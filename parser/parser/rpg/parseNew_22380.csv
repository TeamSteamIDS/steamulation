Fallout: New Vegas, is it for you?If you are considering picking this game up, but not sure if you'll like it, here are some things I liked and disliked.What I liked:Character Customization:The amount of character customization is really up there. Virtually unlimeted posibilities when making a character. (Not as much as TES: Skyrim, but really close).Mod Support:The modding community is very expansive for a game that has been out sinse Oct, 23 2010. If you can think of something, it probably exist!Open World:Depending on what version you buy (Standard or Ultamite edition), you will have plenty to do. Sights to see, things to shoot! Weaponry: Fallout: New Vegas is full of many types of weapons. Everything from M4 carbines to helicopter propeller swords! But don't forget that there are mods for anything you desire.Hardcore Mode:Want something more realistic to a real life apocolypse? Well Fallout: New Vegas has a ""Hardcore"" mode you!Multiple Playthroughs:There's not just one way to experience New Vegas, but four ways!What I disliked:Crashing:Fallout: New Vegas will crash on you at least once or twice. Whenever it does it can be anouying having to go back and redo quest that you've completed.Navmesh:Despite the occasional crash, the navmesh in this game works, but is a little sloppy. Sometimes NPCs will walk into walls and furniture. But it is easliy overlooked when you get further into the game. (You may even find it funny)PC abilities:This game is not the most demanding game for a PC, but can effect your overall experience of it. (I.E. glitching, FPS drops, and crashes)So what's the difference between the standard edition and the ultimate edition?     The ultimate edition is the standard game, but with all of the DLC will it. Yes it cost an extra $10.00 but is worth it compared to buying the standard edition for $9.99 and all the DLC for $22.94.  All-in-all:Fallout: New Vegas is a good solid game for the money. You'll find yourelf captivated by it's charm and want to play evenmore of it. It does get a little dull after a while, but does have a fantastic modding community. I would purchase the Ultimate Edition instead of the Standard, just my opinion. Steam does have The GECK in the tools section which will allow you to make mods for the game. "

												The Wild West meets the Fallout Post Apocalyptic world and a great game is born.Fallout: New Vegas is an open world RPG set in a Post Apocalyptic world. Where Fallout 3 was set in D.C. this game is set the Mojave desert around the ruins of old Las Vegas. The theme throughout this game is a western one, but many different factions are present, each with their own unique (and often hilarious) style. And of course there is a power stuggle between a pre-war industrialist, Caesers legion and the New California Republic is under way and you are about to be thrown into the middle of it. What will you do?This game is filled with great characters, hilarious dialogue and so many entertaining quests that it would be hard to do them all in a single play through. The DLC adds many more hours of fun although it is quite varied in flavour and in value, but all of them are worth playing at least once. The exception might be Lonesome Road, which most people loved but I had some issues with, especially with one decision it forces you to take that I felt was not one any of my characters would ever have made. But Old World Blues may be my favourite DLC for any game ever. The first fifteen minutes had me crying with laughter. When you add the fact that the modding communty is adding more of everything, this game could provide several hundred hours of play time and still have things to offer.  If you are interested in modding the PC version of this game, and you should be, then check out my tutorials on how to do exactly that:

												One of my all-time favourite games, I really enjoyed it and I spent many, many hours playing this. The huge amount of choices, factions and playstyles the game gives you, makes you want to experience every single one. The story may be a bit weak and the graphics a bit rusty (same engine as Fallout 3). This is however beaten by an awesome gameplay (modable weapons!), a brilliant atmosphere set in sin city, nevada and its surroundings and also 4 high quality DLCs (I strongly recommend Lonesome Road, because of its story and revelations).

												I think this review is going to be much like my Arkham City review; I would say the majority of user's on Steam will have already purchased Fallout: New Vegas, and most will have probably even finished it.  So this review will be aimed at the probable minority of people who don't have it, or just haven't played it. Fallout New Vegas was released in October 2010. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic, open world environment around the areas of Nevada and California. You play as a Courier who has been hired to deliver an unknown package to the New Vegas strip across the Mojava Desert. During the delivery, you are captured and shot dead (or so they think). After being recovered by a friendly robot, you are thrust into this massive world which is filled with various different factions competing for control over the land.This was my first ever experience with a Fallout game; I had previously watched my younger brother play a little bit here and there, and of course I am on the internet, and so it's always mentioned on popular websites and subreddits so I knew what I was getting into,  a huge deep time sink. Game play is focused around the use of your V.A.T.S for guns, as well melee weapons. V.A.T.S pauses the game so to speak, and allows you to target certain areas on the enemies body. You have a limited amount of action points to use in this mode, so once you aim, you come out of the aiming mode and the character carries out the orders you set. You can then either wait until your action points have been replenished or use free range shooting mode.  As you wander around the desert, you will find plenty of items, weapons, food, drink, books and many more items that will be of use to you in someway or another.  Obviously you cannot loot every single thing you find, alas we have a weight limit for how much you can carry on you at any given time. This can sometimes lead to difficult choices to make when it comes to looting heavy weapons or armor. As you progress through the game and get a higher reputation, you unlock safe houses, where you can store your items in fridges, cupboards and desks for safe keeping while you are out traveling.One thing I was surprised about in Fallout is that there is surprisingly not as much shooting and actual fighting as I had initially imagined. I created my character to be more based around being able to talk his way out of situations, and this cut down the amount of fighting I had to do by quite a bit I think. It was a nice surprise to see this big game take this approach as I have not come across many that have; like wise, you can go guns blazing at all times if you want; although I would hate to see how your story ends out. Within Fallout New Vegas you have the main quest line which you follow from the very beginning of the game, right until the last moments in the game. Along the way you will pick up side quests, these take you away from the main story and lead you down little branches that allow you to explorer the world you are in and become completely immersed. There are so many little olive branches of side quests that you actually completely forget about the main quest after a while. Some of the side missions in this game are the most memorable I have ever played, helping ghouls escape on their great journey, liberating a power plant were among my favorites, but there are just so many to do, and I would highly recommend that people don't just rush through the main quest in New Vegas as you are going to miss out on hours and hours of content. While the graphics in New Vegas don't look like the graphics we have today in game; they can be enhanced with community made mods to get them up to and even better than any game you will ever play. I played my game completely vanila as it was my first ever run through; I was still happy with the way game looks in the vanilla state, it looks nice. You can get some pretty amazing screenshots from the remote locations you find. The game has varying levels of difficulty, you can play it on hardcore mode, or just on the regular easy, normal and hard modes. I played on normal mode so I could see the missions, story and explore the world without being too focused on min/maxing my character to be optimum at all times - although once I got the option to have Boone as my companion (a sniper), the combat in game takes a definite decrease in difficulty as he just rips through enemies in no time, sometimes you end up not even shooting at all before they are all dead.As you can see from the amount of time I have put into New Vegas, this is one of the biggest and most content heavy games you will ever see, and probably in our life times. You will never be bored; there is always something different to do, whether it be crafting potions, or just playing a little Black-Jack at the casinos - there is never a dull moment. I 100% recommend Fallout New Vegas to anybody. Even if you aren't a fan of RPG games. New Vegas will probably change your mind; this is easily now in my top 5 games of all time and I cannot believe I had not played it until now. If you haven't got New Vegas, get it, it's on sale quite regularly and if you do have New Vegas but haven't played it; please don't wait a second longer, boot this game up and get your self fully immersed in this absolutely perfect game. Easily one of the games of our generation.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												The 'real' Fallout 3 to a lot of members in the community, Fallout: New Vegas picks up where Fallout 1 and 2 left off by continuing to expand upon developments on the Western Coast of the United States in a post-apocalyptic world. The New California Republic is back, as is the Brotherhood and Enclave (or what remains of it). Veterans of the franchise will notice a few subtle nods to previous games in the franchise, such as Poseidon Energy and a few characters coming from locales in Fallout 1 and 2.Unlike Fallout 3, New Vegas maintains consistency in its lore with previous titles in the franchise. The Brotherhood is a reclusive organization rather than an army of ''do-gooders', the Enclave isn't the powerful organization it once was, and Super Mutants aren't all over the place for no reason. It's no surprise that the creators of Fallout : NV are also the minds behind Fallout 1 and 2, before the studio closed and Bethesda bought out the franchise. The post-apocalyptic world is still fresh in their minds and care was applied when creating the world and lore so that it meshes with previous entries.New to this entry is the faction system. Whereas Fallout 3 automatically made the Brotherhood the 'good guys' and you only had one choice in the ending (tamper with the Purifier or not), New Vegas lets you side with one of four factions, affecting the New Vegas power struggle and the ending. Whomever you decide to side with, they carry their own mainline quests to win control of the Hoover Dam. The faction system also carries it's own subset of reputation; a faction may despise you (attacking you on sight) or idolize you. Reputation is gained or lost by finishing quests for a faction and/or siding with them when presented with the option. When doing the mainline quests for a faction, you'll slowly lose karma with the others until you're attacked by them on-sight.Whilst siding with a faction for an ending is excellent, don't place too much thought on juggling reputations whilst exploring and doing sidequests. Whilst exploring the Mojave, its in your best interest to side with the NCR when presented with the option; they have camps all over the map, they account for at least 25% of all sidequests (estimate) and a potential companion (and his quest) requires NCR fame. The only factions you'll have to juggle rep with outside of the main quest arcs are the Legion and NCR, all other factions have peaceful resolutions if presented with an issue between the two of them. Most of the time it'll be a question of whether or not to fu*k over the Legion, since the quest will come from an NCR official. The Legion has ONE camp in the game (the other reached through the storyline), and no sidequests so always side against them. Don't worry, there's a point in the main storyline where negative rep is reset with either the Legion or NCR (or both), allowing you to do all sidequests and then side with the Legion in the main story.So it's a coin toss: either you appreciate the ability to do all sidequests in a single playthrough without having to worry too much about factions and reputation (which I believe), or you believe the system failed since it's effect outside of the main story quest arcs is non-existant. Perhaps the Brotherhood and Followers should've fought more, perhaps concurrent sidequests between two factions should've been introduced, forcing you to balance reputations. Or maybe you aren't a fan of having to play through a game multiple times, especially when you invested a ton of hours into one playthrough. What is clear is that the Legion, despite being an important faction in the game, has VERY little representation in the game. This is due to time constraints: with only 18 months in development Obsidian had to leave everything east of the Colorado River an unexplorable area, originally being Legion territory. There's also an entire western portion of the map blocked off by mountains, and the north eastern end of the map as well. The game also has a significantly lower amount of interiors (buildings you can go into) as compared to Fallout 3, and the Mojave wasteland is littered with meaningless locations (abandoned shacks, empty areas with no interiors). You don't have to look too far to see time constraints everywhere. All to the game's detriment: I would've preferred more interiors with PC terminals and notes delving into inhabitants lives or situations around the Mojave.Fallout 3 did exploration better: more interiors and towns. But Fallout NV does everything else better: lore, story, writing. Fallout NV is more of a Fallout title than Fallout 3 was, and if you're a fan of the franchise you'll love the care Obsidian put in handling its congruity with the other titles. If you really can't be bothered and are only interested in exploring, then Fallout 3 might be higher on your list. Whatever the case, NV's short development cycle and the quality of the end product is a testament to how skilled and dedicated Obsidian is to the franchise. Thumbs up, loved it more than FO3.			"

A few community made patches help with crashing and other obvious bugs in the game.(Pay attention to what is contained in the mods....I didn't realize one had a script that unlocked all achievements at once. I fail.)Overall, I give this game a 9/10 even in it's buggy state.			"

												The very first Fallout game I've played. I've been sitting here for maybe 15 minutes , thinking of something to write, but thanks to writer's block, I'm going to make this short and sweet:- It'll run well on pretty much any computer that's not 10 years old- It's fun and funny- If you like shooters or RPGs, I'd recommend this- If you like Skyrim, I'd suggest thisIf you do buy it, I just suggest one thing: Use the manual save, and only the manual save. If you're comfortable using the quicksave, go ahead- don't try and load off a quicksave though, only use it when in game. Don't use the autosave function, it's pretty unreliable.But it doesn't matter; everything comes down to this:I shot someone in the hand with a hunting rifle. He blew up. 10/10			"

												I'm going to Rewrite my Fallout: New Vegas review because my old one was monkey♥♥♥♥♥Fallout: New Vegas is in my top 5 favorite games of all time, and definitely my favorite post-apocolyptic world. Its one of the best open world games available and I can't recommend it more, full price or not. This is truely one of the greatest games of the last generation, and of all time. I played over 100 hours of FNV on my PS3, before I became a PC gamer. I've now put in 55 additional hours and I'm still not done with it. I'm not even close to playing through the amazing mods, and quests this game has. There is easily over 100 hours of content, without replaying any of it. Its absolutely unreal how much content is in this game and how fun it is to play it all.The Story of FNV starts with you getting shot in the head. Pretty weird start, but it works, it makes me interested. Why did I get shot? Who shot me? Why did he shoot me over [SPOILER DELETED]? You find all this out over the course of the story, that plays itself out greatly. On top of an indepth main quest, you have detailed side quests to go along with it. The side quests do a great job of tying the story together while also telling its own. I don't want to go on forever here, but if you want comparisons, the story in FNV is exponentially better than the story in Fallout 3. And I enjoyed the story in Fallout 3 quite a bit. The combat system works in an interesting way. While you do have the basic FPS mechanics, you also have VATS, which makes it work in sort of a psuedo-Turn based way. You target certain body parts, tell your guy to shoot, then he does. Its pretty satisfying, especially seeing an opponents head go flying in pieces off of his body. Pretty satisfying combat. I do wish sniping was done a bit better, I feel like when I'm trying to snipe opponents from far away, VATS doesn't really want to cooperate, which is unfortunate. Pretty much my only complaint about the combat. This last part isn't really about combat, but it is gameplay so I'll mention it here. The game implements a hardcore mode, which forces you to eat, sleep and drink along with making combat more difficult and companions killable. I've never done a full hardcore playthrough, but I do enjoy the mode for the most part. Killable companions is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t though, I use a mod to keep that part off.This is getting really long, so I'll make my last point about the world. This is probably the major weakness of the game, if I was to point out any. I don't really think there is anything majorly wrong with the world, but at the beginning it sort of feels like you can only go one way. If you try to go north, you're almost guarenteed to get slaughtered, unless you turn god mode on. Mid level(about level 15) and on, you can pretty much go anywhere in the world and you don't have to worry about dying. The world feels good and exploration is fun, but it definitely feels like its forcing a linear path for the first 1/4 of the main quest.Fallout: New Vegas is my favorite Single player FPS of all time, and if you've never played this gem, you should pick it up immediately. I promise, you'll love it. Buy At Full Price  "

I just found my new favorite thing to do in Fallout. I literally just downed all of the drugs, alcohol, and food in my inventory, and then i went around bashing people over the head with a hammer (the one that's made of a block of concrete). I took absolutely no damage and killed nearly everyone with one hit (I had also taken Nighteye, so it was extremely hard to see what i was doing, and i stumbled around viciously attacking walls many of the times).  Luckily for me, i happened to be in Fiend territory, and repeatedly ran into their camps. Needless to say, their camps were filled with drug stashes, allowing the fun to last indefinitely..... or so i'd thought.  My drug-fueled rampage ended when the withdrawal kicked in (for every drug), causing me to commit suicide by dumping all of my landmines in a large pile directly beside me, and then lighting it on fire. Mass murdered and then killed myself afterwards 10/10 "

												Gameplay is amazing. Writing is incredible. Immersion is insane. The amount of choices YOU can make for yourself is unmatched (looking at you, Elder Scrolls). Kept alive and fresh by an *excellent* modding community. Get it. Also, the DLC storylines intertwine. They don't interact much, but it's all cohesive.Get it.Cons? Bugs. Unfinished content, woes of a rushed game. For example, Caesar's Legion (one of the three main factions) lacks as much ingame depth as the NCR (much ingame depth). Another example being Freeside's (outskirts of New Vegas) condition - cut content, seperated zones (there is a mod series called Freeside Open dedicated to restoring this).Update: Still has the best DLC of any game I've played recently, and on the whole I still recommend this over Fallout 3 and 4.

												To review Fallout 3 or New Vegas is a difficult challenge. Not because their content is too hard but their expectations of what players want to enjoy are different. While seemingly similar in their mechanics, both games diverge in what players expect to enjoy in a ""Fallout"" game. If you have read my review of Fallout 3, then you know I consider New Vegas the more refined game. Traits, player-choice influenced quest-lines, the faction systems, and the gray morality are important factors for what makes NV so great. However, it's the world-building that puts NV as one of the finest examples of open-world games. As someone who has thought of open-world games as the death of narratives from the Ubisoft games to the missed opportunities of games like Risen, Obsidian has forever changed my opinion on their storytelling merits. NV doesn't tell the greatest story nor the smartest; it tells a world of tales of your interactions that shape the Mojave one grain of sand at a time.Nuka Cola or Sunset Sarsaparilla?Before I discuss the importance of NV's strongest suit, I do want to go over the improvements of NV. Many fans I think will consider liking F3 or NV to be something similar to the question, ""Coke or Pepsi?""While both games are mechanically the same, there are noticeable differences. For example, F:NV focuses more-so on the role-playing mechanics by making its perks more unique, sometimes beneficial with consequences or adding a new level of challenge. F3 simply focuses on numbers and how to make them better. I found that by Lv 43 my character in NV still had room for growth whereas my F3 character was maxed out before LV 13.Quests in NV seem more shorter and to the point than F3. (Admittedly, the travel time between each quest could be the reason for why they feel more brief in NV.) The Mojave is a more compacted, content-rich area than D.C. which might be great to some (like me) and a negative to others. What NV makes up for instead is how questlines can feed into other quests seemlessly by the player's exploration and choices.Even when it comes to the FPS mechanics, the iron-sights, weapon mods and various ammo types for every gun make the barebones gunplay of F3 much more tolerable. (I find the repair/ammo-crafting benches too restricting on junk to ever warrant using them.) I hardly ever use VATS in F3 or NV unless I want to get headshots on Deathclaws.Speaking of Deathclaws, enemies in NV are not leveled to the player from the get-go. They are given a fixed level—and scaling later—which makes enemies more consistent in NV. This change does come at the cost of making the early part of NV more linear as you have to loop around the road to get to Vegas as your first major quest-goal. However, like in Risen, the game tells you this through the enemies' difficulty and there are quests/paths along a more linear beginning than F3.I personally prefer the grim-humor flavor of the post-post apocalypse of the Mojave over the post-apocalypse consistency of D.C. Your taste may vary, but I hope to explain why NV is the superior game.It's All A Matter of ContextIf you have played a Bethesda game before, then you will more often notice a problem of its open-world design: The world always feels disjointed. Quests in Bethesda games have been focused on telling individual stories with little to no relation to one another. Tone-shifts, relevance to the over-arching storyline, and other narrative pitfalls suffer as a result. While some fans may enjoy this format, the result is a world that feels more lifeless by their lack of context.Fallout 3's main-questline is indicative of this problem. You go from exploring the Museum of Natural History to get a radar dish for a DJ, to wandering to a city made of a shipwrecked vessel to learn about your father's science project, then exploring a Vault with a murder-simulation program, and then later stumbling upon a society of children. In contrast, NV begins with the town of Goodsprings caught up in the much larger conflict of the Legion encroaching upon the NCR claimed settlements of the Mojave. A gang of escaped convicts harass the people of Goodsprings who have stolen their explosives from the NCR mining outpost of Sloan to exert their power. (The result being that the explosions have lured out Deathclaws along the road of Sloan.) This gang has taken the town of Primm under their rule as they fight off the NCR stationed there, and the gang's other settlement Nipton is under attack by the Legion.As seen in this one example, conflicts in New Vegas feed back into each other and expand upon the world it tells. This description of events is simply the background window-dressing to your actions as you can side with Goodsprings, the convict gangs, the NCR or the Legion. Your interactions stay within the story's guidelines of NV. Questlines also can link-back up with previous or new areas, and the order of these quests can be stories you create for yourself (ex. Jacobtown and Black Mountain). What can also be seen in this one example is the careful attention to details. Why are Deathclaws roaming Sloan? Why are the NCR defending Primm/Goodsprings? Even in its environmental design, there is a level of detail of the farming area of Goodspring to explain how a town can survive. Something that was utterly lacking in Fallout 3.The reward from all of this attention to detail is that the world of NV feels more alive than it actually is because the world makes sense. Are there still tone-shifts or missing details? Yes, especially with the cringe-worthy sexual tensions and swear-words. However, these moments are far less abundant and offer a dark sense of humor in a post-post apocalypse. ""I've Got Heartaches by the Number""I would be lying if I said I thought NV is absolutely perfect. While I praise the game's means of storytelling and of player-choices in the overall game there are some downsides that I think some people may enjoy. It took me years to be stubborn enough to play to Vegas because I was so used to F3's freeform exploration.The narrative hook of NV is not one to keep you invested if you don't care to learn more about the conflicts around the Mojave. Even then, the plot of the Courier is very sparse and not very personal. (On the otherhand, the freeform nature of the Courier lets you make him/her be whoever you want.)The rushed schedule of the game has had some impact on its development. F3's engine has really shown its age with how much NV has to restrict itself, whether it be the barren New Vegas or the amounts of gated loading screens. Not only are aspects like this have to be rushed but even some interactions aren't coded in.For example, when trying to set a truce between the NCR and the Brotherhood of Steel, if you had gotten rid of the previous Elder then the option for truce does not exist. It's not that the new one is arrogant and won't agree to it--the game is not programmed to understand that option. These type of instances are very, very, very rare but they are a stain on the freeform nature of the game. On the flipside, it is really telling how much trust Obsidian has with its player when the game has one--and only one--unkillable NPC, the Yes Man (aside from children and Victor in the early part of the game). Fallout 4 is littered with these unkillable NPCs while New Vegas offers multiple optional objectives/paths for almost every quest. If Obsidian was given more time to flesh out the game and on a better engine, then I think this game would be a perfect masterpiece. (In spite of its somewhat lackluster personal narrative.) Instead, it's a masterpiece with a few smudges you have to accept.With all these gripes being said... the day I stop counting that's the day my world will end. "

												-=-Hello! If anyone has read my reviews in the past, I'd just like to let you know that I follow a consistent pattern of playing at least 10 hours of any game I choose to review. So, without further ado, my Fallout New Vegas Review.-=-If you have played any of the Elder Scrolls games, you might be familiar of the famous RPG/Adventure game developers, Bethesda. They do an AMAZING job at creating medieval and sci-fi adventures that they are very well made storylines and well made graphics for four years ago. I think Fallout New Vegas is a great game, but the graphics and presentation are ugly. Its really not even an upgrade over Fallout 3, I would call it more of a downgrade. Bugs are small in amount, landscapes are varied, the open world populated, and many, many towns and cities to visit, including your very own Vegas. Okay, off of the specs: You start out in a small town with a gun, and you can get meat cleavers, baseball bats, plasma rifles, sniper rifles, a concrete club, etc. There are lots of choices on weapons.You have so many choices of armor, too. You will never get bored of character customization.Some horror aspects that will keep you waiting for the next combat. The worst I've experienced was walking through a rundown factory, killing weird creatures and invisible giants.GORE. Yes, I said gore with all caps. You can dismember people! Even when they're laying on the ground, dead, you can use your sledgehammer and slice arms and heads, yes heads, off of the corpses.Crippling aspects. Pretty neat, although weird in some ways. I shot a centaur with an incinerator (Flamethrower) and I crippled his tongue.Mutant creatures. Giant flies, scourpions, and geckos, etc, alongside and against eachother. (I was walking to a town called Prim, and a fly got mauled by a young gecko.)The exploration in this game is incredible. You can go through Vegas doing quests like taking down a large empire, repaying debts, etc. You can head to several different other towns, drink out of toilets to regain health, take down large bandit empires, and kill large geckos with pool cues.If you like the Elder Scrolls, this game is fun and enjoyable. 9/10 great game, accidentally deleted my level 12 character and I hate myself for that. (Spent 9/10 hours working on him. I had a sword and medium armor. freaked me out, I guess I can restart.)Anyways, thanks for reading my review, please rate if it helped, also comment on what you'd like to see in any other review, open for suggestions and will answer questions if needed. :)			"

Developers from Fallout 2 involved in the creation? Yes.Elements of the cancelled Van Buren (Black Isle's Fallout 3) finally brought to life? Yes.A mainstream roleplaying game that will challenge your intellect and emotions with superb writing and meaningful choices and consequences? Yes, yes, yes.For all intents and purposes, Fallout: New Vegas is the true Fallout 3 and the best sequel to Fallout 2 that one could expect given the troubled circumstances surrounding the series.Unfortunately Obsidian was stuck working with Bethesda's sub-par game engine and base mechanics, but they still managed to craft something worthy of following up Fallout 2. If you're a long time fan of the Fallout series, playing this will mostly make you forget about Bethesda's attempt aside from some mechanic problems that unfortunately carried over (problematic automatic weapons, for a big example.)Also worth noting is that Obsidian were only given around 18 months to finish this project. The fact that they managed to release what they did given the timeframe will never cease to amaze me.Lead developer JE Sawyer's mod (though I consider it a much-needed patch) is highly recommended for the best possible experience.Description/update notes for JE Sawyer's mod for a good idea of what it does: http://fallout.gamepedia.com/JSawyer "

												Fallout: New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic open world R.P.G. developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda Softworks. The game takes place in the year 2281 near a retro-futuristic version of Las Vegas following the Great War between the United States and China that occurred some two hundred years prior. For a grand total of two hours on Octorber 23, 2077 the earth was scorched in nuclear fire forever changing life on this planet as we once knew it. Presently, you're a courier tasked with delivering a package to New Vegas until you're suddenly intercepted by a gang led by a mysterious man who then shoots you in the head and leaves you for dead in a shallow grave AFTER relieving you of said package. Shortly thereafter, you're luckily found by a kindly robot named Victor who then takes you to a nearby settlement called Goodsprings where a doctor saves what's left of your life. After some much needed R & R the doctor, who was a former vault dweller, gives you a vault suit, a PipBoy 3000 and a weapon for protection and you begin your fantastic quest to find the man that shot you and retrieve that package...""They Went That-A-Way!"". Along the journey you will encounter your fair share of hostile raiders, strange situations, terrifying irradiated creatures and a plethora of interesting people to interact with. I have to say that this game is just stuffed with so much content and sidequests that you will find it very difficult to stay the course and concentrate on completing the main story without veering off the beaten path from time to time....to time and time again. Wandering around the Nevada wasteland, as dangerous as it may sound, is just such a joy to do in this superb open-world title.The gameplay is definitely one of the shining jewels in this titles heavy crown. The combat in Fallout: New Vegas is a blend of a first and third person shooter for the most part. How you tackle combat in Fallout: New Vegas is completely up to you and the style of play that you enjoy the most. Your character could be guns blazing and shoot up everything in sight, you could also opt for the stealth playthrough and take down your enemies with sniper rifles and close quarter sneak attacks or be a melee fighter and go hands or blade to body with your enemies. The combat can be quite fun and very challenging depending on what mode or method you choose to play. Also let us not forget one of the staples of the Fallout series, the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System or V.A.T.S. which is always something great to see in action. V.A.T.S. is an active pause combat system implemented in the game that allows the player to select specific body parts to target during combat. Gameplay-wise, finding things to do and creatures or people to fight in the Nevada wasteland will not be a problem...just pick a direction and start walking.  Fallout: New Vegas operates off the same game engine as Fallout 3 did so other than running slightly better than it's predecessor both titles have a very similiar look to them. Graphically, I really enjoyed this title when it first came out but as the years have passed it really began to show it's age and lack of visual fidelity in it's base form especially when compared to alot of today's games. However, with the fantastic community of superb modders available like with all Bethesda's outstanding open-world games, this is no longer a problem. With just a handful of graphical modifications your version of New Vegas will look absolutely beautiful in all it's High Definition glory. With that said, this is the type of open world game that you just want to spend hours walking or running around and exploring because it is gorgeous. Every settlement, every cave or ruin that you investigate all have a unique look to them. You definitely won't see any recycled environments in this game thank you very much Dragon Age II! The music is great and really captures the post apocalyptic and somewhat western theme of the title whether you're in a battle, exploring or in some type of dialogue with a denizen of the Nevada wasteland. Last but not least, the sound quality is also top notch and really immerses you within the gameplay.If you're a fan of the Fallout series or just an open-world roleplaying game enthusiast then this is a title that your library cannot do without. This game is truly one of the best in the genre and definitely one of the greatest of all the Fallout titles available. There is an ample amount of very good DLC to play as well as a grueling hardcore mode for the immersion fans. Fallout: New Vegas is filled with lore from the previous Fallout titles which is a very nice addition for true superfans of the series. Also, what with the massive modding community available for Fallout: New Vegas, the replayability of this game is tremendous. This is a title that you can enjoy for months if not years to come much like I have so you will definitely get your moneys worth out of this purchase. Fallout: New Vegas is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!			"

												Day 1: Woke up in a doctors house, found myself in sweaty underwear, and was asked to sit on his couch and answer questions.Day 2: Opened the radio the doctor gave me, I think I've heard Johnny Guitar 500 times now.Day 3: Radio wont turn off, have now idolized Johnny Guitar.Day 46: I've been stuck in a cave for 42 days now, my only company is Johnny Guitar.Day 102: Succesfully developed a cult devoted to Johnny Guitar.Day 252: Radio died, I can't hear Johnny Guitars voice anymore, massive withdrawals.10/10 would go insane from hearing Johnny Guitar 1000000 times again.FOR REAL DOE ( ACTUAL REVIEW )      SPOILERSI SAID SPOILERS YOU CURIOUS CATGame never dissapointed all the way till the end (I'll get back to that).

Now I know a lot of people say that ""Oh I prefer it this way"", and then other people say ""It's better this way"", but the ending to Fallout New Vegas sucked donkey♥♥♥♥♥♥ mmk. I had so many plans, I was going to discover every area in the game and complete every quest available prior to the ending, but you know what they did instead of let me do that? They gave me the option to revert to a pre-hoover dam battle save, or return to the main menu never allowing me to continue that character from the end of the game on. Finding out that there was no free-roam really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, regardless the game is very fun, but hey at least it doesn't give you a worse ending than Skyrim's. I suggest doing everything you want to do with the game pre end game cause you wont get to do it again, enjoy the game, and don't try to ""experiment"" with fisto.... please.			"

												I am the Courier.After I accepted a package to deliver, I found myself on my knees outside a village looking at a shallow grave. A man in a suit flipped a silver gambling chip and shot me in the head, telling me I had entered a game I had to lose. Like so many others, my story would have ended in blood.Except I didn't. My lifeless body was dragged to a doctor who patched me up. Sadly, my name and life was gone. All I knew was the face of the man, and the clothes given to me by the good doctor of Goodsprings. I don't know who I was, but I know who I am now. I am the woman who will have her revenge. As I stepped outside, I saw the good people of Goodsprings being ravaged by bandits. I took up my  9mm pistol, and told the leader to meet us. We would give him their prisoner. As they stepped out confidently, I shot them all in the head. The blood stained the sand red, but the bandits left Goodsprings alone. Taking some food and water, and as much ammo as I could carry, I took a hat off of one of the raiders and hunted down the rest of them in their sleep.I eventually came to the town of Primm; here I met the NCR. A large group of foreigners who told me what I could and couldn't do. Wanted to help, but didn't do anything. Unbound by their rules, I picked a rifle out from their bed and, at night, rescued the locals. I supported the new Sheriff in Primm's independence. The NCR was only willing to watch; cowards, the lot of them.I later came across more of them; content to sit, drink and complain, I learned of the situation of the Mojave desert and began to fix the problems; they thanked me, paid me, took the credit, and continued to spend their time guarding a road going nowhere. They had built a great statue, but did no great deeds.I then moved along the path, following the clues about the fancy man with the fancy chip, until I came across a town on fire. Outside a group of people fought over yellow bottle caps; I killed them all and took their caps for myself. Strange. Stranger still was the townsfolk nailed to crosses as their homes burnt; a town of the dead. Legionaires of Caesar came to me, and asked me to carry on their message. All shall be equal before Caesar. I remembered these words.When I came to Novac, I found a town terrorized by stalkers in the night and electricity stolen by the NCR. As I saved them, I taught them to stand alone. I met the NCR at the power station; obsessed with taking the power from the people and feeding it to the strong of the desert, I sabotaged their efforts and gave the power of the sun to all of the people. I winked at my fellow co-conspirators of the Fellowship of the Apocalypse, and continued on my way.At a trading post in the middle of nowhere, I met Veronica. Beautiful, if eccentric, she was as alone as I was in this desert. She told me of the threats the Mojave faced; her own Brotherhood nearly wiped out by the aggressions of the NCR. We travelled together, learning of the plights of the people in the Mojave.As we moved along, we came across the poor gathered outside new Vegas. The Fellowship of the Apocalypse agreed with my thoughts, that those in power cared little for the Mojave beyond resources and manpower. We killed the local drug dealers, killed the troublemakers, wiped out the Kings for creating a civil war, and once peace reigned, continued my bloody path to my gorey conclusion.As I looked upon the wealth of New Vegas, I saw the rich and powerful live a life beyond the imaginings of any outside. I found my man in his suit, ""Benny"". Surrounded by guards, he warned me off. I hadn't come this far to fail, however, and a few fevered whispers in his ear had him meet me in his room. Alone, I took my pleasure from him, and with his shaving knife, cut his throat in his sleep. That was the first night I slept well, although I needed a shower upon my awakening.I discovered his secret; a robot that could change the whole game to my rules. Not a brutal conquerer like Caesar, not the haughty expansionists of the NCR, nor the greedy self-interest of House; no, Yes Man provided a new way. Our own way. My travels taught me that only in true Chaos could the strong rise and lead the Mojave for itself; not as a battery for an empire nor as a farm for the rich. That was what I told myself as I walked through the rivers of blood.The White Hands family was first, high airs and low appetites, I smiled as I cut my way through them, executing them with the same gun Benny tried to execute me with. Then the Omertas, typical schemers; they screamed as I murdered them in their beds.Instead, I put the power into the hands of the people; the Boomers, remants of those before, I brought their dreams to life. I gave the Brotherhood back to those who would see it's power restored, partly for my philosophy, partly because Veronica had been my partner through everything and I would see her dreams come true as well.I then found the Sierra Madre, a dead land with untold riches. Finding it ruled by the mad, I killed the King of the Dead for my partner's sanity and the safety of the Mojave, and left this damned place to rot in the clouds of poison. Alone and silent.I found Mt. Big, the hope for the future from the past. Dusty, unused relics, I crushed their rotting brains beneath my boot. Our future would be our own; the past had already failed us, as my past had failed me.To the north, I found Zion; a man had returned to his people having seen the failures of empires, and despite the bleating of pacifists, I forged these people into a strong ally for the Mojave; they, like we, shall be independent.Finally, I took control of New Vegas; as the NCR and the Legion of Caesar fought, we executed our coup. A grand army of independence, from the many I had helped, came to free our land from the bear and the eagle. We drove off the Legion; and when the NCR came for their blood prize, I had their leader thrown from their bloody ambitions to his death.The Mojave is free, and shall stay free. Even after I leave.

												Hands down the best game I've ever played. I love it more than I love my family. ""Three crippled limbs, haven't slept in four days, no ammo left and hunted by the Legion. But atleast my spurs go Jingle, Jangle, Jingle.﻿"" It's a perfect RPG with a perfect amount of everything you want. Unlike Fallout 4, you actually have more than 4 choices of dialogue, and the ability to make up your own story. I usually end up using revolvers and repeaters, since I'm pretty much obsessed with cowboys. The amount of really good side quests is incredible. Some of them are even more interesting than the entire story of Fallout 4. Although, in my opinion it is easier to gain playtime in Fallout 4. What about the DLC's? The DLC's, well, they are as amazing as you'd expect from Obsidian. Honest Hearts my favorite, since I love the landscape of Utah and the story of the Burned Man. Old World Blues however, made me laugh as much as I have never laughed at a game before.Lonesome Road and Dead Money? They are gold aswell (literally). The soundtrack is the best. Ever. I've been listening to the music from day 1 since I got the game, and I know the lyrics to most, if not all the songs. It's quite surprising how you won't get tired of them. Also, Mr. New Vegas. It's impossible not to love him. <3How about factions, do they beat the Brotherhood of Steel or The Institute?Hell ♥♥♥♥ing yes, any day, any time. The conflict between the NCR and Ceasar's Legion is far more interesting and immersive than the BoS vs Institute thing. I'm a bit of an NCR patriot myself, heheh.  Never been a fan of lynching and burning people alive. ""Crashes by the number,Glitches by the score,Everyday you love me less,Each day I love you more."" Let's talk about mods. Oh, lovely mods. If you're getting a Fallout because of the mods, this is the one for you. You can (and should) customize your game entirely using them. I'm running 100+ mods now and it's not even that much. The problem is getting the game to work with all of them though, it can be pretty frustrating.New Vegas is nostalgically depressing but it's surprisingly a great feeling.﻿So, should you put 60 dollars into buying a failed Fallout game or spend 20 bucks on one of the best games ever made? The choice is up to you. I'd get this game though.Edit #1Please, vote for this game to win the ""Test of Time"" award. Obsidian deserves it.			"

												Where do I even begin with saying that this is a really stonking great game.Let's just start with some history: Fallout New Vegas is the Fallout 3 that should have been. At least, most of the elements that make their appearance in New Vegas were actually of the original Fallout 3, which was canceled when it was almost finished by Bethesda so they could make their own 3, which wasn't as amazing as it could be in several factors, and fell quite short of its numbered predecessors, to say the least. Fallout New Vegas is pretty much more of a Fallout 3 than the actual Bethesda Fallout 3 was, so calling it Fallout 3.5 isn't doing it any justice whatsoever.Plus, Fallout 3 runs quite badly on the PC partly due to GFWL and apparently is even more crash-happy, so there is that.On to the actual game, it is incredebly enormous in size. I bet that you easily will sink upwards of 50 hours in it at least. If you just take your time and explore like me, expect well over a hundered of hours of gameplay on your first run. The game world feels huge, with way more than enough places to discover. Also, it has a gigantic list of quests, so yeah, this game is going to give you some real bang for your bucks. Evenmoreso with the Ultimate Edition, which covers every piece of Expansion Pack/ DLC with it, which ups the game length very reasonably, and brings enough stuff to the table to make it worthwhile. Not only do you get to go to entirely different locations which will feel entirely different to the Mojave Wasteland, but they all bring enough new in-stuff to the table which is also useable outside the Expansion Pack arenas. Have I mentioned yet that this game has a gigantic amount of weapons?Seriously, I cannot remember another game that has such a gigantic and varied arsenal of weapons to use. True, it is partially due to the Expansion Packs bringing a part of it to the table, but even without it is bigger than Fallout 3, and with the expansion packs, it absolutely makes Fallout 3 looks like a dwarf if you compare the two. The only thing Fallout 3 has weaponwise what New Vegas doesn't is the Rock-It Launcher, but that is about the only thing.Even if it isn't graphically amazing and it is made on an extremely rickety engine, GameBryo, which really should be replaced next-gen and is still a bit glitchy, it is still really acceptable, and hey, graphics aren't the most important things in a game.Story's pretty great too. It all starts off getting capped in the face by someone looking like Bugsy Siegel, if he wasn't shot in the face (yet) and wasn't living in a post-apocaliptic Nevada/ Las Vegas,  you wake up a week later and decide to pay this gentleman a visit, where ever he might even be, to have a very stern talk with him. What's more, is that there are multiple big factions duking it out for power over the Mojave and New Vegas, and it is all your choice who's gonna come out on top, by what means necessary... Or you just decide to take it all for yourself. Voice Acting is pretty well too mostly. Just don't expect the nameless NPC's to say something amazing.Darn, hear me rambling about this game, and I've probably haven't even covered a small part of it! In short, this is a quality game, the Ultimate Edition is where you should go for, and it is really dirt cheap during event sales (like 5 bucks in the Summer Sale) , and you really should pick it up, for a game of this calibre it is practically theft.

												One of the best games I've ever played.My experience of the game in a nutshell: - Speech is OP - Trying to be a good guy is really hard when it gets near to the end of the game - Punching is also OP when you happen to have a robotic hand. If not, don't even think about it - VATS doesn't differentiate friend from enemy so if you're using it quickly it IS possible to go from fighting on one side of a huge battle to being violently abused by enough soldiers from both sides to make you wonder whether they've been killing each other at all - There is a comedian next to one of the doors on the Strip. His line about not being able to get to sleep WILL help you pick up girls in real life - 'Side' quests can be ridiculously long-winded, but worth it - Everything you eat is irradiated, so I survived on hardcore drugs alone. Don't try this at home kids10/10 Would spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to find a sniper rifle again.			"

And I mean EVERYTHING! Combat, Power Armor, Faction Armor, Throwing Weapons! You can have everything that Fallout 4 did good in Fallout New Vegas!- Great DLCsCons:- Locked at 2GB RAM (You can increase it up to 4 with a mod)(That's the only con I can think of)As a new player in the Fallout universe and Fallout 4 being my first I can assure you that this game is propably the best in the series (I haven't played the classics so i exclude them)!

												One of the greatest RPG games of all time (In my Opinion)Lots of people say Fallout 3 is better, I admit it is hard to decide between the two. Positives	 Fallout 3 had a better atmosphere compared to Fallout New Vegas, it actually felt less of a Wasteland in New Vegas, less of a gritty and depressing feeling and more of a Cowboy, Western feel.The Story in Fallout New Vegas is utterly Amazing. It can go many ways depending on who you side with later on in the game which brings me to another point, later on in the game you have much more choice and freedom on which path to take, which allies you want aiding you, who you don't want to work with... etc.The Game starts off very slow paced, a bit like any RPG and is most likely the part where most people are going to turn it off at, but once you get going it becomes addicting, the Characters are detailed and some of the guys you encounter you will either like or hate.Fallout 3 had 20 Levels (NO DLC) and 30 Levels (WITH DLC) so if you thought that was too little, you will be glad to know that Fallout NV has 30 Levels (NO DLC) and 50 Levels (WITH DLC).Many people argue that Fallout 3 had a bigger map, this may be true I'm not sure but I feel that FONV has more unique locations to visit. I also found the DLC in FONV much more interesting than FO3. It wasn't a case of... ""I just want to finish this damn DLC so I can get the items"". Last thing is, there are Factions which weren't in the previous game which is pretty damn cool. Once again opening a path for your character on who to side with. (Legion FTW ^^)You can at least create attachments for your guns in this game, unlike Fallout 3Tons of mods which spices the gameplay up A LOT Negatives	 The only downside to this game is that it of course uses the same engine as FO3 so it may feel a bit outdated, along with the graphics (Not like they matter, sadly they do for some people).One thing that annoys me the most about this game is the fact you cannot work alone later on in the game, you must have the aid of someone else if you choose to... SPOILERS >>>  Take over Vegas	 Once you hit max level, it gets really boring. All you can really do is do the side quests and explore. Conclusion Great game, definitely buy it. Worth way more than the price it is. 9/10			"

												Now this..... this is a Fallout game.Don't get me wrong, I 'liked' Fallout 4....But I LOVE New Vegas.While actual gunplay and animation is mediocre, the characters, world and story is what keeps this game as one of the best of the last generation, and one of the best in the Fallout series. Bethesda should've taken notes from Obsidian, but the newest installment just doesn't live up to its name, compared to Fallout: New Vegas.You're not a concerned parentYou're not a middle aged white protagonistAnd you're not looking for an oversized maggot character model that we're supposed to call a childYOU, good sir/madam, are a FORMER courier from Primm, a settlement in the Mojave Wasteland, left for dead by some rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ high roller wannabe. You wake up in a tumbleweed settlement named Goodsprings, and go out to claim your revenge, and shape yourself to be WHO YOU WANT TO BE and the world AS YOU SEE FIT. While you may be the best in some aspects, this game will assure you that you are NOT a god on earth, or a wasteland deity, but just a guy or girl that is just good at what he/she does in order to survive and leave an imprint on post-apocalyptic America.There is no 4 choice dialogue crap, there is no binary form of morality in terms of how you play and impact the world, nor are there any quests that are just there for grinding.Your story is A STORY, and it is up to you to make the best of your time in the Mojave Wasteland from the beginning, to the end.Ladies and gentlemen, in the end, this game brings to you an excellent story, RPG mechanics, characters, a breathing world, plenty of diversity, and so much more that if you choose this over FO4, I can assure you that you are not missing on anything, but rather are making the smartest decision. This games needs you. And when you boot it up, it will not bound some of your choice with Bethesda's chains, but greet you with open arms, and welcome you into New Vegas in hopes that you will, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it you will, enjoy your stay.

												Fallout: New Vegas is one of my favourite games of this generation. It takes the fundamentals of the classic Fallout games and puts them into the Fallout 3 engine, giving fans of the original games a true successor. Developed by Obsidian Entertainment, New Vegas was created by a company that houses many people who worked on the original Fallout series, and whose strengths are writing and solid role-playing mechanics, and it shows. The writing throughout New Vegas is phenomenal, and no matter what type of character you want to play, the game was made with you in mind. You constantly feel rewarded for your choices. Hardcore mode also allows you to play more of a survival game, having to get food, water, and sleep. For a real challenge, check out the mod Josh Sawyer (lead designer) made for the game. It takes hardcore mode to a whole new level.I also highly recommend playing all of the downloadable content for New Vegas, since it has the best DLC suite I've ever experienced. Each of them is brilliantly crafted, expanding the story of New Vegas in interesting ways. Furthermore, the DLC is foreshadowed throughout the main game, and the DLC can cause changes in the main game as well. If you only get the DLC for one game, make it this one.I can't recommend this game enough.			"

												If you haven't played this game yet on PC than what are you doing?With improved gameplay and dialogue desicions that make it vastly superior to fallout 3 but also the exploration didn't feel as tedious or boring due to enough variety in the locations to make each area unique and feel part of the mojave wasteland.Even though two out of the four main dlcs are actually quite solid (honest hearts and old world blues) the modding community has helped to make this games lifespan survive longer than what Obsidian ever could do. With new weapons (some inspired by other games), texture packs, quest lines and new areas to explore it means that their is much more to do in the land of the mojave.Fallout 3 was my childhood RPG but New Vegas is my personal preference of a Role Playing game where your character is actually the main focus on how the world changes around you.Would recommend a solid 9.5/10			"

V.A.T.S with that.Wanna blow up an entire factory filled with super mutants, blow em up!Wanna unload an entire clip killing an entire town, be my guest.Want to exterminate an entire army of Robo-Scorpions with a Mini-nuke, as long as you don't kill yourself, DO IT IS FUN!But take care of your weapons, the get dammaged over time.-Expansive World to explore (I haven't found all the locations yet).-Thousands of Quests to do (Believe me, i have more that 50 hours and i still haven't finished the main quest because of the secondary quests, plus the DLC ones).-Amazing Soundtrack-The quantity of mods is astonishing (From super inmersive mods that would kill you faster than a Dark Souls playthough to Kinky mods for kinky people ;) ).Big 8 Hours long DLCs (Each) with challenges for those that call themselves ""OP"".Cons:-Limited Character Customization (Nothing a good mod can't fix though).-Level cap to 30, but you can add 5 more level per DLC you get, untill you get a total of 50 (Like i said before: nothin' a good mod can't fix).Fallout: New Vegas is a game that is really worth buying, is fun, gives you an adventure feeling you might be looking for, or just a game to kill Monsters, Super Mutants, Humans, Animals, etc.If you are looking for any of this things, Fallout: New Vegas is a game made just for you. 9.5/10			"

												Fallout New Vegas is a game that comes around only once in a decade. Maybe two decades. It's just one of those games where you either love it and think that it's the best game that has ever been made to represent the fallout universe, or you hate it because you are a sad person who hates fun (or just doesn't enjoy these kinds of games which I can understand. To each their own.) I've put in over 300+ hours on steam officially and probably another 200+ hours offline. The modding community for this game is....well its like nothing I have ever seen before. There is a mod for almost everything. I took great pleasure in modding this game to the point where it nearly crashed many times and yet I still played on. If you like a game where the choices you make actually matter, where the people you meet are interesting and have a story to tell, and if you just love getting to take pot shots at drugged up junkies with explosive anti-tank rounds, this game is for you. ∞/10. Would come back as the Courier to kill Benny again.  "

												War, War never changes. But Bethesda has.When Fallout 4 Launched, those who survived did so in Fallout 3. When the steam reviews rolled out the community set out across the ruins of the old franchise to build new mods. As 48 hours past, what had been the Fallout community, united underneath the flag of the New Fallout Republic, dedicated to old Fallout values of non-voice acted protaganists and actual RPG elements. As the Republic grew, so did it's age, modders spread east seeking better storylines and Intellegint speach options the dryer mercilless expense of the Fallout franchise could offer. They returned with tales of a game untouched by Fallout 4's terrible launch that have scorched the rest of the world and a great wall of its mods spanning the Fallout Nexus site. The NFR mobilized its army and sent it east to occupy the Fallout 4's steam page and restore it to negetive reviews that actually made sense. but across the Nexus another society had arrisen under a diffrent flag. A vast army of Fanboys who had never played an RPG in their life. Forged from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ communities of COD and just about every EA game, Todd's Legion. 4 days have passed since the Republic held the steam page just barrely against the Legion's fake possitive reviews. The Fanboys did not retreat. across the Nexus the legion gathers strength. Dialoge options release, re-textures come out. Through it all Fallout: New Vegas, stayed open for buissness under the control of it's mysterious overseers obsidian entertainment and their army of rehabilitated fanboys.You are a reviewer hired by IGN to deliver a review for Fallout 4. What seemed like a simple 10/10 has taken a turn for the worst. IGN representitive 1: You got the review you wanted, so pay up.Todd Howard: You're crying about a review pally.IGN representitive 2: Guess who's community is wakin' up over here?Todd Howard: Time to cash in.IGN representitive 1: Will you get it over with?Todd Howard: Maybe EA kills franchises without looking the community in the face, but I ain't EA.

												Allow me to ask you a simple question:Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas?I know, I know. This is something we think every day... but I want you to REALLY think about it. Which game is better? Fallout 3 or New Vegas? Back when New Vegas was released, many critics said it was the equivalent of an expansion pack to Fallout 3 and passed it off as just more of the same without being anything special. Yet now many people argue that New Vegas isn't just the better game... that it might be the best game in the Fallout series.Of course, I'm not one to throw stones in this debate. I've only played Fallout 3 and New Vegas so I can only give opinions on this much smaller debate. God, I'm making this sound more important than it actually is.So, I've never been a big fan of Fallout 3. I enjoyed the time I played it when it came out and then I played the GOTY edition on my second playthrough, and I've considered buying it a third time but I'm always reminded about the stuff in Fallout 3 I didn't like, further emphasized by an interesting video called ""Fallout 3 Is Garbage, and Here's Why"". If you're not easily provoked, I recommend this video. It really reveals the chinks in Fallout 3's design.Obsidian is a very underrated gaming company in my opinion. They've made a couple of my favorite games. And what they did with New Vegas was similar to what they did earlier with Knights of the Old Republic: they took an old idea that was good and tweaked it a bit to make it so much better, added better writing, and shoved in a ton of bugs and glitches. Hey, I didn't say they were perfect. I said they were underrated.So New Vegas is made very similarly to Fallout 3 but small tweaks by Obsidian have made this a wholly different experience. Firstly, the story is a massive improvement. Fallout 3 failed to connect with me because it felt far more like I was following in the footsteps of my Liam Neeson dad without feeling like I was creating my own journey. Sure there were some clever ideas and fun setpieces here and there but the story as a whole was kind of flat. And that's mainly because the writing handled the conflict from the Enclave (and also between good and evil) in a traditional black-and-white view of morality.Fallout: New Vegas is a story of choice. The city of New Vegas is ruled independently by a silent overseer named Mr. House but from the East rises a new foe, Caesar's Legion. Their Roman dictatorships guides them to conquering New Vegas in the name of order. They aren't malicious moustache-twirlers. They have clear motivations and justifiable reasons for why they're doing what they're doing. Along with them is the New California Republic, sticking stubbornly to Old World democratic ways. As a decicive battle begins to rise, you must choose the best possible fate for New Vegas- keep it under Mr. House, vote for the NCR's control, conquer it with Caesar, or... find your own unique path. There is no clear ""right"" or ""wrong"" which makes the decisions feel more personal rather than me sticking to a traditional good and evil mentality like the bullsh** karma system in Fallout 3. Of course, on top of that the side quests handle this similar morality as you are given difficult decisions on what is the best to do. Do you choose to destroy or build? Each comes with a cost and a repercussion when chosen, and it's very believable. Of course, not only did the story keep me playing for 70 house (F***... that's depressing) but also the gameplay is very addicitng. You customize your own character as the Courier and embark your quest, as is expected with most RPGs, but the leveling system is so easy to manipulate in order to beef up your character to their best possible stats and all the hidden locations, secret weapons, and amazing side quests kept me hopping from one objective to the next.The world of New Vegas is also much more aesthetically pleasing than Fallout 3's grimy green and dirty brown Washington D.C. New Vegas has bright blue skies and massive golden deserts lying beneath it. During both day and night, the Mojave is constantly a dynamic and enjoyable place to explore and there's enough variety to the world to keep you wanting to explore the whole area... while... on... foot.If you plan on buying the Ultimate Edition, you'll also be getting several DLC packs, including the 4 added story packs. I'll give a mini-review each of them.Dead Money: Fun trip going back to having little supplies and learning to survive. It's a bit on the hard side though, especially at a random middle point in the game and some obnoxious speakers scattered around the map. But the story is pretty decent and the Sierra Madre looks amazing.Honest Hearts: Much cooler in concept than execution. The world of Zion looks amazing, especially with the added weather effects, but the story is clearly another conflict of two different ideas on how to confront a problem and you choose the option without feeling very invested because the story really loses steam when you realize that it's 80% fetch quests.Old World Blues: It's pretty enjoyable. The intro is too cringe-y and long of a start until you actually starts playing the game... until you get over the first hour difficulty hump where you try to find the right weapons that actually affect your enemies. But the world is kooky, fun to explore, and the ending was oddly unexpected but still believable. That and the new weapons are very useful.Lonesome Road: Definitely my favorite. It adds some much-needed backstory to the Courier (which I think is more of a fault in the main game for not having that) but the Divide is incredible. It's a hard play-through (especially when considered to the Hoover Dam battle) but the ending is satisfying to watch unfold. If you don't get any of the DLC packs, at least get this one.Of course, there are some problems too. The game crashed on me more often than my dad's jalopy and there were a couple bugs and awkward conversations with something blocking the other character's face. That and the voice-acting isn't the best. A lot of actors play their roles very same-y and don't variate their voices enough so that most everyone sounds the same.Despite this, I think Fallout: New Vegas improved massively on the initial formula set up by Fallout 3 by adding in more mature moral dilemmas, a more-interesting world, and some fantastic ideas for quests. Sure there are some problems, but this is a game I played in my past that has gotten better with age for sure. I'm giving Fallout: New Vegas a 9/10.			"

												It's been a few years since I've played this game, but still it comes up in conversation for what it did right, and how it left it's mark on meFor me, good writing is the truly vital part of any game that hangs the world, and by extension- the gameplay, off of a strong narrative. So many games are written like a book that's then interpreted into a game, there's rarely any crossover, and if there is any, it's usually contrived. Fallout 3 springs to mind.New Vegas isn't like thatFor example, one faction, caesar's legion, was a thorn in my side for many hours. I read what they did, I heard from people how they did it, I saw for myself the effects they had. Eventually through the story they offended me enough that I got my gun, went to their camp, and killed every last one, caesar included. Right after, I tracked down a person they famously tortured and mutilated close to death years earlier -totally on my own volition mind- and the very first thing you can tell him is that Caesar is dead. He has outlived his closest enemy.I was a courier for my own delivery. The fact I could do that tells me an awful lot about the writing of this game. They understood the Courier. They understood me, the player.From there it only got better, mostly in the DLC stories. One taught me that sometimes it's best to just let go. Another taught me to respect my role as a courier, to think about the results of my actions and to see things from another perspective.I realized in horrifyingly clear terms, that by giving in to my anger and desperation by killing the people I hated, I was no better than the people who dropped the bombs that ended the world. This wasn't forced or even directly addressed, this was something I actually did, and I changed as a result. I now understood why the burned man wasn't happier that I had killed caesar. This same righteous hatred put him in bandages years earlier.Having some of the biggest plot points be informed by what type of game this is, how the player might play it, that has the largest impact. That is what makes this game special. There are ideas, not just dialogue and conversations with X or Y result. The writer's must have actually played the game.By the end, I was faced with the final big decision, to decide the fate of the mojave.I considered my effect on history, what all sides wanted and why, what the people and their stories on my journey had taught me; what ulysses had told me. And finally, next to the hoover dam, I made the best possible decision for everyone.I let go. I stopped playing.And I never went back.			"

Heartaches by the numbers, troubles bythe score- everyday you love me less,each day I love you more~-Day 1 without Miss NovocaineShe's left me. After five years of beinga couple with her since entering highschool, my girlfriend has left me.I am horribly depressed, but I beginmy ritual of logging into Steam in themorning. The Fallout Franchise Saleis in full swing, and New Vegas temptsme so. I consider buying the game.I believe I am going through somethingakin to withdrawal symptoms. I miss hertouch, her laugh, her smile. My handsgrasp air, as I swear I can still smellMs. Novocaine's scent about my bed.I break down, crying. Ms. Novocaineleft me on the first day of the holidays,the time before college. My plans withher up in smoke, I blubber and buy theUltimate Edition of New Vegas.Fallout: New Vegas downloads fastenough. I begin the game with a bulletthrough my head, buried alive and leftfor dead. The game opens up its storyneatly and cleanly, telling me I was justan everyman hired to do a job whichwent horribly downhill. The world is now mine to explore, whatwith me having cheated death and theoptions to pursue multiple paths haveopened for me. With trusty six-shooterin hand, I leave the dusty backwatertown I recovered from my beating inand venture into the bleak world onthe frontier.-Day 15 without Miss NovocaineI have become a veritable recluse. In thetime that has passed, the feelings for Ms.Novocaine have not dulled, but my heart aches even more for her. How can this be?She's started seeing a lanky, fashionableart student. Then a new, stereotypicalbiker bad-boy. I hear she's begun sleepingabout. My heart breaks a little more witheach shred of news I overhear.In New Vegas, my vengeance is tenfold.I brandish and alternate between a lever-action cowboy shooter and a revolverwhich would make Ocelot approve.I undertake multiple quests, but stickto the main quest to restore the fortunesof my employer, the mysterious Mr. Houseand his casino the Lucky 38. I encounterboth the NCR (New California Republic)and the savage Caesar's Legion, led bythe terminally dying Emperor Caesar.-Day 30 without Miss NovocaineI've completed a good chunk of the mainstoryline by playing two sides between theNCR and Mr House's outlying Casino forces.Perhaps on my next playthrough, I shall bea cruel sadist and throw in with the Legion.No matter, the DLC of the game shall keepme company on these cold nights alone.I instantly regret playing Dead Money first,as I soon discover that compared to the others which are of incredible quality, it isDead Money that is the most exceptional.After a few tears sting my eyes at the endof Dead Money, I dive into Honest Hearts,and meet the enigmatic Burned Man at histable of seemingly endless M1911s. His mission clear and his soul reborn, theBurned Man extends his hand out to me so that I may join in his crusade against the savage White Legs tribe, allies of Caesar's Legion.-Day 45 without Miss NovocaineI've done it. I've returned to the main storyand fought the final battle at Hoover Damagainst the new leader of Caesar's Legion,the towering and brutal Legate Lanius.Armed with all that I can carry and drapedin an NCR Ranger's trenchcoat and Chinese Stealth Helmet, I finish the leader of theLegion on behalf of Master House with mynow-signature Revolver.I still have two more DLCs to complete, Old World Blues and Lonesome Road,where the latter serves as an epilogueto my character's original story from themain game. I stifle a yawn and take a long hard look at myself in the reflection of my monitor as I put my computer to 'sleep' mode.Time I got some sleep myself.-Day 65 without Miss NovocaineFinished Lonesome Road last night, andhere I am stifling more yawns in the lineto apply at College on this hot Mondaymorning. A good epilogue after all thathappened in Fallout, but I did wish thatthe main villain, 'Ulysses' would havejust shut up rather than droned on as hedid in Lonesome Road.My mind wanders to Ms. Novocaine as Itry to remember any shred or scrap I canof her. It frustrates me to no end that Ican barely remember, especially after allthe time we've spent together. Did NewVegas really help get over my flightyex-girlfriend? Surely not...Lost in my thoughts of Ms. Novocaineand considering replaying Fallout: NewVegas from a different perspective, I failto see the pale perfection of a girl, dressedin gothic petticoat and corset and daubedin black, blue and silver, knocking intoher and throwing her application papersabout.Dumbstruck, I apologize profusely, buta stare which could stop a clock tickingfrom her hazel eyes meet mine. She blowsa stray blue lock of hair away from hereyes and pays no attention to me.""I'm- I'm so sorry- I was just thinkingabout my application, and Fallout, and-""She perks up at the mention of Fallout,while kneeling down to retrieve herpapers. ""...the Fallout sale? I thought itended already?"" I tell her about howI've been playing it since the sale, andhow well it's been, as both a game anda journey of self-reflection.""What course you apply for?"" She tersely says. It sounds more of a demand. I gulpa bit, intimidated by this beautiful girlwho seems dangerous and skilled. I tellher I applied for Arts and Psychology.The girl has a deadpan look now, beforeshe breathes out in boredom. ""Huh. Itseems we're going to be classmates, loser."" She's collected her papers,but I manage to grab hold of her bookthat she dropped in the commotion.""Let me carry your things. It's the leastI can do."" I tell her, as I feel a fierce heatwell up behind my cheeks. ""Please. Letthis loser make up for his clumsiness,Miss...?"" She scowls, before handingme all of her papers and strutting off.""Come on, Fallout Boy. I don't have allday."" She beckons, her voice laced withirritation. She almost looks beautiful, asbeautiful as Ms. Novocaine was, if notmore so. ""Walk me home while carryingall my things. Then... then maybe I'llforgive you, and add you on Steam.""My heart leaps now, and I suppress a smile, bounding after her so I can walkin step with her. After a time along thesidewalk, I finally muster the courageto ask her.""What's your username on Steam?""She flicks my forehead before skippingahead of me, flashing what I wouldcome to know as her signature smile.""It's _Summer-Rain_.""I bid Ms. Novocaine farewell under mybreath and I smile to myself at havingbought Fallout: New Vegas.Heartaches by the numbers, troubles bythe score- everyday you love me less,each day I love you more~ "

												Honestly, having played Fallout 3, Fallout NV with all the DLCs and recently Fallout 4..NV really stands out as the game that captures the spirit of the Fallout universe the best.It can be a tough game to get into if you're not used to what Fallout is about.In short, you can do anything you want in no real particular order, the NV universe is big and diverse, and allows for plenty of hours of amazing gaming. You'll have some emotional moments (especially in the DLC..), some WTFmoments, and you'll have loads of laughs.For me, this is a must have for every gamer. Just buy it :)			"

												I, along with an unfortunately large number of people, was not too fond of New Vegas when it was released. My original review was littered with complaints about bugs, issues, uneven difficulty, and so on. However, with Fallout 4 on the horizon, I think I'm going to miss Obsidian. They have (or had) an understanding of what I appreciate most about the series, and it took me almost five years to realize it. Don't know what you got till it's gone? When it comes to the post-apocalyptic wasteland; once you've seen one bombed-out building filled with skeletons, you've seen them all. I got my fill of ""destroyed-beauty"" in Fallout 3. I expect something a little more intriguing. New Vegas creates a more thoughtful world. The characters are interesting, the stories are imaginative, and there's always that superb twist of dark humor. It ain't pretty though, and I mean that in every sense of the word. Speaking from a strict game-design perspective, the Mojave is amazing. There's a linear structure, which works well for first-timers. In subsequent play-throughs you'll know where to go, how to get around those freakin' cazadores, and create your own path. If you focus entirely on the main quest-line, the average play-through is roughly 5-10 hours. Naturally, once you factor in all of the additional content (side-quests, DLC, mods, etc) that time balloons into absurdity. I think it's perfect. I also really appreciate that this game doesn't employ level-scaling. But the Mojave is not only a desert, it's also a desert that suffered through a nuclear war. Even New Vegas itself is just a few casinos and some lights. If you didn't notice the details, you'd think it was the blandest place imaginable.The details are where New Vegas absolutely shines. Each ""dungeon"" has a story to tell, some (like Vault 11) are among the best the genre has conceived. It helps to pay attention to posters, and even subtleties like what somebody was holding before they died, or how some everyday objects are arranged. This is what I appreciate the most from Fallout's jump to 3D. Though I have a soft spot for reading a paragraph of text when I right-click on a broken vent, sometimes I just want to be able to see that it is in fact a broken vent and move on. Not only are there multiple endings, there are also several methods for getting to them. Every quest has numerous solutions, and if you can't be bothered, then just crack skulls until you're allowed to progress. The faction system is also quite interesting (especially now that it works), and it's nice to have actual consequences. Bethesda's obsession with essential NPCs drives me insane. Diplomacy is also extremely effective. Not only can you talk people out of fighting, but you can talk people into fighting for you. In a couple play-throughs, I sat back while my allies did all of heavy-lifting, even for the climatic Hoover Dam battle. On the flipside, there isn't any ""benefit"" to playing a stupid character. This is the unfortunate side-effect of higher production values. Everyone has to be voice-acted, and there's no time to record hundreds of lines to satisfy low-intelligence play-throughs. Playing an idiot in Fallout 2 was so much fun. The combat mechanics are...well they're still rather poor. This is something that I've grown to accept with this game. We can't expect all games to be at the level of FEAR 1 when it comes to shooting, but FO3/NV are content with barely passable. After all these years though, I guess I've just grown tired of pointing it out. I never paid much attention to combat in the 2D Fallout games. It might be considered strategic, but for me it's only entertaining when I knock a chunk out of somebody with a sledgehammer, critically hit someone with an advanced karate move that kills them instantly, or shoot their eyes out with limited edition red ryder BB gun. Basically, when I get into a fight in Fallout, I only care about the results. I punch someone, someone turns into dog food, and that's good enough.Since this is a review of a Bethesda game on the PC, I might as well talk about mods. With Skyrim, I got almost all of my enjoyment through modding. With New Vegas? It isn't really necessary. There are a handful of mods that I think are essential: New Vegas Stutter Remover*, Mission Mojave, and Project Nevada. Once you grab those, you're pretty much set. Now I'm not saying that's all you'll ever want in terms of mods, but it's more than sufficient for playing and enjoying the base-game. The only other notable mods I have installed are A World of Pain and Daughters of A.R.E.S. AWOP adds hundreds of dungeons, which can be fun to shoot through. I have ARES installed because the courier is actually a cool-looking robot with anime-colored hair. This is totally immersive and most certainly canon. Also when playing New Vegas, instead of listening to ""Starrrrrrrrs of the midnight rangers"" for the billionth time, I listen to non-stop Eurobeat.In short: I have a new-found appreciation for this awesome game. *Mission Mojave might make this mod unnecessary, I'm not sure.

												This is by far my favorite Fallout game. (Just after Fallout 2)The intro is short and to the point.. No info who your dad is, or your mom, or your childhood friends, or just about everything that could ruin your character building. Here you wake up after being shot in the damn face by someone who wants to take the package you were supposed to deliver. You then wake up with your personal mission to track down the man who did this♥♥♥♥♥♥and if you chose a female... well. just do that and choose the Black Widow perk.. You'll laugh. And while your trying to find that guy, you'll probably notice how much nicer the world looks now, not as boring anymore either. Side quests are a lot fun, except some usual ""Go to Point A, now go to Point B, now go to Point A again"" quests.. they are a little annoying as they offer no real sense of accomplishment other than some XP rewards and maybe a small amount of caps. (But you can kind of expect those in a RPG game.) Resources can also be quite rare in this game, like Stimpacks and drugs. (If you've played Fallout 4 you'll probably know how common they are in that game) This offers a nice feeling of being out of supplies constantly.. which is always appreciated, as finding items now feels a lot better, and it also helps the roleplaying and the overall immersion.. and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is this game immersive. The music helps greatly! and the overall atmosphere in a lot of places just makes you sad.. seeing corpses and briefcases and their items they had on them before the bombs.. The atmosphere is amazing here. And the leveling is rewarding. And all the perks seems very useful which makes it hard to choose. Oh and also.. The sense of progression is once again just fantastic. When you first start.. almost every enemy is scary.. Deathclaws are horrifying, Casadors are poisonous a-holes and you just need to stay away from those.. Then at level 20 you can take on the Casadors with just a rifle shot or two. Then at level 30 you'll just go up close to the Deathclaws with a Hunting Shotgun and blow off their faces.. One major problem I have.. is the Invisible Walls.. They're some of the most annoying things I've ever ""seen"" in an open world rpg.. They really want you to take specific paths to quests and other areas.. you're not allowed to find shortcuts by jumping on rocks or anything else that would seem logical to climb.. which just pisses me off when I should easily be able to pass over a little rock but there's an invisible wall in the way.. and sometimes they'll literally get you stuck inside them for some weird reason. Also some quests are bugged to hell and back. Which was never fixed, so I'd suggest installing some mods for that. Here's a list of what is good yo! Weapons, A lot of the quests, Progression, Perks, Dialogues, Enemies, Weapon Modifications. Fantastic!			"

												Somewhere between convincing a young boy to hand over the trigger for an orbital death laser, and running into a trio of elderly women howling for my blood after I reprogrammed a sexbot to work for the local bar, I found myself thinking, ""This might be one of the best RPGs I've ever played.""More than any other game in recent memory, Fallout: New Vegas is an RPG that encourages - and rewards - you for exploring strange or out-there possibilities. Whether you want to be the savior of the Mojave Wasteland or the Devil Incarnate when it comes to the way you deal with the world and its residents, this game actively relishes in allowing you to mold the experience in any way, shape or form you choose.As a courier who is double-crossed and shot in the head, the game immediately sets itself apart from previous Fallout titles (which all had you start in a Vault and bring you slowly into the outside world) by having you wake up in a small town and immediately get caught up in a (sometimes-overwhelming) amount of oddball characters, sidequests and machinations from various factions within the Mojave. When you set out, you'll quickly find yourself making enemies, running across all sorts of strange locations and getting lost in a mountain of sidequests that will quickly have you glued to your computer saying ""just one more mission"".The most interesting aspect of the game is the care that's taken to giving the player unique, memorable experiences. Whether it's strolling into a new town as the sound of Marty Robbins' ""Big Iron"" plays on your Pip-Boy radio, the oddball encounters given by the Wild Wasteland perk, the unmarked quests peppered throughout the wasteland or the fact that you can literally run around killing everything and everyone (up to and including the heads of major factions), the game has an unbeatable sense of world-building and freedom. You can quite literally massacre everyone and still achieve an ending that's on par (or arguably better) than one of the faction endings.Much care has also been given to the wide assortment of companions you can recruit throughout the game, who all provide incredible benefits during combat. They all have their own quirks and unique conversations, strong companion quests, insight into the various factions and amusing chatter during combat and encounters. Likewise, it shows how much care Obsidian Entertainment put into the game when you see some of the minor NPCs, who have surprisingly-intricate conversations and mini-questlines.New Vegas also has some of the most interesting and, I would argue, iconic encounters and quest designs in the entire series. Whether it's the surreal ""social experiment"" in Vault 22 (and arguably, the rest of the Vaults in the Mojave), menial tasks like the picture-taking sidequest at the south end of the Vegas Strip, or just being able to sell your companion to a group of high-society cannibals for no other reason than ""for the evulz"", the game does an incredible job of keeping things fresh and varied throughout a playthrough.The most interesting thing is that you can play the game a number of different ways and get a different experience every time. The first time I beat the game, I was doing a completionist ""goody-two-shoes"" run where I saved everyone I could and was incredibly thorough. When I went back for a second run, I played as a female melee expert who ran around stealth-killing everyone with sneak attacks, but couldn't shoot guns to save her life. The flexibility and care given to making both character builds have unique advantages is the main part of why New Vegas continues to have such replay value.Of course, there's also the modding community, which has given the game unparalleled longevity, both through restored content (like the New Vegas Uncut series on Nexusmods) or major gameplay overhauls like Project Nevada. Even if it wasn't on sale, the game is still incredible value thanks to the amount of content both in the game and contributed by the community.I highly recommend New Vegas for anyone getting into the genre. It's one of my favorite Western RPGs, and an experience that keeps rewarding me time and time again.			"

Hijacked the rockets so that they would crash into each other killing all the people and the leader of a weird ghoul religious cult. Saved the president. Killed the president. Killed Caesar because I thought saving the guy that shot my brains out and buried me would be amusing.Whole Legion camp went hostile.Killed everyone.No regrets.			"

												GAME CRASHING AFTER INTRO CINEMATIC? SOLUTION HERE:Hey everybody! This is a great game (played it on console before) but I was having issues with it crashing after the initial cinematic on my PC. This issue stems from some game files not being able to recognize newer video cards. Essentially, you have to add a file to the game folder and it should run.STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMUpon initial launch of the game, a pop-up window should appear stating what graphics level the game suggests after detecting your graphics card. If this does not happen, you're in the right place.STEP 2: DOWNLOAD WINRARWinRAR is a free application that allows you to open RAR and ZIP files. You need this because the file you'll have to add is a RAR file. You can download WinRAR from this link: http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm Make sure to download the proper one for your PC. STEP 3: DOWNLOAD RAR FILEThis is the ""unopened"" file you're going to add to the game folder. Download the ""d3d9dll"" file here: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34778/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fnewvegas%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D34778&pUp=1The ""main"" file worked perfectly for me. You can click on the description tab for the author's comments if you'd like.STEP 4: OPEN THE DLL FILE WITH WINRARAttempting to open the DLL file should open it in WinRAR immediately. Click on the file in the WinRAR interface, then click ""Extract To"" in the toolbar.STEP 5: PUT THE FILE IN THE FALLOUT NV FOLDERThe ""Extract To"" option should open up a new window asking where you want to put the DLL file. Navigate to the Fallout NV folder (C:\(Hard Drive) -> Program Files (x86) -> Steam -> steamapps -> common -> Fallout New Vegas).STEP 6: ENJOY FALLOUT NVThat should do it. Please note that this solution worked for me as of 10/23/16. Download files and applications at your own risk. I am not responsible for any viruses/damage these sites may cause. This solution worked for me without any issues, but that is just my personal experience. I believe that I had to do a similar fix last year for Fallout 3, so if you're having issues with that, the solution should be similar. Good luck!			"

												One of my top favorite games of all time. It's as great as Fallout 2, which is high praise. If you're having crashing on Windows 10, please install the following mods. Read the installation instructions carefully as these mods are a bit different from the typical ones.http://nvse.silverlock.org/  <---This is the New Vegas Script Extender. It's required for a lot of mods anyway.http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53635/     <----New Vegas Anti-Crash. It's a plugin for NVSE. These are installed in the following location: GameDirectory(where the falloutnv.exe is)/data/NVSE/PluginsYou drop the nvac.dll in there and violla, your game will work again.			"

												Many people leave the game running to clock ridiculous numbers of hours and say something stupid, like, ""it's okay"".I didn't. I've clocked each and every one of these hours with actual gameplay (or modding and testing), and it is far far more than merely ""okay"".  If you've been living under a rock and you still haven't gotten around to playing this yet, you're missing out. I can't even count the number of characters I've played through to varying stages of completion -- probably in the forties by now. With Tale of Two Wastelands porting over all of the Fallout 3 GOTY content (if you own that one too), the hours I've clocked and the numbers of characters I've played have tripled.Sure, it's buggy. The graphics were outdated when they came out, let alone for 2016. The 50's schtick wore thin enough in Fallout 3 and they tried lampshade-hanging on it in this one, but all they wound up doing is showing how stupid it is to run around with a lampshade on. Some questionable design decisions, sometimes linear plot, invisible walls, vast tracts of empty. Dialogue that sometimes vastly misses your actual motivations (where's my ""Because I don't like being used!"" option when playing the Wild Card?).But this game is ten times the roleplaying game that Fallout 4 even dreams of being, and twice the game that Fallout 4 actually is.

												New Vegas is a proper Fallout game. The lore's there and the story is rich and diverse, with many different endings, albeit missing a proper post-game feature like Fallout 3 did.Obsidian, ever the company that is rushed into releasing their products, also unfortunately did not have enough time to properly playtest this game, and thus, expect a lot of bugs, some of them quite annoying. Game's a bit crashy as well. Thankfully, we're blessed with mod support, and they fix many of the issues present.Gameplay's slightly better but never look at this game as a proper FPS, because the engine was never adequate for it. Do expect hundreds of hours, because although it is set in a desert, you'd be surprised at the amount of locations it has.The DLC can be a bit hit and miss. Gun Runners Arsenal adds a few fun weapons but nothing mandatory. Dead Money had great plot, but terrible gameplay. Old World Blues was pretty funny, but had a few bugs and at times I thought they were trying too hard. Lonesome Road was linear but pretty tight, with great pacing and story. Honest Hearts was probably the weakest, because Zion and its denizens didn't really interest me, except for one character. Not saying who it is, but if you've played it you'll know who I'm talking about. New Vegas is an RPG through and through. The characters are original and engaging, especially the possible companions you can have, their personality trump anything Fallout 3's companions could offer. The choices you make impact the game and nothing is ever black and white in this world. I recommend it to everyone in a heartbeat. Games like these are few and far between.			"

One of the best games I've ever played: Fallout: New VegasPros: Great Factions Great Weapons Great Characters/Voice acting Hard to choose an ending (Means the game is good) Smooth gameplay Excellent DLCs Great creatures/enemies Amazing quests Great Modding CommunityCons:  No major changes in graphics from Fallout 3 When you complete the last of either quest you choose as your ending, you can't play from there you have to restart at the Hoover Dam or whatever save you choose to restart from (I brought this up due to Fallout 3 having this included)Overall the game was fantastic! I know I said I love the graphics in the pros, but hey I had to include atleast one con. And they could've improved the gaphics by just a bit, but I understand its an open world game and those usually dont have the best graphics due to lag and other various problems. I would rate the game 10/10. But my main reason for the rating 10 is because you can choose sides with different factions unlike Fallout 3. Plus in Fallout 4 you're most likely gonna choose to side with the protagonists of the game. In Fallout: New Vegas, however, its hard to choose what faction you wanna side with. "

Just, this game is just full of it. Story is pretty decent as all the side quests are very enjoyable. I only have a few hours into this game seeing as I already finished it on the PS3.This game is really addictive and got me finishing it plenty of times.			"

												I absolutely loved Fallout New Vegas, yes its more of the same but the story is more engaging ,  I enjoyed the expanded equipment roster, tons of locations and the companions were not half bad. An excellent game, spent hours scavenging and exploring the endless amounts of loot. If you can get past the technical hurdles , it's a heckuva gaming experience.			"

												I've always heard that people liked Fallout 3 better than New Vegas. To me, it should be the other way around. New Vegas is better that Fallout 3 in countless ways.-The story is much more complex than Fallout 3's story. In Fallout 3, it was as simple as Brotherhood=Good Guys and Enclave=Bad Guys. New vegas has a nonlinear, choose-your-own-path storyline: Help Caesar's Legion conquer New Vegas, give the NCR control over New Vegas and the Hoover Dam, or fight for an independent New Vegas. There are also numerous smaller factions that you can join or fight. There is a massive amount of player involvement in the world, and your actions in one faction may affect your reputation with another. Not only does this make the game's story more interesting, it also gives the game immense replay value.-Did the Capitol Wasteland in Fallout 3 feel empty? I know that it takes place in the aftermath of a global nuclear war, but the world of Fallout 3 felt barren and boring. In New Vegas, there are plenty of locations to explore and loot around the Mojave Wasteland.-The weapon variety in Fallout 3 pales in comparison to New Vegas. Fallout 3 had about 50 different types of weapons, whereas New Vegas has over twice as many.-Fallout: New Vegas actually allows the player to look down the sights of the gun they are holding, rather than the zooming-in effect that Fallout 3 had. If you liked 3's method of aiming better, then don't worry; you can toggle ironsights.-In Fallout 3, you could only repair weapons up to a certain point, and that point was determined by the repair skill. In New Vegas, Weapons can be repaired to 100% no matter the repair skill. The repair skill instead determines how efficient  you are at repairing a gun (For example, a person with a repair level of 80 would need less materials to repair a weapon than a person who had a repair level of 30.)-Fallout 3 has almost no color whatsoever. Most of the time, the screen is filled with a dull gray. Even when looking at what should be a gorgeous sunrise, the world is bathed in gray. New Vegas has much more color compared to Fallout 3, which is admittedly not very difficult to accomplish. Granted, it's nowhere near as colorful and vivid as Fallout 4, but at least the player doesn't have to stare at the world through a monotonous gray filter all the time.-I will concede that the DLCs in Fallout 3 are interesting. However, New Vegas' DLCs tell much better stories. In addition to their own individual stories, the DLCs in New Vegas all tell the story of another courier, ""Ulysses"". In each DLC, the player finds out more and more of Ulysses' story and learns more and more about who he is until the confrontation in the ""Lonesome Road"" DLC (to be honest, Ulysses' story is much better the second time through, when you can catch all the  minor details).-In New Vegas, unwanted ammunition can be broken down and crafted into different ammuntion, allowing the player to destroy ammo for a weapon that is rarely used in order to create ammo for a weapon that the player uses frequently.-The option of hardcore mode in New Vegas presents an added challenge if the game seems too simple or easy. The player muust manage their hydration, food, and sleep. If they neglect any of these for too long, they suffer negative effects and ultimately die.-Nearly all of these points add to the replay value of the New Vegas, which is something that Fallout 3  did not do very well. In New Vegas, you can side with different factions, use different weapons, explore different areas, complete different quests, learn different things, etc.Overall, New Vegas feels like more thought went into its production, despite only being in development for a year and a half.

												Fallout New Vegas is one of my most favorite games ever.  It's just as amazing as Fallout 3, but the game is a bit on the lighter side astmosphere wise. Instead of taking place on the east coast like Fallout 3, This takes place on the west coast and gives the game that more cowboy southern feel to it. I also find the story to be a tad more enjoyable just because it's so different and refreshing from Fallout 3. I'm normally not a fan of shooter games, but Fallout is amazing! I suggest you give this game a try, I'm sure it will be one of your favorites in no time!			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is probably a great example of what a fallout game should be like. I love the location in Las Vegas area and the mojave desert and the storyline is ok pretty good. If just coming from Fallout 3, you may find the game slightly different from the previous game. Make sure to check out the great dlc's made for this game. Recommended if you like the newer Fallout game series. The storyline is really my favorite.			"

												TL;DR below.The good:- Meaningful and plentiful choices. The quests and stories (especially the main one) actually made me stop and ponder for a while what I wanted to do.- So many things to talk about with so many characters.- The role-playing system.- The environments are pretty nice- The DLCs are amazing and worth playing.- Many interesting and engaging characters.- You get to be the mailman who delivers DEATH.- The lack of level scaling.- An ending which didn't infuriate me (unlike Fallout 3 and to some extent Fallout 4).- You can get a house with various appliances that talk to you. Including a seedy machine that seeds soil using seeds.- Moddable.- Perks. Perks. PERKS.- Companions and their provided perks. ED-E is the best.- The physics are hilarious at times.- Many things to do.- The world and all the interesting stories you can find.Note that almost all the problems listed below apply to Fallout 3 as well! Strange, eh?Biggest issue in the game:The karma-system is really bad. I really wish they had opted for scrapping the general karma system and instead only had faction reputation. You may encounter the Brotherhood of Steel (BoS) while exploring the wasteland. If you find their bunker (through sheer coincidence even), they will demand that you surrender and will put an explosive collar on you to put you on trial. If you resist: they turn hostile and will try to kill you, killing them in responce will incur negative karma. I find it strange that the creators of the game create a situation where they (as a some sort of objective arbitrator of right and wrong) say defending yourself against this action is wrong. Additionally, say you murder the entire BoS-chapter (that's what their groups are called), be it through another faction demanding you do so and you abiding, or because you decide to: you may incur some severe karma loss for this action. However, you can ""repent"". How do you ""repent""? By killing more people that are deemed ""evil"" by the game's creators such as fiends (humanoid, always hostile) and feral ghouls (monsters). What. Murdering 12-13 BoS members and letting the rest die in an atomic explosion in the bunker incurs karma penalties that can be undone by killing 7 members of the fiends. Additionally, this makes it really hard to play a evil character by the game's definition of ""evil character"" as you may have to fight enemies that give you positive karma for killing them! This game would've been better off without this system (just like the Mass Effect series!).Other major problems:- Crashes. Lots of them. May be caused by me modding the game, however, I didn't run too many mods - I had 10, 3 of them graphical, 7 of them minor gameplay changes/other. Wasn't too much of a problem as the game autosaves all the time.- While the dialogue system is extensive and great, I really wish there were some more options to speak out against authorities in the respective factions when you're on their side to influence them a bit more.- Glitches all over the place - including some rare ones that makes your game get stuck.Minor problems:- The AI can be kind of bad sometimes. Things like these happen occasionally:

 Other problems include characters not following you through doors if you're supposed to go somewhere with them (always let them go through first), companions running in front of you during gunfights (Lily is very prone to this - somewhat annoying as she goes invisible if you're sneaking), and enemies have strange reactions to stealth attacks - such as not responding to the fact that someone next to them transformed into a red mist and associated bits of flesh and bones on the floor.- Graphics are somewhat dated.- While Fallout 4 is accused of being a ""superhero simulator"" (fair accusation), you can sort of get the same thing going in this game quite easily as well. Certain combos when creating a character gives you a truly godlike character compared to the alternatives - one of the keys is to go with 8 endurance (and get a 9th point through Lonesome Road). Early-game: you can take a lot of hits, late-game: you get +1 to all SPECIAL-stats, passive regen and additional damage threshold - but you need 8 END (or waste perk points through investing in intensive training) to do this. Slightly better balance could've been achieved if the number of implants you could get wasn't determined by your END.- You can't hotkey turbo or implant GRX (both give a slow-motion effect) without a mod (and sometimes during combat you can't bring your Pip-boy up!).- I want the hear the stealth suit's voice, but I don't want it to apply med-x or stimpacks automatically (got a med-x addiction because of this!). The only solution was to install a mod that disables the voice completely.- Some design-related issues (this holds true for at least non-hardcore mode): stimpacks are disproportionally better than everything else healing-wise - they heal insantly, and they do not weigh anything at all. Food weighs, does not heal instantly, and may also give you some rads.- Rads are mostly a redundant as a mechanic except for one place in Lonesome Road that is optional and for characters with some perks that may choose to incur radiation poisoning on purpose.- The crafting system is meh.- The physics may do strange things like this:


Physics!

 (all of this is frozen!)- Some invisible walls here and there.- Some items labeled as things you can only steal (an action which incurs very minor karma loss) when they belong to an opposing faction.One final very minor problem:


Poorly placed outpost

												A work of art reflects and depicts the culture where it is created. This is what Fallout: New Vegas achieves on its best way.Politics are defined here like anywhere else in a videogame.Democrats are represented by the New California Republic -NCR-while Republicans are epitomized by the Legion.Technocracy and dictatorship are Mr House,and Anarchism is the fourth path you can choose to finish the game.Some spoilers here: None of them are perfect. NCR are corrupt and pay no attention to anything but their interests;and Legion are slavers and gynophobic, although true to their word as their ending shows up.Despite the fact that Mr House is one of the best hopes for humanity (you can see the message if you get rid of him), his regime is totalitarian and despotic.No Gods, No Masters ending is also imperfect. Hard to say which one is canon, honestly.End of spoilersAll the relations you establish with every faction, and there is a lot, affects its gameplay and endings, so this game becomes in my opinion the most complex and rewarding I have ever found, and I remember seeing the first arcade Pacman when I was a kid.The quality of the main quest is reinforced by the impressive amount of sidequests. This game is not only about the campaign, you get swallowed by the Wasteland through the sidequests. Even your companions have hidden quests, all of them flawlessly written. You might need to check the wikias, or buy the game's guide (totally worth it, for me at least), to activate them. There are hundreds of hours ahead of pure delightment, and you will have that feeling you get when you read a really good book:""I don't want it to end""New Vegas inherits the spirit of Fallout 1 and Fallout 2, in an act of enrichment beyond Fallout 3, even though a good game, not as excellent as this one. Even the humour is pretty as unique and subtle as in the two previous games, (just watch a Legionnaire picking his nose and we'll talk). Or the name of one of its Commanders: Vulpes Inculta (Ignorant Fox in Latin). Just play Old World Blues if you want to have some hillarious laughs. I still smile remembering those conversations, oh God! Suffice to say, if you ever played Fallout 1 & 2, I assure you you'll get shocked when you find some characters in the Wasteland. There is a LOT of references to the previous games. Just like the Wild Wasteland perk, you get it or you just don't even notice. That is, after all, what being cultivated means.And yes, I'd love to see those games remade with nowaydays engines. Sorry, purists.Whereas Fallout 3 was focused on resources -water, more precisely-, New Vegas is a struggle of energy resources and you can notice how everything is twisted around that. Not only this is very clever, but also it is the most mature post-apocalyptic simulator you can find to this date.Mojave Wasteland isn't as huge as other sandboxes, but it is worked to the detail, full of spirit and so plenty of diversity or marvels you can walk those sands for a thousand hours. I can guarantee that.Even though the campaign is close to perfect, New Vegas DLCs, all of them, create a storyline arch which multiplies the game's quality immensely. From Dead Money through Big Empty to the Lonesome Road, there stands a parallel storyline mesmerizing and superbly written. By the way, Lonesome Road which was unfairly critizised for being ""linear"" (aren't all paths linear after all? o.O) contains some of the best this game has to offer.Edit: for those owning Ultimate Edition, think that you should really play the DLCs in order:    Dead Money    Honest Hearts    Old World Blues    Lonesome Road.Voice acting:Simply the best there is. Let's talk about Caesar and get to the point.Every time I found this character I was amazed how charismatic and strong he was.No doubt a superb actor was behind those flawless performance.That actor is John Doman[www.imdb.com]When I was watching The Wire (the best TV series of all time) I was literally shocked when I heard the Commissioner William A. Rawls reprimmending his police officers.That acting strength wasn't similar to New Vegas' Caesar, it WAS Caesar himself!And he was.Same goes for many others. Boone, Veronica, Doc Mitchell... Ulysess.Edit: THE MUSIC:It goes without saying this is some of the best soundtracks ever made. I just want to talk about something else to reinforce how mature, cultivated, and serious, this game is.Driving and listening to this soundtrack I found something amazing: the TITLE of a song.'Jacobstown Ladder'. Inon Zur left an impressive cultural mark even at the level of giving title to the songs. It is a reference to Jacob's Ladder, a Biblical figure whose purpose was to rescue the lost souls and take them to Heaven. If you have ever been in Jacobstown you can see the pun (paronomasia it is also called) and how it is related to the game. I bow in respect to you. Me quito el sombrero. 'Dam Nation' is the song for the Second Battle for Hoover damn. There goes another paronomasia with big balls.Con dos cojones. And there is more: the MODS.(Yes, that thing some economical powers of gaming industry wanted to charge you for).I have not only found gamefixes which work fantastically, but also some writers out there that I do consider cannon of the Fallout universe. I am looking at you, Someguy. Your ""New Vegas Bounties"" are part of this game. Congratulations.Edit: WOW just WOW New Vegas Bounties III. Marko enters the Pantheon of best villains ever made (Kerrigan, Arthas, GLaDOS, make some space because you have a new neighbor)And the story, Someguy, you really got me there, you monster.100 out of 10. To my eyes you are part of Fallout Universe by right.Check ""Paint Your Weapon"", please. ;)There are other fantastic attempts, like for instance ""Dust"", the most extreme survival simulator, although having certain flaws in my personal opinion.Other mods I recommend:    Leather Backpack    Veronica Can Wear Vera's Outfit    Russell    Burning Campfire    HZ Novac Campfire    New Vegas Stutter Remover    The Someguy Series    Enhanced Blood Textures    Tales From The Burning Sands <--     YUP Base Game and all DLCsWhat else can I say?One more thing: what this game means to me. I deleted my previous recommendation, which was one of the most higlhy rated I have, but deep inside I knew I was being unfair to my favourite game.In a few days Fallout 4 will come out.I know it will change many things, and you can bet your moustache Bethesda is going to put a lot of efford to make it a breaking point.I am not saying I am not going to love it.I am just saying it has the most difficult task if it wants to conquer my heart.I left my heart at The Mojave.

												I need to update this review, how people gave it 79% user approval is astonishing, this review was rather silly and inconsistent.The Fallout Series tripped my trigger during my middle school years, however I was really rude to this game before playing it, and I slumped it with some awful generalization while I was young. Personally this game was one of those most fantastic games I have ever played. It is full of what Obsidian wanted and they deliver a much more fine tuned game compared to what Bethesda released a few years before this. The reason I like this game a lot more than 3 is the fact there is more involvement, lots of things to do, and it is overall an improvement on what Fallout 3 had to offer. Having true iron sights, more customization, a more fluent battling mechanic. Sure the shooting mechanics are often bullcrap, but really they are not so bad as the point it hinders my enjoyment of the game. There is tons of lore, and quite a few interesting questlines. The game feels more massive than what it really is. Exploring is a lot more fun on this game, because there is not a overwhelming feeling of emptiness that you get when you play Fallout 3, and this game offers an overall great experience to those that liked the early Fallout games, but hated the turn based combat mechanism. Yes, this game still isnt the most RPG of the Fallout series, but it is definitely better at being an RPG than the Bethesda games. The companions on this game are much more interesting and they have more involvement with the story, as the end potrays. Your character feels like he has much more involvement in this game. Even if three of the endings might seem similar, they each feel different. What this game does wrong is the fact that unlike Fallout 3, you cannot continue after the game ends, but personally that is not something I argue about, becuase there is mods that allow you to do so, and thats really that. Do not get me wrong, games like Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 are both good in their own intricate ways, but Fallout New Vegas seems to combine everything I wanted in a Fallout game.What will turn you away from the PC release of this game, is the constant crashing, and the annoying bugs that sometimes come about in this version of the game. Installing mods is quite effective, but even with tons of crash fixes I still crash every now and then, and it angers me to the core. The PC version is not very stable compared to, lets say, the Xbox 360 version, but I still very much enjoy playing it. So, if you want a game with decent combat, fluent story, and an immersive experience, I can easily recommend this game to you. If you want lots of mods and a dedicated playerbase, this game is for you. However if you get angry with games that crash a lot and are full of tons of bugs, you might not want this game, yet I will still heavily recommend you at least try it. To me those bugs and crashes are worth it.			"

												War, War never changes. But Bethesda has.When Fallout 4 Launched, those who survived did so in Fallout 3. When the steam reviews rolled out the community set out across the ruins of the old franchise to build new mods. As 48 hours past, what had been the Fallout community, united underneath the flag of the New Fallout Republic, dedicated to old Fallout values of non-voice acted protaganists and actual RPG elements. As the Republic grew, so did it's age, modders spread east seeking better storylines and intelligent speech options the dryer mercilless expanse of the Fallout franchise could offer. They returned with tales of a game untouched by Fallout 4's terrible launch that had scorched the rest of the world and a great wall of its mods spanning the Fallout Nexus site. The NFR mobilized its army and sent it east to occupy the Fallout 4's steam page and restore it to negetive reviews that actually made sense. but across the Nexus another society had arrisen under a diffrent flag. A vast army of Fanboys who had never played an RPG in their life. Forged from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ communities of COD and just about every EA game, Todd's Legion. 4 days have passed since the Republic held the steam page just barrely against the Legion's fake possitive reviews. The Fanboys did not retreat. across the Nexus the legion gathers strength. Dialoge options release, re-textures come out. Through it all Fallout: New Vegas, stayed open for buissness under the control of it's mysterious overseers obsidian entertainment and their army of rehabilitated fanboys.You are a reviewer hired by IGN to deliver a review for Fallout 4. What seemed like a simple 10/10 has taken a turn for the worst.

												Let me start this off with one statement:Fallout: New Vegas is one of the greatest games I have ever played.(Mass Effect 2 holds that title for me.)I will most likely add onto this after more playthroughs. I've still yet to play Dead Money (got the endings from the wiki).I'm also currently replaying Fallout 3. The base game has been finished, and I'm currently trying to explore the entirety of the Capital Wasteland and do the DLCs before I go back over the review.Like my other reviews, this will be kept simple, with pros+cons, and a small explanation of the game.Disclaimer: I played Fallout 3 through a CD ROM.Another: While I have 100+ hours on the game, today was the first time I actually did the Battle for Hoover Dam.Fallout: New Vegas is a spin-off in the Fallout franchise, a series of post-apocalyptic RPGs. Using the same engine as Fallout 3, New Vegas was developed by Obsidian, the same company who made games like Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords.Unlike Fallout 3, New Vegas takes place in a location not hit by the Great War as much as DC was. The Mojave, which was already a wasteland. Also unlike 3, you don't start out as a Vault Dweller.You start off as The Courier who was sent to deliver the mysterious ""The Platinum Chip."" (Yes, THE is actually part of its name.) You're intercepted by the Tops chairmen, Benny and two Great Khans, who then shoot you in the head. You're rescued (slowly) by a strange, friendly Securitron named Victor, and sent to Doc Mitchell in Goodsprings, who saves your life. After creating your character, you set out to the Mojave to hunt down Benny, only to be caught up in a full blown war.There are of course spoilers ahead.Pros:+ A strong lore like the other Fallout games.+ Great companions that all have their own story. They all give opinions to the Courier and make comments about the world around them, even a PROBE, who got an ENTIRE DLC involved around him! Except Boone. ""MY WIFE IS DEAD""+ Characters in quests have better writing and memorability than the ones in 3, The only characters I can remember in 3 are James and Three Dog.+ MUCH MORE PLAYER FREEDOM. Fallout 3 had barely any freedom. You HAD to go here, HAD to find your dad, and HAD to side with the Brotherhood of Steel. In NV, you have many more options, including multiple game endings, where you have four choices. NCR, Legion, House, or Independent. Six if you count Dead Money (dying in the vault or siding with Elijah).+ Less invisible walls than 3. Still a lot, but they don't block off any paths or anything. Only simple hills and mountains. I'm going to get a lot of backlash for that, but this is from experience.+ A great radio and soundtrack. + Graphics are quite decent.+ Animations are OK. It's best if you get a mod to improve them.+ A large modding community. Not as large as Skyrim's, but still quite large.+ Better optimized than 3.+ Well designed armors, weapons, and enemies.+ Well written storyline. While not as story-rich as Skyrim, it connects with characters more.+ The move from Damage Resistance to Damage Threshold was a smart one. Now you won't be shredded by a simple assault rifle while wearing Power Armor.Cons:- MULTIPLE bugs and crashes that need to be fixed with mods, and said mods require the DLC. I'm looking at you, Unofficial Patch.- Gunplay is... bad.- Sometimes you can halt the progress of the entire game by doing a quest wrong.- Locations tend to be very bland. In 3 many of the locations were quite unique, like Rivet City.- Feels boring at times. In Fallout 3, you had actual random encounters, even if they were just Super Mutants every 200 feet.- Game ends completely at Hoover Dam. Unlike Fallout 3, there is no DLC to fix this, but there are mods.- Battle for Hoover Dam felt small, BUT it could be because I nuked the entirety of Arizona. I'll change this con when I STOP the nukes in my next playthrough.- While there are less than 3, invisible walls. Some of them, while most are in hills and mountains, are in places they shouldn't be, like ridges in places you can go.- Not enough redheads. Forgot about that one.Final Verdict: 9/10 AMAZINGOnce again, I will add onto this as time goes. Please comment on any pro/con you disagree with.			"

'War. War never changes!‘[… but mods can change everything.]________________________________________________________________________________These words are the prelude to the ‚Fallout‘ series, a world on the brink of destruction. During the great war in 2077 all the nations launched their nuclear weapons and civilization was nearly annihilated. Some people have been seeking shelter inside the vaults, others died by the explosions, the contamination and the fallout. Nowadays ruins are most of the time the only witnesses of former glorious cities and nations. Mutations have spread, the curse of radiaton still haunts the wastelands and brutal raiders and gangs wage war against poor survivors and former armies. And then there's you, a simple courier who has been hired to transport a mysterious package. You had the feeling that something wasn't right there. But you still took the job. And in the end...... you’ve been shot in the head. Twice. Then your pursuers robbed and burried you. But somehow you’re still alive, rescued by a mysterious robot and a doctor. Of course you not only want your package back but you also demand some answers. And so you start your adventure through the wasteland of Nevada, following the trails of your former pursuers. And this will lead you right into the heart of the Strip, where the former glory of Vegas is being rebuilt.________________________________________________________________________________Typcially for the ‚Fallout‘ series you are able to explore a huge open world, a post-apocalyptic wasteland where hundreds of abandoned buildings, ruins, caves and so on wait for a curageous adventurer. You will find countless weapons, armors and items, fight against raiders, bandits, animals and mutated beings like ghouls or death claws. With every lock you open, every enemy you defeat, you’ll get stronger, forming your own character. You may evolve into the intelligent mastermind, focussing on energy weapons and science or into the evil cannibal with a love for rusty chainsaws – the choice is up to you. And meanwhile you can follow the storyline of the main quest or you lose yourself in the huge wasteland, the sidequests, the crafting or the fighting. Or you'll just go to the casinos and try to hit the jackpot. The amount of content is huge, so many persons to talk to, so many places to visit, so much stuff to blow up.And all these positive points make up for some of the games disadvantages: Even with different fixes and stuff the stability isn’t perfect, the translation of some items, dialogues and stuff is (at least in the german version) ‚interesting‘ (maybe ‚creative‘ would be the better term) and some stuff like e.g. loading errors can annoy the crap out of you……but you will still continue playing. At least I did it. Because I really love the style and atmosphere, the soundtrack, the exploring, the development of my own character and all the other stuff. And due to the great 'Nexus' modding community you can make the game look absolutely stunning and beautiful, you can add even more content and make it an apocalyptic masterpiece. But even without the mods you won't regret the time you spend in New Vegas.________________________________________________________________________________So all in all there’s only one more thing to say: Gather your stimpaks and the ammo, load your energy rifle and ride into the sunset… *Vault-Boy approves*			"

												I've spent weeks playing this game (almost litterally), this is by far my favorite game ever made.If you've never played it before take a good 20 hours in vanilla to get a feel of the atmosphere and visuals then go rampent with mods and you'll have a almost current gen first person fallout game with true a dialog system fallout is suppose to have. You're not playing a story, you are the story.My favorite roleplay in this game would probably be to go a steath small arms/sniper rifle route with wild wasteland turned on for maximum enjoyment. DLC is a must so get the Game of the Year edition.			"

												This game, THIS game... where can I begin?Let's start with this: buy it... got it? OKGameplay:Although you might argue that the shooting and gameplay in general is the same as fallout 3 (which you should also buy) it does improve over its predesecor like with the all new ironsight, a real one for once.Crafting is generaly the same etc. etc.Quests:This is where the game really shines, its story and quest will leave you wanting always more and that's a good thing. The characters are way more interesting then in fallout 3, in this game you will want to think twice before killing someone who isn't an enemy and you will always think : was that a good idea? Also the quests are not fetch quest well some of them but not a lot.Factions:In this you will come across the many factions of the harsh Nevada desert which wil include mad bombers, underground thechnology freaks,the new army of some sorts,a legion of slavers and Mr. House(I can't tell anything about him)Story:YOU are a simple courier... or are you? So, after you ty to deliver a package you get shot in the head... but you live and now you're on a wonderful magical quest to find the sonofab***h who shot you... but that's where our story begin, find out by yourself.Community: You being part of the pc master race CAN and WILL put mods on your game. What are mods you ask well they are content created by users like you yes you and with time and patience you can make some too. But seriously go to the mod nexus, it is amazing what people can do with this game.DLCs:As I see it, the dlcs( downloadable content) are part of the experience, don't buy the game without them you will miss out on an extrordinary adventure.Dead Money: The first and best dlc released for New Vegas, I recommend starting it at low level, you might not get the best ending but it's way better that way also play it in the dark, it will be quite an experience.Honest Heart:The weak link at least in my opinion, it does have a good story but all in all it was laking something, I don't know what.Old World Blues: If you are patient you will enjoy the dialog but if you normaly skip it all you will find this dlc laking, it still as some memorable moments though.The lonesome Road: Arguably one of the best story in video game history, this dlc makes you uncover your origin, do this as your final challenge before the end of the game if you want to enjoy it.And finallyThe Verdict:As I said before buy itright now, you will not regret it, it doesn't cost much and it will take you more than a few dozens of hours to say: I'm finally done with this.I give this game 9.8/10, my favorite video game in the history of gaming.

												Take fallout 3, expand it, add more diversity, add more interesting locations, triple the amount of factions, add a better theme, and add more immersion and you have fallout NV. Obsidian has taken a decent game and made it great. Really a lot more depth in the world and just overall better. Of course your on the same engine, so some of the same problems exist. Really though the best way to describe it is it makes the fallout 3 world seem boring.Score: 9/10			"

												You know the drill - war, war never changes. The ultimate edition is quite a package and after playing endings for the three major factions (ncr, house, yes man) out of four I feel really full of waging war. I gotta go back to experience the ultimate bad guy route as the Roman psycho sometime later after I have survived the hangover from having drunk hundreds of Sunset Sarsaparillas. Its a really good RPG with extremely well written dialogue and abundance of choices up to you. The vanilla game really has it all on its own, the DLCs are just a bonus - like spin-offs of the main world of Mojave Wasteland. I dont really have anything bad to say about it, except for some annoying bugs like enemies getting stuck inside the terrain and the player occasionally falling through world etc. Gotta lock that FPS to 60 as well to avoid severe bugs with physics. You can even make the game look decent(ish) by todays standards by exploiting the offerings of nexusmods.com and ENB.So the DLC; -Loved Dead Money, great story building around the theme of Greed with intriguing gameplay elements; it deliberately makes you approach the game from different angle than you were accustomed in the base game. -Honest hearts was a bit of a letdown, kinda uninspired area with basic gameplay and run of the mill storyline, it answers some minor questions and rumours heard in the base game though.-Old World Blues was amazing, definitely the best dialogue offerings in the whole game and such a fun story with ludicrous weapons and gadgets to be obtained. I didnt want it to end =D-I'm bit on the fence with Lonesome Road, it has its moments as a ""final boss"" of sorts and discovering the rest of the Courier's tale but it falls kinda short with its boring map design, endless +4 radstorms and fighting sections full of Deathclaws and Ghoul grunts with deathclaw-like health. It gets a bit old to get ambushed by an instakilling monster while crossing a minefield the hundreth time. And that freaking storm always comes out at such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ time you will find yourself thinking if that crap is scripted or is your luck just running completely out.Overall the ultimate edition is a very good game with not too many annoyances, well played Obsidian Entertainment!

Posted: July 8, 2016
												I bought this game in 2014 on PC, and I haven't played it recently enough but it has always been in the back of my mind. I played it on the PS3 at release aswally and when I bought it on PC, I replayed it with some graphics mods and improvements on the game.Fallout: New Vegas is the underrated 3D Fallout game by all people who seem to be unable to see what makes a great Fallout game. It's superior to Fallout 3 and 4 in every way except the gunplay and the graphics, which is technically surpassed by Fallout 4, but I feel like Fallout 4 seems like plastic, but I digress and I'll move from this incoherent rant into the main meat of this review. Story and Dialogue Fallout: New Vegas is written by those who originally worked on Fallout 1 and 2 and their work and faith to the old lore is absolutely phenomenal, I have been engrossed into the world of New Vegas and the whole Mojave desert just through the dialogue and how the whole map, locations and all the politics behind every event, would, as Todd Howard would say, ""it just works"". The whole conflict between the NCR and the Legion is written in a way where you cannot technically define Evil as all choices are quite morally gray, all choices have a proper pros and cons list and it seems like they're all equal shades of gray, but at the same time, they seem black from the other perspective.Characters do speak in a realistic manner, but as I say this, I'm sure that there are characters that don't really speak naturally (dialogue wise) but I just cannot seem to think of any at the time, except Ullyses, he seems too pretentious to seem like a real person. Mechanics The mechanics of the game are quite an improvement over Fallout 3, the quest system from Fallout 3, where the choices and quest start could be different or change the course of the quest but it's quite llinear and less liberal with all the different choices, and in New Vegas, they overhual it and give you more methods to complete a quest depending on how your character is built and how you want to play. The shooting has been improved with the addition of Iron-Sights. The stats have been improved with slight more impact onto the game and the quests, adding alternative routes into quests.They've readded the traits from Fallout and Fallout 2, which force your character to gain extra skills but also penalizes you in some other way. And the perks have been turned into an affair that only comes each 2 XP Levels, This is to prevent you becoming some sort of past-mortal god at Level 20, and the repair system has been revamped and improved and works in a much simpler and handier way than in Fallout 3.I do recommend Hardcore Mode for returning Fallout 3 fans as it does add a slight minigame that makes food and water quite neccesary and adds a bit more difficulty.  Graphics and Map Design The Map is designed in a way where it is easy to find something interesting within a radius of something else, making it like a Mountain that you climb in a way, you progress, you can fast travel back to safety if you're outside, then return from the last spot you were at and keep progressing. Fast Travelling does cheapen the game quite a bit and make it less interesting but at the same time it does make running back for supplies or even restocking or upgrading much simpler.The Mojave Desert has roads on it, and when I first played the game, I had never noticed that the roads in the game would actually work if you drove on it and it made me realise how much thought the developers put into the map and the playable region of the game. The developers put less effort into the third and fourth DLCs, Old World Blues and Lonesome Road when it comes to how the map is planned out and how it would work in real life, but who plays an RPG for realism? It's all an afterthought. Soundtrack and Original Score From classic 40s-50s American music from the likes of Dean Martin and other artists (to be honest I don't know names, I just listen) to ambient noise to give personality to an otherwise dark, quiet, pest-infested cave, the soundtrack does hit it's hits of how to perfectly fit in the silence of the Mojave and the slow trekking through the map.It's amazing to listen to and the songs have stuck with me throughout my daily life, still stuck in the back of my head, still jingling and jangling.Then again, music tastes are subjective, but in my opinion, I do feel like it did fit the game quite well.

												Obsidian is an amazing company, with a solid background in RPGs and storytelling. Fallout New Vegas is my favorite Fallout game, with Fallout 2 following closely, and is an amazing RPG with great lore building and lore stacking.Obsidian also knows what the ♥♥♥♥ an RPG actually is, unlike bethesda, and makes great advancements over Fallout 3 and over Fallout 4 as well. The reintroduction of traits, which was short lived as Fallout 4 lost all of its RPG elements, was a great feature to FNV, taking traits from the orginal Fallout games and adding new ones; even going as far as to add even more in the Old World Blues DLC. The perk system is similar to Fallout 2, a perk ever other level rather than one every level; the perks also do what Bethesda perks don't, which is actually behave like perks. By this I mean that the perks in FNV are game changing, perks should make the game play differently rather than just doing more damage or more EX per task. Jury Rigging and Mad Bomber are my favorite perks from FNV, adding new ways to supply yourself with weapons and changing up how the repair system works. There are perks that do add more EX per task like I mentioned, but its signifigance is small compared to how many there are to change combat, crafting, survival and speech options.LORE, I absolutely LOVE lore. I can't get enough lore out of things I'm into, the Brotherhood of Steel lore especially, I'm a huge BoS fan. Obsidian does this amazing thing, whereas others *cough *cough* bethesda, don't. Surprise! They actually know what the ♥♥♥♥ they're talking about when they write lore. They actually give a damn if the lore can be supported and if it will conflict with other lore. They build onto previous lore and write new lore where its needed. Jacobstown is a HUGE reference to Fallout 1 and 2. The name of Jacobstown itself is a big reference, the super mutants who mention the masters army is a big reference, nightkin is a reference which I thought had been lost in the newer games. Obsidian knows what they're doing with lore much better than the company which prides inself on it's ""storytelling"".So, Obsidian is a great company who deserves ever dollar they get from you buying this game. They make AMAZING RPGs, they write GREAT lore, and overall they're just good at what they do, and isnt that what it should all be about in the end? Making a great game requires a great company to make it.P.S. The head honcho of Obsidian is one of the lead directors of Fallout 2, so classic Fallout fans, you can trust him. You also should try out KOTOR 2, or Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2, another great Obsidian game.			"

												So far yet so great, this is the best fallout game for me even this game came out 6 years ago. Why did I say this? let's have a look to the Cons and Prons that I've made based from my reviews.Pros:-A strong LONG story that'll make you surprised even from the beginning until the end.-Faction system-A lot of major and minor improvements that made the game not to run like a rotten potato that will ruin another fallout game.-Great Difficulty that lives up to its name and that is the ""Hardcore Mode""-Massive, varied, open wasted world just for you to explore and to encounter interesting characters and quests-New combat system, faction system, and more features to the settings-Keeps the atmosphere and structure that made it's immediate predecessor-Weapon Mods that let you have fun and experiment with your guns.-Great DLCs that isn't made for a cash-grab tactics-Powerful enemies in different parts of the world.Cons:-No more Metro Tunnels like you can see from the past game Fallout 3-No significant innovations or improvements in graphics, design, or play mechanics-Lots of Bugs and Glitches that you can encounter while playing this game-Dirty rigged AI-Lets you go up to Level 30, you only can pick few perks like 15 perks only (Not Including the 2 perks at the beginning.)If you asked me if YOU should get this game, I would say it why not? This is the best fallout game made by bethesda and obsidian. Too sad for Fallout 4 which obsidian wasn't part of the development which is why Fallout 4 was the suckiest Fallout Game.			"

												Fallout New Vegas has proved to be a high-level title regarding the PC version, that very little moves away in qualitative counterparties on consoles. Basically the game still has a well-balanced interplay between Dynamics typically from role-playing and first-person shooting, with a collection of narrative lines that are incoceranno and will find their point of Union in the decisions of the player himself. The endless Mohave desert awaits players and make them share personal experience and subjective, long-lived and never boring. There are unfortunately some problems in terms of graphics and code cleaning, resulting in sudden drops in frame rate and a random bug; as well as on consoles, though, it's very little flaws that affect the value of a product to be considered calmly among the must buy for all fans of the series and role-playing games in General.

												Fallout : New Vegas is, in my opinion, a rather good game nailed down by numerous bugs/glitches, so having any reasonable conversation with someone about it turns quickly into a glitch-swapping fest.So, let's do some good old fashioned Pros/Cons way of reviewing video games.PROS-A large, expansive world.-More guns/ironsights instead of that inching forward from FO3-Unique factions, and every single one of them you will hate.-The line ""What's a Chicago?""-The Bloody Mess perk-Funny physics toss-ups-Modding community active in all departments.And now for the bad.CONS-The game dies silently behind loading screens.-The game dies if you use explosives too much.-The game dies if you use the console too much.-Running into cars stacked atop each other can get you stuck, forcing you to use the console.-Achievements-Many weapons from FO1 and FO2 have been removed.-The Gamebryo engine is one of the worst engines I've ever played on, but dayum, is it flexible.

												What can I say about Fallout New Vegas other than that it's essentially a 4 year old game that I still play more often than most recent triple A titles. I'm not the sort of person who plays just one game based on nostalgia. The primary reason for my love for this game is that. like many others in Bethesda's RPG line up, it's pretty much fully customizable with mods. There are mods still being made to this day, and you can make changes to virtually everything in the game world. Modding includes adding custom weapons, clothing, lighting, enemies, creatures, weather effects, custom companions, missions, expanded game areas, sound effects, voice effects, interface, homes, and even to linking fallout 3 to New Vegas (given that you own both games), and that's not even scratching the surface. If you have any experience with modding, or a willingness to learn, I HIGHLY recommend this game.			"

												For starters, since you're probably playing on PC, I STRONGLY recommend you spend some time looking at various mods that people have made for this game (and are completely free). While the vanilla game experience is still good, playing with even simple mods that fix bugs makes the experience so many times more enjoyable, and allows you to tweak the game to your preference.This game is very enjoyable and easy for me to lose myself in. I can spend hours just wandering the Nevada wasteland exploring new locations or cutting down enemies. A number of the non-playable characters have interesting, and even sometimes thought-provoking, dialogues that makes doing quests something you actually want to do (besides getting a reward of some sorts).Of course, this game has its downsides. For starters, the game engine is junk. The game clearly shows its age, so if you're not using mods to make the game look good, don't expect it to look amazing. You can go in any direction you want past the opening sequence of the game, and while I consider this a good thing, those of you who prefer linear games will probably dislike this. The game very strongly suggests the direction you should go in (by following along the main questline), but more experienced players will probably greatly deviate from this.If you've never played a Fallout game, what are you waiting for? (Well, I can understand if you're waiting for the next $5 sale, I did that too.) For those of you already familiar with Fallout / The Elder Scrolls, you'll probably enjoy this.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is probably the only post-2 Fallout game that I would consider to be a legitimately good Fallout game instead of just alright (Fallout 4) or worse (Fallout 3). It feels more like a sequel to the original games than any of Bethesda's work, and frankly there are so many improvements from the gameplay to the writing and story that I'm too lazy to go into an in-depth review of all of it, so you can either take my word for it or just go read my Fallout 3 review and imagine if there was a game like that except good instead. It makes the shooting feel slightly less like it was taken from an amateur's Oblivion mod, it balances out the perks and makes it generally tougher to become a god, the companions actually make you want to travel with them instead of leaving them all in a slumber party at your house, and the main storyline actually makes sense this time. It's just overall a really great RPG, and a great Fallout game.The DLCs are a little different than most Bethesda DLCs in that they all have an overarching storyline going on in the background leading up to the final part. The first DLC, Dead Money, will probably either be your favorite or your least favorite depending on whether you like being challenged or you're a big whiny baby. It's probably my favorite part of the game as a whole, and the characters and general atmosphere of it are pretty great, especially if you turn on Hardcore mode for it (which I don't really recommend doing outside of Dead Money, because it's not really that challenging in the main game; it's more like a minor inconvenience that occasionally pokes you and tells you to sip some water). Honest Hearts is the next one, but you can basically skip it as far as I'm concerned. You get some cool .45 pistols and tommy guns that you'll never find enough ammo for in the main game, and you get to see Joshua Graham (also known as the Hanged Man from Van Buren) for about 5 minutes or so because the main questline of the DLC is like one hour long and there's not really anything else to do in it. It also has barely anything to do with the overarching story. Old World Blues is the next, and it's most peoples' favorites. It has a lot of fun areas to explore that actually have things in them, and the overall presentation is pretty funny and entertaining, which might be a welcome change of pace because of the dreary nature of the rest of the DLCs. Lonesome Road is the final DLC, and while peoples' opinions on it tend to vary (the Lonesome Road True Faction Allegiance mod is pretty much mandatory in my opinion, because otherwise you'll spend the whole time getting yelled at for being an NCR dog because you waved good morning to one of them on your way there), it's a pretty solid conclusion that solves the mystery of who that guy in the collector's edition playing card set was.If I had to complain, it'd be that Lover's Lab's selection of sexual mods for New Vegas is pretty terrible, and you're a lot better off with the Elder Scrolls games if you're into that. It can also be a little slow at the start on additional playthroughs, because even though each area presents multiple ways to handle it you will likely see the same few areas in the beginning because of how the map is designed to send you in one of two paths to New Vegas (the long way that takes you through several areas on your way to New Vegas that you're supposed to take, or the big manly man way through a chasm full of deathclaws). Overall, buy New Vegas.			"

												This game is love. Fallout: New Vegas really tells a brilliant story and although you feel at parts like nothing more than a pew pewing machine, other times there are decisions that affect you as a person, and your emotions, be extreme laughter, or sorrow for the smallest of characters. Without a doubt my favorite DLC is Old World Blues, I highly encourage you to buy this along with the game, if not the entire DLC. OWB had me laughing and giggling with each witty remark, and Obsidian do a fantastic job in both this and its other DLC opposite, Dead Money, a horror type DLC which does a good job of making each step you take a worrying and questionable one due to the enemies AI staying stealth and silent untill the last second. Good job Obsidian, I'm sure the replay value for taking sides will keep me going for quite some time!Edit: The music in this game has become a bliss for me, the music having music from the actual time the game is set in gives a stable feel of authenticity to the game and to its creators. Each time ""Big Iron"" plays from my Pip-Boy I can't help either go along silently in my head, or even start singing it out loud with broken but well meant notes :)Another thing I have to say is something I feel a bit sad about. When I began the game, I had no clue what I was doing and thus, did not like the game at all. I had a friend's strong reccomendation that all would get better and thanks to his reassurance, I've had great fun. So this little note is just to say that you may not fall in love with this game at first, but perseverance makes the game feel like a gift rather than the chore like feel I had at the beginning.			"

												This is the easily one of the very best story-driven games that exist with decent gameplay and presentation.You probably already know all the pros but I'll skip to the cons outside of poor optimization/engine.-Low effort on Legion path, lots of things unfinished (thanks Bethesda 1 year time limit)-Mojave outpost is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ not nearly as important feeling as everyone hypes it out to be-There's like 5 voice actors in the entire game and 2-3 lines that repeat for all the soldiers/NPCs you can't interact with BUT luckily you can fix all of these with mods and more, and the DLC for this game is also fantastic (especially for the mods)Some recommended mods (new game is probably necessary and some of these may clash without Nexus Mod Manager)Also this is not the mod load order, important and you probably need all DLC for this to work (get it anyway it's great)-New Vegas Redesigned III-Project Nevada (Core, Rebalance, Cyberware)-NMCS texture pack (prioritize in first couple mods, use small texture pack if your computer is weak)-Nevada Skies-New Vegas Bounties I, II, III (get all)-More Traits/Perks-Weapon Mods Expanded-Interior Lighting Overhaul-Populated Casinos-Mojave Outpost Redesigned-Fallout Character Overhaul-A World Without Pain-Anti stutter/lag-New Vegas Anti Crash-Some desert eagle mod (trust me here)-New Vegas Killer-Weapons of the new millennia -Vurts WFO-Bad mother fu.cka + all other NPC additions -Improved companion sandbox-Someguy Series master (required for some mods)-Better loading screens (is the name of the mod)-Freeside open-Immserive Karma-Enchanced blood-Wasteland Flora overhaul-Wave Radio-New vegas strip connected-EVE (weapon particle retextures + overhauls especially for laser weapons)Optional (as if the rest weren't):-Unlimited Companions (I just wanted Boone and Cass at same time with the Doctor guy)-Perk every level (I liked an easier game GG EZ)-Run lucky 38 (great but takes time to figure out)-Level cap 100 (self explanatory)If you haven't played the game yet I highly encourage you to get the game with all DLC's, and to definitely get it on a sale (like 100%). If you're not brain dead I also encourage you to install all of these mods before playing the game once as it makes the experience much better. Also even if you have finished the game on vanilla but want to play the game again you should definitely get at least some of the mods listed above.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is simply one of the greatest games I have ever played.I'm not going to pretend i'm not a fanboy as I write this, because I am. I have always been deeply in love with the Fallout series since the first game and I am happy to say it's one series that seems to have only gotten better.I'll start by saying I own this game both on Console and on PC and i've completed the game on both. Though, with Fallout 'completed the game' is a very loose term, I use it to mean finished the main story mission line.Fallout is one of those games that allows you to play how you want, and punishes you accordingly. If you want to be 'evil' then you can, but don't expect to find allies amongst those who want to protect, and if you want to be 'good' then the same applies, but don't expect the Legion to want to help you.My favourite thing about this game is the freedom to play it at your own pace. There is the main story mission which you can follow and most likely complete the game in a few hours, but there are also hundreds of sidequests, areas to explore, people to help and companions to find. My Steam shows that i've played 79 hours and i'm nowhere close to having completed every side quest or exploring every location and in those 79 hours I don't think I've ever felt bored. The morality in this game is another standout feature that I loved. Many games have a good/bad element to it, but I felt in Fallout: New Vegas your actions and choices really do have an impact. I find that there are so many games now that give you choices but they never really affect your gameplay. Fallout: New Vegas isn't one of those. Maybe like me you'll start to question if what seemed to be 100% right at the start, really is the right thing. Fallout does have it flaws though, like most Bethesda games, and they don't intend to fix them. You will most likely find quests glitching out here and there and the game crashing as and when it feels like it. Saving often can massively help, and keeping a Fallout Wiki open in the background to check if the quest you're on has any known glitches is something i'd recommend. There's also the massive issue of killing someone (by mistake or purposely for whatever reason) and finding out 20 hours in they were part of a quest and that quest is either failed, or you have to select an ending you wouldn't have wanted. The frustration of losing an hours worth of gameplay because I forgot to save it has been the reason many times that i've stopped playing, but I always pick it up and play again sooner or later.You can't really go wrong with an open-world rpg survival style game with leveling, perks, companions and over 50 hours gameplay. The game is worth every penny and more in my opinion, and even if you don't have the £14.99 to spend now, when it goes on offer grab it. You won't regret it.			"

												Fallout New Vegas is the best way to shame Fallout 3!As a big Fallout fan, first time I felt I was in Fallout world since the first games was New Vegas.A lucky courier finds himself/herself patched up by a good samaritan and a bullet to avenge.New Vegas introduces us to Mojave, a land where we see the ""future"" of the wasteland.NCR grows to be a large government. But are their goodwill limited to self-benevolence?A newly risen power is the Caesar's Legion. What seperates them from mere slavers?What's the position of the players such as the Brotherhood of Steel or the Enclave in Mojave?And who is Mr House?You're going to find the answers to these questions in this ACTUAL post-apocalyptic game (as opposed to the reskinned fantasy game F3).Ups:Believable charactersGood dialogueVastly improved gameplay (comp to f3)Dusty atmosphereModdable (google for compilations)Downs:Carries the unfixable downs of the f3 engineThis is definitely a must-play for any fallout fans and strongly suggested for any RPG players. For shooter lovers, it still offers a variety of weapons and enemies and a deeper game play then f3.			"

												Coming from Fallout 3 with the positives and negatives that resided there, I was wary of New Vegas. I came in expecting to be bias against it, and instead came out with one of my favorite games of all time. New Vegas offers a unique experience with nods to prior entries in the series, and adds affecting quests and intriguing choices. Its strengths, however, come in the form of its DLC. The main plot of Vegas is interesting, and allows you a large amount of ways to go about the end. But what stands out is the story behind the Sierre Madre (Dead Money), finding out who Randall Clark is (Honest Hearts), learning what's really going on in the Big MT (Old World Blues), and figuring out a part of your past and what you left behind in the Divide (Lonesome Road). Obsidian tells stories that stay with you, and nothing does it better than New Vegas.			"

												Fallout New Vegas is hands down my favorite RPG of all time.After playing Fallout 3 I didn't think another Fallout title could out do it, then came Fallout New Vegas which was made by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda. New Vegas did everything right in my opinion. First off FNV was made with the same engine as FO3 so it looks exactly the same. As far as I know they didn't upgrade any visual details. New Vegas runs okay, I like to use RivaTuner to cap my FPS at 60. This ensures there aren't any insane FPS jumps and I've found that higher frame rates cause micro stutters. There probably are mods to remedy this but I've never bothered. All in all FNV may look really dated in some people's eyes but I still love how it looks.The RPG element of New Vegas is so deep, you can play it for hundreds of hours and each time your experience will be vastly different. There are a wide variety of perks, if you have a play style in mind, I can gaurentee there's at least one perk for it. My favorite part of this game is developing a character and making it my own. The gameplay in Fallout has always been great in my opinion, it was made even better with the addition of aiming down sights. In FO3 it was basically essential to use VATS but in this game I never use VATS, I don't invest in any VATS related perks, and I love never having to use it. With that being said I think they improved VATS and made it way more balanced.The story in New Vegas is my favorite out of the series. It's a classice revenge story with a great twist. The best part about the story is that it allows you to role play any character you desire and it will all make sense. So if you want to be an evil raider or a good NCR ranger, it all would make sense around the story. There are a ton of factions in the game and I love the variety they bring. It's also awesome how your actions can effect your faction relationships. Also the setting is great, I've always been fascinated with the west coast in the Fallout universe so it's cool to see in this iteration.The DLC in FNV is some of my favorite in the series. It brings much appreciated scenery changes and even the worst DLC for FNV is still really fun in my opinion.So, as a final point, to say I recommend Fallout New Vegas is a bit of an understatement. This game seriously influenced the types of game I enjoy playing and I will always be able to come back and enjoy a fresh playthrough.			"

												Fallout NV is one of my favorite games. It has a great atmosphere,quests,and locations. The modding for the game is top. I reccomend this for anyone that liked Fallout 3(and all who dont need dragons or orcs and elves in a rpg xD)The Fallout series takes place after a nuclear war and the U.S. is desecrated, a shell of its former glory. Humanity emerges from the tragedy as selfish and power-hungry as ever. Despite the bombardment of numerous nukes, the city of Vegas managed to survive the war mostly untouched. In the aftermath, a group of people formed touting the values of the old governmental system and called themselves the New California Republic, or NCR. Thanks to the Hoover Dam, the NCR and citizens of New Vegas have access to clean water and power, something most areas lack. At odds with the NCR is the Legion, a dictatorship lead by a man who renamed himself Caesar. Based on the Roman methodology of conquering other civilizations, the Legion absorbs nearby tribes and enslaves a portion of their population. The NCR and Caesar's Legion butt heads over control of the area, and tensions are high. Deception, cannibalism, space travel and drug use are all themes, really crazy sometimes :)backstep-crit-boooom      :-O			"

SUMMARYObsidian's Fallout: New Vegas is the last good Fallout game. It features everything good out of Fallout 3, features superior writing, and a generally better feel.REVIEWFallout: New Vegas. Otherwise known as ""Fallout 3 that should have been"".Imagine Fallout 3 but with more meat. A lot more meat. I mean a mega-ton more meat. That's New Vegas. Basically, New Vegas features better writing, better plot, more story, better pacing, more interesting side quests, more weapons, more interesting perks, the re-introduction of traits, interesting factions, and interesting locations.New Vegas manages to revive the feel of the classic Fallout games by including fun, interesting characters, grimy locales, and choice with consequences. In the first few moments of the game, you are given a number of choices that can influence how the rest of the introduction will play out. For example, the starting town of Goodsprings is facing a problem with a gang known locally as the Powder Gangers - merciless thugs that use a lot of dynamite. You essentially have four choices: help Goodsprings, help the Powder Gangers, help no one, or kill everyone. But it's not so straight forwards, as there are subtle ways to complete the quest without following the most obvious - being to complete all the objectives. I'll leave the rest for you to find!The visuals are improved only slightly from the previous installment, but they get the job done and can be easily improved using an ENB filter. The basic gameplay mechanics are the same, but there are some improvements here and there. The game shines with its writing, proving that Fallout isn't about the guns and loot as much as the story and characters.New Vegas is known for its large modding community, and it has more files on Nexus Mods than Fallout 3. They range from small tweaks,  as in the popular ""New Vegas Anti Crash,"" or as expansive as Project Nevada - which changes the fundamental gameplay of New Vegas, adds new weapons and armors that are well balanced, adds neat visual effects, overhauls the stealth mechanic, and more. If you are a returning player of New Vegas and haven't played in a while but are still looking for an interesting and immersive experience, I recommend these following mods:- Project Nevada- Enhanced Camera Mod: makes third person animations visable in first person (check the ini!)- Nevada Skies: adds new weather affects, like rain and sandstorms. Works well with Interior Lighting Overhaul which changes the mood of all rooms in New Vegas to be more realistic.- All of Vegas Uncut, especially Freeside Open and the Strip Open.- Enemy AI - Tactics - NPC Healing: just generally makes the AI better and more interesting, plus optional AI healing.- EVE: New effects for explosives and energy weapons- MTUI and oHUD: MTUI is just a more PC friendly hud set up, with small fonts, more room in menus, etc. oHUD is a suite that includes imersive HUD options, (HUD disappears after a moment) adjustable HUD options, and extra HUD options (hardcore needs, clock, etc.)- WMX: Adds a bunch of new, balanced weapon mods.- Classic Dialogue Options: Doesn't tell you when you have a skill check in dialogue. For immersion, etc.- Enhanced Blood Textures: Generally better and meatier looking blood.- Pipboy 2500 mod: it's not a big, ugly Pipboy, neither a gay readius- Flashlight NVSE: adds a host of different flashlights, for when Nevada Skies nights are scaring you away- Fallout 4 Quickloot: The only good thing to come out of Fallout 4.CONCLUSIONWhere Fallout 4 failed miserablely to capture the intangible essence of Fallout, the folks over at Obsidian managed to craft a fantastic Fallout game that is worthy of being placed alongside the classics.

												Never would one imagine that one would find so much to do in such a grand role-playing world. If I were to define New Vegas in a brief sentence, that would be my definitive statement. The extent to which this game has changed me whenever I replay it is incalculable. So much so that it is a difficult task to enumerate its many virtues. I will try to stick to vital values. Firstly, this is a game that adapts itself to several gameplay tastes. Whether one wishes to play it casually, attentive to storytelling elements and lore progression, or whether one would rather feel the potential for post-apocalyptic survival that it presents, New Vegas is there to provide it. Explore the numerous side-quests or discover how influential and emblematic each of the four main-quest personalities of the game (Yes-Man, Caesar, Mr. House, General Oliver and his entourage) can be. There is never a shortage of in-game mythos prone to in-depth unearthing by the player should they be interested enough. On the other hand, the game is so self-sufficient and self-explanatory as to not demand any background knowledge should the player choose to ignore Falloutian lore. And all that wholeness executed in perplexing 18 months by the careful minds at Obsidian.New Vegas steps into the chaotic territories of mechanic bugginess from the infamous Gamebryo/Havok combination, but manages to keep major nuisances at bay. I have never experienced a single game-breaking bug or glitch, only the minor and even amusing stuff. And although the mechanics was already dated when it was released (late 2010), New Vegas feels like a fresh journey with its simple but timely additions - among them I can bring up the Companion Wheel, shooting downrange, and the addition of a hotkey to switch between ammo types; not to mention the precise crafting system and the hardcore gameplay option.Characters are as close to perfection as you can get with an RPG. Brilliant voice-acting, immense sense of uniqueness in each of the relevant characters, and an actually solid story given to each and every one of the player's companions. This is the good old Fallout 2 companion system that we are discussing here, only improved. A set of quests intertwined with the main conflicts shall give the player valuable support for the entirety of the game's mythos, as almost every companion has a history with the Mojave to be scrutinised. The emotions enticed by such quests can vary greatly, and only serve to reiterate Obsidian's sharpness in delivering an authentic, almost flawless rendering of branching storyline in an electronic RPG. And these are just side-quests. I am not even going to discuss the merits of the game's intricate main storyline, as I leave it up to anybody thinking of buying this title and playing it for their first time.Willing to abandon your real-world anxieties for valuable moments of embedding yourself with an immersive post-apocalyptic experience? Investigate or intimidate, persuade or kill, hide or bring mayhem about, survive or secure your niche, craft or buy from merchants. New Vegas gives you all said options to prosper and unveil its stories. The Mojave awaits, and it will reveal a thousand mysteries as long as one is willing to travel extensively across its horrifying deserts. Those points and several others are some of the reasons why this is one of the most impressive videogaming enterprises I have ever witnessed.			"

FALLOUT NEW VEGAS PUTS AAA TITLES TO SHAME!Incredible game for ludicrously low price.If you are going to mod new vegas after playing for a while, I strongly recommend the following mods from Nexus CommunityProject NevadaMakes the game even more interesting than it already is. You can have optional FPS Shooter elements with Project nevada. Dynamic Crosshair, Bullet-time, Peripheral vision etc, fully customizable you can enable or disable them at any time. Also to mention Cybernetic implants which give the player extra perks.True leaning, by XilandoEssential if you are going to Install Project Nevada, or Stealth. A very simple mod which allows you to peek from corners. Thats about it.NMC Texture PackThe game is a little old, but NMCTP revitilazes the game giving more realistic and detailed textures. Will consume extra space on your HD but worth it definetely.Bottle that WaterIt's odd that Obsidian devs missed such feature, by default you don't have the possibility to refill water from lakes, pumps or fountains. But thanks to the modding community now you can.The mods I recommend going on and on, there are definetely more essential mods but I wrote the most important.Look from my personall mods installed here:http://i.imgur.com/Xixo1zb.pngI Bought Fallout New Vegas on Autumn Sale 2014, Invested many hours playing even after finishing the game I feel like playing it all over again. I upgraded it to Ultimate Edition on winter sale 2014, to get all the DLC's to increase the playability of the game. It's basically enormous game, and the time you  can spend on it. Let's also mention the ridicilous modding potential, if it happens to beat the game with all 4 ""factions"" and finishing the DLC, you can either turn the game into a complete sandbox, give it some bounty hunting mode or user-created quests.

												New Vegas is a faithful sequel to Fallout 2: New Reno. Much like its predecessor, the game features a desert, gangsters, casinos, guns, surprisingly good role-playing. The game takes place in the Mojave Wasteland � a pretty much lifeless, HUGE and twice as many locations as F03.  It's a bleak world without much hope and the choice is between bad and worse.New Vegas does have a few technical issues. Overall, the game is best played not as a sandbox but as a more traditional RPG where you explore the main quest, which, depending on your choices, will send you to a variety of locations. New Vegas is a huge game. I can probably write another 6 pages examining New Vegas's various aspects but i'd rather play more. This game is only improved upon with the INSANELY TALENTED modding community with some quest mods even better than the ones Obsidian has written themselves dont forget all the armour, weapons, the re-texture's and mods that increase the difficulty of the Mojave. Without a doubt a MUST OWN! even without mods and any DLC its just so great it would be a crime to not pick this up worth any amount of money.			"

												More than just a Fallout ""3.5"", Fallout New Vegas is definitely an unique game for me. The atmosphere, the weapons, the lore, the NPCs... all of this make it my favourite game.Instead of having the focus on your character's story like in Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas puts mostly the focus on the background of those places : the war between the NCR and the Legion. This background is so well-introduced and so well-placed, when I met Mr. House for the first time I felt like it was a movie (a true icone of the game). Thanks to this, you feel like a part of the Mojave and not just playing an RPG game.About the gameplay, the new crafting seems a bit too complicated and unworthy to be really used, but the addons on weapons are really nice to get. Also the survival mode makes the game a great experience. Like in FO3, the locations are well detailled, and even if they don't have a reason to be visited through some quests, you'll end up doing it just to find the funny easter eggs.Finally about the RPG part, you'll really feel like your actions have influence on the world and also how the world will react to you. You have a karma with each faction, and each one will change your own story in the Mojave. "

												Good fun.  Mods make it a ridiculousy good game.  Here's a list I use;-Project Nevada-NMC Texture pack-Nevada Skies-MTUI-Fallout Character Overhaul (needs Old World Blues DLC)-EVE - Essential Visual Enhancement-Enhanced Camera-Enhanced Blood Textures-Weapon Mod Expansion-Wasteland Clothing HD-Weapon Mod Menu-CaliberX-Legionary/NCR Asasssins Balanced Lists (The base assassins are super high level even if you're low level, good to balance it.)Run it through the New Vegas 4gb client that you can get off the Nexus (along with all the above mods).

												Took me a while to get into but once i did, i loved it.It's better then Fallout 3, why ? Because it lets you do whatever you please, you can kill everything if you feel like it, even important characters related to the main plot of the game can die and the world will react to it properly with many dialogs with NPCs changing to what you did and some quests might not even be open to you anymore due to what you did.Quests in New Vegas tend to have alot of multiple choices,solutions and endings, not just one neutral ending,one evil ending and one good ending , instead there's a fine line of varying shades of grey which will often make you think about what you're about to do instead of doing the usual video game trope of ""Well, i wanna be a good guy/a**hole so I'll pick text that's in blue/red"".This is why people tend to recommend Obsidian's New Vegas over Bethesda's Fallout 3, New Vegas has far more intreasting things to do in it with an insane amount of choices and outcomes which make replaying it a second and even a 3rd time still a somewhat refreshing experience without resorting to installing community made quests via the Nexus mod site.However, the problem New Vegas still has to this date is the engine it's powered by.Even when it came out back in 2010, the engine it had was considered a fairly limiting and old engine, it can only use 2GB of RAM on a system which is just one of the many reasons why  this game loves to crash so much.It also comes with an annoying micro-stutter bug that's caused by the fact than the engine was for some reason coded for 64 Hz at 64 FPS for some strange reason and since pretty much no one in this world has a TV/Monitor that's 64Hzs, it ends up causing weird micro-stutters in the game.Thankfully the community created various mods which fixed these issues, there's a popular mod which removes the micro-stutters so you can enjoy a a nice smooth 60 (or 120/144 ) FPS experience without any stutters and there's a community made launcher which enables New Vegas to properly use at least 4GB of RAM and not just 2, which is a must if you plan to mod New Vegas with graphical mods that increase texture sizes alot or maybe add alot more models and other things in the world to be loaded by.Overall, it's an amazing game that's sadly sometimes hampered with technical issues it has due to the engine it uses.

												Fallout New Vegas is an excellent game. Generally speaking, I do not really play any games over 50 hours unless I really enjoy the game, and with 80 hours, I completed my first playthough of Fallout New Vegas, including the DLC. So in terms of time that you can get out of this game, Fallout New Vegas is worth every cent.The game itself is fun and the questing system is enjoyable just like Fallout 3, which I have previously played. Many quests have multiple ways to finish it and there are tons of branches that open up from that. Additionally, Fallout New Vegas features factions which is an interesting a good addition from Fallout 3. Not to put an major spoilers in, but I ended up compeltely destroying a ceratin faction that just did not seem like a good bunch of people >:) But you can really destroy the balance with the factions with certain actions and sometimes they lead to unintended consequences. There is so much to do in New Vegas and so much to explore. The skill line, perks, and skill requirements for things are all just as good as Fallout 3, except that leveling up is a little too fast and easy in Fallout New Vegas in my opinion. The visuals and audio are good as well as with almost all Bethesda games so there really isn't too much that is bad with Fallout New Vegas.The DLC for Fallout New Vegas are generally fun. The only DLC that I didn't really like was Dead Money because it was so dark and creepy for most of the time, even though I was overpowered by the time I went in. Dead Money just didn't give me a good feel playing it. Old World Blues and Lonesome Road were by far the best two DLC compared to the other New Vegas and Fallout 3 DLC as well. I personally liked Old World Blues the best, but Lonesome Road is closely behind.Although I generally have no problems with Fallout New Vegas, there are actually a couple of game breaking problems. When I mean game breaking, I mean actually game breaking. There are certain parts of the game that completely glitch the game and freeze it, prevent it from continuing, or crash it. I installed a couple of mods (that did not change the gameplay at all since I like Vanilla) to fix the bugs and crashes such as the unnofficial patch. The mods integrate very smoothly with Nexus Mod Manager so it is very easy to ""fix"" the game for the most part.TLRD: With the glitches and bugs aside, Fallout New Vegas is an incredible game that is a ton of fun.Rating: 9.2/10Recommend Price: Full Price (it's worth every cent!)

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. The reason ... the freedom. Sure you could say it’s for the graphics (not), or the amazing story line, or even the gameplay. No, the freedom the game offers you is amazing. You start of a guy/or gal, woken up from a shot to the head that should have killed you. Although some information was given about the person you choose to play as, I would have liked to seen more from the game. From the start you are given various options as to how you want yourself to be represented. As a hero, or an anarchist. Aside from the freedom you also get lovable characters and their factions, the decisions you make, and locations you venture off to that you   WILL remember. Graphic wise, the game isn't strong. The animations aren’t either. But you know what who cares, oh you do? MODS!!! The modding community of this game is huge, however it has  gotten smaller but sure as hell isn’t dead. The community is still alive and still pumping those sweet, juicy, hot mods you want. The mods include many things like : texture packs, weapons, or weapon mods; quest, npc's, and a whole lot more. Don’t like the mods the community has to offer? Make your own! The game does have a creation kit,yes it is confusing, but with a little practice you’ll be making mods better than a lot of the stuff on the sites. Sure the game isn’t perfect but you can make as good or as horrible as you like depending on what you do in the game or what you do to the actual game.			"

												Day One: Got shot in the face by a dude in a business suit. Woke up in a doctor's house, nicked all his stuff and ran. Got into a bit of a tiff with some locals, but I remained level-headed and gunned them all down brutally.Day Two: Travelled to a town with a giant dinosaur statue, which needed help with some ghouls in the nearby ruins. Went to ruins, sniped down ghouls, stole their loot. At that point, I was attacked by an invisible demon, I panicked and shot grenades everywhere like a spaz. Repaired a rocket ship, loaded it with some more ghouls, shot it into the sun.Day Three: Made it to New Vegas. Got shot at by some Elvis impersonators, removed their skulls in revenge. Bribed my way into the casinos, at which point my game crashed.Go figure.			"

												I usually don't do lengthy reviews, but, hey, it's Fallout.Pros:- Great story- Hundreds of quests- Can run smoothly on probably any computer- A lot of choices- Mods- DLC- Dozens of different play styles- Easy and challenging- Dozens of weapons and locations that I haven't even been to yet.- S.P.E.C.I.A.LCons:- Can be buggy- Crashes- Sometimes frustrating- After playing it multiple times, Goodsprings is repetitiveSome things you might care about:Question: I like (genre) games, and not western games like New VegasResponse: Chances are, Fallout: New Vegas has some of that genre. It's not horror, but sometimes creepy. Also, if you don't like western games, it doesn't really matter because New Vegas has it all.Question: Do I have to side with the good side?Response: No, and there really isn't one ""good side"". You can side with the NCR, Legion, Mr. House, or Yes Man.Question: How should I approach this game?Response: In my opinion, approach it how you'd like, at least in the first play through.Conclusion:Should you get this game?Absolutely. $10 for a game this great is a steal. I have 125+ hours so far on this game and I haven't played every quest yet. Words cannot express of how good a game this is.			"

Note: I've spent hundreds of hours on this game excluding its DLC on the console versions. There are so many good things that can be said about this game, from gameplay to side quests to how the S.P.E.C.I.A.L and skills work, but I can only say one thing that makes me prefer this game so much over Fallout 3. I would have to say it is the constant references to Fallout 1 and 2, by exploring the wastes, talking to people, and even gathering items from those times, you can really see how Obsidian pays tribute to the games they helped create whilst under the name Black Isles. From the tales of a screaming Sargeant stationed at Navarro, to tales about The Master, and finally to the Chosen One blowing up an oil rig; it's obvious the wastelanders will never forget about the amazing tales of the Vault Dweller and the Chosen One. Neither will Bethesda, Obsidian, and most importantly, us, the players.You will never get bored of this game, it's a masterpiece just like the games before it. 10/10			"

Posted: June 25, 2015
												War, war never changes.The GameFallout New Vegas is another Fallout series, which focuses on open world experience, with combat and RPG. Fallout New Vegas, like its predecessors, inherits lot of its series strong points, the most important thing is that your choice matters. The game is set upon the ruins of Nevada after the Great War, which includes the ""city"" of Las Vegas and its surroundings, such as Primm, Goodsprings, and Freeside. Like in RPG games, you can interact with a ton of characters, you could speak, trade, or get mission from them. The combat in the game is similar to FPS, which means just point your gun and shoot, but also added with a special mechanic that allow you to stop time for a while and fire more accurately.The Good of the GameOpen World. No borders.Since the beginning of the game, you can go whenever you wanted. You heard from the NPCs that the Quarry Junction is filled with deadly deadclaws, which are high-level encounters. You still want to go there? No problem. Do you want to skip early mission and head straight into New Vegas? No problem. You wanted to use that beautiful gun? No problems, there are no level requirement, just some stats requirement (for example : You need a high skill in Guns before you can use a Marksman Rifle).You can interact with many people.Every people have their own schedule, so you won't find a single person at the same location every time. At night they usually goes asleep at their own home. Some may visit other people, some may visit casinos, but no one will just stand and waiting for you to talk to them. You can kill people, enslave people (mods required), pickpocket them, puts grenade in their pants, etc. Some of them have interesting personalities, in fact most of the personalities you would find in Fallout New Vegas are on the colorful side, instead of the ""Regular Joe"" personalities. Like what a character in the game said : ""If someone is too clean, you can bet he/she has hidden a terrible secret.""Great DLCsFallout New Vegas does not have DLCs that only add 1-2 weapons, but they add DLCs that gives a new area to play, even some DLCs have different way to play. At Honest Hearts DLC, you are living with the tribes near Grand Canyon, thus you must rely on traditional medicine instead of your regular stimpak. At Dead Money, you are forced to be more resourceful and careful. And so on and so on.Better companion system that the previous game.Interactions with companions is now done using companion wheel, so you can order them around without the trouble of going to their dialog choices one by one. On the other hand, you companions also have a lot of interesting backstories attached to them. Faction systemThere are lots of faction vying for power in New Vegas. If you kill faction A members, expect them to came to you and try to kill you. If you help faction B members, expect them to give you something or help you.Weapon moddingA new feature in FNV, that allows weapons to be added with mods, such as scopes, silencers, cooling system, etc. A small but great addition to the game.Interesting worldThe world is interesting. The game is interesting. The world is interesting. The story, mission, backstories, they are all interesting. Interesting means that they evoke a sense of ""need to see the end"" of the story, so you don't get bored. The details of this game is also big, there are lots of terminals and logs scattered around places that gives rich backstory to the game.Mod supportEnough said. With mod support, there are lots of changes in the game. There are mods that makes the game more realistic, whether in the gameplay, lighting, or the weather. Some mods add weapons, armors, and other stuff to the game. Some even add areas outside the game world for more gaming hours. Mods are what Fallout New Vegas are still played today.The Bad of the GameBugsLike your regular Bethesda game, there are some bugs. Some doors fail to open, some achievements fail to register, some quests do not work, but mostly it is a minor issue. Being a PC master race, usually a simple console commands will fix the bug too. Bear in mind that the game is very stable, but using mods may creates instability, though it adds lots of fun.Companion missionWhile companion mission are great backstories and great stories themselves, to trigger them it is fairly difficult. Without guides, sometime we can only walk in the dark. Even more, some companions ""trigger"" will only trigger once (for example : when meeting a person for the first time) thus by just playing you could miss your companion mission and it have detrimental effect in the ending.VerdictA definite buy this game. Don't buy Fallout 4 yet, but buy this one and Fallout 3. Both are great games. "

												So instead of reviewing the game I'll tell you about a near perma-death-loop experience I had as an example of what kind of crazy stuff can happen in this game, and then you can decide if a game that allows you to experience crazy stuff like this is the kind of game you're interested in.-So I get a quest to go into this old abandoned vault to figure out why the towns water is radiated. They tracked the radiation to the vault but since there's tons of undead in it nobody wants to go in.-I get my rad suit on for protection, I got stimpacks, some fresh water, some rad-away, some rad-X and so on.-I head in and find out that there's a small cave I have to get through first.-Then I enter the vault.-I find my 1st vault dweller (undead) pretty easy, dead in a few shots of my 9mm machine gun.-I take some Rad-X to prevent rad poisoning.-And then I find my 1st vault dweller guard.-He's much stronger than the 1st, and he gets a lot of good hits on me.-I drink some water, and eat some food, it restores my health, but I still needed to use the one super stimpack I had, so now that's gone.-I have 10 water, 2 food, 4 stimpacks, and 1 doctors bag at this point.-So then I go deeper and deeper in the vault, navigating the maze, all the while my rad points are increasing steadily.-I get rad poisoning, I use some rad-away. This happened multiple times until the last time when I ran out of both anti-radiation meds.-By now I've explored most of the vault going from terminal to terminal to open door after door.-By now I have 5 water, no food, 1 stimpack, and a doctors bag.-I find the vault overseer who is the most radiated of the undead and the strongest, he's protected by 2 machine gun turrets.-Before fighting him I take out all the nearby undead to avoid them interrupting the fight and catching me off guard.-My supplies are: 3 water, no food, no doctors bag-I proceed to the overseer's door. My health is VERY low, so I use all 3 of my survival magazines to increase my water's effectivness of healing me, I then proceed to use all the water I have left in order to have the most health possible.-My health is now at 85% and I have no healing supplies.-I open the door, and the turrets start firing. I sneak in a grenade which takes them out.-My companion (A robot named ED-E) charges in and gets some good hits on the overseer, he now has half health, and I still have 85%.-He charges and I have no choice but to back away as quickly as possible while shooting a plasma rifle at him.-He gets plenty of hits on me lowering me to 5% health.-Then I get rad poisoning. And have no way of stopping it.-So now my brain FINALLY says ""GET THE CRAP OUT!""-So I begin to make my way out and actually run into another vault guard, I use a stealth boy in order to avoid detection, and have ED-E take him out.-After this happens my health is down to 4%. (Rad poisoning)-I proceed to try and find the fastest route out, but since it's a maze down there I end up just wandering aimlessly.-Eventually I find the exit to the vault.-My health is at 1%.-And then I hear a vault dweller directly behind me.-ED-E takes him out and by some INSANE luck, I level up.-Now leveling up does not restore health in Fallout. It just lets you increase your stats. So I'm not too excited.-But then it turns out it was an even number I leveled up to, which means I get a new perk.-One of the perks that I can unlock at level 12 (Which is what I leveled up to) is one that allows me to increase my max health by 50 more points.-And so I use it, make it out of the cave, fast travel to a doctor, and fix the rest.10/10 would panic insanely again.

												There are lots of people who say that Fallout 3 is better than Fallout: New Vegas because Fallout 3 has better dialogue, or more interesting characters, or makes you care more about the world than New Vegas does. Those people are lying.Let's start with the obvious one: The world. In Fallout 3, you basically have a choice of being a good guy or being a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag, but no matter what, you are railroaded into following the main quest line, which is to grow up in the vault, leave to chase after your father, join up with the Brotherhood of Steel, and fulfill your parents' dream of a wasteland filled with life. The only difference between a ""good"" and ""evil"" main quest completion is which of two options you pick at the very end, either putting a modified FEV strain into the water supply to kill off ""unfit humans,"" becoming a eugenicist in the process, or not doing that. That's it. A ""Do you want to be evil? Y/N"" dialogue box at the very end of the main quest is NOT GOOD DESIGN. Even worse, picking one choice or the other doesn't actually change anything after you complete the main quest. In New Vegas, by contrast, you have four different ways to finish the main quest line, and you're locked into picking one when you're still a few quests away from the climactic ending. Once you've firmly sided with one faction, the others  will shun you, and even attack you if you're particularly mean to them. The fate of the Mojave wasteland is real and dynamic, and you get to shape it to your will far more than you can the Capitol wasteland.And that's not even mentioning the fact that it takes a solid ten minutes in Vault 101 before you're let out into the world, while you only need about sixty seconds of listening to Michael Hogan before you can start roaming in New Vegas. The tutorial in NV is more organic than F3, and completely optional.What about the mechanics? Well, F:NV has everything F3 does, PLUS a fully-flushed crafting system (Fallout 3 let you make 10 marginally useful items from blueprints; New Vegas has dozens, maybe hundreds, of craftable items) that includes campfire remedies, reconstruction and recalibration of bullets, improvised ammo, natural poisons, and lots more; the ability to AIM DOWN YOUR SIGHTS (I didn't remember how much I valued that until I picked up Fallout 3 again); a higher level cap and more - and more specialized - perks (lots of Fallout 3's were just ""Add 5 points to this attribute and 5 to that one!"" Boring.); the need to choose two handicaps at the start of the game to make each playthrough pose its own challenges; faction disguises; a hardcore mode; decreased effectiveness of V.A.T.S. to make the choice of whether to use it or not meaningful (in Fallout 3 you could just spam Jet with Grim Reaper and mow down tons of foes without thinking; NV makes you play more tactically); and lots of other things I've mostly forgot about. From a mechanics perspective, then, Fallout: New Vegas does beat Fallout 3.What about characterization? Lots of people have said that they just didn't care about the characters in Fallout: New Vegas the way they did the characters in Fallout 3. I can only conclude they didn't get exposed to any video game characters before playing Fallout 3, because New Vegas' characters are definitely more flushed out. Companions are the best example of this: In Fallout 3, your companions have the personality of two lines in a speech bubble stapled to a cardboard cutout with a crayon smiley-face drawn on. There are no real differences between the companions: They simply run around, shoot whatever weapon you give them, and have a few generic lines of dialogue. In New Vegas, however, each character starts out holding a part of their personality back from you - you know, like people in real life. They have personal motivations, and will leave you if you do something they don't like (for example, retired NCR ranger Boone will leave if you start hurting NCR people, Cass will leave if you have very low Karma, etc.). If you do things they like while they're travelling with you (for example, if you have Chuck Bartow- I mean, Arcade Gannon in your party when you direct HELIOS One's power to Freeside and Westside), you will eventually trigger more dialogue options where they tell you more about their past - because they trust you - and, depending on how you respond, you can trigger a quest that has them confront their past, the choices they've made, and what their future holds. You, as their friend, have some influence based on your dialogue options, and that impacts the way these characters will act in the future. This is the epitome of characterization in video games. That is about as close to ""how people work"" that we're going to get in an open-world post-apocalyptic RPG, and I love it. I'm not going to bother getting into nitpicky things like weapons, armor, buff items, etc. It's a sequel, so of course there's an improvement in the variety of items. That's to be expected.In short, the worst Fallout: New Vegas can be accused of is ""not improving on Fallout 3 enough."" Fallout 3 is better from a ""Narrative storytelling"" perspective - the narrator, of course, being Liam Neeson - but Fallout: New Vegas is a game where *you* choose who you are - which is the crux of an RPG, a Fallout game in particular. I recommend you get both this and Fallout 3, but if you *have* to pick just one, New Vegas is the better option. -Heit			"

												You were fooled. Tricked. Betrayed by the man. But you wake up from the grave with a mighty lust for revenge and nothing is going to stop you.Thats how i felt when I first started playing New Vegas. I think it has one of the most amazing beginnings of any game, because you just feel that you have the get back at the man who shoots you in the opening cutscene. A lot of people have spoken in a negative way about how the game isn't open from the start, and while I partly agree with that, I don't think it matters that much becuse starting your journey towards the strip is just so engaging.Like any other game from the fallout franshice the experience is what you make of it. If you just use the first gun you find, only follow the main storyline and don't talk to people and explore, you're probably not going to get that much out of the game, althoug it is certenly playabe that way.To get the most out of this game, you have to immerse yourself in your character that you can basically make your own in most ways; from what faction you are going to side with, handling delicate situuations peacfully with you charm or going in guns blazing killing everything is sight, how you are going to look and act during dialouges.The game is however full of bugs (and not just the giant insects trying to kill you). Some of it can be excused due to it being such a large world with so much to do, but it can be annoying at times when the game freezes, some character interactions being buggy and objects glitching out.But most bugs can be fixed throug unofficial patches since fallout probably has one of the largest modding comunities. This also means you can add endless amounts of content to game already filled to the brim with it.Fallout: New Vegas is a great addition to the already fantastic fallout series, fixing alot of the problems people had with Fallout 3, like like the iron sight. It aslo contains probably my favourite storyline in the series so far, with gambling, gangs and a big battle.8/10Feel free to check out my other reviews.			"

												What do you get when you cross the Post-Apocalypse with the Old West? A bullet to the head.You play the role of a Courier who was ambushed, ""killed"", and brought back from the brink of death. Now you can hunt down the man who shot you and left you for dead! Or not. Take over the Mojave Desert! Or not. You can do pretty much what you like, even if that means shooting everyone while giggling like a madman/madwoman. (Giggling not included.)The DLC is recommended as well.			"

Posted: April 17, 2016
												After the huge dissapointment that ruined the fallout franchise and decided that Fallout should be a fantasy first person action game with an ilusion of choice codnamed 'Fallou 3' we actually get a Fallout game. Ladies an gentlemen, welcome to Vegas. New Vegas.Now I'll be comparing this masterpiece to both FO3 and FO4:New Vegas is set much closer to the original Fallout games, on the west coast, where super mutants don't exist everywhere for shooting things reasons, there are no colapsed buildings to force you to go around or use console comadns( that annoyed me so much the only way I was traveling the DC ruins was using tcl).There are no enemies named 'raider', the 'raiders' are part of different gangs. There are FACTIONS, something thatwas missing in FO3, and they don't shoot at you for gameplay reasons. In case you haven't figured it out I'm talking about the Enclave, who even if you side with them still try to kill you just so you have something to shoot at that shoots back at you. Speaking of the Enclave WTF are they doing on the east coast in DC? I tought they blew upp at the oil rig back in FO2. You can still find remnants of the Enclave scattered across the Mojave, and they are well aware thet the Enclave blew up at the oil rig, one of them can be your companion. Companoins who won't hate you because you want to make money. Oh, and inn this game you aren't a concerned middle-aged white parent, or a 19 years-old daddy's boy, no, you are a... mailman. The Mailman. Who has more than 4 answers to a question. In FO4 you had 4 options: 1) Yes(I'll help you)2)A question that lead to the other options3) Sarcastic( make a bad joke that will make the player feel embarased they chise it and help him)4) I don't care about you but my character and quest  marker does so I'll help you anyway kind of option that will make your companion hate youIn New Vegas you can talk your way out of most situations with a SKILL check, and not having to quicksave before you choose something in case you have 10+ Charisma but you still fail. Also this CHR checks are not color coded for people with low INT(see what I did there) who can't read numbers. Also in FO4 INT no longer affects your speech, because they could't record so many lines. Take this for example:Fallout 4When you meet Kellogg, no matter what you say( all options indicating that you are a middle-aged concerned white parent) your options are:I'll kill youI'll make you sufferI'll make you payA bad joke about killing him again in hell or something like thatYou can't convince him to leave, either by a speech check or by having low INT, You can't side with him, BUT you can shoot him, because this what FO4 is all about: shooting things and being a middle-agedg concerned white parentIn FNVWhen you talk to the Legate you can tell him to f*ck off, you can convince him to fight you 1v1 with a karma check(karma no longer being in FO4)ORWhen you meet with Benny you can just kill him, have sex with and kill him in his sleep, let him escape and tell him to let you live etc.Also New Vegas includes dark humor, not bad and embarasing jokes that only a middle-aged concerned white parent would say. In FNV you have no family, no friends, it's just you, the Mailman. And that makes you feel like an adult making your own choices that affect the game.The 4 main factions are: Mr House, The NCR, the Legion and Yes Man's independent New Vegas. When you finish a faction's quest you don't get the same end mission( yeah,you have to face Lanius, but under different circumstaces) like you do in FO4. Also, some may disagree, but its better if the game doesn't allow to play after the main quest because if you sided with let's say the NCR, you've probably done all of their quests before the second battle for Hoover Dam. If you would still be ablle to play, there'd be no legion, no Mr House so it's better if the game ends with the main quest. Also this game includes gambliing, just like FO3 and FO4, but unlike FO3 and FO4 it's gambling with chips and money and all that, not your skills and dialog options. There are also plenty of smaller factions such as the Great Khans, The BoS, who can either help or work against in the second battle for Hoover Dam.Take this for example: Colonel Moore from the NCRasks you to(spoilers) deal with the BoS. You can initiate the self destruct sequence, just kill them of sign a truce between the NCR and the BoS. Each of these options will give you a diffferent end slide, and the Courier can decide if the choice was either good or bad. You can play as a saint or thedevil's right hans if you want, you don't have to be the Wasteland's hero. FO4 wants you play as a good guy, but it doesn't really let you help people. In FNV you can really help people if you want to, like helping people in Freeside kick their habbits, not making you build houses like a minecraft ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for 'settlers'  who are never happy. There are plenty of houses in Boston, you don't need more.			"

												Well, where to start? Hmm, ok, the main story of New Vegas: VERRRRY well written! An almost perfect balance of difficulty, questlining, exploration and cast of colourful characters. An awesome 4 different endings for the final Hoover Dam battle, deciding the ultimate fate of the Mojave forever. Plenty of side and faction quests to keep you occupied for an easy 100+ for completionists. The factions are very cool, with some very interesting backstories, e.g. how the NCR are the re-construction of the democratic world, or how the Legion are basing themselves on the success of Pre-War Rome. Definitely adds to the throwback of the Pre-War era.Ok onto the DLC's:Lonesome Road: Ok Lonesome Road has got to be my favourite DLC by far. The amazing and yet emotional story of the true destruction of human nature, The Divide. The hellish nightmare you'd think most of the Fallout world would truly be. With plenty of secret US Govt. bases and awesome prototype laser weapons including Red Rocket. A heartwarming and cold-blooded ending with the tale encrypted into ED-E, and an epic finale showdown in an OPERATIONAL Nuclear Missile Silo, with the option to change all Faction relations in the Mojave with the option to Nuke NCR or Legion... or BOTH! 10/10 would replay many times!Old World Blues: This was an interesting DLC. Travelling to an old Pre-War Area51-esque science base called Big MT, having your Spine, Brain and Heart removed for robot parts, and then quest to overthrow the facility and track down your old brain in a very epic confrontation. Definitely will recommend this DLC to anyone. 10/10Dead Money: Ok, so Dead Money. This DLC has a unique and interesting storyline, of a super luxurious casino opened on the day of the Great War bombings in 2077. Having never opened, and left sealed in a cloud of toxic dust, it has been haunted by the ghosts and holograms left to rot. I liked the story of the Greatest Heist of the Century. Howecer, the downside to this DLC is the unbelievable difficulty. It took me as a Lvl50 character, 9 hours and about 12 deaths later to beat it. Its a good DLC, but needs to be nerfed in Difficulty ALOT! 6/10Honest Hearts: Honest Hearts was the kind of DLC made specifically for the more strategic and cartegoraphical advanced player. Not an easy terrain to navigate in the Utah badlands, but a very cool Native American-esque story with many tribes scared of Pre-War structures, living the old native way, under threat for warmonger tribe White Legs. And a heartwarming story to decide the fate to Fight or Run to save the Sorrows and Dead Horses. And a very confronting meet with The Burned Man himself.... 9/10			"

												Best Fallout title to datemassive amounts of content worthwhile exploration, faction affinity and looting as well as immersive side stories after having played fallout 4 I realized one of the things I loved the most about this game was the dialogue options and skill system. You can become a professional and your dialogue reflects it, if you've got high medical skill you'll have unique conversations with doctors, got guns? talk to gunsmiths and so onthey also included the classic fallout intelligence dialogue feature in that if youre intelligence is really high you speak clearly and concisely and if it is really low you basically just talk like a super mutantcan't reccomend this game highly enough			"

												I never appreciated this game enough when it first game out, still riding the high of Fallout 3.  That really wasn't fair, I wasn't as familiar with the previous games and I was playing them all on console at the time.  Years later, after writing this game off, I came back to it here on steam and by then I was deep in the PC modding community, which only enriched this rediscovery.  Even without mods, I can say that Fallout: New Vegas is a GREAT GAME!  In improves on the gunplay of Fallout 3, adds a gigantic arsenal of new weaponry to enjoy and brings back a lot of the cooky humor from the previous games, as well as a few homages to classic characters, storylines and items.  It's not the bleak, incredibly atmospheric experience of Fallout 3, that game still gets all those points right on the money, but if you want fun gameplay, to not take things so seriously and play your way, this game has it all!  It's before the sytem was streamlined in Fallout 4 and improves on all the favorite features of Fallout 3, making it probably the best Fallout game to date, in my humble opinion.If you get onto The Nexus and start throwing mods at this thing, prepare for a of the best gaming experiences you can have today!  There's still people putting work into this game right now just a browse will help you increase performance, fix various bugs and glitches, overhaul the graphics with HD texture packs, lighting and weather effects and even give yourself an alternative, roleplay focused start that can give you an entirely new loadout and starting location based on the decisions you make at the start!Great game, fun game, please buy and play it NOW!

If you decided to team with any faction it could drastically affect the game. You can be evil or a saint. This game is a great fallout game and a great game in general. This game worth every penny and sometimes it even goes on sales so you could get this amazing wasteland to explore and reform for just 5$!

												More and more, I return to New Vegas as the absolute paragon of how a game can resist the ""Show it all in one playthrough"" mentality, taking your actions and choices and moulding them into a meaningfully different, unique-to-you conclusion that describes how your time in the Mojave Wasteland affected not only the fate of characters you met, but entire factions and regions of America in the years following the game's conclusion.Obsidian provide a masterclass in storytelling, engaging and memorable quests, meaningful choices and fantastic post-apocalyptic survival gameplay. Fallout has always been about the world that was burned away as much as it is about the world that rose from its ashes, and Obsidian never forgets this. Dark humour abounds, twinged with a kind of sadness, but also with profound musings on what it is to be human, what it means to lose your history and culture, and how we might replace these things among the ruins of the civilisation of yesteryear.A fantastic job is done of resisting painting the franchise's various factions as simply ""goodies and baddies"", giving you the freedom to decide the fate of the Mojave without feeling like you have been pidgeon-holed down clear-cut, simplified endings. The game refrains from judging the player's morality in a refreshing way, staying true to a core tenet of Fallout: morality is a flexible thing that can mean many things in the Wasteland.I cannot stress enough that this is a game totally unafraid to bar you from embarking on certain quests as a result of your actions, and I must insist that if you play it, you fully embrace it. It's not about seeing it all, it's about the tailored story unique to your character that came about by reacting intelligently to how you played, and letting the chips fall where they may. In my most recent playthrough I played as an Enclave fanatic, and this roleplaying decision governed all of my choices - what weaponry and armour I wore, how I interacted with others, the factions I chose to support and attack. It couldn't have been a more different playthrough than my first, where I decided to be chummy with the New California Republic. It is hard to describe the satisfaction to be had when a game reacts so capably to your decision-making. Few games have done it as well as here.Companions are memorable and have side-quests which open up their characterisation and make you feel attached. Locations are iconic, ranging from the debauched New Vegas Strip to the sun-baked settlements that surround it.The DLC is, frankly, unmissable, chronicling an excellent story thread which is interwoven in each piece of DLC despite them at first glance appearing to be thematically unrelated. It's important to play them in order of release for the full effect.Fallout 3 was an amazing RPG, but New Vegas reminded me why exactly I had loved Fallout so much in the first place. Closer to Fallout 1 and 2 in tone and RPG design, New Vegas leaves huge boots to fill for Bethesda's Fallout 4. New Vegas honestly remains one of the best games of its generation.			"

												I know the Fallout series from the promotions of fallout 4 when it was announced. It is a great game. As a fan of FPS games, I can't deny the fun of fallout 4. Until I bought and play Fallout: New Vegas (FO:NV), I start to realise what an RPG should be like. It would not be exaggerated to say that this game is the best among Fallout 3, NV and 4.The GoodsBeing a real RPGIn the game, when you talk to someone else, there are usually at least 3 dialogue options to be chosen. DIfferent dialogue can lead to different ending of that mission or even brings good/bad impression to the ppl in that area. In contrast, the dialogue options in fallout 4 is limited to 4 only. In some situation, different dialogue options will lead to the same consequences. Fallout 4 has been focusing on FPS too much and forgotten the RPG part. FO:NV has shows what a good RPG should be like --- the player can immerse in playing as the protagonist.Attention to detailAs mentioned before, what the player has done can affect the reputation of him/her in a town/settlement. For example, if the player has completed a lot of side quests assigned by the residents in the settlement, residents there will be more polite to the player and may even offer discount to the player when he/she purchase stuffs there. If a player wears a certain cloths in a certain place. NPC may recognise him/her as a companion/enemy and stops shooting/start shooting the player. These attention to detail warn players to be cautious when making a decision in the game and immerse into the game. Similar to fallout 3, player can choose a skills when level up and unlock unique dialogue options in certain circumstances. This makes the conversation goes smoother or deeper. Player can also explore the history of some special characters or some places by talking to the residents there. Those details in the game makes the game a lot more immersive than the fallout 4.Fabulous storylineI don't want to spoil the story too much... The game offers a wide variety of options for player to choose so that the story is driven by the options made by the player. (A little tip: Upgrade Speech first as it will be beneficial when the story progresses)The BadsPoor optimization to newer Operating SystemIt happens with fallout 3 too. Bethesda Softworks simply doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game running on newer operating system. To even start the game properly, player needs to search for fixes on the community forum. I run the game with the fixes found on the Internet and the game will still crash periodically. Such a great game is sort of ""abandoned"" by the developer. In contrast, I can still run Half Life 1 on my WIndows 10 PC smoothly without needing to fix the game by myself. I don't think it is that hard to make the game run on newer OS smoothly. Bethesda Softworks, please fix this.Minor flawsThe abbreviation of certain ammo does not have any full name with it and sometimes may cause some confusion to the player. It may be a good idea to display the full form of the abbreviation when player select the items. Also, some bugs are presented in this game. I get stucked behind the wall and can't get out sometimes. It is really frustrating.Overall ImpressionThis is a fabulous game if you can patch the game yourself and tolerate the bugs on that game. I really hope the developer can publish an update to the game so that player can run the game flawlessly on newer OS. This would really make this an undeniable masterpiece.			"

												I remember waiting anxiously for Fallout: 3 to finally arrive. I had played and loved Fallout and Fallout 2. I had waited for  years, and could barely contain my excitement for a modern Fallout title to be released. I have no shame admitting that I enjoyed playing the game immensely. However, I always felt that it just had the Fallout name slapped onto a post-apocalyptic RPG, with a few Fallout-esque elements thrown in to loosely tie it to the previous titles. While the post-apocalyptic atmosphere of the DC ruins was incredible, It didn't follow in the intellectual footsteps of the previous games in the Fallout lineage, nor did it maintain the same feel. When Fallout: New Vegas arrived, I was completely blown away. It exceeded my expectations in every way. The setting in the American Southwest maintained the atmosphere of the original titles.  The faction system allowed for alliances to be forged within the Mojave Wasteland, but like the real world, denied you the possibility of making everyone happy. While I believe there was a mistake in maintaining the clunky Karma system of FO:3, I felt your choices within the game were more morally grey, more reflective of the world wherein there are actions and consequences rather than an arbitrary definition of good and evil. The major NPCs have excellent dialog and some of the most compelling back stories in gaming. The base game is good in and of itself, but the DLC add dimensions that are unparalleled in any of the previous Fallout games and the modding community has produced many excellent add-ons which enhance the gameplay and appearance far beyond the vanilla offering. I have devoted more hours to this game than any rational adult should. It is by far my favorite game of all time.			"

												Have you ever been a long-time fan of something, gotten really excited when you heard it was coming back, only to be massively disappointed with the result? Fallout 3 had this effect on many fans of the Fallout series, myself included. Thankfully Fallout: New Vegas was developed under Obsidian Entertainment, a smaller company known mainly for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II. The project leader was Joshua Sawyer, the same person in charge of the original Fallout 3 that was cancelled after financial troubles with the developer’s parent company. Fallout: New Vegas serves as a “return to form” for the Fallout series, bring it back to its roots in exploring the ethics of a post-apocalyptic world, not exploring the world itself.Returning to Western USA, New Vegas is set in the Mojave Wasteland, directly adapted from the real world Mojave desert. Being a western the art direction of the game has changed from Fallout 3 but it should look familiar. The horrible green tint has been replaced by a much more subtle (yet still a bit annoying) orange tint, Buildings a much more suited to the environment (with much more varied interiors) and a good portion of the game world is actual desert. Despite being set on a desert, the sheer amount of content in New Vegas is densely packed in a logically designed world that is easy to navigate without a map, thanks to cleverly located landmarks. Gone are the days of trying to distinguish between this pile and rubble and that pile of rubble. The Mojave also features a number of areas that are very dangerous to lower level players, while level scaling does exist, it only ensures that enemies aren’t just cannon fodder at later levels.Moving from Fallout 3 to New Vegas won’t feel too different gameplay wise. While the two are very similar, New Vegas is improved in every way. Iron sights have been added to make first person shooting a viable tactic, VATS has been reworked to be less unfair for enemies, Guns skill no longer increases bullet damage, etc. Character creation has had a few smaller changes but the ways your point allocation works in the world has been greatly improved. Perks are only gained once per two levels making you still human by level 30. Traits make a welcome comeback from Fallout and Fallout 2 where you can choose a nice little perk but at the cost of something else. Fallout: New Vegas allows great flexibility in what kind of character you want to play as, and all character build are perfectly viable. Want to be a gunslinger who kills and instils fear in all who oppose him? Go Ahead. Want to be a pacifist? Using your words to solve issues? Sure, New Vegas allows you to. Being able to shape the game, rather than just play it, is what makes Fallout: New Vegas stand out among modern RPGs. It’s surprising how not many Role Playing Games actually let you Role Play. While at launch the game was buggy beyond being playable, the game has been shaped by developers post launch to be the most stable Gamebryo game in existence, not a hard title to achieve but a good one nonetheless.You play as “The Courier” and while delivering a small package to the New Vegas Strip, you are ambushed and end up in a shallow grave. Miraculously you survive the encounter and begin your quest to retrieve the mysterious package. A common misconception with Act I of the story is that it's just a western tale of revenge. The reality is that the story is about the package you were meant to deliver and using it to determine the fate of the Mojave Wasteland and its inhabitants.The two main factions, the New California Republic and Caesar’s Legion are battling for control of Hoover dam and the conflict between the two is apparent throughout the whole game, and by the time you finish Act I you should be near a decision on who you want to side with, or if you want to side with one of them at all. Unlike Fallout 3, New Vegas is not a simple tale of White Knights vs Evil Moustache twirling cartoon characters and many of the game’s decisions are morally ambiguous as opposed to black and white choices. Because the game predominantly features factions with unique motives, it makes sense to reintroduce the Faction Reputation System, as opposed to relying on a heavily flawed Karma System. Players can complete quests in a variety of different ways, and in favour of different people. Whether it be through distribution of electricity, or destroying the NCRs monorail; the variety of ways to play the game makes it unrivalled in terms of replayability.Interacting with the seemingly infinite number of NPCs is a joy. Dialogue is excellently written and everyone has lots to say. The Skill checks the feature are well varied in the skills they use and expertly written to be believable. “Your predisposition towards anger suggests unresolved issues in your past” sounds like a credible thing someone trained in Medicine would say. While the number of voice actors is only a small improvement over Fallout 3, the quality of the voice acting is a massive improvement, characters personalities are greatly enhanced by the brilliant voice work done. Facial animation still leaves a lot to be desired but it’s still an improvement. Because Obsidian Entertainment consists of many ex-Black Isle employees, including the series creator Tim Cain, New Vegas is very faithful to the canon established by the first two games. The game also plays a lot like a first person version of the old-school RPGs. A lot of NPC interaction is involved making the game more about interacting with the world than exploring it.Fallout: New Vegas does well to capture the atmosphere of Fallout, a world rebuilding after a nuclear holocaust. Adding to this is the soundtrack, which is largely comprised of the atmospheric music from the first two games. While it’s disappointing that very little new score was composed for New Vegas, it’s still infinitely better than the action movie soundtrack of Fallout 3. Radio stations make a return and play music appropriate for the retro future setting. Though this time with radio hosts that actually make sense in the world of Fallout.If you enjoy RPG experiences with deep lore, plenty of replayability then Fallout: New Vegas is for you. If you just want a simple minded shoot and loot then it may not be for you, but I still highly recommend it. It does a fantastic job of bringing Fallout back to being… Fallout.			"

												Amazing game. Of the 55 hours of playing it I spent maybe 20 hours on actual story missions. The rest was spent doing sidequests, some more sidequests and finally some more sidequests. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.Seriously, if you get easily distracted then this is the game for you. The game is so ♥♥♥♥ing addictive. I played it for 13 hours the day I bought it. When you start you can't stop. The story is amazing, the characters are great and the gameplay is good.That said, I didn't think the game was that immersive. The game is full of bugs, NPC's act like robots with loose wires. They're always running into walls, getting stuck in animations et cetera. Oh, and above all, CRASHES. At the start is wasn't that bad. I had maybe 2 crashes in the first 13 hours I played it. But especially near the end the game was crashing like crazy. Every time I booted up the game I crossed my fingers, because there's a chance the game will crash so hard you will need to reboot our PC. At one point I lost more than 5 hours of progress because the game flipped a coin and decided 3 of my save files didn't exist anymore. This is what made me take a break from the game for about 15 months. If you get past that however, the game really shines, especially the story. The premise is amazing and the way the different factions interact with eachother is really well done. You really get a sense that you're in the middle of a living, breathing community. This is probably the reason this game is so addictive. That and the fact that the missions are extremely varied. One moment you're a bouncer for a lasergun store, and the next moment you're helping radiation zombies develope a space program. The dialogue is really well done as well, with loads of funny lines and loads of interesting choices to make. During the entire game I listened to Radio New Vegas, which is an awesome station although several 50's country songs are now forever etched into my soul.To conclude: An amazingly solid game, even though it does has some technical issues. Definitely recommended.9/10			"

												While some say its really buggy I didn't have that problem, since there are several readily available mods (posted in a sticky on the steam forums) that fix most of this game's problems. I played the previous 3 fallout games and enjoyed all of them, but this is my favorite so far.Its an enjoyable Open World quest based RPG game that let's you do *almost* anything. And then you find out that the Legion are slavers that crucify people for fun and you realize that you only have one choice. Which is killing every living thing in the wasteland to prevent the Legion from having the pleasure, of course.			"

												IMO this game has to be the best game that was released in 2010. Like all other games from Bethesda's side this was also a major success. The story is good about the Courier. 10/10 with DLC, worth the cash for Ultimate Edition.Since Fallout 4 is newer I can't compare them since the graphics have been upgraded.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition is a good RPG with an interesting setting and a lot of content. That said it also has a lot of quest related bugs that make it seem to be not very thoroughly tested. There are a lot of locations to explore and factions to discover. You can choose your way of playing the game after you develop some skills pretty freely and it never loses that ""choose your way"" feeling. The DLC that tie in along the way are mixed. Dead Money and Lonesome Road feel like filler material while Honest Hearts let's you explore a totally different area and Old World Blues is just a must play. The main story isn't fully engaging, but it offers enough choices to be interesting for a couple of play-throughs.Sadly the game crashes a lot and feels a bit under-tested which takes away from the overall experience. Otherwise I'd fully recommend the trip to New Vegas!			"

												This review. Like my Fallout 3 review will be long.For my Fallout 3 review go here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaoticmayhem/recommended/22300Fallout New Vegas still stands as one of the greatest games ever to be enjoyed not only as a Fallout fan but an RPG fan as a whole.The game brings together combined elements from Fallout 1, Fallout 2, and Fallout 3. While adding a few things of it's own here and there to make the game even more exciting. To top it off this game presents Hardcore mode, which basically turns Fallout New Vegas into an (almost) realstic game.Combat- Combat has seriously improved since Fallout 3. The combat in this game instead of a straight forward shooting up your enemies with VATS with a few grenades here and a rocket launcher here, and a lazer gun here and last aid of your companions or the other faction that is fighting your potential killer, you will have to rely mostly on 'special ammo' for example, if you are attacked by a deathclaw the only way to kill it or bring down it's 'defeneses' (the name will have a shield icon right next to it) is by using armor-piercing rounds. Music- The music of this game is both combination of western and Vegas style. You will need music mods to make that list grow even larger. But in the end it doesn't really matter because both music pieces presented in Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas are great either way.Quests- There is a barrage of quests, not only from the modding standpoint, but also DLC and the game overall. You will spend a lot more hours with these quests as the same amount of hours you do with Fallout 3, and the other Fallout titlesCompanions- Companions are no longer ""Lydia's with guns"" They are actually smarter and with the aid of the companion wheel it makes life SO MUCH easier when talking to your companion for him, her, or it to move back, go non-agressive, wait, trade equipment, and maintain distance. Bewarn, if you play the game in 'hardcore' mode, your companions will still be smarter, but they will end up dying and staying dead till you reload your save or you restart the game after you finish it. There are also companion centered quests, Which by the way some are fun, but others are just boring and tedious to do.World/ Exploration- Unlike Fallout 3, where it really shows the post apocalyptic side to the world. Fallout New Vegas really doesn't have the gritty atomosphere sadly, It is more of a homage to movies like Mad Max (1979) and the Book of Eli with Denzel Washington (2010). All desert, a few settlements here and there. Hostile areas here and there with random events. You only have the New Vegas area as the ""DC ruins"" of this game but unlike D.C ruins of this game, it is populated. Also the game map itself is huge.RPG- The RPG elements in this game are heavily seen, for example, ""Faction armor"" depending upon what faction armor you wear, the other side, and the neutral party might be offensive or hostile to what you wear. The choices you make in game, also shape how the faction looks at you. Leveling up is much different from previous games. It goes on an odd or even level of leveling up, so install mods to fix this little issue and make it more like Fallout 3's leveling up system. Lastly the perks within the game that you obtain either through challenges or leveling up really make a difference so choose wiselyDLC- The DLC within the game are extremely well done. If you want to put your skills to the test, play Dead Money. If you want to play a DLC that touchers your inner nerd, play Old World Blues. If you want something more faction oriented and exploration play Honest Hearts. And lastly if you want all three combinations (except the inner nerd part) But offer a much more bigger challenge, play Lonesome Road. There are also 'player add-ons' that gives you basically starting gear.Voice Acting- Fallout New Vegas not only has a huge celebrity cast, but also the voice acting for the different NPCs ranges differently so from settlement to settlement don't expect about every odd or even number of NPCs to sound the same.The Modding Community- The modding community has been ever helpful to make this game not only challenging, but more prettier and much more longer, also of course the usual mods (weapons, armor, companions, etc.). *MASSIVE Spoiler Alert* Because unlike in Fallout 3 where you can free roam after Broken Steel DLC, all DLC takes place BEFORE the final battle at Hoover Dam. So make sure you really take your time with this game, because there is no going back when the final quest begins.Conclusion: Like in my Fallout 3 review, Fallout New Vegas has things that Fallout 3 should've had, but again Fallout 3 had things that Fallout New Vegas should've had as well. But regardless of that, it is really an enjoyable game to play and this game is a definite recommendation			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is the single best video game to ever be released, with no other game even coming close. The story is great, and for the time, so were the mechanics. You actually had real choice, unlike gay♥♥♥♥♥Fallout 3 and Fallout 4. There were real RPG elements, relation to the original games, and a western theme. In fact, New Vegas is so good that Bethesda refuses to recognize it because they know that Obsidian is better at making Fallout than them. Companions actually make sense in New Vegas. You have to do a quest in order to get them to like you, unlike Fallout 4 where you could pick 50 locks and then ♥♥♥♥ Piper. The endings were all different, unlike Fallout 4 where there are three reskins of the same ending, and then an Institute ending. Also, in New Vegas you can be ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. You can sell Arcade Gannon to Caesar, give Veronica to the White Gloves, you can burn Doc Mitchell to death, and take over the whole Mojave with Father Elijah. Speaking of Dead Money, it is the best DLC for a game to ever come out, only rivaled by Old World Blues. And if you don't like Dead Money or get a mod to make it easier, you're a ♥♥♥♥♥. Speaking of mods, New Vegas has the best. Someguy2000's mods alone are better than anything the entire dumbass Bethesda team could come up with. In New Vegas, there is a sense of progression in the map as you go south and around to Vegas. It makes the game feel structured, increasingly challenging, and increasingly rewarding. Again, unlike Fallouts 3 and 4 where you can go wherever the ♥♥♥♥ you want right after leaving the Vault. The vaults in those games had basically the same ♥♥♥♥ing number too. God Bethesda is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You can play New Vegas however you want. You can play the whole game like a ♥♥♥♥♥ and never kill anyone, a feature Bethesda promised for Fallout 4 but didn't deliver on. You can also play the whole game without dying or even healing at all. There are so many choices within each endgame faction that you have to replay each faction multiple times to try out all the possible endings (except for the NCR, they're too gay to play more than once). Oh and even the raiders have more character in New Vegas. They fall into gangs with history and lore. In Fallout 4, they are just raiders. Nothing else. Mindless fodder to shoot. The enemy placement throughout the Mojave is explained and just makes sense. Now I do rip on Fallout 3 and 4 a lot, they aren't bad games. In fact, they are pretty good. Just they are not RPG's. They are open world action games. All in all, Bethesda needs to liscence another Obsidian Fallout game if they want to save their cucked company.			"

												this game is everything fallout 4 should have been and it is 6 years older.pros:-its actually an rpg unlike fallout 4-quests have multiple solutions and are very different from each over, unlike fallout 4 which is mostly ""go here, shoot this, oh another stupid settlement needs our help-factions are really interesting and play a big role in the narrative-story is great, with different paths to choose-mod support for this game is amazing-actions will effect the ending-has lots of replayability -great dlc (honest hearts has a good story but is too short),-skill system -perks are fun and change the game.cons:-gunplay is not great-grahpics are a bit dated but can be fixed by lots of the mods on the nexus-because Bethesda rushed Obsidian in development so the Legion was not fully fleshed out but this can be fixed by the legion expanaded modin conclusion its a great price for the amont of content			"

												 Fallout: New Vegas, is possibly one of the most successful video games published to the Steam Community. Not only becuase of its sense of real life war, conflict of nature, and real grasp of a post apocalyptic world, but also becuase it allows to feel yourself as you might in the real world. An example of such is how it allows you create your own character, with your own tastes in style, color, and even gender.  It also gives you the feeling of bonding with other NPC's as they as well have a design, much like one you would find in the real world itself. Another very popular and inspiring thing for this game, is its open world enviroment. You can do what you want, go where you want, take who's side you want, and say what you want. Along with a more then wide variety of armor, weaponry, and most anything else you can think of, to choose and select from. And if that isn't enough to satisfy your tastes, you also have the ability to install mods, to perk up the enviroment, change many differant aspects of the game, the people, places, and things you interact with, and even yourself. Though this is a spin-off from the Fallout games, 1 2 and 3, this world still allows you to imerge in a whole differant world that you would likely never find in any other game. And if you're the type who is up for a challenge, you can even use a feature, known as ""Hard Core Mode"", where hunger, thirst, sleep, and radiation, will be allowed to play roles in your gameplay experience. All in all, this game is a excellent piece of art made by the game industry, and I would highly recommend buying this game, if you are the type of gamer who like post apocalyptic, open worlds, as well as a throw-back to what seems to be as far back as the late 1950's, yet mixed with a futuristic element at the same time. I would with no doubt support this game, and encourage the Community to give it a shot. Game on, Fallout Universe!			"

												Just thought I'd share an old preview of the game that I did when it was first showcased at PAX.  Fallout: New Vegas lived up to every anticipation, and is truly an excellent game worthy of the series.______________________________________________________________I just returned from my first PAX, where I managed to get a good look at the upcoming Fallout game: Fallout New Vegas.The Bethesda booth had demos on the X-Box, only allowed you to play for a (theoretically) 15-minute interval, using a demo savepoint, and had lines at least 45 minutes long -- all of which gives you a very limited look into the game. But fortunately, I discovered that the Nvidia booth had a Fallout 3 demo for the PC, often with no lines and a gameplay duration limited only by your conscience. As such, I was able to get in several hours of play in the new game.That said, I avoided most anything that would spoil the plot for me, as well as avoided major areas like The Strip. Instead, I focused on learning what I could about changes to gameplay, and I'm writing to share those with you.What I've learned:(If you've been looking forward to this game, some of these things you will probably already know from other reviews and spoilers.)Fallout New Vegas uses the same engine and basic gameplay as Fallout 3, but incorporates a lot of things from Fallout 1 & 2 that Fallout 3 dispensed of, and includes a lot of game tweaks previously only available in mods.Visually, the game is beautiful. The green haze is gone, giving us a bright blue sky and a lush desert landscape which is heavy on oranges and browns.Traits are back. Traits are special perks, available only at the beginning, which either modify the game a little or which give you a benefit at the cost of a drawback. You can pick two traits for your character. (One trait, Wild Wasteland, ""adds additional 'wacky' content and modifies existing content and special encounters"" that makes connections to the bizarre encounters you could have in the first Fallout games.)Skills have been mildly revamped. ""Small Guns"" and ""Big Guns"" are now just ""Guns"". Plus, they have added in the ""Survival"" skill. (More on it later.)A lot of the perks from the older games are apparently back. In addition, opposite-sex perks (like Black Widow) now have same-sex equivalents.Food items now give you health slowly over time rather than in a single lump sum. With sufficient Survival skill, you can activate any campfire you find and cook food (or otherwise combine foodstuffs) to create superior foodstuffs. For example, you can cook gecko meat to create a gecko steak which is much healthier.Similar to the ""recipes"" for food, you have the ability to modify or break down your weapons with a sufficient level of Repair skill -- you can even break down scrap metal into lead. You can add silencers, scopes, etc to certain weapons if you have the parts, the Repair skill, and a workstation.In addition, apparently you can repair items up to 100% regardless of the level of your Repair skill -- higher levels just makes it easier, requiring less items.And, having mentioned gecko meat... yes, geckos are back! In addition to a wider variety of monsters, New Vegas offers more variety within those monsters, including smaller ""young"" versions of the adult critters.As well as basic good-evil karma, you also garner reputation with each settlement and group. On a similar note, stealing from any group (even an evil one) will get you negative karma. This leads to scenarios like the one I encountered below:I sneak up on a camp of Powder Gangers (a gang formed of escaped convicts -- they be evil) and take them out (gaining positive karma for killing the bad guys but negative reputation with the Powder Gangers). I loot their bodies (gaining nothing... except loot, of course). Then I loot their campsite (gaining negative karma for stealing from the Powder Ganger faction).As a fun addition, if you are wearing the outfit of a particular faction, you are disguised as a member of that faction. The initial reactions of people you run into will be based on that disguise. (So, as it turns out, running around in Powder Ganger armor wasn't such a smart idea.)Weapons (at least some of them) have special critical hits. For example, fighting with boxing gloves allowed me to knock an enemy critter out cold.So, overall, I'm even more excited for Fallout: New Vegas than I was before PAX. It looks like this game is going to be excellent!			"

												Absesive!Ok that top line was my review for well over a year. If you knew the series, you got the joke. But in the spirit of an often on sale yet over looked game, I can do one better.Yes folks this is one of  those  ""Games You Absolutely Must Have!""Set in the Fallout world of Post Nuclear America, this time in the Nevada Badlands outside of what is left of Las Vegas. You awake as a courier recovering from a nasty headshot. Think old west mixed with Rat Pack era Vegas, and the fallout dash of mutants, ghouls, tribals, NPR, Brotherhood of Steel, and cowboys. Yes you get a PIP Boy. The Fallout standard navigation device, inventory access, and radio.You have VAT. Fallout's version of action freeze/bullet time.No this one does not have bobble heads. Iit's only bad point in my opinion, though it does make the game more challenging.Look if you enjoy a premium RPG first person shoot/hack/zap... game. I can highly recomend this one. Intense combat. Fun plot. A small but rich open desert world explorer. Nice voice acting as well.  Best of all nowadays highly afordable. If you haven't played this yet, you are truely missing out.			"

												This game is honestly the best modern Fallout title to this day. It fixes almost everything that Bethesda flopped with in the original (DT is better than DR, the locales are pretty believable, dialogue checks are guaranteed with proper skills), and it just feels like what Fallout should have been with the transition. There's no level scaling, so there are some locations that are probably a bit too difficult until you reach a certain level, and it doesn't feel like an empty land to explore. There's vegetation and people trying to go about and make the world seem as if it's trying to repair itself 200+ years after The Great War rather than the DREARY POST APOCALYPTIC WASTELAND THAT STILL SOMEHOW HAD FOOD IN GROCERY STORES. Good character writing, quirky but not too far out there, and factions are well done. Karma system still sucks but is essentially irrelevant.Also, unlike FO3, there are actually 200+ endings in New Vegas. Just play this buggy mess instead of Fallout 3/4, because Bethesda needs to know that they suck at Fallout, and it's a shame that we might not see Obsidian take another jab at it. Remember to consent with Fisto.			"

DIS GAME.Gameplay:I definitely love the gameplay. Roaming around the dry Mojave Desert day & night, slaughtering mutated creatures that were once normal, avoiding other tribes that will ruthlessly steal your damn clothing & supplies, murdering you is in the deal as well. Although V.A.Ts is a bit buggy, Example: You would use it & heaps of enemies would be around the area, it'd take afew minutes to actually lock onto the targets that are head of you. When you click one of the arrows to go right, it may go left, even though there is another enemy towards the right.Weapons:Holy♥♥♥♥♥/i> this game has heaps of weapons, actually reminds me of Borderlands/Borderlands 2, I know I know, this game came first, haha. Definitely your kind of FPS if you enjoy advanced technological weapons or old timey western guns! The concepts & designs are amazing for the futuristic weapons, my personal favorite is the ""Q-35 Matter Modulator"", the name is a cronky one, but how it looks is simply sexy & dangerous!Characters:Very unique character designs & clothing. However, as I stated, I loved the clothing, some of the clothing was completely Overused. I mean, I get it, it'd be pretty expensive to have every single character have different clothing! The ragged & digusting look of the raiders in this game is absolutely amazing! Originality blasting in this game, such as a car tire for a shoulder pad, haha.Voice Acting:Let's be honest, this game had so little voice actors. I didn't really mind it, but it kinda got old after awhile hearing the same voices over & over again! Some of the voice acting could use a little more work, such as the NCR soldiers & how almost every  civilian had the same dialogue.Soundtrack:Coming from a person who absolutely loves retro soundtracks & music, this game has to have my favorite OST! As for the ambience while you're roaming around or in battle, it's pretty intense & may get a bit creepy from time to time. The ambience really depends on your location & state, which is a pretty sexy addition to the game!Story:How I loved the story! It gives it a realistic vibe due to the fact you can literally slaughter important people.(Not that you should...) You have about 3 whole main choices in the game, Neutral, Bad, Good. Neutral being you forget about everyone else & fight for no one excluding a certain robot. Bad being you side with the Legion & plot for Vegas Domination. Good being you side with the NCR, New California Republic, taxes up the♥♥♥♥♥but that's what it will take to get the world back into natural order.Conclusion:Well, all I gotta say is you should really buy this game!

												In this game as a mailman, I helped gain peace between a band of Elvis Presley impersonators, launched a cult of irradiated humans into the Far Beyond, help kill a man for a refined cult to go back into cannibalism, recruit a robot named Fisto for sex, implant a drugged dog's brain into a cyborg one's, fought off dogs with the heads of snakes, killed off a band of power armor wearing guys in a bunker for the post apocalyptic Romans, and decided the fate of the Mojave Desert during a battle for the Hoover Dam all after getting shot in the head. And I'm not even covering the DLCs. In other words, GET THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.			"

												Ok, now that I'm waiting for Fallout 4 to come out, I guess I'm going to go back and visit the Mojave for a while.  The counter above the block where I'm writing this says I've played for 490.9 hours.  I might be willing to concede that such a thing is not necessarily healthy.Nevertheless:  if you consider yourself a gamer, and you haven't played this, you need to snap it up and find out what you've missed.  Some may wail about crashes:  cry me a river.  Save periodically.Yes, you may find some graphical oddities from time to time...but if you want richer stories, or more authentic post-apocalyptic atmosphere, you're probably going to have to wait until the real thing happens.  On the plus side, your wait might not be that long...so there's that.There are an endless supply of mods out there as well, so even after you've played through, you can still revisit and find new things.  Don't like the color of the post-atomic sky?  There's a mod for that.  Want real firearm textures? They got 'em.  Want to own your own casino?  You can fix up the one in Primm.If'n you don't, folks will be saying that 'Clint Eastwood' is the biggest yella-belly in the...whoops...wrong review.What are you still reading this for?  Step to!  And tell Victor I said ""Howdy!""			"

												A great rpg with a steady pace throughout the game. If you want a new generation fallout game that better represents the originals then this is the game, it follows a greater focus on character development and how you interact with the world; appreciating the fact that not everyone cares about pure run and gunning (you can still do that but there is a high chance of death involved). It may be a sudden change from the atmosphere of Fallout 3 now that they have somewhat of a more civilised stable society and its rather reminiscent of the wild west styled games but that only serves to continue the atmospheric development. If you can embrace actual adventure and actually role play then you are in for a treat of post apocalyptic wild west vibe. All I can say is give it a shot and don't try to compare it to Fallout 3. "

												A game of limitless choices, possibilities, and complexity; something an RPG wants to be at its core. Fallout New Vegas is truly an 'epic' experiance, with a whole world of choices and options at the players fingertips, all of which is explorable and playable space. Want to be a space cowboy firing lazors and lever action rifles, sure. Want to be a swat trooper who bashes peoples knees in with a katana, you can easily do that. The game just has a lot of things to do.These choices, compound into its ultimate game strength; the sheer amount of content there is. The game has a massive world, with easily 110+ quests, and probably even more unmarked quests. As well, the vast arsenal of weapons, the variety, and the balencing the game has in regards to these are phenoninal. Any playstyle is viable in this game, and it is an experiance where everyone can flourish. The game is perfecly paced as well, meaning that at no point are you this indestructable God of death, you are fragile, you are not the best, you are mortal. The game teaches you that very well, that you are human, nothing more. You live in this shattered world, dealing with your own human nature; whether it be the mortality, the drugs, sex, disease, or just plain stupidity. But despite the games humanity, it falls into one major trap. That is, the game encourages metagaming at its finest. For instance, to get the best stuff/ending/quests, you need to know how/when to do things. This can be argued in the whole nature of the complex choice system as well, but because of the no turn back attitude of the game, it highly encourages veterans to play the game rather synthetically, rather than let it all flow together as it may. Yes, this does mean replayability, but its not as fun as a purely organic gaming experiance.Despite the main criticisms of the game, and other factors I chose not to mention (for length restraints), the game is not bad. On the contrary, its quite good, very good. Why is it good? Because it emplifies its core concept excellently: Humanity, and what it means to be human. That focus in what its about, makes it a must own.			"

Such as the BoS girl you get at the trading camp, She can't CQC fight at all when her special is that.-Quick save quick save quick save! your game crashs A ton so remeber to quick save, and Quick save files don't get corrupted make you quick save from every 5-15 Minutes!Any who this game is just amazing! I recommend it to all RPG fans, and Apoc fans!Final verdict: 9.5			"

I just recently picked up New Vegas again and god damn, Fallout 4 is nothing to New Vegas. I think this is absolutely the best Fallout game and I hope that the rumours of Obsidian creating a Louisiana spin-off with Fallout 4 engine are true!This is the best RPG format to me. Ally with pretty much anyone or no-one and do it in your own time. My only criticism is that there is no after-game. 10/10			"

												This game has the potential to be so much more. Anyone who has ever visited Nexusmods and seen the library of content created as an addition to New Vegas, can attest to the potential of this game. Bethesda, off the heels of success with Fallout 3, in my opinion rushed New Vegas and released it before it was stable. Non-modded, Vanilla versions of New Vegas with and without DLC, are prone to random crashing. Now, even with that most annoying of pet peeves for all gamers, New Vegas is another post-apocalyptic, immersive sandbox, Taking place in the Mojave wasteland, and with the DLC content, surrounding areas. Instead of playing the intrepid vault dweller, you are a courier for the Mojave Express, who is gunned down. You must uncover the reason behind your attempted murder, find your stolen package, and unravel the mysteries within. The Brotherhood of Steel makes a brief appearance, but does not play the central role of law and order, the way they did in Fallout 3. Now we are introduced to the government and military of The New California Republic, as well as the despotic and sadistic masses known as Caesar's Legion. Fallout New Vegas is a game that must be played with all available DLC, for the full experience. Despite all the flaws, there are hotfixes, such as official game patches and player created Mods, to combat game crashing. If you enjoyed Fallout 3, you will love New Vegas.			"

												Yet another phenomenal addition to the Fallout IP. Fallout: New Vegas touches on many of the original concepts and mechanics of its predecessor but also improved on them. The amount of content in New Vegas and its ability to immerse you into its lore is astounding. How you shape yourself in New Vegas is virtually limitless, almost every choice to be made has several alternate paths that affect your experience greatly. Leveling in New Vegas feels more rewarding and desired than most games, sculpting your skills and traits are perfectly done here. In combat your options are huge, ranging anything from fists to laser rifles to mini-nukes. With the addition of Steam Workshop, your options and the amount of content really do become limitless.Fallout: New Vegas truly peers on top amongst the greatest in the genra. If you are a fan, you won't be disappointed. If you're new here but love immersive open-world RPG's and have an interested for post-apocalyptic scenarios, you're in for quite a ride. 94/100			"

												I was writing a huge review, but I'll summarize it with one of the game's own quotes. While tacky, it perfectly describes my initial approach to the game, and modern videogaming as a whole.""There is an expression in the Wasteland: 'old world blues.' It refers to those so obsessed with the past that they can't see the present, much less the future, for what it is."" New Vegas is as close as you're gonna get to a contemporary update on the 17 year old fallout 2. And would you know it, they even had the decency to update and modernize the crashes, bugs, and glitches, so the new audience wouldn't miss out on such a crucial element of fallout gameplay.A masterful blend of old, new, and yesterday's news, that even in 2015 sees mods, fan content, and updates. More importantly, it's got heart, and while the base game shows some obvious signs of being rushed, the huge DLCs and fan patches take care of that.Above all, the game prioritizes player agency, and not the cute 'kill the guy, spare the guy' kind that's thrown around as a buzzword.Highly recommended.

												This rather divisive entry to the Fallout franchise is, for all real intents and purposes, the true Fallout 3.  If you can get past the general derp of the Gamebryo engine, you'll find one of the most beautifully realized gaming worlds of all time - all fleshed out with a myriad of well written and interesting characters.Only real downsides are the general glitchiness of Gamebryo breaking immersion, and the rather easy/weak combat.

												I really can not recommend this game enough. Easily one of the best RPG's ever made thus far. I may get some hate for this, but in my opinion, Fallout New Vegas has out done Fallout 3 in nearly every regard. The story is pretty great. It can be slow at times, but when you make decisions, they feel like they actually matter. The setting is something many people used to praise Fallout 3 for, including myself, and it is no doubt one of the best game settings ever, but after several play throughs of New Vegas, I feel the Mojave has that extra bit of charm that the DC wasteland didnt have. Some disliked the Mojaves bright skie's and bright City for a post apocalyptic game, but for me it just felt very right. The writing for some of the Side Quests in this game, is truly phenominal, and I hope Obsidian gets another shot at a Fallout game once Fallout 4 is out. Overall Fallout New vegas, and the Fallout franchise as a whole is a master piece, with rich and interesting Lore, great characters, excellent gameplay, and HOURS of replayability. Expect 100+ hours per playthrough, and even then you'll still have not done everything. My playtime on steam for this is only about 128 hours as of 2/14/16, but when I used to play this on console, id say my time on it is around 600+.**EDIT: Having now played Fallout 4 and its overly simplified rpg elements, i've come to appreciate this game even more than when i originally wrote this. Here is a summed up list of the Pro's and Con's of Fallout: New VegasPRO's-Amazing and vast, variety of weapons.-Interesting and Fun characters.-Extensive character customization.-Great leveling system with awesome Perks.-Excellent setting.-Good story, and great variety of story paths and Choice's.-V.A.T.S-The Pip Boy 3 thousand, Enough said.-DLC's add a good amount of content for your character to take back to the Mojave. The way the DLC story lines tie in with the main games narrative is ♥♥♥♥ing excellent, making this games DLC some of the best i've ever played.-Very well optimized for the PC. Runs better on my fairly average computer than it did on my Xbox 360.CON'S-Occasional crashes, not as big a deal as people make it out to be. You should be fine unless your trying to run this on an Etch A Sketch or a Potato.-Sometime's a glitch will interfere with a quest or you might get stuck in a ledge. This is also Very occasional and not a real problem at all.If you dont already own Fallout New Vegas, why are you still reading this, go buy it. NOW!.10/10, Would herd Wind Brahmin Again.			"

												Despite what Hideo Kojima would tell you, war never changes.Fallout New Vegas returns the Fallout series to it's west coast roots, sort of. While little of the action actually takes place in The New California Republic, the state DOES play a heavy role in the title. The player embarks on a quest of mythical proportions starting as a simple courier caught up as a pawn in the affiars of dicatators, emperors, and corrupt senators, and offers satisfaction to any who step into the wastes, in several ways. One can endavor make the post apocalyptic, post divergent hell (as opposed to pre-apocalyptic, pre-divergent hell, or even conteporary hell) a slightly better place through feats of heroism. Alternatively one can take out their aggression at the powers that be by establishing new orders under nefarious leaders of varying degrees of nefariousaritynessnessism (sp?). Or one can simply say ""screw the rules, I have ______"" where ______ is ""money"" or ""all manner of fictional designer drugs and booze"" or ""a collection of exotic guns that would raise Heston from his grave"" or ""300,000 piles of scrap metal, duct tape, a radioactive toy rocket, and some bubble gum!"" The morality system is still in place, and the game can be heavy handed with this, though in addition to ""break stuff steal things, versus fix stuff, save idiots"" are a series of factional based fame meters. Remember how back in high school, you accidentally peed your pants in the cafeteria? Well instead of immediately gaining the same amount of infamy among all the cliques, the art kids, and tweakers thought it was kinda cool, in an ironic way. Same thing goes in FO:NV. Blowing the facial bones out of a random scumbag with a kids BB gun, maxed skills, and the ""Bloody Mess"" perk may toque off half the factions, but it may just earn your a little bit of positive feedback from other groups - maybe that guy pooped in their Sugar Bombs. Added to this iteration of Fallout is also increased crafting as a mechanic. One can skill up abilities in making medical and food aid items, which come in handy if one plays the real game (hardcore mode) and not just ""Cousin Timmy's, I'm Too Frail to do Even Live Hard in a Simulated Reality Weekend Adventure"" (regular mode). Hardcore mode requires the player to consume food and water, as well as sleep regularly or risk stat debuffs or even death. And healing items take longer too work, along with stat buff items risking negative side effects like addiction, far more frequently than in Cousin Timmy's experience. All said, FO:NV is what Fallout Fans were hoping for from FO3, Fallout franchise based setting, more guns, more items, huge map, hours of gameplay and sidequests, but still with all the bugs one can expect from Bugthesda, though you shouldn't complain - If you're reading this, you're in the PC mustard race, and therefore console is always a tilde away, and through tilde, all problems can be solved. Some may not enjoy single player only, but this is the apocalypse. All your friends are dead. JK, you never had any friends, that's what the charming classical radio tracks are for.. All in all, one of my personal favorite.Final score: 875/1000 RadsProtip: Generally speaking, honest heats will tell you the DLC was lackluster, however, while it was a lonesome road to get to this point, for the current going price, I'd say all are worth the dead money. I'd have something clever to say about Old World Blues, too, but out of all the DLC it was the only one worth the initial cost, as it was clever enough on it's own, and is this reviewer's personal pick.

												The current game in the Fallout Franchise, New Vegas awaits, to entertain, to corrupt, or just to provide you with those home comforts, like that 12gauge you just never get tired of pumpin'. Gun firing a bit crap? Go upgrade it at the Gun shop by trading all that crap you found lying around, for that shiny new recoil compensator for your 5.56mm Marksman Carbine!! This game is an excellent RPG/shooter hybrid. I personally love the V.A.T.S combat system, allowing you to momentarily step out of real time to select those body parts that you think will look better being severed from that body, you don't know why, but you just wanna see the guy's head explode ha ha ha! Hrm...who's that over there, hey! It's a companion, make friends, get them to carry all your stuff, on first name terms already? Great, Why not give them a gun and some ammo too and you can double team those mutated Wasteland horrors like they were the best days of your life! (well they were for me mmkay..)  Choose wisely on the course of action to take when encountering strangers, or just  generally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the army. Not sure about that creepy looking character you met in that strange bunker? Hrm...do his bidding? Or betray him, up to you! Run off with the loot or give it to the homeless people for street cred, the reputation is yours for the making as everyone you interact with has the potential to aid you, or slow you down (cos you spent waaay too much time zooming in on her ti-♥♥♥♥♥♥.) After over 200 hours of playing this game, I'm lightyears away from getting bored of this Titan, I aint never growing up !!! 8/10. There's room for improvment..but that's what sequels are for, fool! Load up and get your kit, it's gonna be a long walk and your gonna need to get your game on out in the Wasteland..some of the critters out there just get real mad if you shoot them! Good luck! Oh..and try not to die!			"

												I recently played a game titled, Fallout: New Vegas, it was developed by Obsidian Studios, which many of the company’s members happen to be former members of Interplay Productions’ Black Isle Studios, the ones who brought you Fallout 1, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, and Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel. The game was published by Bethesda Softworks, the Makers of Fallout 3, as well as one of my other favorite game series, The Elder Scrolls.The game takes place in The Mojave Wasteland, which is the Post Apocalyptic version of the areas of Nevada, California, and Arizona. The game follows a The Courier who has a package delivery go wrong, as you find out at the very start of the game. This is one of the few games that I recommend watching the intro all the way through on, as the intro is very well done, in fact I enjoyed watching it my first playthrough, and then after I had played the game through several times, after which I noticed many different things that you would only notice after having played the game in depth. The game is played in 1st/3rd person perspective, and the player interacts with the world and with items using a GUI called a Pipboy 3000, which can be upgraded to the Pimpboy 3 Billion (Which is a gold plated version of the Pipboy 3000.) after completing a certain quest. The game has a nicely done crafting system for creating items for the player to use/sell. You can make items from a few different hotspots, those would be, a fireplace or hot plate, a workbench as well as a repair bench. This game unlike so many of its kind, actually has a nonlinear questline, which basically means you can chose who you would like to side with, as well as how you want to handle a situation in most cases. The games main factions that you can side with during the main questline are Caesar’s Legion, Mr. House, the New California Republic (NCR), and for an independent New Vegas, you can side with a overly friendly and forthcoming robot named Yes Man. Caesar’s Legion is led by no other than Caesar, aka Edward Sallow, Caesar co-founded his legion with a man known as Joshua Graham, whos name is not to be spoken within The Legion without punishment. Mr. House or Robert House, founder of RobCo Industries, is a man who spent the latter years of his Pre-War life, planning for how to keep himself alive indefinitely, and protect the Vegas Strip from nuclear attacks.The New California Republic is a fairly large democratic federation that is the absolute enemy of Caesar’s Legion.The music choices in Fallout: New Vegas are fantastic, it perfectly fits in with the early 1900’s feel of the game and while a few may disagree the music itself is very good, with selections of the greats of the 1940s and 1950s with genres including classical and jazz. I feel like this revived a great period of time for music, so that new generations could enjoy it for themselves. This game is amazing and I would recommend it as a must play for gamers everywhere.

												Fallout: New Vegas is the next entry to the critically acclaimed Fallout series. Taking place 3 years after Fallout 3, you find yourself tied up, and being shot in the head by Chandler Bing. New Vegas was made and produced by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda, unlike Fallout 3 which was produced and published by only Bethesda. Fallout: New Vegas has some improved gameplay elements from Fallout 3, like the ability to aim down sights, a new reputation system, and a better companion menu. The story is well written, with a lot of star power voicing the characters, and a story that has 3 or 4 branching endings. Like the game that came before it, it is also an open world game.PROS+ Improved Gameplay elements from Fallout 3+ Open world, with many more quests than the previous entry+ More weapons and enemies+ Great voice acting+ Returns to Fallout's dark sense of humour that Fallout 3 more or less lacked+ Includes a ""Wild Wasteland"" perk that adds tons of easter eggs, and is in my opinion, the only perk worth getting at the start+ Large map with many interesting cities+ Big city near the top of the map, New Vegas, that includes casinos, and hotels. New Vegas also has a ghetto north of the city, that has more than a few quests to enjoy+ A new reputation system that effects how factions (and their enemies/allies) will treat you+ Great radio soundtrack+ Amazingly written, interconnected DLC storylines+ Amazing DLC environmentsCONS- Sparse towns make the map seem too big at times, and can be a pain to walk around- Very little change in landscape- Radio soundtrack can be very repetitive- Companions can be hard to locate, and are sometimes overlooked. - Main quest is very short, and can take only about 4 hours to complete- Armor can be hard to find and acquire without the Courier's Stash DLC- A few bugs and problems here and there.Overall, a great game with a story that (in my opinion) is better that the one of Fallout 3. Buy the Ultimate Edition when it's on sale.9.5/10			"

												This game is a game that if described as ""Skyrim with guns"" could not justifiy it. this game is a masterpiece, with well-executed combat, a huge and expansive lore, great creature diveristy, and always feels challenging no amtter what. the levelling system is well made, and well created - a great and smart way to do things in the Mojave. everything in this game feels right, and the DLC? oh my god, there are few things that fit this game so well as the DLC. its 16 quid in total. but it's all worth it.  the world is open, and not ONE character is unkillable. this is truly a free game, the definition of a sandbox in some ways. it is my second favorite RPG, my first favorite gun game and easily my number one least suspected like of all gamingtry it, you'll love itCOMPLETIONISTS NOTE: this game isnt hard to complete, and at no point will you feel like the game is unfair (except Deathclaws...)

												This game is one word, ""amazing"". I purchased it on Xbox on release day then on PC in summer 2013. This game gives you so many choices to choose from, you pretty much have four storylines to go with. There are tons of quests in the game that are actually really fun to complete, I liked them a lot more than in Fallout 3. The storyline is amazing, something I felt lacked in Fallout 3, New Vegas really makes you feel like you have a goal to accomplish. The combat system is highly improved from Fallout 3. The only thing I criticize the game about is the empty spaces, there are a lot of them but then again it is a desert after all. This is one of my favorite games of all time, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get into the Fallout series. I give the game a 9/10.			"

												Frankly, I'm astounded by how good New Vegas is. It brought back the true Fallout feel, especially the clever and witty humor. On top of that, it completely overhauled everything that Fallout 3 had, producing mechanics that actually work rather well, a world that gives you incentive to explore and reward for doing it, a great deal of solid difficulty, much improved combat, and a TON more role-playing ability. The only problems are that the story is somewhat weak and it has a MASSIVE amount of technical issues. Still, this is what Fallout 3 should have been.			"

												The best Fallout game, period. It has a great storyline that makes you consider your actions and question them afterwards, factions that behave realistically and have fleshed-out backgrounds, great gunplay with tons of unique weapons and it's perfectly challenging-- you die just enough so that progress feels like a real victory but not enough to make the game frustrating. On top of this, every single DLC is top quality and the game has an amazing, active modding community. I beat the game twice already and I keep coming back years later. Fallout New Vegas is one of the best games I've ever played, hands down.			"

												Personal Rating: Not a bad game - I expected moreClassic Rating: ★★★☆☆New Vegas doesn't add too much to what we saw in Fallout 3, in my opinion: there are companions, enhanced crafting (which is pretty useless anyway), maybe more weapons and mods but it's the same old game - I can't tell one true change in game play or UI.Main story falls short in comparison to FO3: NV it's mostly made of side quests - some of which very interesting, I have to admit - but all the Courier's story starts and ends in a flutter (not going to spoil).● I loved FO3 dark setting, I liked New Vegas.● I loved FO3 story, I liked New Vegas.● I had some crashes in FO3, I had many more in New Vegas.● I don't remember any particular bug in FO3, I found a lot in New Vegas - from mid game to end I had to open the wiki almost every time I played.● I had to fast travel very often in NV because of silly quest while I spent more time actually playing in FO3.● Factions implementation is not good in New Vegas, in my opinion: if you don't pay attention to what armor you wear, your playthrough can get f****d up.As you can see, there's a lot of things I didn't like, BUT I cannot say New Vegas is a bad game; I can just tell to whoever is still doubtful about choosing Fallout 3 or New Vegas, go with the former, you won't be disappointed.

												I used to think no game could come close to how good Fallout 3 was but all my friends would say to me ""You bought Fallout: New Vegas collector's edition on launch day! Why haven't you played it yet?! It's so much better than Fallout 3"" and how right they are.Fallout: New Vegas is a First-Person Shooter / Role-Playing Game / Survival Horror game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and is set in a post-apocalyptic western United States, an area largely untouched by the events of the great nuclear war of 2077. You are a Courier, delivering messages around the wasteland and have been assigned to deliver a package containing something very special. Unfortunately, you are captured, package stolen, and left for dead in the wasteland. What happens next will eventually determine the fate of the thousands inhabiting the Mojave desert for years to come.The huge open-world of Fallout: New Vegas is well constructed and very atmospheric. I found however, that it feels slightly less interesting than Fallout 3. In Fallout 3 you would worry all the time about what is around the next corner. In New Vegas, the landscape, at first, looks fairly flat and uninteresting. Is this a fault of the game or is it to be praised for being authentic to the area in which it is set? I have friends that have visited Las Vegas and they tell me ""Yes, the area around Las Vegas is pretty much how it looks in the game"".Which ever way you look at it, you'll get lost in the atmosphere in no time. The ambience and music gives the game a great western vibe as well at the nicely crafted musical score (which also includes tracks from Fallout 1 and 2 for added nostalgia)The world is also not immediately open to the player. Going North is pure suicide early on in the game so the player is encouraged to explore the south before venturing north. By closing off certain areas to the player early on, I found that it really helps to emphasize just how much of a dangerous place the Mojave wasteland really is and it increased my wanting to explore those areas later once I got some better gear.The plot in Fallout: New Vegas however is a lot more open and is better written than Fallout 3. Right up until the very end of the game, you have total freedom to choose your own path in the world. The story also doesn't take itself as seriously as Fallout 3 does; the characters you meet, situations you are put in and overall tone of the game is lighter, funnier and doesn't centre around one specific key character. You have a world, an event is happening in that world, get going and help shape what happens!The game mechanics are deep, very very deep. There are almost System Shock 2 levels of complexity in this game; It keeps pretty much all of Fallout 3's FPS/RPG elements and statistical goodness everyone has come to expect from a Fallout game but also re-introduces mechanics from Fallout 1 and 2 back into the mix. Damage Threshold and Damage Resistance are back and really well implemented into the combat. I learnt pretty quickly that it is futile to chip away at a creature's thick hide or somebody's metal armour with a 9mm pistol, you're going to need the right gun for the right situation which means thinking on your feet. Guns can also degrade in quality over time and depending on what ammo you use which means keeping your gear in top condition is very important.The game also allows you to create your own food and ammunition. Different types of ammo will require different components you can get from either de-constructing existing ammo or finding them in the Mojave and will affect different opponents in different ways; Use 12 Gauge, Slug rounds to pierce through Armour or use 12 Gauge, Dragon's Breath rounds to set squishy things on fire!The game introduces an optional 'Hardcore mode' which, amongst other things, requires you to eat, drink and sleep in order to stay alive. Ammunition has weight to it and getting health from Stimpaks occurs over time. It will drastically change the way you think about approaching situations and provide you with a more survival horror type experience.Not only all this but your actions will affect people's opinions of you. Do good things and people in that region, town or faction will like you and will come to your aid in times of need. Do bad things and expect to be hated, shot at and have general abuse hurled at you.I've only scratched the surface of what the game can do here but now it's time to talk about the Downloadable Content that the game contains. There are four packs and they all differ widely in settings and theme but they all tie together cleverly to create one big story to play through:Dead Money DLC - Holy crap this is one atmospheric ride! You are sent to uncover the secrets of the Sierra Madre and I can't say much more as anything else would be a spoiler. This is probably the creepiest DLC out of the four, It's bursting with places to explore and things to find. Anyone who finds that a lot of Fallout: New Vegas feels quite empty and void of small detail in a lot of places will have nothing to complain about here. Great characters and very nicely paced with amazing atmosphere.Honest Hearts DLC - You are hired to travel with the Happy Trails caravan to Utah's Zion National Park. This is the first of the DLCs to give the player an open world to explore. The world is, once again, very nicely crafted with real attention to detail but unfortunately it suffers from being quite boring story-wise. It's nice to meet characters that aren't your average wasteland survivors though but sadly, most are largely forgettable and the story can go out with either a small pop or a whimper depending on what you want to do.Old World Blues DLC - This is probably the funniest and most bizarre DLC made for New Vegas. It was even nominated for a 'Best DLC' award! This is a real turn around from Honest Hearts; hilarious from start to finish, incredibly well written story and characters, a new huge open area to explore, perfect pacing and the DLC will prove a real challenge for players of all skills. Absolutely worth playing and taking your time with.Lonesome Road DLC - The final DLC and it is something quite special. This is really worth playing if, like me, you disliked the game giving you a character that was both a blank slate and had some kind of past that was a complete mystery. This will definitely fill in some of those blanks and make the Courier more interesting. It's a return to a linear world like Operation Anchorage but it is so full of more interesting places to see and things to do. You will find yourself backtracking to either find all the hidden secrets or opening up new areas but a lot of the time, it's worth doing. There are cool set-pieces (which is a must for this kind of DLC) and what happens to you (and/or others) at the end is amazingly good. A great end to an impressive series of DLC.With all of the praise I've given the game, it has its faults. Bugs mainly. There are a few hanging around and whilst they aren't game-breaking, they can range from floating objects to random crashing to desktop. Another issue depends on your point of view, the game falls into the same trap Fallout 3 fell into by letting the player level up too much and becoming too powerful making most of the RPG elements like speech-checks largely pointless. An RPG isn't an RPG any more when you're good at everything!I'm already planning my next play through of Fallout: New Vegas and after playing it, it makes Fallout 3 a very hard game to go back to. Fallout: New Vegas is just an all-round better game, despite it's small flaws and if you enjoyed Fallout 3, I urge you get your hands on this as soon as possible! Hundreds of hours of enjoyment guaranteed!Recommended Mods:JSawyer and Mission Mojave. Use these to make your game a better RPG and fix over 27,000 in-game bugs.			"

												I have a good 250+ hours worth of play of Fallout:New Vegas, and I have to say that it is one of my favourite games, ever.Obsidian have always been great with RPGs, but as my first experience of the Fallout franchise, this remains to be one of my favourites.I have explored every possible element, looted every corpse, cabinet and dead Brahmin that I could find; there is SO much content, and with 3 DLCs, you have plenty to work with.Some of the voice acting gets a little...groovy within dialogue, corpses fly to the ceiling with V.A.Ts shots, rescuing followers from behind boulders becomes a frequent chore, and if I have to listen to one more run of Johnny Guitar, I may scream...but a solid 10/10 overall from me.In short; if you enjoyed Skyrim, give this a try. For a lover of stories, I would say this still holds a lot of weight despite the new game now launched (just don't expect the graphics to be on-par.)Guns rather than pew-pew magic.			"

												This review was requested by a bunch of my friends!Fallout: New Vegas is Obsidian's attempt at recreating the Fallout games after Bethesda's attempt at Fallout 3 (And I thought they failed at that attempt) but this time, I think Obsidian was successful.The visuals are mediocre at the most, but there are a few times in-game where the graphics look great. The faces for the NPCs and even yourself seem awful. Plus, the big con above the mediocre visuals is that the atmosphere, where Fallout was dark, scary like the previous entries (Yes, even 3) seemed to bright. The enemies didn't seem terrifying thanks and I couldn't fully enjoy a real Fallout experience. The gameplay is smooth, and I enjoy using VATS (The more tactical approach to the gunplay) and people who don't like the full-out shooters that don't require thinking will enjoy it too. However, I can't put that as a con due to Fallout 3 having this too, so why should I? But like I said, the gameplay is smooth. The shooting is simple and the melee too, but the explosives and such can be a bit useless. However, the hardcore survival experience is highly enjoyable and makes up for the useless explosives. The gameplay does not disappoint.The story is pretty solid, and also if I'm not mistaken, Fallout: New Vegas actually holds the record for the most lines of dialogue in the game. Why am I saying that? It's a major pro for some and a major con for others. Because I enjoy strong storylines, it's a pro for me. If you like ""Get to the point"" NPCs, be wary that you won't find that in Fallout. Benny (The checkered suit guy) is a solid villain who legitimately tricks you at one point in the game and is able to smoothtalk you into nearly killing you. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but I can think of only a few antagonists who successfully manipulated the character with ease, Benny among them. The con to the story though is the fact that the game ENDS, meaning you can't play anymore, after you do the main storyline. The story is great, just be wary of the fact that the game ENDS.The audio is very impressive. The voice actors have more personality than your average Call of Duty, Halo, and whatnot. Plus, I enjoyed the songs that played on the radios and just made me think of the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie. Fallout: New Vegas and GotG both have something in common: Despite the fact that it takes place in modern/future time, the primary soundtrack uses songs from the 50's-80's. It's good to see a game like Fallout (3 too) not use your average dubstep/epic orchestral music for a soundtrack. You will definitely enjoy the audio from this game. The sound effects, the voice actors, everything.I'm a one-and-done kind of guy for replayability, this game included. However, I've seen people get hundreds and hundreds of hours in this game. The replayability, much like its cousin (or brother, or sister) Elder Scrolls have high replayability. After you beat the game, you can create another character, and then another character, and another character! The replayability is some of the strongest in the whole series.In the end, Fallout: New Vegas is nowhere near my favorite RPG, but it's still an amazing experience. I didn't really enjoy the experience as others did, but if you get this game, you will probably side with them, so I recommend this game for any RPG fan.Graphics- 4.5/10Gameplay- 8/10Story- 8/10Audio- 9.5/10Replayability- 9.5/10.:8.0/10:.+High replayability+Amazing hardcore mode+Outstanding performances by the voice actors+Clever antagonist-The game ENDS for real-Awful graphics-Explosives are useless-Bright atmosphere			"

												Whether or not you will like Fallout New Vegas will most likely depend on your personal preference. For example, it depends on whether you prefer the blade or guns. After playing Oblivion and Skyrim, I tried this game and was both pleased and turned off. The cool stuff:I got a mod that imported Star Wars droids into the game, and they are awesome.The costumes can make your character look awesome!There is a jetpack mod......http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/37140/?The main city of New Vegas is pretty nice, and Freeside is fun to explore. The Liberty Loft is the house to get there.http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/41822/?In addition, it is easy to be a total bada** in the game, which is pretty fun.The guns are also diverse and fun, the gunplay is solid. There are also throwable weapons (which Skyrim should have).The soundtrack is good.The uncool:Oblivion and Skyrim spoiled me with beautiful worlds and exciting combat, so I expected a world ripe for exploration and screenshots. However, while it may be great for exploration, its sheer ugliness completely turned me off. On top of that, deadly monsters roam the bleak landscape and serve as bullet sponges, so I ended up being content staying in the City.The NPCs seem fake and are not interesting (if that makes sense).There are some annoying mechanics such as dehydration and radiation. It is fun sometimes and annoying as all heck other times. There are great ENBs, but the game looks bad without them. I now know that I much prefer Elder Scrolls over Fallout. Although Fallout has its perks, I will always rather invest my time in Oblivion and Skyrim's gorgeous worlds, spells, potions, sword combat, and quests. New Vegas' ugly and unrewarding world, unfortunately, dampened my excitement to do a serious playthrough.But: Do not let this deter you. Try it out for yourself and see if you like the elements this game has that other games do not. Plus, check out the Nexus Mods. There are some pretty cool ones there!			"

												This is an amazing addition to the series, highly underrated. Has to be one of the best RPGs to date.I highly recommend getting the Ultimate Edition to enjoy the brilliant DLCs, the game is much more complete with them.Game-play is as amazing as ever, pretty much following the same game-play as Fallout 3 with a few improvements here and there. Strangely they decided to add an iron-sights mode when shooting, which would be fine, but seeing as this game doesn’t have the best graphics, it can sometimes feel like your aiming down a brick. This can be easily corrected by disabling it and going back to Fallout 3’s zoom, however. All the guns feel great, all with a specific purpose and good against certain enemies, there is a great deal more strategy to the gun-play than with Fallout 3, with many more available stats, weapon mods and weapons which are useful in particular situations. This game also introduces hard-core mode, where the game is set to the hardest difficulty (very hard) and forces you to eat, sleep and drink on a regular basis in order to survive. This mode tends to start extremely hard, with endless treks searching for water or supplies and provides a hefty challenge for experienced players, but once you’ve played this game to death, you’ll have enough supplies to not really have to worry about impending starvation any longer.I could go into much more detail on game-play but many of my points would also apply to Fallout 3, which if you haven’t played, I recommend doing so before getting this.As far as visuals and soundtrack go they are beyond exquisite, with a great mix of a western style Mojave theme and the classic 1950s twist that was evident in earlier games.The story is excellent, following your life after being shot in the head. The game has over 62,000 lines of dialogue, holding the Guinness World Record for the most dialogue ever produced for a video game. It also has has some of the best written characters I’ve ever seen in gaming, most of them appearing the DLCs. The actually story, well, that’s up to you. Do what you want; don’t do what you don’t want to do. This is the definition of strong story-telling in a truly free game world.Where the game has many of its problems is in mechanics. Perhaps it was rushed out, thanks to Bethesda only giving Obsidian 18 months to make the game. Very small aspects of the game do sometimes feel unfinished, or the remnants of an idea that was originally in the game are left lying around. There can also be a number of pesky bugs, most of which can be fixed by a few easily installed community mods.What truly should sell you on this game is the endless supply of amazing mods on the Nexus. These mods with the game and DLCs combined will give you endless hours of fun.			"

												9.5/10 - Perfect. Except the ending..Open world, Great gameplay and atmosphere. The gold standard for me. I would easily pay $30 for this game. A real must have. Choose your path and help either Mr. House, The Legion, NCR or local gangs to force unique outcomes.The only negative is that once completing the storyline you can't continue exploring and playing.

												During a quest line that initially seemed innocuous or too much to bother with but ultimately directs you towards an npc with a treasure trove of information on the massive world that you partcipate and you speak to and listen captively to this npc for what seems an eternity you realize what a tremondous achievement Fallout New Vegas is.  Briliant in it's construction and writing. Grand in it's scope.  Rich in exploration.  So big that 50 hours of playing time and your choosen build might not even yield the true gameplay or dialog gems of what has to be considered one of the best rpgs ever crafted.  Yes it's just a desert for the most part but this desert has the richest of gaming gold waiting to be mined.			"

												i've never played a fallout game before and this is my first one the story is a bit hard to be understanded ( for me :p )  , but beating the main quest took me over 50 hours , yes , which means that the main quest is long , and so  does the rest of the quests the gameplay is 80% about surviving :   sleeping in time , avoiding eating bad food , using weapons correctly , and also  : surviving with your social profile , like avoiding crimes , having a good karma ....and speaking about social profiles...it also has a faction system which gives you many choises about which way you wanna follow , of course every faction has it own negative profiles and positive ones fallout new vegas is kinda buggy , but its because of those bugsthat we enjoy a part of the gameplay :Dand also , the game is enjoyable even without dlc's ,and it has modding community i would call the game alternativly : future wasteland surviving simulator 2011 :]this one takes 10/10 and deserves all the love :]			"

												The Fallout series is one of the most acclaimed that has also a retro-futuristic touch that charms you when you see it for first time until you finish the game. New Vegas is no stranger to it's predecesors.The player visits the city of New Vegas and it's Mojave desert that are just ruined by the radioactivity and the different factions that are in war. You, most known as the Courier, were hired to deliver an unknown package from the Mojave to the New Vegas Strip but you were intercepted, shot in the head, and left for dead by an also unknown man who steals it.Afterwards, you are found and healed by a local doctor and then, your story begins. No complains on the writting department from me.Being an Open World Action Role playing game gave Bethesda give the gamers so many things to do in the map: from following the main story, or just not and complete side quests; or from being an explorer of the wasteland to wander just in populated places. This game gives you freedom to choose what do you want to do in it and how do you want to develop your     story and character (as you have speech,lockpicking and multiple skills to upgrade by playing). This game even lets you choose how you want to end it as you choose your side in the faction crisis (NCR,Caesar's Legion, Mr House... or none)shown through all of the story. This is what keeps the player so connected to the game: the freedom of playing as you want.The gameplay is  similar from Fallout 3: the Pipboy is back with all it's previous options modified a bit to fit in this game (radio included, lol), the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System or V.A.T.S for the specific aiming of a limb and the real time effects of it (brilliant), the karma and your reputation (good or bad, your choice), companions, weapons modding and the adding of the Gambling (cheating is included) are the most unique things of the series and of course, it's signature. Even the new players can blend in without any problem.Fallout: New Vegas is one hell of a game and will not steal minutes from your life because you will enjoy every second of it.You won't regret the experience.

												Ah, Fallout. My first true RPG, and one true love. Full disclosure, I prefer 3 to NV, but it's almost solely because of the radio personalities; Mr. New Vegas is just kind of...blah. Luckily, there's an all-music station, and the in-game sound track is pretty damn good, too.So, hey, the actual game. For starters, super-fun story. I've always been a sucker for games that have you caught between large warring factions. New Vegas has three of them. Not two. ♥♥♥♥en three. AND, you can say to hell with all of them and throw in with the faction of Me, Baby, taking the riches of New Vegas for yourself. But whatever choices you make, they're all apparent during the final battle, which somehow manages to put Liberty Prime's curb-stomping rampage to shame.The world is beautiful and makes me wish I had a better graphics card. The vaults in particular are very well-written. I still get a feeling of dread whenever I crawl through Vault 34, and Vault 22 is supremely fun with fire-based weapons. The world is solidified by the fact that, unlike in F3, there are a number of large, well-established settlements, with whom you can gain or lose reputation as you and your shooting sprees see fit. The terrain itself is varried, from sprawling dessert to rocky cavern to lush forest to snow-sprinkled mountain, all within about a day's run of each other.Mechanics are glitchy but good as always. Love the condensation of Small Guns and Big Guns into just Guns, and the addition of Survival. I actually wrote my own physical copy of The Wasteland Survival Guide with all crafting recipes in it, just so I could better manage my inventory and decide what crap I could sell safely. I can't mod weapons to save my life, but based on the public achievement stats, I think I'm the only one with this issue. Doesn't bug me much, as there are enough unique weapons in-game to make moding almost pointless. I am, however, a huge fan of the new ammo types; armor-piercing rounds making it so much easier to kill higher-level enemies, and coin shot gives you something to do with all that worthless Legion money you're going to collect.Buy this game, Ultimate Edition. Everyone talks up Lonesome Road, and while enjoyable (partly because it gives you access to the best companion in the game), it's one of the slowest points in the game - and filled with Deahclaws. Old World Blues is hilarious and gives you invaluable resources, Honest Hearts is beautiful in its simplicity, and Dead Money...well, Sierra Madre Martinis make Tin Cans worth something, and there's some good loot towards the end that does help your midgame. God damn, just writing this review makes me want to play again!			"

												Take fallout 3, expand it, add more diversity, add more interesting locations, triple the amount of factions, add a better theme, and add more immersion and you have fallout NV. Obsidian has taken a decent game and made it great. Really a lot more depth in the world and just overall better. It manages to capture Fallout I and II spirit far better than FO3. Bethesda should learn, not everything is about saving the world.A game for explorers and people who like good stories.Far better than FO3.			"

												Ya know after putting a lot of thought into I can honestly say Fallout 4 is a great shooter and builder game, of course others do it better but beside that it's good at its one thing.The down side is, this ancient title that was dug up from the tombs of Bethesda way back in the fantastic year 2012 still somehow managed to be a better game. Which is upsetting to me in a lot of ways, but this game is truly a fantastic RPG in almost every regard of the word. It's not a simple Yes simulator like Fallout 4 is. I feel connected to my character in this game, I feel like I can really play someone give them a backstory, a life and a reason to keep pushing through the mutant rampant lands that we call the Mohave. Is it perfect gameplay? No. But mods fix that. And moding is 100% free (as long as you aren’t playing on a toaster). The melee system is clunky no matter what, the gun play is fun and you can mod weapons, it's very limited yes. But it's not overwhelming and you don’t have to lug around the entirety of a hoarders belongings in order to make sure you can upgrade your pipe pistol from the start of the game to still be relevant. I love this game, I played it for hours back when I still had a functional PS3 and I'm probably going to play it for way more then what I have right now. Get this game, it's the best Wasteland survival RPG on the market. "

												Incredible follow up to Fallout 3. Still perhaps the best way for Fallout fans to spend their time exploring the Fallout universe until the next installment hits, although every Fallout game is well done. I liked the atmosphere of the game more than that of numerous RPGs, even though it's Vegas (I've been there more times than I can count). I only wish they made the characters more authentic in general, but the DLC seems to make up for this weakness, at least to some extent. Therefore, between the two I would always recommend the Ultimate Edition, if you can afford it. Never the less you really can't wrong with this game.			"

												A few years ago, Bethesda said ""I'm going to make Fallout games"" everyone waited the new fallout game with curiosity anxiety and hope. some people liked it some people didn't, but whatever happened, everyone sat and played at least once. As far as novelty is concerned, it adds a beauty and new excitement to everything in life unless it is overstated. So while the old Fallout is a classic, this new version is becoming another classic in its own style and taste.First of all, the story of New Vegas is completely different from the story of the third game. At the outset, now the serade is classicized, ""I turned into a fish out of the Vault"" does not apply to this game. This is not an old Vault member, we are a wasteland person. It's a little more than we've been through.Fallout: New Vegas is almost four years from Fallout 3 in 2281, and 204 years after the Great Nuclear War in 2077. The story goes in Las Vegas, Nevada and Mojave Desert. Unlike other cities in the Fallout series, Vegas is not directly affected by nuclear attacks. The majority of buildings in the city are intact and the number of mutations among people is very small. This isolation is reflected in nature in a sense, clean water and food are more common than other places in the country. We can also compare the city of Vegas with the old Reno. Because it is one of the rare cities where the post-war world has electricity. It is also located near the famous Hoover Dam.If we come to the story; Our scenario character, written by John Gonzales, is a simple element for a courier company called Mojave Express. Something goes wrong during an ordinary deployment and we are attacked and shot by a group to bury a landscape. Fortunately, however, it is being rescued by a robot called Victor and we are opening it up at Doctor Mitchell's house. So our adventure begins.The main story is about finding out who shot us, why, but of course there are many other side missions as well. Like the Fallout 3's twin in terms of New Vegas technical structure. Physics engine, character designs, models, shaders, etc. They are all the same as the third game, so I do not have to talk much about it, but I have only one desire from Obsidian; Please, but please let me create characters that look like human beings no more. There are still a lot of choices in face design in the character creation phase, but unfortunately all the combinations of these options do not give you a proper look. Okay maybe this world is a world where you get dirt and nukes, but not everyone looks like a pug-eyed alien.Like I said, the game has the same technical features, but there are also a few minor bugs about graphics. I think we will be quite satisfied with the game in terms of visuals after these mistakes that will be corrected in short time. In fact, when talking about the ready-made character model and graphic mistakes, let's talk about one or two bad sides of the game before it hides its beauty so that when we finish our writing, we have a nice taste in our mouth.Apart from the two technical faults I mentioned above, there is nothing I can complain about the technical part of the game. Beside this, I experienced some sadness about the music and sounds of the game. Music or voices are not bad, just few. Especially with the 5-10 songs you hear on radio music, it's just a piece of music playing on the fence while you are walking around. I still have old jazz and blues pieces, and occasionally I have two rock 'n' rolls. Regarding the voicings, it is not very inadequate as it is not bad at all, considering the logic of the game, neither technically nor quantitatively. But human beings are not enough! The character, ambiance and other voices are quite nice. Sounds and mouth movements are in sync. The sound of the surroundings really makes you feel like you're walking around in a circle. But I can not say the same for artificial intelligence. In general, artificial intelligence acting logically, sometimes can do really stupid things. In some places, if you are an enemy, your supporters, nonsense objects or walls can be stuck in place. But that's all. Obviously I'm going to do a bit of a bad review on the game, and that's a problem, except perhaps a music patch - a problem that can not be solved with a simple patch.As a first innovation we can start with traits and advantages (perk). While there is no change in skills, the features and benefits have been renewed. Also, the game does not force you to choose your first features. It offers you a choice of ""Choose 2 features or never"". Another innovation is camp fire. You will find these in many places. In campfires, you can make medicines and meals with the plants you collect around.Another innovation is in the work tables. Now, besides the classic work table, there is also a working table for preparing your own ammunition or for creating ammunition for the weapons you use with the pieces you have obtained from this unarmed ammunition. Of course, for these two innovations, you have to have your talent as well as the material. The game map is much smaller than Fallout 3. But do not perceive it as having less work to do. On the contrary, the fact that the map is small makes the game more full and lively, and I think it was a good tactic. One of the nice innovations is that you can now use binoculars. Now we do not have a problem to see far enough to find a scoped rifle, so I've been looking a lot for binoculars in the third game.The bobble heads we gathered in the third game have been replaced by snow globes and star aisle covers. What you will notice directly when you first target your weapon is that the weapon is not fixed. Yes, there is a coherence in weapons now. So you will usually want to squat and shoot. VATS was one of the most favorite battle strategies, and it still gives you the opportunity to make special strikes in addition to weapons other than firearms, and it is cinematic during these strikes. You already learn all these innovations in the village of Goodspring at the beginning of the game. As I said at the beginning, this village is actually prepared as an exercise section and you can say that I can absolutely recommend it, you can play this exercise section. We can say that great innovation is the interaction and the effects that this interaction creates in our stories. First of all, I have to say that reputation now has a very big prefix. The Mojava desert is shared by many groups; The most important of which are NCR and Caesar's Legion. NCR (New California Republic) is an organization that started after the war and a group of law-makers united and formed militias, and then it is growing considerably. They have power, money, technology and most important power. They provide electricity to New Vegas with the Hoover Dam on their hands. Caesar's Legion is a slavery-focused rebel group. NCR is not as strong and organized as the NCR, but literally insane. Apart from these, many other small group games are out in the game. This is where the reputation you make at this point affects the reaction you give to the groups that you encounter by coming after you. In every town, there is a reputation according to your attitude there, and at this point the game leaves you in a complete void. You will be on the side of a group during the game, or you will not be able to decide whether you will choose your side. There is good and bad here with no exact meaning. The people you say are good and want you to do things that sometimes you do not even doubt yourself.Dialogs are solid. It gives you detailed information about your life and your life here. Depending on your SPECIAL abilities, you may encounter different dialogue methods. In addition, the people you talk to change their face expression according to the subject or current mood.Overall: 11/10 LEGENDARY			"

												I typically prefer to play simulation and strategy sandbox games because I can get countless hours of replayability versus games with a storyline as eventually the story ends. Reviews and trailers for Fallout 4 caught my attention, but I wasn't quite ready to dish out the money for a genre I've only started to dabble in recently. Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas caught my attention when it was discounted during this past Winter Sale, and I went with Fallout New Vegas because I was worried about Windows 10 and Fallout 3 not being optimized past Windows 7.  I am soon to be 30 hours in and there is someone with almost 4,000 hrs of gameplay out there, I do not regret my choice and it speaks to the opporunity to replay the game when I am done with my first playthrough.Fallout New Vegas welcomed me in without the need to play the previous Fallout games, the storyline is captivating and well-planned thus far. The quests help me to explore an almost open world, exposing me to various creatures and gangs. I am not an expert and no where close to ending the game, but I like the fact that I can choose to replay the game differently by altering my choice of SPECIALS, skills, and choices that in turn affect how the game continues. I have restarted a few times while learning which SPECIALS and skills work best with the character build I am interested in. I finally have a better understanding of the setup and I find that the game provides a challenge without completely sinking and frustrating me as a new player to the genre and franchise. I imagined originally that I wouldn't like it because I don't typicaly play first person shooters but the whole aspect of combining elements of an RPG that I am dabbling with as of late with FPS has suddenly made me more fierce with a gun and explosives. I LOVE that I can cause damage but on the side of good. Some day, maybe I will walk on the darkside to see what else Fallout New Vegas has to offer in terms of quests, but until then I am shooting ghouls, creepy crawlers, and gang members in favor of those in need.

												Despite what some people might say, Fallout: NV is the better game compared to Fallout 3. It has the same basic ""Fallout 3-esque"" gameplay but it's much improved. They took many popular mods from FO3 and implemented them directly into the game and it's much better for it. I'd even go as far to say that ""hardcore mode"" is the way you should play Fallout: NV. It feels much better with that turned on...like a real wasteland and you're trying to survive in it.NV is exactly what Obsidian does best - They take a good IP and improve upon it in almost every way....especially the writing. Bethesda couldn't write a decent story to save their lives. Their writers are down-right horrible and every one of their games' story was a joke. They make nice lore, but they never write an interesting and involved story in a single game.The only thing FO3 has over NV is easy to see (literally). It's the visuals. FO3 takes place in a  ruined downtown DC area in the USA. Very iconic even to people who don't live in the US. The cowboy-esque visuals from NV are nice at times too, but nothing compares to a torn-up iconic environment most people have seen pictures of in real life.  It's the one real advantage that game has. Everything else though? Fallout: New Vegas actually does it better. Don't get me wrong, I liked Fallout 3 for what it was, but most everything was improved for New Vegas.Do yourself a favor and pick up NV today!			"

												Perhaps its greatest strength is the fact that everybody can play it differently. Rigidly follow the main storyline – or wander off and ignore it entirely. Try and be as moral as possible – or kill and rob the first merchant you come across. It's a tailor-made gaming experience where everything can be done at your own pace and in your own way – no wonder it resonates with so many people.Fallout: New Vegas, the latest addition to the FRANCHISE, exemplifies all these great qualities in the series' best outing to date.The action this time takes place on the US west coast – the setting for the first two Fallout games – a decision which has granted Obsidian much greater scope for variety in landscaping and colour than the washed-out Washington DC of Fallout 3.Being further away from the game's titular nuclear fallout, there's blue skies, singing birds and more signs of civilisation – a marked tonal shift from the unremittingly bleak scenery seen previously.Aside from the familiar burnt-out cities and trailer parks, the centrepiece of this new setting is the New Vegas strip – a wonderfully distorted and dark version of its real-life counterpart. Vomiting drunks, voluptuous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and a selection of fully playable CASINOS(better max out your Luck rating first) make it every bit as vivid and memorable as the decaying US capital of the last game.In terms of the story, there's next to no foreshadowing this time around – players are expected to be familiar with the Fallout universe – and the main narrative follows your attempts to unravel the events leading up to your near-death, which prefigures the game.Fallout: New VegasI've been asked a few times whether it's 'better' than Fallout 3's central plot and to be honest it's hard to say. It's a looser strand to follow, meaning side-questing fits in much more easily, though the blank nature of your character means it's hard to care too much about what happened to you – especially when there's so much fun to be found elsewhere.

												You don't need an approvement to know that FO:NV is a great game, worthy of your time. Sure, it's a bit broken with those glitches, you can't turn a blind eye. But its quests and story, its freedom of choices and an amazing soundtrack really makes the glitches look like something unimportant, something small. I personally enjoyed New Vegas a bit more than FO3, but I think that it depends on your personal choice and experience. Most DLCs give you at least 5-6 hours of gameplay which is quite important in my standards and they follow up different stories, which are brand new for you. Game's been out for years, it's basically a no brainer to get it, doesn't matter if full price or on a promotion. Try it out, see if I'm right.			"

												Fantastic RPG. Adds a bunch of new stuff that wasn't in Fallout 3. The companion wheel is great, and the weapon mods make your weapon pack more of a punch.The story is very well done, and all the stuff you could do in the Mojave could keep you busy for months. Then when you go through the DLC, you'll have even more stuff to do. I guess there's never a dull moment in this game!			"

												There are two main groups of the Fallout fanbase as of 2011: people who played all the Fallout games and the much larger amount of people who only really played Fallout 3. I'm part of the first group. Leaving aside the fact that said group is the most toxic fanbase on the Internet, suffice to say that I think Fallout 2 was a big improvement over the first (awful opening area aside).Fallout 3-gen fans tend to dislike New Vegas. But to people like me, Fallout: New Vegas is what I've been waiting for. It's designed by many of the people who made Fallout 2, specifically New Reno. The shortcomings I felt with Fallout 3--the lack of region/NPC-specific endings, the quest solutions not really having much of an effect on the game or world, the dialogue/writing of the NPCs, etc--have all been fixed here. The VATS targeting system is no longer invincible and targeting is redone to use FPS mechanics (where you aim = where you shoot). It'd be hard to go back to Fallout 3 from this, & I liked F3!			"

												Played 40 hours on my first playthrough, then lost the save file right before the fight at Hoover Dam.Now, one year later I finally build up the courage to start anew and begin an adventure that will help place Fallout: New Vegas as one of the most immersive, and addicting games I've ever played. The glitches give it that charm that lets you know not to take things too seriously, many laughs to be had. The game provides challenge as long as you play at least Normal and up.This game also gives you the option the literally play through the adventure, in many numorous ways whether it be what main story path you'll take (NCR, Caesar, House, You having an entire robot army)On top of that, you're free to decide how you will deal with every situation. You want to be a blood thirsty melee mad man? Maybe you'd prefer to deal with things in a more ""peaceful"" way, vanilla new vegas has been proven to be able to beat without killing a single creature or person (You can look up the YouTube playlist) Or like any regular person who likes the pick up Fallout, just wants to get 100 Guns and shoot any man creature or creepy ghoul proostitute, lockpick into everything (Which is nicely recommended) and all in all, have fun. The DLC is also all really well done and worth picking up. This game I recommend for everybody who has a brain420/10 changed my life.P.S. In H&H Tools Factory, read every single terminal, it's worth it.			"

												Fallout New Vegas is a very nice video game. From the story to the gameplay, it has eaten the past 100 hours of my life and I'm  very pleased to waste my time. From the art style to the music to the characters, it all just fits in so well. You could say that it's no different from Fallout 3 but unlike Fallout 3, this is a much brighter and much more difficult and polished up experience with only a few flaws within the game. The DLC is fantastic, offering lots of new content and areas to explore. However, there is the problem that it's a Bethesda game. Why is that a problem? Because it's buggy. You have to be careful with the game. If you can get over the annoying save bug (where you can't load your save, requiring you to start the game from the start in order to be able to load your oldest save), to some quest breaking bugs that require you to cheat in the console (I had this occur for me once, but still). The other problem is that the battle with Caesar is very very badly executed. But, that doesn't stop the game itself from being good. If you're looking for a very fun and enjoyable experience, I highly recommend you try it out. And the game itself isn't that expensive with all it's DLC anyway.			"

												This was the first of the Fallout Series that I've played and I am thoroughly impressed. The creators and successors of Fallout truly love their creation and put so much passion into their games and related items of interests. Only finishing FO:NV, I realise that I have only touched like 5% of the whole story. It made me curious and so I read the timeline of events in the whole Fallout universe and pleased myself with the reading of the whole story. I really enjoyed that as well!(From a first-time player of Fallout) FO:NV has great FPS gameplay including the VATS feature. The leveling, skill, S.P.E.C.I.A.L, perk and reputation system is vast and astonishing. I enjoyed starting new characters with high strength and luck and yolo it out in the Wasteland. The mass amounts of items, armor, weapons, ammo and drinks you can find is another aspect that'll make me enjoy and not get bored. Storyline is very non-linear and links up few quests so you don't have to got through too much trouble. The A.I is nicely designed for the era of the gaming industry when FO:NV was in. Companions are cool and there are many options to do with the companion (fight, stay, disband or just have a nice chat). Overall I just think FO:NV as an incredibly badass game.The main reason I played FO:NV was because of the massive hype for Fallout 4 that provoked me to try out the Fallout Series. I know now that I will definitely buy Fallout 4, when I have the money ofc. I am proud of Bethesda, Obsidian and the original creators Interplay. 10/10 I write poetry in my Brotherhood of Steel armor. Lasers are my ink. My enemies are my paper.  "

												A fitting love-letter of a bygone era known only as the '50s, it reminds me of a dusty ballroom recording, with its crackles and pops, genuine improvisational finesse, and its propensity for dryness. It seamlessly blends diverse modes of visual art, ranging from retro-futurism to Art Deco to modernist sensibilities into its quirky and idiosyncratic world.You, the Courier, wander the vast expanse collectively known as the 'Mojave Wasteland', a post-apocalyptic, divergent vision of the United States in 2281.On a quest to seek revenge against a mystery man who left you in an unmarked ditch to die, you are inadvertently thrown into a quagmire between three major factions: the 'New California Republic', 'Caesar's Legion', and with the enigmatic 'Mr. House'.The main story revolves solely on these three factions, which I'll get into in relative detail. (Spoilers below).The 'New California Republic' touts itself as a last bastion of a democratic federation, structuring its government and its system of laws after pre-War United States sworn to egalitarian ideals. This ideology was handled rather poorly by bureaucrats and serve as an annoying hindrance to civic order. (They are now dealing with a conglomerate of loosely connected but independent city-states.) Problems arise regarding but not limited to: laissez-faire capitalism, populism, rampant corruption, extensive senatorial infighting, and most recently, aggressive expansion.Edward Sallow was a former member of the Followers and the NCR. Here is a man who took charge of his life, as a true anarchist like himself would. He familiarized himself with the 'Commentarii', Julius Caesar's firsthand account on the Gallic Wars and emulated his character, even taking on his title. He quickly established himself as a man to be reckoned with, resorting to shockingly barbaric ways to make his point, and established the monolithic 'Legion'.One might think Caesar's Legion would serve as a direct dichotomy to the NCR, but they're very analogous if you think about it: both are nationalistic (strictly in the traditional sense), militaristic, imperialistic, and arguably totalitarian. The Legion takes it one step further and ""obliterates the identity of every group it conquers"", a homogenous culture of racialists, galvanizing under one banner.And of course, you have Mr. Robert Edwin House and his roaming army of Securitrons. A mysterious and undoubtedly interesting figure, a staunch antitheist, and an ambitious, calculating autocrat with great oratory skill and prowess, he practically owns the New Vegas strip. He is also a self-described visionary of technological and economic gambits, and wants total control of the Wasteland.(I won't even mention all the fracases you can get into with minor factions, specifically with the Three Families, the Boomers, the Great Khans, the Brotherhood of Steel, the Remnants of the Enclave, etc. simply because there's no room for it.) These storylines are just as enjoyable and original, if not moreso than the main quests.This is a game that's politically versed, wholly engaging, dark and humorous, and always fun to play. Mod it to your heart's content, and explore the Wasteland, a dried-up canvas that keeps on giving. Fallout at its best.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas may seem like an expansion for Fallout 3 than a stand alone game, but that is only at first glance. Fallout: New Vegas takes the focus of the Fallout franchise back to the west coast and does so in a very good way. The story isn't exactly amazing, however it lends itself to letting you create your own backstory, and making your own decisions. There really isn't too much to hold you back from doing what ever you want? The base game alone has hundreds of hours of contnent in it, and has a huge amount of replay value, from four different major endings and dozens of smaller end pieces. That being said it is not without a few flaws: namely the glitichs and instability. It manages to be worse than its predecesor in that regard, as well as numerous bugs; some hilarious, some that can ruin a run through. The only other real complaint I have is that you CANNOT continue the game after you beat the ending, which is a shame. Still there is more than enough to do in New Vegas, and with all of its DLC this is a must have for any Fallout fan, as well as anyone who likes RPGs.			"

PROS:-Decent story-Brilliant, fun gameplay-Great characters-Great dialogue-Fun quests-Awesome weapons-Great DLC-Realistic towns (in terms of a wasteland)-Tons of mods-Has the same level of writing/characters as the original Fallout's-Weapon modding-Great soundtrackCONS:-Absolutely marred by bugs. Only real way to fix them is through mods, however the game will still be incredibly unstable. Note: If you want to mod the game, install Nexus Mod Manager, LOOT and Fallout Mod Manager. Be warned that modding incorrectly or not installing mods properly can break textures. Some mods may break interior cells as well.  Overall:  Great game, marred by bugs. 8.5/10			"

												War? War never changes. Neither does Fallout. Between Fallout 3 and New Vegas not a whole lot had changed. Heck, usually a sequel adds significant technical improvements. Not New Vegas. New Vegas trades out the setting for a slightly different one, trades in its story for something that Bioware would be jealous of. And adds a few new weapons and options. Other than that, New Vegas and Fallout 3 are pretty much exactly alike. And that is not a bad thing. I would have loved a more intuitive interface, or higher walkspeed, but I guess the developers held true to their creed of ""do not fix what isn't broke."" They also didn't fix was was broken, but big games have these small issues, and New Vegas is big. Huge. Ginormous. Not just in scale, but also in scope. There are so incredibly many things to do; if you'd try to do them all, you'd go mad. It is impossible to do it all in one playthrough; many quests have different angles and outcomes, and your alignment plays a big role. Oh, and this game isn't cushy with good and bad alignment. No, this game has a tonne of factions, and each keeps tabs on your relationship with them. You can suck up to all of them, or a few, or just go full paraiah and just kill everyone. Also, the game generally doesn't care about how you finish up a quest; just that you put an end to it. New Vegas is a true, and both technically and literally a sandbox game. Most of the world is desert. Miles and miles of barren, irradiated sand, rocks and broken roads. This is where the tedium sets in. Because for all its superfluence, there isn't much variation in the design. All the buildings look the same. Someone built the same dingy shack about 18 times over, all across the Mohave desert. You can only distiguish the various derelict factories from the name on the door. It's a shame. For all its complex relationship mechanics and over the top gore, it is easy to see where the developers cut costs.None of it really matters. The narrative just sucks you in, then spits you out to the side so you can go fishing for airplanes, only to draw you back in as you are rummaging through random hotel rooms. When you finally hit the climax, you'll have no idea about what and who you were working with. All the more reason to play it again, and waste even more time, looking for snowglobes in a giant desert while the future of mankind is at the mercy of antiquated fanatics who like to nail people to crosses for fun. Serious business.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is all about more. There's more to do in New Vegas than in Fallout 3, its superb predecessor; there's more complexity to its gameplay mechanics; and there are even more secrets to uncover as you roam the postapocalyptic wastes. Fallout: New Vegas' familiar rhythm will delight fans of the series, and the huge world, expansive quests, and hidden pleasures will have you itching to see what other joys you might uncover. Occasional glitches and performance issues occasionally intrude upon your travels, along with the scorpions and geckos that might accost you. Don't let the quirks frighten you away, however: New Vegas' nooks and crannies are bursting with grimy treasures waiting to be dusted off and admired by intrepid explorers.There's a wild, wonderful world outside Vegas, just waiting to be explored.This latest trip into the desolate American landscape possesses many of the same elements that made Fallout 3 such a successful role-playing game, but its story doesn't boast as many memorable moments. The large-scale combat scenarios are less epic, and the surprises are less dramatic than Fallout 3's mid-game reverie. Nevertheless, the main tale provides a solid skeleton from which to hang a dumbfounding number of tasks and stand-alone parables. Many of these quests are lengthy, and great dialogue and good voice acting will invite you to learn more about the characters, as well as keep you wondering about what will happen next. A society of ghouls with pie-in-the-sky aspirations is creepy enough to make you squirm, yet blind devotion to their dreams still inspires empathy. Socialites in formal attire run a casino known for its creative menu choices, and if you play your cards right, you might get to make a menu alteration of your own. You investigate the disappearance of a sharp-tongued wife in one town and bring star-crossed lovers together in another. Some of the most fascinating occurrences are the wittier ones. During one quest, a robot with a specialized skill and a gut-busting name might offer a service that surely no game character has ever offered before. A poet in an unlikely place mumbles aloud his difficulties in finding the right rhymes. Like with Fallout 3, the greatest delights aren't in the central storyline but on its periphery.While the tale isn't as evocative as it might have been, the way it blossoms as you advance, giving you any number of ways to proceed, is extraordinary. The choices you make might lead to a dramatically different experience from another player's experience. The same is true of many supplementary quests. There's a ton of flexibility in how you might approach certain tasks. Maybe you'll fend off the robots defending a long-forgotten museum, but you might also steal an identification card that allows you to walk around (mostly) unharmed. You might provide a drug addict his fix, but if your speech skill is high enough, you can convince him to get on the straight and narrow. One lovelorn fellow will try to send you on a scavenger hunt for spare parts, but a high science skill means you can recommend another schematic and avoid the job altogether. However, there are certain cases in which the game funnels you down a specific path that might come as a shock if you prefer peaceful ends but are forced into a combat scenario with a single viable solution. And in certain cases, the quests just aren't designed particularly well. Searching for a key in a vault overrun with vegetation can turn into a major hassle. Avoiding an artillery bombardment isn't fun in the least and feels out of place given the measured pace at which you move. And an optional quest in which you hop from one computer terminal to another to isolate a virus leads to frustrating trial-and-error guesswork.Ghouls don't like it when you say 'eewww' to their faces. It's better to talk behind their backs at a later time.Large personalities give an edge to your undertakings. A mysterious man known as Mr. House presides over both the Strip, as well as your own adventures, and his singular focus on fulfilling his needs looms dramatically over the later hours of your escapades. The leader of a Roman-inspired legion is also an ominous presence and a violent counterpoint to the upright and learned leader of the Brotherhood of Steel's local contingent. A ghoulish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, a potty-mouthed head waiter, and a wealthy-but-desperate father all make an impression in spite of their very minor roles. You might even find an interesting kindred spirit to accompany you. As with Fallout 3, you can bring a companion along with you; this is handy not only in combat, but it also gives you an extra inventory for dumping detritus. Interacting with your companion is simple, thanks to a wheel that lets you choose behaviors for your fellow traveler. You can only have one at a time, but you'll encounter multiple individuals willing to join you, and they all make interesting and funny quips when you interact with them. They also open up different quest opportunities, giving you a chance to learn more about what makes them tick.Fallout: New Vegas' major addition is that of faction favor. You establish a reputation with various towns and organizations by doing them favors or annoying them in some way or another. Which factions you align with has both subtle and profound consequences. If you're liked, a random somebody might run up to you bearing minor gifts, such as an iguana on a stick. (Mmm, tasty.) Or if you've gained a more violent reputation, a mugger might accost you with violent intentions, only to run off when he recognizes you. It's a pleasure to hear random citizens remark on how they feel about you as you pass by, even if the canned comments repeat a bit too often. (It's sometimes bizarre to hear two characters standing side by side deliver the same line, spoken by the same voice actor.)That Great Khan is no match for a sword made out of a bumper.Your faction relationships also have much more dramatic consequences on your adventure, opening up new quests while closing off others. The game is sometimes a bit opaque regarding how your actions may inadvertently affect the way a particular faction sees you, but this complexity manifests itself in awesome ways as you near the end of your travels. One great twist to this system is that by dressing up in faction-specific clothing or armor, you can disguise yourself and avoid a confrontation. Though, conversely, you might get dragged into battles against allies if you forget to change gear, which might damage a relationship you're trying to cultivate. This reputation system is a bit abstract, but it's a great addition to the Fallout formula, adding even more layers to a template already lauded for its flexibility.Glitches may give you a few minor fits, but the PC version of Fallout: New Vegas is not in the same rough technical shape as its console counterparts, possibly thanks to a sizeable patch delivered a day after its release. That doesn't mean there aren't problems here. We encountered some bugs, such as a friendly quest giver inexplicably attacking us, even though he didn't show as an enemy on the directional radar. Characters might still randomly freak out as if you're about to attack for no discernible reason, only to return to their normal locations a moment later and act as if nothing had happened. But we encountered only a few scripting problems, and the game never crashed. Most complex role-playing games suffer from technical hitches, and this one is no exception. However, the oddities in this version aren't exceptionally disruptive, which makes it easy to stay invested.Hacking is one way to solve your problems, but if you aren't good at it, there's probably another way. Or three.If you played Fallout 3 or The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, which used the same game engine as Fallout: New Vegas, then you won't be surprised by some of the other minor foibles, although many of them seem exac			"

 I just love this gameI played it without Steam some years ago for about 150+ hours and want to recapitulate this experience now with some Nexus-mods. Took me about 4 hours to get it running smoothly and without crashes, but it's totally worth the time and money!! For me  NMC-textures and Nevada Skies crashed the whole game. So this was a bummer. I recommend the following mods:  Western Sky!!  Active Wasteland  db enhanced Blood Textures  Full Character Overhaul!  Improved Sound FX!!  Sprint Mod  NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash  EVE - Essential Visual Enhancements!!  The radio stations: CONELRAD and Old World RadioI also recommend to start the game in Windows 7 compatibility mode (Windows XP Service Pack 2).But also without mods and stuff this game is absolutely great and except the grafics totally up to date! If you're from Germany, be shure to buy the UNCUT Ultimate Edition!!For More Blood etc. open Fallout_default.ini Config file found in:...Steam\steamapps\common\fallout new vegasand find the following lines:fDecalLifetime=10.0000iMaxDecalsPerFrame=50change the numbers to:fDecalLifetime=720.0000iMaxDecalsPerFrame=512 Bottom line: This is one of the best RPG of all time and can keep up with games like Morrowind and Skyrim!Update: It's still running pretty good, but every 2-3 hours it's crashing...But so what?!Update after 150 hours: Done most of the side-quests and it's still fun to scavenge and explore the wastelands. There's sooooo much to discover and I realized that last time I played it I missed many many cool quests and locations.Right now, I'm starting the Dead Money DLC with my level 34 character. This DLC seems to be quite out of touch with the ""normal"" Fallout NV world. There's something about ghosts, radios which will kill you if you go near them (you're wearing a booby-trap-collar (Battle Royale?!), which will detonate on approach) and some guy is forcing you to enter the Sierra Madre casino with some companions...Mhh, I'm eager to find out how this turns out!! I'll keep you updated!Update: Okay, totally got addicted again to this game! Played every DLC and maxed my character out...Mhhh, let's see, how long it takes until I play it again :-DI WILL BE BACK!!Update:   Okay, maybe I won't be back, because, people, hear me out: FALLOUT 4 HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED!!!  So for all of you who can't wait, get this game and prepare yourself for the wasteland!! "

												Before you read this review - let me just say this: buy it. Just buy it.Fallout New Vegas is a FPS/3rd-person/RPG/adventure game hybrid that for most gamers it would be common to compare with Skyrim. Because after all, the two games were developed by the same company. Almost. Bethesda and Obsidian respectively  Based upon an equal foundation, at least. But New Vegas is so much more than Skyrim in a post-apocalypse setting.New Vegas shows some of the most intriguing, creative, funny and emotional writing that I've ever experienced in a game. It sets the perfect tone with the western post apocalyptic 1960's combined with a bunch of Vegas Baby-backdrop for an adventure about war, ruthless criminals, survival, and endless discoveries. It encourages an alternative approach with a seriously dialogue-driven storyline. With you as a participant, you can influence almost everything that happens. IF you're a charismatic speaker. If not...well, I guess you could go for the (ATTACK) option. This bothers me much with other games, because there's usually no ""pacifist"" game mechanic, you usually end up straining yourself to avoid things the game want you to do, because it doesnt tailor to what you want for yourself. This is not the case with New Vegas. If you want this or that to be the fallout (meh) of your several quest and individual storylines, it's fine. It's possible. The combat may feel a bit disjointed and ""hack'n'slash""-like, with little weight behind motions. I would like more impact. There's not really much physics involved, except for the ragdolls when someone dies, lol. Even that is lackluster.Graphics... pretty..bland. At least my vanilla game (the normal, not modded version) doesn't really drag me into an immersive world, and it hasn't aged that well. BY ITSELF. Not anymore. that's my curse though, I'm a bit stuck up when it comes to graphics and visuals. I just didn't manage to get AS into it as I used to. Then I started modding, and got ENBs functional. My Fallout now looks incredible, runs good, and for me is one of the most complete experiences to date.When I get past my own cursed liking for good visuals, and actually got the game looking sweet... There's nothing bothering me with this game. The writing and story, the characters, locations, the exploration, the factions you fight for and against, the dynamic and deep companions, the action and reaction, consequences of your choices, and how it's all just...Its a good trip.One of my favorite games. No doubt. about 40 hours checked on this playthrough, and I haven't even reached the Strip!A couple of years ago I got 100+ hours without a hitch.Ring-a-ding-ding baby			"

												This game is brilliant. it fixes allot of what fallout 3 did not (iron sites ect...) the choice and influence that your charicter has on the world is increadable. you can end up making new vegas a utopia in the waste or enslave/kill all of his inhabitence. The DLC alone is enough to buy this game as it adds so much in terms of story, gameplay and maps. Although if you try to describe this game to someone it can seem a little wierd. ""the world has been nuked and a mail man gets shot in the head only to survive and go on a mail man phsycotic rampage, nuke two places, rob a casino, extermanate tribes and be the most baddas mail man there is"". I think that this was the true falout 3 (not that it was bad or anything it was realy good) but because most of the people, factions and references are for fallout 1 and 2, so it feels like this should have been were fallout 3 is, and 3 be a spin off game (a very good one at that)i give this game 5 stars and bannana out of 10			"

												Easily one of the best RPGs out there. The engine is a bit outdated, but still makes a great Job in being fun. Specially if you mod the ♥♥♥♥ outta it. Skyrim may have better graphics, and be more stable, but like most Elder Scrolls games, it lacks roleplaying. The TES saga is great for it's lore and dungeoncrawling. But in New Vegas you can REALLY play a different character. You can be a gay guy who's a smooth talker and doesn't need to fire a shot to get♥♥♥♥♥♥done, for example. The different ways to solve the quests, according to your skills is what makes the Fallout saga really great. Of course, that's not the only thing this game has to offer. An awesome ambientation, the whole Fallout lore is so rich and unique. Since the smiling guy from the pipboy and all the 30s related humor, to a faction that tries to live by the rules of the Roman Empire, or the super mutants, and a lot more stuff. If Fallout has something that makes it different from other post apocaliyptic settings it's its humor and its uniqueness.Comparing it to Fallout 3, it's better in pretty much every way. The decisions now aren't all ""be a good good person or be a evil evil man"". There are more quests, more factions, a better reputation system. The companions actually have quests and personalities, you can really get to love 'em.  The combat system is better, with the weapons having iron sights and mods, and different types of ammo. Armor is more important now, etc. And to top it off, there's a really nice hardcore mode that allows you to have needs. Yes, now you need to eat, sleep and drink to survive, and can only heal limbs with the not-so-common doctor bags or by actually visiting a doctor. It definetly makes the game harder (Though it IS pretty forgiving in some aspects).The game has its flaws, obviously. The most serious being its bugs. But even like that, the game is a lot more stable than Fallout 3 and is fully playable. Anyways, I could keep talking, and I know I left various aspects of the game uncovered in this ""review"", but this is Just a general recomendation. If you like old RPGs where roleplaying was more important, or simply an unique and open world to explore and get into, this game is for you. Just buy it, you won't regret it.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is pretty much the post-apocalypse game I always wanted. You have a gigantic world to explore, countless number of side quests in addition to the already meaty and choice-based main quest The gameplay is satisfying and is is the perfect balance between RPG and action shooter. The game easily has over 150 hours of content with all the DLC. It is a proper RPG, letting you play how you want, be it a suave diplomat, a sneaky thief, or a thug with a very big hammer, and has multiple factions to side with for the end-game.As someone who played the hell out of this on the Xbox, I got the game again on PC primarily for mods, and if anyone is considering re-buying for that reason, I whole heartedly say do it right now. Modding makes an already great game fantastic and utterly unique to you with thousands upon thousands of mods. Never a fan of any of the armour or weapons? There is probably a mod out there for you. Not a fan of the fast travel system? Get XRE cars and drive around the wasteland. Have Fallout 3 and want one huge game? Get Tale of Two Wastelands and combine them into one big game with the same character. Want the game to be less of an RPG and more of a shooter, with high damage numbers, sprinting and hotkeys for grenades and melee? There are indeed mods that do that. The possibilities are endless, and the main modding website for New Vegas is easy to use, letting you both manually install mods or have an app that does it for you if you aren't confident enough or unsure.  Pretty much any kind of mod you want, it's out there.The main downside to a game of this scope if the stability, and while generally stable there are some very common bugs everyone will come across when playing the game. Of course, if you have played any other Bethesda-style RPG you will expect this anyway. I made a post on the forums which has the main ones you will need to make the game stable and mostly bug free:http://steamcommunity.com/app/22380/discussions/0/522730700736948013/I can not recommend this game highly enough. One of the best RPG's of the last generation. If you want to see how awesome this game looks, check out my screenshots.			"

												Fallout New Vegas really reminds the player of the original fallouts.Unlike Fallout 3 (which i highly recommend as well) New Vegas gives you choices that you may be morally conflicted with, yes Fallout 3 had choices in it, all good fallout games have, but New Vegas gives you more options. In addition to more choices the developers have introduced a reputation system, you do something good like help a community you will be liked more, but if you do things they do not like your reputation will go down. All of this matters in the endgame, who will support you depending on what side you took.Like many of RPG you will encounter people, you will talk to people. Throughout your travels you will meet interesting people you either like or dislike, all characters of importance are interesting, they have a story to tell, from Mr House overlord of the strip to the super mutants in Jacobstown.The graphics honestly are not anything to brag about. There is little change from Fallout 3, a few things have been brought over. But Fallout has never been known for their graphics, it has been for the story. If you are really bugged by the graphics you could just go and get a mod for it, there are plenty.VATS is back, along with other gameplay elements that made Fallout 3 popular. There have been changes made as well, more immersive elements have been added, like making ammunition, more crafting options, more weapons types, gambling and many more. I would not be recommending this game if there was no change, but there is change and it is a good change.Active community, Mods! The community is super active for mods, so many mods mods mods mods.Lastly the DLC. Lonesome road, Dead money, Old Wolrd Blues and honest hearts. All of them are good in their own respects but this review is looking at the core game, reviews for the DLC's will be on their respective pages or elsewhere.Fallout New Vegas is a game that is a game I will definitely recommend to anybody that asks.

 Fallout: New Vegas Alright, before you read the rest of my review let me get one thing straight, on the whole ""Fallout 3 vs. Fallout: New Vegas"" argument,  I believe Fallout: New Vegas is better  in my opinion Fallout: New Vegas is better than Fallout 3, now hold on, before you call me the devil himself,  I don't dislike Fallout 3 by any means  , it's still one of my favorite games of all time, I just believe that New Vegas is better. I'll be going over my reasoning for believing that New Vegas is better and generally comparing it to FO3 a lot.First of all we'll have to go over some pros for Fallout: New Vegas Fallout: New Vegas Pros  Improved Gameplay Mechanics: One of the biggest improvements over FO3 is the improved mechanics such as the widely improved crafting system, the weapon modification system, ironsights, nerfed VATS, gambling, and etc. Improved Character System Mechanics: Faction system, better karma system, almost no essential (unkillable) characters, hardcore mode Branching Storylines: One awesome addition was the branching storylines (I'll cover the FO3 storyline later) one great thing about the branching storylines was the replayability, I'm about the do my 4th playthrough of the game, the factions you could choose from are the  New California Republic, Caesar's Legion, Mr. House, and Independant Vegas.  Modding: The game itself is amazing, and mods just make it more enjoyable, fix bugs, or add more content, it's all there within the Fallout: New Vegas modding community. Fallout: New Vegas Cons  Bugs: FO:NV, just like any other Fallout game, or Bethesda games for that matter, are plagued with bugs. Whether it's clipping into the ground, mission glitches that make them uncompletable, or missing textures, even though a mod has probably been made or a guide that can be found with a quick Google search. Similarities: One problem I had when first playing is how it was too much was similar with Fallout 3 such as the user interface and it just felt like a Fallout 3 reskin at first. Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3 Comparisons  World Design: I personally like the vibe that FO3 gives off more than FO:NV, while New Vegas gives off a ""humanity rebuilding"" feel, FO3 focuses on the apocalypse more and I personally like that about FO3, when I was gambling in casinos on the New Vegas strip it sometimes felt like a Las Vegas Simulator. Storyline: So this was my main gripe with Fallout 3, it's storyline, you would think I would have some choice, in Fallout: New Vegas there were 4 different storylines, all with different missions, and even side missions would affect the endings Fallout: New Vegas Verdict  9/10  "

												If you haven't been diagnosed with ADD prior to playing Fallout New Vegas, you definitely will be after playing it. There are so many places to explore, people to talk to, and things to do that it's difficult not to get distracted. But the game remains fun even when you happen to run off on some wild goose chase because the story flows so seamlessly. It never feels like you are on some irrelevant side mission. I love the stress-free freedom to do what you want, when you want to do it.The game left me in awe as to how intricate virtual worlds like this can be experienced in such stunning detail--definitely worth spending my time and energy. Its biggest disappointment is the inability to continue character development and exploration once the main quest is finished. You are forced to load an old save...			"

												Difficult to say everything that needs to be said, so I'll start with the easiest thing. This is my favorite game. I thought that Morrowind or Fallout 3 would be very tough to surpass, hell even Elder Scolls Oblivion was a pretty comprehensive experience, but no, Fallout: New Vegas is a masterpiece of gaming. The core game is great, but when you add the DLC it really becomes a massively worthwhile experience. Lots of moral choices, lots of options in how you can approach the combat, plenty of customization, single player even lets you recruit companions and equip them as need be. The settings are masterfully done, and have plenty of variation. Some stuff can plain creep you out, and some can make you want to just stand for a few minutes and take it in.  If you want a fulfilling experience get this game and play through it. There are enough endings and your actions carry over through even the DLC, so its easy to play 10 times through and have just as many final conclusions that are distinct from each other.			"

												Compared to Fallout 3 (imo): more interesting storylines and quests, more weapons and customization options, better humour, more factions, more impact on decisions, better soundtrack (great music to have in the background, especially Big Iron by Marty Robbins), far more locations to discover, more active and living world and atmosphere, etc etc...I don't know what it is with this game, but it always draws me back to discover yet another thing, location, weapon, speech, Cazador, Deathclaw...I could play this game until I die and I would never ever get bored of it, that's how good this game is.This game is an absolute masterpiece!

												One of the Best Apolalyptic RPG games out thereStory 9/10Gamplay 9/10Replayable 10/10Achievement 7/10Fallout New Vegas is the fourth installment to the Fallout franchise. This game is a big step up from the previous game Fallout 3, one of my all time favourite games. It added more of a survival aspect and weapon upgrading to the already ideal nuclear apolalyptic world of Fallout. It seems that Bethesda wanted to take this game into more of a cowboy feel to it and  move away from the big city and the Brotherhood of Steel heavy power armour to the deserted Mojave wasteland with the NCR soldier look and The Legion Roman battle armour. Adding new and old weapons to aid on your journeybut still keeping the same look and style of Fallout 3. This game uses idea and references from the previous game studio Blackisle Studios plan for their Fallout 3 before Bethesda rebooted the franchise with more of a first person shooter.The story can be told in many ways and the actions that you take on your journey as the courier, the choices that you make truly make your character to survive the wasteland.At this time the game is easy and cheap to buy the game and all the DLCs and not break the bank but adding more whispers in the wind of the Mojave wasteland from the  science labs of Big Mountain to the cloud ridden get away Sierra Madre to the forgotten Divine, or to travel to an untouched land where the trees are green.I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys the idea of apocalyptic worlds where you are the creator of your free will.Cause.War, War Never Changes.

												Fallout: New Vegas is easily and undeniably one of the single greatest games of all time (at least in my opinion). From the moment Ron Perlman mutters the simple opening line to the point in which you look back upon all that you have accomplished before your final decision at Hoover Dam, you experience a world filled with colorful landmarks and memorable people. On the surface, the game and its world seem crude, dirty, and vulgar but once that surface is cracked and you look inwards, you see an arrangement of mysteries and philosophies all waiting to be explored and experienced. Unfortunately, nothing can be perfect, every shining jewel is tarnished in some way or another- and in the case of New Vegas? The game is broken and unstable. You can not spend an hour in the game without experiencing the consequenses of an incredibly low budget and a development time of less than 2 years. Clipping issues, assets becoming distorted, quests not allowing you to progress, and so on. Not to mention the crashing. The game has some of the most insufferable crashes, often forcing you to sign out or restart your PC entirely. The final drawback of the game is its graphics. The game is ugly. It recieved no enhancement over Fallout 3. In fact, a noticeable percentage of assets and textures are borrowed directly from its predecessor. Of course all of these problems listed can be fixed with one simple method: mods. As one of the most heavily modded games of all time, its very difficult to run out of content, whether it be vanilla or added in at your discretion. Six years later and I still play this game regularly, and I'm hoping that Obsidian is given one more chance at the helm of the Fallout franchise.(Oct 2016) Nvidia and Windows have made this game absolutely unplayable. Can't even load a save, the game just automatically crashes. Thanks for the memories, New Vegas. We will never forget you			"

												This review is titled: In My OpinionFallout 4:Pros: The most exploration of them all, best combat, a large city enviornment without borders, the best leveling system, base building, Far Harbor, best crafting systems and customization, most interesting companions (and are not completely broken mechanically), most badass power armor, most brutal survival mode, best setting. Not green or orange.Cons: THE ABSOLUTE WORST DLC (literally a rip-off except Far Harbor), almost zero amount of roleplaying (I dont care about that anyway tbh), you get the achievements and never play again, a slightly more classic aesthetic feel to F1-F3 but still odd like New Vegas.Fallout New Vegas:Pros: Roleplaying, decision based main questline with multiple branching paths, lots of replayability, best vault locations, best minigame (caravan), saving up caps actually matters, slaughtering factions you don't care about whenever you want, anti-material rifle (the most badass gun in any fallout game), most interesting easter eggs (and there are a lot of them).Cons: Cazadors, frustrating combat, small map size with a lot of forgettable locations, okayish DLC (some are better than others), cazadors, odd artistic style compared to F1-F3, huge amount of game breaking bugs at launch (i lost a 30 hour playthrough because of it), worst setting, cazadors, boring NPCs, Orange.Fallout 3Pros: Most memorable side quests, best plot of the main story (imo), most badass brotherhood of steel, most classic artstyle, best radio music, best radio host, best score, most interesting NPCs, best overall DLC, feels like a post-apocalyptic world, lots of locations that have depth and multiple zones.EDIT: I forgot to add Liam Neeson to the pros section because I mean... do I need to explain?Cons: Downtown is chopped into chunks that require hours of subway exploration to access different areas, large map however everything is very spread apart, more replayability then Fallout 4, but still not as much as Fallout New Vegas, NO STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS, runs like crap on Win 7+, I believe you cant aim down sights not 100% though on that, Green.

												Even with Gamebyro bringing it down, this is a pretty good Fallout 3. Just think of the series as Fallout 1, Fallout 2, Fallout New Vegas, and occasionally Fallout Tactics and you'll do ok.			"

												This game is great, but it also has many, MANY BUGS AND GLITCHES. Pros: - Good Story - Many Quests, a lot more than Fallout 3 - Great Weapon Variety -  Good and bad voice acting - Many Followers - References to the previous fallout games - The best dlc's i have ever played - Many different paths and factions to follow - Great locations and level design  Cons: - Bugs, frequent crashing, glitches - Terrible Gunplay, you will probably rely on vats for many battles - Bad Graphics, terrible for 2010 - Character Creation is lackluster, your character will most likely not look like you  I know i probably missed many things about this game, but this is what i came up with. I recommend this game to anybody who enjoys the fallout series and the dev and published Bethesda, then this is a must have game. If you enjoy western rpg's there is no better developer and publisher, however this is developed by Obsidion, and is made in a different sort of mood than Fallout 3. This game is bright and interesting. Fallout 3 can be interesting, but it is most often dark and gloomy. This is great game that anyone who enjoys rpg's should buy.			"

If you have a little spare money i would pick this game up, it has nearly endless playability. Even without dlc its still a great game that I've played religiously recently. PS. it says that I've only got 2.1 hours, but i have aroud 1 or 2 hundred hours in offline.			"

												First review in quite some time, but I'll keep it more short and simple.This time, Fallout: New Vegas!Holy S#!% I love this game. The Fallout franshise has ceased to dissapoint me. However, New Vegas has to be my favorite. I just don't know, the characters and amount of content are just plain baffling to me. I spent HOURS trying to ally the Boomers and Brotherhood of Steel. I put my all into saving Goodsprings and Novac. It's just that these characters are great to love, like the King or Benny.  Graphics in this game are pretty alright too. My laptop set the game to medium, so I didn't really experiece the fullness of the detail, but it still looks great.Although there are several bugs, I haven't found anything gamebreaking, and that's just normal in a game.Fallout: New Vegas is possibly one of my favorite games of all time, and you may love it too.I totally recommend this masterpeice.9/10-Dynamic			"

												Really loving this sequel to Fallout 4™,they improved a lot by adding different types of ammo,even craftable ones,more skills,skill checks in dialogue,they even added a survival mode where you actually need to drink,eat and sleep! Really surprised that Bethesda being the masters of innovation that they are,didn't think of that for Fallout 4™!Conversations are more fleshed out,the characters are interesting,really loving the writing in this,which improved a lot,so huge props to the writing team over at Bethesda™!They even added the ability to holster weapons and have them attached to your body which Fallout 4™ didn't have.Overall very good game,improved a lot on Bethesda Game Studio™'s most ambitious game ever!

Fallout: New Vegas is a Post-Apocalyptic RPG that is a great change from common Fantasy-Themed RPGsIn the game you play as a courier about 200 years in the future where america has been turned into a Post-Apocalyptic radioactive wasteland by a war with China in 2077. Small towns dot the lands, while remnants of large cities are ridden with bloodthirsty junkies and criminals. While there is so much danger in the world, there is one gem that sticks out and attracts wealthier people from all around: New Vegas. A city protected by a mysterious overseer called ""Mr. House"", New vegas contains gambling just as much as dirty criminals and squatters.You were delivering a package for the Mojave express when you were shot in the head and buried alive by scheming businessman and had your package stolen. You wake up in Goodsprings, a quaint town on the very outskirts of New vegas. The doctor patches you up and sends you on your way. Your Mission: find the man who tried to kill you and get revenge. On your way, you may be having to decide the fate of New Vegas, and maybe, the world.The Pros:The gameplay stays true to regular RPGs, with a balanced level system but a low cap at level 30. The game is easy to get used to and does have a more challenging mode for when you become a veteran at the game. Hardcore Mode is a mode that increases the difficulty of the game by giving ammo weight and adding hunger, thirst and the possibility of sleep deprivation. I dont reccomend playing on this mode on your first playthrough, but is a fun twist on the traditional game. The arsenal of guns is truly AMAZING, some obtainable through with expensive purchases while others you may have to do some hunting for. there are a large variety of locations in the game and there is even more if you buy the DLCs. All of them are great in my opinion but you may want to pick up lonesome road and old world blues before any of the others. Both give you interesting new areas to explore and cool storylines (lonesome road is a direct continuation of the story!) and maybe up to 10 hours each of additional gameplay. The game also has an INSANE amount of mods and a great mod community. Head over to the Fallout New Vegas Nexus for most mods.The Cons:The Graphics are a little dated since it uses the same engine as Fallout 3. The Game also does have a long tutorial period for learning the game, Which can almost stop you from replaying the game a third or fourth time. The ""Dead Money"" DLC is absolutely horrible, full of ugly puzzles which make you feel like you're not even playing Fallout, More like a horrible and buggy indie stealth-puzzler. The vanilla game is also buggy, some that can even stop you from progressing in the game.Despite these cons, Fallout NV is a great Shooter-RPG to pick up, and a cheap one at that! I give it an 8/10.

												""The New California Republic needs YOU strong!  Do not eat irradiated food!""Having played through Fallout 3 twice over the course of the past half of a decade, I was looking forward to giving Fallout: New Vegas a go but I always seemed to forget that it was in my library when I was choosing what my next 'main game' was going to be.  Finally, with the announcement of Fallout 4 being released in the near future, I pulled it together and started it up with the goal of completing it before the new release.  I was not disappointed.Fallout: New Vegas feels like a standalone expansion to Fallout 3.  However, this particular standalone expansion brings so much to the game that it may as well have had a 4 slapped onto the end of the title.  The roleplaying aspect is drastically improved with a faction alignment system, a balancing of the skills (all of them are extremely useful throughout the game now), and an incredible and deep storyline that alters the world and the ending based on choices that you have made throughout the game.  As opposed to saying that I enjoyed the story as I did in Fallout 3, New Vegas pulled me in and didn't let go until I'd finished the game in its entirety.The more action-FPS aspect of the game was significantly improved in this iteration as well.  Fighting outside of VATS seemed much smoother this time around and was genuinely enjoyable as opposed to merely acceptable.  Crafting was completely overhauled with several different skill lines unlocking hundreds of recipes that were invaluable at differing stages of the game.  The lands around New Vegas were a blast to explore and seemed packed full of life from one side of the map to the other.  Every trip I took across the wasteland resulted in discovering a new location to explore, a caravan being ambushed by the dreaded Caesar's Legion, or any number of other events that were a breath of life in the world.A great game, and one of my favorites now, that I highly recommend to RPG, FPS, and Post-Apocalyptic fans. I'll definitely be taking at least one more trip back into New Vegas to see what other events, quests, storylines, and endings I can discover by signing on with one of the other factions in the game.

The game loads to the main menu but crashes when I select continue or new game. A window pops up that says the game has stopped working. Bummer.UPDATE:With an outdated driver installed this game works again. It is a great game if you're willing rollback your driver anytime you want to play it. A spicy ravioli dropped some knowledge on me to use 368.81 nvidia driver and my particular problem was solved.			"

												Orth, 3000 years in the future. The planet is a radioactive wasteland inhabited by ska-criminals, sentient rat mutants, and Fearum's deadly Waster clan. The Daybringer is the proxy agent for extrasolarian reverse-aging gas-cloud lifeforms which intend on re-arranging the events of all timelines so that only one timeline remains, freeing up valuable multiverse real estate. Jack and Jill are the most advanced paired AIs ever conceived, on a mission to sift through memories and sort out where and when The Techno Device is. Dzang-Sarang is an extradimensional refugee hoping that the other half of his body shows up at some point. The ruthless Praetarch Unless has made a deal with The Daybringer to spare this timeline, but at what cost? Dr. Tuce Dopeshow is the only man who has a handle on what's going on but he's been dead for centuries. You are Abe Stahl, a salt-and-pepper haired grifter who just wants a root beer.

With excellent writing, memorable characters and great locations, the Mojave desert is a joy to explore. Luckily most of the major bugs that were present at release have been ironed out, both in official and community patches.Also, if you play any of the DLC, make sure to check out Old World Blues. Fantastic piece of expansive content.New Vegas comes highly recommended from me to you if the Fallout universe appeals to you.			"

												A lot of people don't like this game as much as Fallout 3, but in my opinion I find New Vegas better than FO3. Like FO3, you explore a large wasteland and take on different quests, explore different locations, encounter different people/creatures/things trying to kill you, etc. I like New Vegas more because of its larger selection of weapons, cool DLC (My 2 favorites are Old World Blues and Lonesome Road) and a vibrant modding community that adds even more weapons, gear and the like. Also, there's a Hardcore mode where you really have to pay attention to your hunger, sleep and radiation levels, as well as not lug so much ammo around (ammo has weight in Hardcore mode).			"

												""Best game ever"" - Was my first review for this game but I have decided to write a little more because why not. This game was my life for a while. I play through 3 game disks on Xbox when it came out, then I bought it on Steam and played around 72 hours on it. It's an Open World RPG game and It is one of Bethesda's games, which if you have ever played any before you know that it will be a really good game. Very similar to Fallout 3 except not as much of a big game, but still lots of stuff to do and have fun with. Little bit of glitches now and then but for the most part (as long as your not climbing mountains lol) you'll be fine. Now go play it because it's great!And just so everyone knows Fallout 3 is very hard to run on modern PCs. It is quite old and will crash and glitch up and stuff like that, so I suggest you buy this one first and if you find a way to make Fallout 3 work then buy that one later. Hope this helped people :D			"

												Fallout has always been rugged and uneven, both as a series and as individual games. The first two titles regularly feature on the greatest games lists despite the unfinished, buggy and censored-in-EU nature of the second game in particular, which at the time gave a sadomasochistic mix of pain and pleasure. The legend is justified, of course, with complex mechanics married to equally complex storytelling. The original vision mixed surreal elements and pop-culture references with pitch-black realism and a psychotic wit. The series was awoken from slumber by Bethesda with Fallout 3, which met with success and acclaim at the time, triumphing over the scepticism of the community. Whatever the merits of 3 as a game, it was ultimately undone by paper-thin, artificial writing with the finest elements being simple allusions to what came before. With New Vegas Bethesda did the best possible decision by giving the development duties to Obsidian Entertainment and the brilliant veterans within. New Vegas is a classic Fallout in the good and the bad. The game was released in an incomplete state to say the least, with a rotating head greeting players in a moment of true horror comedy... with many such moments following. Apart from the glitches there was much cut content which the mod community has done its best to restore. This is all classic Fallout indeed as is fortunately the game beneath the problems. Instead of merely repeating or referencing the previous entries Obisidian chose to reimagine the Fallout as a post-apocalyptic Western, building on tradition without being trapped in it.The gameplay is by and large the same as in 3, with added subtleties, some of which were inspired by Fallout 3 mods. The optional Hardcore mode made food, water and sleep vital which was a pleasure-adding limitation. The perk tree was changed more and the skill tree a bit less, mostly for the better. Crafting is fun but not always necessary and stealth is simply much too powerful. Chems and alcohol give extremely useful boosts and addictions are so easy to cure that The Courier will most likely spend most of the game high out of his mind, yet reasoning calmly all the while. Certain perks are virtually mandatory with other ones being useless if not outright broken. Charisma is infamous for being the dump stat with virtually no use, Karma does not affect anything, a high Speech skill outweighs all the in-game roleplaying choices, the difficulty slider is both crude and shallow -- et cetera, et cetera ad nauseaum. There is only so much mods can do.But while the mechanics can be criticized to no end New Vegas is a truly great game, one no games lover should pass. Whatever ""it"" is, the magic that makes any great game an another world, New Vegas has it. No magic can be dissected and analyzed but one can try to describe it. Thinking back on my time in the Mojave it is the people I remember, from the dignified to the funny... and the brutal. The articulate megalomania of Caesar, the resigned and humane smart-assery of ghoul mechanic Raul Tejada and the swanky sociopathy of Benny are all unforgettable, as is Mr. New Vegas, the greatest gentleman to ever grace the radio waves. Even secondary characters like a certain ghoul prophet or an extremely likeable Elvis impersonator leading a gang of Elvis impersonators leave a permanent impression. The DLCs follow suit, with Joshua Graham in Honest Hearts being a personal favorite. He has a history of atrocities he tries to atone for but finds it easiest to do so by committing even more atrocities. He describes his antagonist, the raider chief Salt-Upon-Wounds thus: ""He is a butcher. I feel the godless fire burning in him well, for I have felt it too."" Joshua wants to kill the things he does not accept in himself, which is a very human thing to do, for better or for worse. All these characters are given true life by a cast that can only be described as unique. There are the famed veterans, such as Keith Szarabajka as Joshua Graham but then there are many unusual suspects like Kris Kristofferson as Chief Hanlon or Wayne Newton as Mr. New Vegas that all make me wish they would find alternate careers in voice acting. This applies in particular to the greatest surprise in the cast, Matthew Perry as Benny. This is his only VA performance to date but he brings such reptilian, smooth-talking calculations to the table it is very nearly enough to make one think he has been miscast all these years in his other work. As for the graphics, sounds and much else the only thing that needs to be said is that there are mods for it all, more than enough to make the game your own. The DLCs are some of the best I've seen, the survival-horror-meets-casino-heist of Dead Money and the loopy Old World Blues being equally great for their very different reasons, with the always underrated Honest Hearts being my favorite of the bunch. (There is a fourth, Lonesome Road, but I have yet to play it.) The mods also fix all the bugs and the glitches and the JSawyer mod rebalances the game extremely well. Given the package price at which New Vegas sells the only conceivable reason to not play is the damage it will do to your free time. New Vegas may not have been developed by Bethesda but is nonetheless the greatest ""Live another life, in another world"" gaming experience associated with them.			"

												I LOVE this game, I enjoy its world, it is well written, it has good quests, it has a lot of choices, and every choice has consequences during the game or at least in the end, the story DLCs are good, it has also a lot of bug (Bethesda + Obsidian ... ), fortunately almost all of them can be avoided or addressed with a console command or using the right mod			"

												A good game to introduce players to first person shooters. Also recommendded by veteran players for the free and open world style of the game. Sure, there is a main plot; but with so manu side quests, factions to choose from, decisions to make, and areas to explore this game is wel worth the investment as you get many hours of game time and high replayability. This game will run on windows 8 and 8.1 as well.			"

												I have looked at this game in my review list for months, of all the titles in my back catalogue Fallout: New Vegas is by far the most daunting. I feel that regardless of to what extent I praise FNV, I will still not be doing it justice.Fallout as a series has grown from some seriously humble roots, and what it has become is one of the finest post-apocalyptic open world RPGs to date. The world is alive, desperate, detailed, immersive and a true wonder to explore. Within this incredible world are some of the most spectacularly realized NPCs and stories ever conceived by Bethesda. The last time I remember being so aware of the lives around me was when I first played Morrowind.As if the vanilla game wasn’t amazing enough, the modding community is seemingly limitless. From tower defense, to a first person shooter overhaul, to countless add on stories and scenarios, there are hundreds if not thousands of hours of content to lose yourself in. The ultimate kicker here is that Fallout: New Vegas is CONSTANTLY on sale. And not just dinky 15% off specials, during any given steam sale, FNV is almost always on sale for 2 or 3 bucks at some point. At this price, it is absolutely ridiculous not to pick up this masterpiece RPG.			"

												If I had one word to describe this game I would choose Spectacular! A lot of people have criticized this game because it had a smaller map than Fallout 3, that is a terrible reason to talk badly about this game. Yes the map was smaller but the locations in the map were amazing. It was super fun to be able to explore all of the casinos. In quite a few of them you could even get your own room.Pros:One of the Best games of all time!Beautiful vegas setting!Lots of new weapons and combinations!Several different endings that you can choose!Only $10 retail and $2.50 during some sales!Cons:There aren't any unless the smaller map bothers you!All in all this is a 10/10 game and for only $10 it is literally a steal. Seriously no other game on steam with a retail price of $10 is this good! If you haven't played it you are missing out! "

												I really am in love with this game and the fallout series, just to put my bias out there. Pros:-Great storyline-Many likable and rather ""hateable"" characters that will manipulate your emotions and affect your choices-Karma and repuatation gives the game another layer, plays on your conscience constantly. -MASSIVE amount of weapons, armors, clothing, chems, ammunition variations, that can either give you an advantage or mess your day up!-Enemies' levels remain constant, so some areas may not always be comfortably accessed which really encourages you to level particular skills that may give you an advatage.-The wasteland is HUGE, maybe not as big as it was in Fallout 3, but it is big with many places to discover-Full nexus mod manager support, which gives this game so much more life; you can expand the selection of items, skills, perks, and game mechanics. Give the entire mojave a makeover, or implement zombies, the choice is yours! The modding community is very much active and helpful. Cons:-Game crashes. You will have a few, guaranteed. Not sure if there is a memory leak or not, the game does have a spike in RAM usage when loading new areas. I have 8GB and have not really had many issues at all. I personally only had crash issues related to mod usage. Friends' crash issues are with the vanilla game, do not know why. I think I can remedy any issues with a 16GB RAM upgrade. -Sometimes there will be bugs where you may not be able to access particular dialogue that will activate the next part of a quest, this has been rare in my experience and can only be remedied with a load to a previous save. So on that note, save often. -Without atmosphere mods (Neveda Skies is one of the best, also various ENBs are pretty cool) the vanilla atmosphere does not carry the same feeling as Fallout 3. I don't know if this was intentional, I get the impression that game-makers where trying to show an america where the world is very much accustomed to the new-world. -Not an issue for me, but the game can seem slow at times.Overall, this is an amazing experience that I recommend to anybody who has a little patience. The game gives the land of fallout, another breath of fresh air, which has been welcomed and embraced by many.Edit: Now have 16 gigs of RAM. No crashing issues what-so-ever.			"

												Very few games have grabbed me the way this one does. There's just so much to do, and that's before you start dabbling in mods of which there are many excellent choices, no matter what it is you're looking for. Yes, there are bugs. But by now the majority of them are hammered out, at least in my experience. New Vegas Script Extender and New Vegas Anti-Crash are must-haves and greatly improve the game's stability. The key here is exploration. Put one foot in front of the other for a little while and you're bound to find something cool to get involved in, whether it's a hostage situation in a ruined city or a showdown in a little desert town. The combat is quite fun, but it's the standard fare. You have guns, there are guys over there and ♥♥♥♥ those guys. Speaking of guns, there's an assload of them. Pistols, shotguns, rifles, assault rifles, SMG's, sniper rifles and even energy weapons, though I myself prefer conventional firearms, the energy weapons are still pretty badass. The storytelling in this game is superb, with little details everywhere. The story of The Survivalist in Zion Canyon is amazing to read through and experience as you seek out his journal entries across the little hideaways he's established throughout the area. There's also the little things like finding a skeleton laying on a bathroom floor in a tophat clutching a revolver that makes you wonder just what that poor guy's story was. The game manages to be dark and hilarious at the same time which is a tough balancing act to pull off.Overall this game is excellent and will draw you in and not let go. You'll be stuck on this for hours and hours and you'll love every moment.9/10			"

												Wow this is a good game. This was my first fallout game and I loved it. Now that I play other ones I see how different they are. Like in Fallout 3 companions have karma requirements which sucks. The music is one of the best parts. The mojave is big and sometimes empty and desolate. But the music helps with that even if it is. You don't know how often me and one of my friends starts singing I've got spurs that Jingle Jangle Jingle... Another good thing is companions, I love all the different companions. my only complaint is that you could have had more at one time. Also good job on rex and not making another dogmeat, like somebody! (Fallout 4) The main part I love about the game is how good it is to explore. At the beginning you can just explore and find random things and places. But once you hit level 20 you can get the explorer perk and do some hardcore hunting of places. For the traits in the game all I ask of you is to get the wild wasteland traits. It really adds to the game so just do it. Also get Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition you get all the DLC's and it's just better. Also before buying it though check if it will play on your computers because some people say it won't, just fair warning. It may look like I don't have much time on it but that is because it doesn't count offline time.			"

												So, you might have come here because people were telling you to get this instead of Fallout 4, or because you want a Fallout that respects the lore of the original titles; well, you're in luck. Because this is possibly the best First-Person Fallout yet, and it makes Fallout 3 look like an amateur mod.Fallout: New Vegas puts you in the role of a guy/gal known as the Courier, who was shot by a man wearing a checkered tuxedo and your mission is to find where he is, and why he tried to kill you but on your way, you will be involved in the war between the expansionist New California Republic and the totalitarian, autocratic slavers known as Caesar's Legion; and you get to decide who takes control of the Mojave Wasteland. Who would you want to control the Mojave? The NCR? Caesar? Yourself? Or do you want to keep the status quo? These choices, and many others will matter as your actions even from the beginning will influence how the Mojave Wasteland turns out in the end.Pros:-Excellently crafted story: I'd probably say that the story in this game is perhaps the best Bethesda has ever got in a long time. Especially since your choices very much will matter, from start to finish.-Excellent world: Is it empty? A little, but it feels alive even compared to Skyrim. I might be a little biased for thinking the Mojave Wasteland is better because I have watched westerns growing up.-Gameplay improvements from Fallout 3: While vanilla gunplay isn't the best (Project Nevada improves it http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40040/?), New Vegas has fixed a lot of FO3 including improving ADS and companions. The companions you meet are now more meaningful rather than just mere mercs you met along the way, Veronica being my favorite character.-Mod support, and there's plenty of excellent quest mods too. Suffice it to say, I think the quest mods in Fallout: New Vegas are more worthwhile than most of Skyrim's.Cons:-Bethesda bugs. You will need NVAC to fix the crashing (http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53635/?).-Despite an excellent story, the final mainquest was anticlimactic.What can I get to improve the combat system to be more in line with 2016, you ask?Project Nevada - http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40040/? The big one, adds dynamic FPS crosshair, grenade hotkey, visor overlays, bullet time (FEAR and Max Payne-like), sprinting and other things that we know from our favorite shootersReal Recoil - http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62153/? Improves the game's recoilMore Realistic Aiming - http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40652/? It actually makes a difference1st Person Weapon Animation Overhaul - http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61501/? Makes the game's FPS animations look better, and adds optional featuresJIP Selective Fire - http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/49478/ Remember alt-fire like in Half-Life 2? Well, this mod kind of adds that.EVE - http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42666/ Adds more death effects.Lazarus Project - http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61824/? Adds more features to the game which can be disabled, including the weapon wheel, Half-Life style ladders, hitmarkers, etc.IMPACT - http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62050/? Another mod which makes combat feel more alive.Rudy ENB - http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/55076/? Actually adds dark skies. Works with vanilla weather. Actually makes a difference in combat too with that immersion crap and all.Overall, I would recommend following a STEP guide if you're starting out modding or if you wanna try something new; like Fear & Loathing (I'm currently mostly using that one): http://wiki.step-project.com/User:Essarrbee/FalloutNewVegasOverall score (vanilla): 9.5/10Overall score (2016 mods): 10/10			"

AMAZING its truly amazing and worth your money. THE TECHNICALSglitches, glitches, and glitches, occassionally it crashes, but it really is worth it.  sometimes it IS bland and sometimes it feels like it was a bit rushed. i think this game should have had much more play testing and and been development for at least 4 more months. the graphics are a little dated, especially now, and sometimes the actors did not put enough enthusiasm in their acting, but danny trejo, yuri lowenthal, and a few other big name actors fir the roles amazingly. i just hope this makes more people want to join the profession, because Yuri had too many roles. but he did good.THE PLOTit's an original and welcomed addition to the fallout franchise, in my personal opinion, it's better than FO3 in almost all aspects, as i mentioned earlier the acting beats FO3 and most AAA titles. but only for the time period. and it is kind of hard to actually talk about the plot without spoiling the experience.to me at least, this was a show well worth my money, and a gamble worth taking, Fallout: New Vegas, gets a 9.5/10 and Fallout 4, bring it on! :)			"

I think I can remedy any issues with a 16GB RAM upgrade. -Sometimes there will be bugs where you may not be able to access particular dialogue that will activate the next part of a quest, this has been rare in my experience and can only be remedied with a load to a previous save. So on that note, save often. -Without atmosphere mods (Neveda Skies is one of the best, also various ENBs are pretty cool) the vanilla atmosphere does not carry the same feeling as Fallout 3. I don't know if this was intentional, I get the impression that game-makers where trying to show an america where the world is very much accustomed to the new-world. -Not an issue for me, but the game can seem slow at times.Overall, this is an amazing experience that I recommend to anybody who has a little patience. The game gives the land of fallout, another breath of fresh air, which has been welcomed and embraced by many.Edit: Now have 16 gigs of RAM. No crashing issues what-so-ever.			"

												""Best game ever"" - Was my first review for this game but I have decided to write a little more because why not. This game was my life for a while. I play through 3 game disks on Xbox when it came out, then I bought it on Steam and played around 72 hours on it. It's an Open World RPG game and It is one of Bethesda's games, which if you have ever played any before you know that it will be a really good game. Very similar to Fallout 3 except not as much of a big game, but still lots of stuff to do and have fun with. Little bit of glitches now and then but for the most part (as long as your not climbing mountains lol) you'll be fine. Now go play it because it's great!And just so everyone knows Fallout 3 is very hard to run on modern PCs. It is quite old and will crash and glitch up and stuff like that, so I suggest you buy this one first and if you find a way to make Fallout 3 work then buy that one later. Hope this helped people :D			"

												THE GAMEwonderful. Truly amazing, I wish this wasn't so underrated, it is a classic, the characters are great, the plot is great, the gameplay? AMAZING its truly amazing and worth your money. THE TECHNICALSglitches, glitches, and glitches, occassionally it crashes, but it really is worth it.  sometimes it IS bland and sometimes it feels like it was a bit rushed. i think this game should have had much more play testing and and been development for at least 4 more months. the graphics are a little dated, especially now, and sometimes the actors did not put enough enthusiasm in their acting, but danny trejo, yuri lowenthal, and a few other big name actors fir the roles amazingly. i just hope this makes more people want to join the profession, because Yuri had too many roles. but he did good.THE PLOTit's an original and welcomed addition to the fallout franchise, in my personal opinion, it's better than FO3 in almost all aspects, as i mentioned earlier the acting beats FO3 and most AAA titles. but only for the time period. and it is kind of hard to actually talk about the plot without spoiling the experience.to me at least, this was a show well worth my money, and a gamble worth taking, Fallout: New Vegas, gets a 9.5/10 and Fallout 4, bring it on! :)			"

												I really like this game. You have the freedom to do almost everything. For example exploring, killing raiders, doing quests etc. It's like a huge sandbox survival game with an epic story. The choises you make in the game will depend on how it's going to end which I like. I recommend playing on hardcore to make the survival more realistic and also to download some graphics/performance mods via Fallout Nexus to make the game more beatifull, smoother and more epic. This game is a must If you like apocalyptic games!			"

												This is the best RPG game I have ever played.- This game gets tons of quest and places to explore, places that are very fun to explore and could also be very rewarding.- The story of this game is also very good, you can play this game 4 different times for 4 different walkthrough and 4 different endings.- There are also a lot of factions with there own uniqe questline. - All character in this game get a unique background and are fully voiced, this result for hours of just listenning to the NPC words ( who get extremely well voice acted).- The game get a great stroy background (happand in a different universe thanks to few different changes from our choices in our universe).- This game happens in a post Apocalypse world - this caused to a lot of different unique Creatures that can only be found in this game.- Huge open world with the ability to explore it all from the start.- this game can be Challenging - it gets few bosses and Creatures  that are powerful( you may need to use tactics to overcome some of them).- this game get hardcore mode that make your game even tougher for a open world hardcore gamers.- Lots of great mods that can make your gamplay even better.In my opinion this is the best game I have ever played and it gets the most actual playtime that I played in a game, the only con in my opinion in this game is the AI but this is barly noticed as this game is so good.Words can't descrive how much I enjoyed this game and how good this game is - it will make you wait for fallout 4 every single day.My score - 10/10 (run to buy this game)			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is a game built with the elder scrolls engine, making it extremely moddable. The community is still active, spitting out mods every couple of days. Some of the mods are crap, some of them are worthy of the title: ""Mod of the Year"". While the elder scrolls engine is known for its bugginess, the bugs are usually either patched or you can get a mod to help with them. If you've played fallout 3 and are expecting more color than that, I assure you that the stock game doesn't have more color. The game changes from fallout 3's greens, greys, and browns to orange, tan, and red. While on the topic of changes, a new feature is ""Hardcore Mode"" which can either be used to amp up the difficulty for some of the more hardcore gamers, or add a new element to the game for replaying the game. As far as guns go, the base game has a solid selection, but each gun can only have 3 mod slots and most guns don't even have three mods. My reccomendation is to grab WMX(Weapon Mods Expanded), which happens to be a mod, to remedy this. Although it doesn't add more mod slots, it makes sure that EVERY weapon has 3 mods for it. If you miss some of the guns from Fallout 3, go ahead and grab the Fallout 3 weapon pack(also a mod), which i just recently found out has added the Rock-It-Launcher, a Fallout 3 favorite. If you've completed the main game or just want more content, you can either buy some awesome DLCs or look for mods. There are some awesome mods that add entire storylines, factions, and even advanced functionalities. The main location to find mods is either ModDB or The Fallout NV Nexus[www.nexusmods.com]. Great game, great buy!			"

												New Vegas is a huge improvement over its predecessor, Fallout 3. The dialogue is not written by children this time, but actually has depth and meaning. The main story leaves quite a bit of room for player choice, although the Caesar's Legion line is a bit thin and should have had more quests. The companions all have their own personality, story and connected quest(s). The DLC packets are varied and connected to the main game's world and story, but I wouldn't have lost any sleep over not having Honest Hearts.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is a game set in the Fallout Universe, with the Oblivion/Gamebryo engine. It is in full 3D and you can play in 1st or 3rd person. This is a deep RPG with plenty of moral choices, tons of weapons and equipment, lots of locations and side quests, as well as a main quest line with multiple solutions / choices, and tons of companions. You are the Courier, left for dead in a shallow grave in the middle of nowhere. You recovered and want to find out why they robbed you and why you were saved. You will end up exploring the Wastelands around New Vegas. The Fallout RPG system is in full effect, and the background is pretty amazing. There are also 4 DLCs that adds more quests, and when you're done with those, there are user-created mods available. This game is easily worth HUNDREDS of hours playing, more if you try out multiple characters with different specialities, and should not be missed.			"

												Fallout has always been rugged and uneven, both as a series and as individual games. The first two titles regularly feature on the greatest games lists despite the unfinished, buggy and censored-in-EU nature of the second game in particular, which at the time gave a sadomasochistic mix of pain and pleasure. The legend is justified, of course, with complex mechanics married to equally complex storytelling. The original vision mixed surreal elements and pop-culture references with pitch-black realism and a psychotic wit. The series was awoken from slumber by Bethesda with Fallout 3, which met with success and acclaim at the time, triumphing over the scepticism of the community. Whatever the merits of 3 as a game, it was ultimately undone by paper-thin, artificial writing with the finest elements being simple allusions to what came before. With New Vegas Bethesda did the best possible decision by giving the development duties to Obsidian Entertainment and the brilliant veterans within. New Vegas is a classic Fallout in the good and the bad. The game was released in an incomplete state to say the least, with a rotating head greeting players in a moment of true horror comedy... with many such moments following. Apart from the glitches there was much cut content which the mod community has done its best to restore. This is all classic Fallout indeed as is fortunately the game beneath the problems. Instead of merely repeating or referencing the previous entries Obisidian chose to reimagine the Fallout as a post-apocalyptic Western, building on tradition without being trapped in it.The gameplay is by and large the same as in 3, with added subtleties, some of which were inspired by Fallout 3 mods. The optional Hardcore mode made food, water and sleep vital which was a pleasure-adding limitation. The perk tree was changed more and the skill tree a bit less, mostly for the better. Crafting is fun but not always necessary and stealth is simply much too powerful. Chems and alcohol give extremely useful boosts and addictions are so easy to cure that The Courier will most likely spend most of the game high out of his mind, yet reasoning calmly all the while. Certain perks are virtually mandatory with other ones being useless if not outright broken. Charisma is infamous for being the dump stat with virtually no use, Karma does not affect anything, a high Speech skill outweighs all the in-game roleplaying choices, the difficulty slider is both crude and shallow -- et cetera, et cetera ad nauseaum. There is only so much mods can do.But while the mechanics can be criticized to no end New Vegas is a truly great game, one no games lover should pass. Whatever ""it"" is, the magic that makes any great game an another world, New Vegas has it. No magic can be dissected and analyzed but one can try to describe it. Thinking back on my time in the Mojave it is the people I remember, from the dignified to the funny... and the brutal. The articulate megalomania of Caesar, the resigned and humane smart-assery of ghoul mechanic Raul Tejada and the swanky sociopathy of Benny are all unforgettable, as is Mr. New Vegas, the greatest gentleman to ever grace the radio waves. Even secondary characters like a certain ghoul prophet or an extremely likeable Elvis impersonator leading a gang of Elvis impersonators leave a permanent impression. The DLCs follow suit, with Joshua Graham in Honest Hearts being a personal favorite. He has a history of atrocities he tries to atone for but finds it easiest to do so by committing even more atrocities. He describes his antagonist, the raider chief Salt-Upon-Wounds thus: ""He is a butcher. I feel the godless fire burning in him well, for I have felt it too."" Joshua wants to kill the things he does not accept in himself, which is a very human thing to do, for better or for worse. All these characters are given true life by a cast that can only be described as unique. There are the famed veterans, such as Keith Szarabajka as Joshua Graham but then there are many unusual suspects like Kris Kristofferson as Chief Hanlon or Wayne Newton as Mr. New Vegas that all make me wish they would find alternate careers in voice acting. This applies in particular to the greatest surprise in the cast, Matthew Perry as Benny. This is his only VA performance to date but he brings such reptilian, smooth-talking calculations to the table it is very nearly enough to make one think he has been miscast all these years in his other work. As for the graphics, sounds and much else the only thing that needs to be said is that there are mods for it all, more than enough to make the game your own. The DLCs are some of the best I've seen, the survival-horror-meets-casino-heist of Dead Money and the loopy Old World Blues being equally great for their very different reasons, with the always underrated Honest Hearts being my favorite of the bunch. (There is a fourth, Lonesome Road, but I have yet to play it.) The mods also fix all the bugs and the glitches and the JSawyer mod rebalances the game extremely well. Given the package price at which New Vegas sells the only conceivable reason to not play is the damage it will do to your free time. New Vegas may not have been developed by Bethesda but is nonetheless the greatest ""Live another life, in another world"" gaming experience associated with them.			"

While Fallout 3 transitioned the series into the modern era, New Vegas takes it back to its story routes.While Fallout 3 was a somewhat lonely hike through the Capital Wasteland, New Vegas is a vibrant wild west shooter. There are a lot more side activities to do, such as gambling and faction tasks.With multiple choices in the main quest, New Vegas also possesses major replay value. A definite must-buy for any RPG fan.			"

												War. War never changes. Except for the occasional crash and bugs, but that's typical of a game with little development cycle.Fallout: New Vegas is a first-person action RPG, much like its predecessor, Fallout 3. Developed by Obsidian Entertainment, it is set in the Mojave Wasteland, closer to where the original games were set. Your customizable character’s a Courier, shot and left for dead by a man named Benny interested in a package you were delivering. Following through your trail for revenge, you find that the major factions in the region--The New California Republic, Caesar’s Legion, and Mr. House--vying for complete control of the Mojave wasteland. It’s up to you whether or not any of the three, or yourself, would take over the Dam.The NCR is a lot like the US, both the good and the bad. Most of the time, they mean well. In the game, they spread out a lot, using up quite a bit of their resources to cover their new land in the process. This puts them at a disadvantage after the first battle at the Dam against the Legion. Caesar's Legion, in theory, is supposed to be the Roman Empire. But it's filled with misogyny, homophobia, and slavery. There's Mr. House, an expy of Howard Hughes. While he wants to improve humanity in his own way, he's extremely ruthless in his dealings. And there's the Wild Card path, where you set the Mojave down a path of independence and anarchy, alienating the other main factions in the process.In addition, there are four major DLCs (Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues¸ and Lonesome Road), each having its own story, and two additional DLCs (Courier’s Stash--pre-order bonuses--and Gun Runners’ Arsenal—more weapons).I really enjoyed the game largely due to the writing, along with a lot of replayability. However, I feel that there was a lack of real motivation deciding which faction to assist in taking over Hoover Dam, and I felt that your character lacked a bit of personaity compared to other RPG characters. Even the Lone Wanderer had plenty of personality (c'mon. ""No. ♥♥♥♥ you.""). As mentioned earlier, there were a lot of game-breaking bugs, especially at launch. But thankfully mods and patches had gotten rid of them, but a few of them are still there, so mind where you travel.Because of the small development cycle, there are plenty of missed opportunities, like exploring Legion territories and continuing the game after the second battle of Hoover Dam. My suggestion for this game? I would recommend getting this game and its DLCs, which is easy to do with buying the Ultimite Edition. But do take your time on the Nexus; they got plenty of mods that'll enhance the game immensely.			"

												After the wide critical acclaim and finacial success of Bethesda's Fallout 3, it was only a matter of time before a follow up was to be produced. This follow up developed by Obsidian Entertainement would not only meet fan expectations across the board but raise the bar of quality and world building for Western RPG's as a genre. What makes New Vegas a great game compared to it's contempararies is the level of depth and thoughtfulness when it came to presenting it's setting. The people, towns, and factions are all handled incredibly realistically, to the extent where each settlement has it's own food source and way of income. Comparitively in Fallout 3, such details are completely glossed over, leaving some very impractical settlements scattered about the wasteland. Since this game uses the same engine as Fallout 3, Obsidian had the luxury of improving where they Bethesda left off. As a result, players have the ability to aim down the sight of their weapons, switch between different ammo types, weapon modding, companion quests/companion perks, and a hardcore mode which offers even more gameplay mechanics to the mix. Personally, I'd say my favorite aspect of New Vegas is the thriving mod community that continues to still produce more content on already 100 + hour experience.If you're into games that present world worth engaging yourself in as well a wealth of opportunities for player expression, then New Vegas is definitely worth the purchase. Easily one of the best games of last generation.			"

												A good game to introduce players to first person shooters. Also recommendded by veteran players for the free and open world style of the game. Sure, there is a main plot; but with so manu side quests, factions to choose from, decisions to make, and areas to explore this game is wel worth the investment as you get many hours of game time and high replayability. This game will run on windows 8 and 8.1 as well.			"

												This is one of my favorite games!I finished once, but it was a long ago. Now I'm doing it again, and man, it seems a new game.The only cons that I got is when you are playing in Hardcore mode the AI is kind of buggy sometimes. Like when you're trying to kill a Cazador, man, that darn insect flies at the speed of light. And sometimes when you're in a combat, some enemies seems that they came from the Matrix movie, they dodge your bulllets so fast that you can't see it.But, despite that, the game is awesome, even better when played in Hardcore mode.I totally recommend it! :)			"

												If you like FPS-RPG crossovers, this is a quality game to pick up. Turn on true iron sights, install a few mods in the standard practice for Bethesda-engine games, and save often. I'll include a list of my choice mods at the end of the review.Do save often. Bethesda-engine games are notoriously unstable, and this (built on Oblivion's engine) is no exception!However, the game has good writing, plays fluidly, and delivers an enjoyably varied experience - especially if you play throught he DLC as well. Highly recommended for fans of Fallout who are not purists at heart (the series has diverged from its isometric RPG roots).I recommend the following mods:- Underwater Vault Home New Vegas edition (UMHNV) or Afterschool SpecialThese are housing mods with a quest to earn their housing. UWHNV requires NVSE (New Vegas Script Extender) and Afterschool special does not. NVSE is worth installing - there are other mods that use it, and it's an invisible modification. (I use the last Beta version, 4.X something and it works well.) UWHNV basically allows you to move the entrance of the home wherever you like and includes a beautiful sorting and display mechanism. Afterschool Special allows you to take over and convert the school in the first town to a home that is simple, compact and effective as well as pretty.- RHK Companion CureCorrects an oversight in Bethesda/Obsidian's companion mechanism, allows you to cure posion in your companions, which is much better than the base mechanics.- Perk Every Level and Unlimited TraitsThis shifts balance somewhat, allowing the player to build as many of the game's provided traits as desired during character creation. (All of them are tradeoffs of one sort or another.) In my case, I didn't want to forego Weird Wasteland because I chose traits that suited my vision of your character. Perk Every Level will build a more powerful character, but also free you from some of the tyrrany of having too many good options or having to ruthlessly specialize into one playstyle.- DLC: Old World Blues is the best of the set, followed by DLC: Lonesome Road. The others are certainly not bad, but do not live up to these two. If you get the GOTY edition, you'll get them all, but if you're forced to choose, go with these.- Other mods, like texture and model replacers to taste.What you like will vary. I recommend installing the Nexus Mod Manager, and using it to manage your mods as painlessly as possible (everything except NVSE which must be manually installed).Get it. Get it now. Enjoy it.			"

												One of my favorite games of all time. Love the fallout franchise. This game has great new add ons and mechanics that make it better than fallout 3. Such as hardcore mode for the real fallout gamer! Or aiming down sights, a better quest line, factions, Very good dialogue, etc.. Even though the feel of a post apocapliptic wasteland isnt as good as fallout 3 its still a great game. The modding on it is outstanding also. Highly recomend buying this at the steam store!

												Good ol' Fallout New Vegas! Let me start off with saying, I love this game. Now I know quite a bit of people which prefer Fallout 3 for its more post apocalyptic feel and just being how fallout 3 was, however I prefer this game. Now, although I will admit I have never played the original Fallout 1 and 2, I do know a fair bit, and really am looking forward to playing them, and from what I know, if you want to continue off from where Fallout 2 ended, or just want to get into more of a lore feel, this game is for you, not putting down Fallout 3, but it wasn't near the location of fallout 2, making it a lot harder to continue on the growing factions and people like Fallout New Vegas did. But if you're just here for fun, add mods and it can double the fun a lot of the times. There are some downsides to this game however. There are some technical issues, stutter, crashing and etc, but when looking past all these, its a damn fine game. However this is just my oppinion.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is a game set in the Fallout Universe, with the Oblivion/Gamebryo engine. It is in full 3D and you can play in 1st or 3rd person. This is a deep RPG with plenty of moral choices, tons of weapons and equipment, lots of locations and side quests, as well as a main quest line with multiple solutions / choices, and tons of companions. You are the Courier, left for dead in a shallow grave in the middle of nowhere. You recovered and want to find out why they robbed you and why you were saved. You will end up exploring the Wastelands around New Vegas. The Fallout RPG system is in full effect, and the background is pretty amazing. There are also 4 DLCs that adds more quests, and when you're done with those, there are user-created mods available. This game is easily worth HUNDREDS of hours playing, more if you try out multiple characters with different specialities, and should not be missed.			"

												New Vegas is a huge improvement over its predecessor, Fallout 3. The dialogue is not written by children this time, but actually has depth and meaning. The main story leaves quite a bit of room for player choice, although the Caesar's Legion line is a bit thin and should have had more quests. The companions all have their own personality, story and connected quest(s). The DLC packets are varied and connected to the main game's world and story, but I wouldn't have lost any sleep over not having Honest Hearts.			"

												I figured I'd finally review this game. This is coming from someone who had trouble getting into the Fallout series for years: This game is a gateway drug to the series.I love the setting, the characters, and the plethora of interesting mods that have been out for the game for a long while now. You can choose to join a legion of Trump supporters...I mean dangerous barbarians bent on wiping out the new civilization around New Vegas, the new military which has broken and divided leadership but means well for the people....or you could just screw them both over and go the independent path. There are plenty of fun side quests and DLC that will give you hours of immersive entertainment.			"

												Fallout NV just one of those games that you can play forever (or untill you've killed everyone on the map).The main story and quests were awesome and interesting, but there're a few side-quests (''Beyond the beef'', ''Come fly with me'', ''I forgot to remember to forget'' etc. )  and DLC content that I've found far more interesting than the main story itself, especially the ""Lonesome road'', which in my opinion could be easily one of the main quests in the game. Also i really love the fact that some of  the DLC have some characters that're connected to other characters in other DLC's, and because of this fact the Mojave Westland and the people surviving in it becomes even more interesting world to explore. Oh, and how could i forget the fact that when you reach levels 30+ you're starting to feel like an indestructible war-machine that can do and destroy whatever the ♥♥♥♥ he want. and have a LOT of fun doing it.Fallout NV is jsut one of those games that just throw you into their world, and never let go.

												I have never written a detailed game review. I have written lots of reviews, but their short and generic. I am so enamored by this game i am going to write a full reviewFYI, I have not beat the game, or havnt even really touched most of the places or characters or quests. But after 25 hours with so much to do, I feel I can accuratly review the game.Overall Impressions:If you don't want to read a very detailed review of the game, just read this. If you want a detailed review (although u shouldnt be reading reviews and be clicking that buy now button) scroll down a bit. First off, I have not played FO3, so I have no way to compair weather its a better game than that or not. I had heard about fallout and the mascot for me was easily recognizeable when it came out, but I never had much of an intrest in the game or rpgs. Fallout:NV came out and when my friend got it for Xbox 360, I watched some and it looked interesting, but i was into other games and didnt want to play it. last christmas, while it was on sale, I purchased skyrim, my first rpg taste. Now I realize skyrim isnt as much of an rpg as FO but it got my feet wet, and I loved the setting, being an insanly big Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones fan. However, i LOVE EFFING SKYRIM TO DEATH. That made me go wow! I bet Fallout is awesome if Skyrim is this good! So i saw it on sale over haloween and i picked it up along with the witcher, payday 2, dmc4. I played mostly pd2 and dmc and witcher and kinda forgot about FO:NV. However, when I did, I wasnt just hooked like i was 2 skyrim. This became the most fun, and overall meaningful game to my playing to date. All of the options are great, there are a lot of different factions all fighting and weaving in and out and picking some sids but not others is fun and challanging. I havn't touched hardcore mode yet but I bet its fun, I just want to focus on enjoying the game right now before I go shoot myself haha! Anways this game is amazing and a MUST OWN. Now onto specificsGameplay:+Many weapons+GORE+V.A.T.S. system is a great and not overpowered.-spritingThe gameplay itself is good, it feels good to shoot and the slight waver in your hand adds to the realism and I personally liked the added challenge. However, not being able to sprint, while not bad, can be annoying as I wish I could rush from cover to cover. I give gameplay 9/10Visuals:+Has moments of beauty+Destroyed wasteland is great and it all affects the mood of the game-runs on old engin so graphics look mostly outdated-character models look a bit stiff to meThis game is 4-5 years old and still looks good! However, it does look outdated and abovementioned stuff 7.5/10Story:+SO Many options+tons and tons of ways to progressTo me the story so far is great. Every faction is interesting and your personal story is very cool. The sidemissions IMO are better than main ones, but the main missions are great so thats saying something. 9.5/10Final verdict:9.5/10This is my favorite game of all time. That doesnt mean its a perfect 10. It has a lot of bugs and outdated models, but the game itself is what keeps me going. Anyway thanks for reading!HODOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												If you can get over the plentiful bugs, weak engine, and disgusting graphics, you will find a real treat. Departing from the traditional Fallout scene of 1950's cold-war-turned-hot retrofuturism, this strong western post-apocalyptic story starts with you getting shot in the head, and it gets worse from there. Not gonna get into the story, what I am gonna get into is how EVERY decision you make WILL affect the ending. If you look after your companions and help setllements, they will get happy endings that will bring tears to your eyes. If you don't, you will get a sour tale that will break your heart and make you want to try again. You can feel a real connection to everything, and it makes you want to explore and take different paths more and more.Don't even get me started on the DLC. They even connected that to the main story. You can ask chars in different DLC's what the think about the whole thing. So much detail and so many options are simply nonexistant these days.11/10. I mean it. Above and beyond. We will never get a Fallout game as good as this again.			"

												When New Vegas came out, late 2010, many billed it quick as a mere ""data disk"" of popular Fallout 3. Six years later, not only it vastly superceedes Fallout 3 in every aspect, but proves itself worthy even compared to brand new Fallout 4. The writing and choices are superb (usual masterwork by Avellone himself) and the feeling of being part of postapocaliptic Mojave is unsurpassed. I reccomend this heartfully, but please apply adequate modding (the plain vanilla experience is quite... jaggy).			"

												This is currently the Steam game I spent the most time with. It added some interesting new features compared to Fallout 3 like better companion management and crafting. The story is not bad and has a lot of references to the older Fallout games. First I did not really like the game's main factions (Cesar and his Legion, Mr. House and the Strip) because I thought they do not fit too well in the Fallout universe. But later in the game when you get some more background information it plays out well. As with most Obsidian games also this one has some bugs and glitches. In my case the game sometimes crashed while saving or loading which forced me to restart and reload. No save games were harmed though. All in all a good game which I recommend to all Fallout fans and everybody that likes to explore an interesting open world. Comparing it directly with its predecessor I have to say I liked Fallout 3 a little bit more though.			"

												This is by far the best RPG game i've played in a long time. Your character serves purpose in this world. You kill, and people will start to see you differently whether it be good or bad.Quests are mutilayered with optional sub-quests. I love how everyone in this world is killable, regardless of being a quest giver.Of course it's not recommended to kill everyone you meet, but the fact that you have that choice makes this game feel more like what an open world RPG should be.I also love that killing is not the only option of getting quests done.As you level up you can increase your various skills.some skills such as speech and bartering can be used in conversations with NPCs.With a high enough speech skill you can persuade people to see things your way, instead of having to put a bullet in their head.Of course this doesn't apply to every person you meet who is shooting at you. Anywho, If you have the cash get this game. it's well worth the price and from what i've been told this blows Skyrim out of the water. ♥			"

												Post-apocalyptic RPG, based in a medium-large size wasteland. Quests are great, some of the best I've seen, multiple methods of completion, makes you feel like your choices have meaning. Fun first-person shooter with some cool weapons like lasers and awesome enemies like deathclaws. Music is usually enjoyable, sometimes a tad repetitive. Best part has to be the mods though, lots and lots of mods, mods for everything.			"

												I could find no fault in this game. I have always loved the Fallout series and this one definintley did not disapoint me. It felt like the true sucessor of the Fallout franchise. I am not saying that 3 wasn't great, but I felt New Vegas was in the same vein, at least story wise, as Fallout 1 and 2. I have played this game mostly on my xbox, but the PC version is just as good to me.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is a game built with the elder scrolls engine, making it extremely moddable. The community is still active, spitting out mods every couple of days. Some of the mods are crap, some of them are worthy of the title: ""Mod of the Year"". While the elder scrolls engine is known for its bugginess, the bugs are usually either patched or you can get a mod to help with them. If you've played fallout 3 and are expecting more color than that, I assure you that the stock game doesn't have more color. The game changes from fallout 3's greens, greys, and browns to orange, tan, and red. While on the topic of changes, a new feature is ""Hardcore Mode"" which can either be used to amp up the difficulty for some of the more hardcore gamers, or add a new element to the game for replaying the game. As far as guns go, the base game has a solid selection, but each gun can only have 3 mod slots and most guns don't even have three mods. My reccomendation is to grab WMX(Weapon Mods Expanded), which happens to be a mod, to remedy this. Although it doesn't add more mod slots, it makes sure that EVERY weapon has 3 mods for it. If you miss some of the guns from Fallout 3, go ahead and grab the Fallout 3 weapon pack(also a mod), which i just recently found out has added the Rock-It-Launcher, a Fallout 3 favorite. If you've completed the main game or just want more content, you can either buy some awesome DLCs or look for mods. There are some awesome mods that add entire storylines, factions, and even advanced functionalities. The main location to find mods is either ModDB or The Fallout NV Nexus[www.nexusmods.com]. Great game, great buy!			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is a game set in the Fallout Universe, with the Oblivion/Gamebryo engine. It is in full 3D and you can play in 1st or 3rd person. This is a deep RPG with plenty of moral choices, tons of weapons and equipment, lots of locations and side quests, as well as a main quest line with multiple solutions / choices, and tons of companions. You are the Courier, left for dead in a shallow grave in the middle of nowhere. You recovered and want to find out why they robbed you and why you were saved. You will end up exploring the Wastelands around New Vegas. The Fallout RPG system is in full effect, and the background is pretty amazing. There are also 4 DLCs that adds more quests, and when you're done with those, there are user-created mods available. This game is easily worth HUNDREDS of hours playing, more if you try out multiple characters with different specialities, and should not be missed.			"

												Clearly one of the best Bethesda games.Upsides______________________________________________+Awesome sound+Awesome main storyline + sidequest's+Own choises+Cool followers+Atmospheric+Perk's/Upgrades+Exploring!+Names (very creative names on, persons, quests, items and so on)+Nice gear+Moddable+Dialogues = perf (and voice acting is also good with some exeptions)+Pritty little secrets here & there(there is many more upsides but these are the ones that I just love this game)Downsides______________________________________________-Bugs-Crashes The buggs and crashes can be and crashes can be annoying but if you aren't an compleet idiot you can see that the upsides can be worth the trouble.Simply another huge succes from Bethesda since this is one of the best games ive ever played in my life. And I know I only have 34 houers or so (by the time this reccomendation was made) and I wish that ive would have spent more time on this game since it no doubt deserves it.Although I have one regret....Not buying the Ultimate Edition, do that for me please. Only 19.99 euro thats ♥♥♥♥ing sick.Anyway before I end this recommendation I would like to throw out an little apology for any bad spelling/grammars, spelling in English isen't my strongest side.10/10 would get hooked on med-x again "

												New Vegas is a huge improvement over its predecessor, Fallout 3. The dialogue is not written by children this time, but actually has depth and meaning. The main story leaves quite a bit of room for player choice, although the Caesar's Legion line is a bit thin and should have had more quests. The companions all have their own personality, story and connected quest(s). The DLC packets are varied and connected to the main game's world and story, but I wouldn't have lost any sleep over not having Honest Hearts.			"

												Probably my favorite game of all-time. A small slice of post-nuclear Nevada is your playground, with hundreds of well-written, fleshed out characters. Quests in almost every area, dozens of unique, fun weapons and armors, and the ability to play precisely the character you want. A bounty hunter? Done. Brotherhood of Steel♥♥♥♥♥♥who robs everyone of their advanced tech? You got it. Or maybe an alcoholic with 2 INT and skills in Unarmed? Why not. TONS of replay value. Plus, the modding community is active as hell. Be warned that thanks to Gamebryo, the game is quite buggy (Not as bad as the console version, though) and obviously doesn't look that great. Nothing some mods can't fix, though. Happy trails, courier!			"

												TL/DR: 9/10A different take on the franchise, New Vegas takes you into the west. One of the most appealing RPGs for a broad audience. If you play shooters, this game has alright shooting mechanics with true iron sights, unlike Bethesda's Fallout 3. If you like traditional RPGs, this is still a great addition with impactful dialogue trees and awestruck stories. You can side with three different main questlines, each with amazing characters and vibes. If you don't like the graphics, get some mods. Game can look better than Fallout 4 and still be 6 years old. If you don't like the vanilla weapons, armor, textures, npcs, voices, there are thousands of mods online that change just that with specific rifles and companion mods. The level-up system is very impactful, every single perk you can choose can bend the game. To name a few, you can be able to create ammunition out of broken weapons,  to repair a hunting rifle with a different rifle, and many more. I've sunk over 400 hours into this game and I can't say that about Fallout 4. This game is truly a masterpiece by Obsidian Entertainment and should set the bar for other RPGs. 9/10			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is a open word post apocalyptic role playing game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda Softworks. The gameplay itself is very simlar to Fallout 3. New Vegas took Fallout 3, and gave it a new location, and vastly improved game mechanics and player choice. I think there is nothing wrong with that. Some people do not like New Vegas because of this. While it is true that New Vegas is quite reminiscent to Fallout 3 , it is not a reason to jump to conclusions and assume that the game is not good because of this. Fallout: New Vegas is an amazing game. It has tons of freedom and choice, and it lets you do whatever you want to do. The game even set up the Intro to the game in a way that you can decide who you are. You are a player with no past and have no memeory of anything. This leaves massive space for role playing. I can be a badass sheriff in one play through. In another playthrough, I could be a cold blooded asassin looking for revenge, that will do anything he needs to get what he wants. In creating a backstory for your character, your imagination is the limit. The quests in this game also do not fall short of great. There are many choices within the game, when it comes from choosing how to deal with a faction, choosing which faction to side with, choosing to kill everyone you see etc. Some choices will even test your morals and you will never really know if you made the ""good choice"" Speaking of good, there's another thing to mention. None of the factions in New Vegas are just good. There is no plain good faction, or plain evil faction, as they are all debatable. The political side of New Vegas is sort of morally grey. Each faction has their good side, and they also have a bad side to them. It is up to the player to make the final descision which faction they will side with. The game even shows you a slideshow before the credits showing you all of choices you made, and the outcome or consequences of those choices. It really does make you feel mixed emotions depending on how you played the game. The game also has great and memorable music, that will get stuck in your head right away! Since there are 4 factions to side with in the main quest, and tons of role play oppertunities, this game has tons of replay value. This game is a must have for any PC owner. Excuse my hours on the game, I played a lot more hours on the consoles before I had a PC. If you do get it, I recommend you get the Ultimate Edition with all the DLC, because the DLC is great, and if you are going to mod the game, a lot of mods require you to have all DLC. Good luck and have fun!I give this game 10/10 spurs!			"

												So what do I personally think of  ""Fallout: New Vegas?""  Well, I think this is probably the best Fallout game I've ever played. Simply a masterpiece for the Fallout universe that fits so well, with a new main questline nearly totally different from Fallout 3. SPOILER, GO! ->  Except they both sorta still involve water at the end... Sorta.  With even some new creatures, and a new look at the way I saw Super Mutants, which in comparison to the once in D.C., they're just so... beautiful.  *Slow tear drop*  So if you like horror games, Fallout may just be your ticket to a few new scares from Cazzadors, Radscrops, or even Ghouls! Then you have NPC's. As there are hundreds of dumby NPC's like there are in every Fallout that lack every bit of social skill, there are a large amount of interesting characters with interesting names apart from ""Novac settler."" These characters with names such as Easy Pete, Mr. House, Ceaser, President Kimball, Boone, ED-E, and more are all unique. So every time you meet someone new in the game, expect a new personality to communicate with! Each one apart of a faction. Well, almost. But thats right! Because in this game there are loads of factions to choose from. Factions that each may just change the political map of the Mojave for the entire Fallout universe. Things you do have an impact on your character, the Mojave, factions, and just everyday Wastelanders. So if you wanna make it suck, you can probably do that. Wanna make it the next safe haven of happiness? Feel free! The choices are yours in this game. No need to really prepare for the future, because you're the one who shapes it here! Just be sure you're the proper level before hitting New Vegas. Especially do the same before you get any of the worth-while DLC as well. So for me, all of this just adds up to be my absolute favorite of the Fallout universe, since Fallout, to Fallout 3, and to now Fallout: New Vegas. *Cough* But still your average bugs of course. Pay no mind to them. *Cough* Note however this is all from past experiance on the PS3.			"

												Fallout New Vegas is yet another game about Skyrim with guns, but this one is different, and in a lot of good ways, the world created is a charming yet surprisingly deep land of politics and interesting characters all around.Instead of writing an essay about this i'm going to create a list of Positives and Negatives, I know when you're just looking to see if a game is worth playing you usually don't want to read all that much.Positives- The story always seems to be moving forwards and never seems to slow down always introducing new and interesting characters to meet.- The art style is beautiful, the world in general is extremely bright and colourful and everything is outline with more of a red tone than most games, this helps to differentiate its style from the crowd and really makes it a pleasure to view.- The characters are all interesting and I always found myself wanting to learn more about them and their origins.- The relationship between Boone and his wife is great.Negatives- The relationship between Boone and his wife might turn off some viewers.- The 'shooting' dynamic is interesting in some areas but it does get rid of some of the tension from certain battles.- The game ends on an extreme cliffhanger- Sound was nothing special.I would recommend New Vegas to most people if only because it is extremely short at this stage, it won't take you long to power through the 30000 quests, however if you don't like cliffhangers you should definitely hold off on playing New Vegas			"

												Surprisingly, this game was heavily criticised by Fallout fans, for being no where near as big as Fallout 3. Personally, I think New Vegas is the better of the two, and here's why.New Vegas, whilst it isn't as large as Fallout 3, still packs an awful lot of content into it's self. Whilst most of the map is a barren landscape, New Vegas is FULL of hiden quests, items, easter eggs and just swarming with things to do.Whilst it doesn't add much new to the Fallout series, in no means does it feel like a Fallout 3 copy. The story is great, full of twists and turns and most importatnly, player options. You get to choose how you want the grand finale to go, wheter it's the easiest way or the hardest. After you complete the main Act's, you still have a ton of places to explore, quests to solve, and DLC to download!My only problem with this game, is linked quests. For example, to progress one Main Act quest, you must complete either a very long side quest, or various little side quests that usually offer no impact on the player or story. This is not a fun way to play, and it feels like the game is forcing these quests on me, rather than letting me have the freedom of choice, like the title the game holds dear to its self.+ Story is very interesting, player involvement heavily influences it+ Hundreds of hours of content, including 6 DLC expansions+ You really feel as if you make in impact in the game universe+ The Wild Wasteland perk. Nuff said.- Alot of grinding is required for some parts of the game- Enforced quests are not fun- AI is sometimes sloppy, but nothing too major9.5/10			"

												Fallout: New Vegas, oh boy where should I start? Probaly a short bit about the story.WARNING! IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET THE GAME SPOILED DON'T READ BEYOND THIS POINT! The game takes places in the mohave wasteland, an area around the remains of las vegas after the great war. Your a courier on a mission to deliver a mysterious platinum chip to the city of New Vegas, but your stopped by a man called Benny and his crew. They want the chip your delivering, so they knock you out and ties your hands so you can't fight back. When you wake up you see Benny pointing his trusty gun at you and shoots you in the head twice, they leave you for dead but you get saved by a mysterious robot known as Victor and he takes you to doctor Mitchel in the town of Goodsprings. Now you'r on a journey through the mohave wasteland to take back the mysterious platinum chip and get revenge on the man who tried to kill you.               Pros:                    + Good Soundtrack On The Radio Stations                    + The Story Is Amazing                    + The Humor In Some Parts Of The Game Is Really Funny                    + You Can Mod The Game To Your Hearts Wishes                    + The Detail Put Into The Game Is Just Splendid                    + The Graphics, Its A Improvment From Fallout 3              Cons:                    - You Can't Really Sprint But There Are Mods For This That Adds It.                    - Companion Ai At Times Loves To Block Doorways Infront/Behind You. Well thats about it for me, for me this game will always beat fallout 4 story wise, and I would truly love to see obsidian entertainment make another fallout game like this one day. I give Fallout: New Vegas a 9.5/10, If your a fan of Bethesda games or just First Person RPG's This game is for you.			"

												Warning: Disliking this game is punishable by death.Methods of execution include being forced to take part in a ""lottery"" by Caesar's Legion, viciously mauled by a literal pack of Deathclaws, swarmed by poisonous Cazadores, or being thrown off Hoover Dam. Fun!So take the superb writers and designers who were behind the original two Fallout games (who also did other great RPG's like Planescape: Torment and KOTOR 2) and mix it with the gameplay of Bethesda's Fallout 3. The result is a game that, at first, is a bit annoyingly linear, but opens up later once you eventually find your way into New Vegas itself. But you also get a game that is overflowing with sidequests, dark humor, and neat little bonuses found all over the world much as you would in Fallout 2. In fact, there is so much to do here I am not positive I've actually seen everything there is to see in this game despite having 100% completed it.Obsidian, of course, is a developer that is rather infamous for bugs in their games, and there are some to be found here as well. As usual, save early and save often just in case something breaks or crashes, but usually that won't happen too often. It will probably happen more if you fill this game with mods like I and many others love to do, but that's something you will have to accept because mods make this already great game even bigger and better.So if you like the Fallout series, you... probably have already played this, actually. If you haven't, then you should. Otherwise you too might find yourself digging a shallow grave in the middle of the Mojave desert. o_o			"

If you loved Fallout 3 (as I did) then get this and play it, its more of the same although a weaker main story and much more buggy (pop in no matter how powerfull the PC, crashes on occasion).  If you havent played Fallout 3, then play that first before playing New Vegas.			"

 Fallout New Vegas: THE GAME THAT FALLOUT 3 SHOULD HAVE GOD-DAMN BEEN! Where, do I even start on this beauty of the game? I guess I should state that this game, has everything that Fallout 3 stripped from Fallout 2 and them some. This game just absolutely masterpiece that Fallout 3 failed to be. Yet we have Bethesda Fanboys thinking Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 are the epitomy of gaming. (Seriously though, I don't mind if you like Fallout 3 and 4 but to be honest, I don't feel they are real Fallout games)Okay, this game improved the gunplay, by so much. Iron sights may not be much, but it sure does help when you are trying to shoot the thing with the biggest weapon or the biggest fists or the biggest pinchers. Not to mention, there are plenty of beautiful, powerful, and unique guns in this game PLUS plenty of actual Unique/Legendary weapons such as Maria, Esther, This Machine, Dinnerbell, Alien Blaster, AER14, etc. Also, all the guns handle greatly compare to the ones in Fallout 3 which had the spread of the circumference of Mars.How about the RPG elements? Well, let me assure you, this game actually has those AND has plenty of choices to make in the wasteland that effects who has a ♥♥♥♥♥ier life. Plus, this game has plenty perks and traits that affect gameplay to the point of changing the Wasteland overall. Goodbye Fallout 3's Daddy's Girl (+5 to Science, +5 to Medicine) and say hello to Cowboy (Increased damage to western themed weapons such as repeaters, revolvers, knifes, dynamite, and more.) Did I also mention you can flirt with a gay and gorgeous scientist name Arcade Gannon? (Of course, that's only if you are into that kind of thing.) New Vegas, is also, a more direct continuation off of Fallout 1 and 2 as New Vegas has many of the elements and ideas that Van Buren (the original and cancelled Fallout 3) had.The environment this time around however, is kind of boring. Aside from the town's and settlements, the game should just be desert simulator. Places like New Vegas, Primm, Goodsprings, The Fort, Hoover Dam, are all great but at that same time, the surrronding areas have very little to them to make them really unique and the game lacks that true post-apocolyptic feel that Fallout 3 managed to catch so wonderfully but the game explains why the whole Mojave Wasteland isn't a massive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Now, for the DLC's that come with this pack.Dead Money is a great idea, that was poorly executed. The game's crappy stealth and overall run and gun feel, makes Dead Money not so great. However, it's story and characters are great. The story is about how you and 3 others attempt to rob the Sierra Madre casino after being captured by a crazy old guy. I won't spoil anything because boy would I end up spoiling everything about this DLC. Aside from what I mentioned above the weapons are really good. The Automatic rifle (The WWII BAR) boasts a beautiful DPS and great feel to it. The Holorifle, is a quite different energy weapon that is pretty much a damage-over-time shotgun that fires slug holographic rounds at your enemies.Honest Hearts is probably the weakest DLC but is still good. Beautiful environment with a somewhat boring story but once again, great weapons. The story is this, 2 tribes are fighting over Zion National park, the Sorrows, and the White Legs. With the help the Dead Horses and 2 New Cannanites, they are able to hold Zion National Park. However, they can justt barely do this. You, who was involved in an accident involving a caravan, go and help, decide the fate of Zion. The weapons... Tommy Gun, M1911, Tomahawks, War Clubs. Enough said. Old World Blues is by far, the most outstanding DLC as it involves the long forgotten Big Mountian which houses the world's greatest minds. After the nukes fell, the never left Big MT and they lobotimized themselves to become robots. You are abducted by them and theyn forcibly lobotomized you. This DLC, addes plenty of amazing perks, weapons, and enemies to the mix in BIG MOUNTAIN! The place clearly feels ♥♥♥♥ing awesome! Robots everywhere and you are allowed all the weapons you can bring to fill them with holes or vaporize them. Let me just say, you will get plenty of new weapons that will help your build in some way. The dialouge and story, while crazyily stupid and comedic, can have it's momentsLonesome Road is the big finale. Journey into the  Capital Wasteland  Divide to find a mysterious character who just wants to talk. Or kill you. Or nuke your faction. Or steal your robro! Lonesome Road lacks in story and makes up for that in grand scale badassitude, weapons, and challenge. Let me just say you will be getting Flare Rocket Launchers, Shoulder Mounted Machine guns, and more and you are sure as hell going to need them against all those Deathclaws and Ghouls armed with the same weapons. Hope you enjoy playing as swiss cheese!New Vegas is amazing. Everything about it is just amazing. Better gunplay, better RPG elements, more interaction, a true choice to be Satan himself if you so please or the Messiah. New Vegas shows what can be done should Obsidian take control of the Fallout series.

 Fallout: New Vegas  It is a production created by Obsidian Entertainment in partnership with Bethesda Softworks. And so it should remain. The game is set in the Mojave Wasteland, and  we play as a Courier who was shot and rescued by a local robot and doctor. New Vegas area are embraced by the war between the New California Republic (NCR), Caesar's Legion and the inhabitants of New Vegas. The story is great and our every choice matters at the end of our story. Sound system as in any Fallout is great, but the songs are often repeated and can be boring. Fallout is guided by that we do not have to do the main storyline at once, we can go off to explore the area. And there is a lot to explore, some of the locations it may be a simple hut but sometime it may be a large warehouse or vault with his own lore and quests. List of weapons is huge. From the usual guns after laser or plasma equipment. There are also melee weapons. Graphically, its do the trick but you can always improve it through NexusMods. The game besides the normal mode its also offers a hardcore mode. It is much harder than usual because the game change into a typical survival game. Our character must drink and eat in order to survive in this world. In my opinion this is one of the best productions I played. Finally a game where our choices are important not like in a Telltale games or new Fallout. That is why I highly recommend this production if you still have not played it. I spent many hours in it and have no regrets because I had a lot of fun.  Lonesome Road  This is one of the best additions to the game. I highly recommend it is incredibly atmospheric and character Courier Six is very intriguing. Also, the location is really well chosen.  Old World Blues  In this DLC move to the Big MT research crater. It offers a large map to explore, although the story is good gameplay itself is boring also we can get to this location by incident with a low level and you cant laave this location until you finish the DLC so beware of satellite and and do not click on it. :D  Honest Hearts  Welcome to the Zion Canyon area which is a war between tribes. The story od this DLC is good as well as the character of Joshua Graham is a really interesting person. Map is quite a big but most locations do not offer a lot of experience.  Dead Money  The least popular DLC for this game. I do not know why I personally liked. We come around in the Sierra Madre Casino totally helpless and without our equipment. The game most of the time based on an stealth due to tough opponents. The story is pretty cool and a little creepy. Gun Runners’ Arsenal  Regular addition offering new unique weapons and challenges. And that's it.  "

												This is one of my favorite games on steam. I can't seem to decide which game is better this or Fallout 3.(EXCEPT THIS GAME HAS MORE REPLAY ABILITY) This games brings a lot to the playing field if you compare vanilla FO:NV to FO:3. New Vegas brings in the factions. You can be friendly with just about everyone to make the game easier but in being friends with say the NCR you are going to have to do alot that will  make the Legion mad at you. And factions play a huge role in whether or not you character is played the ""right way"" or wether it is not. For instance if you want to play a guns character NCR is probably the best way to go. If you want to play a meelee character I would say Legion. If you want to play an energy weapons character then I would say go with the Brotherhood of Steel/Independent(independent for the end of the game fighting the last part of the main quest on hoover dam with the robots on your side). Also this game doesn't bring back that many things from FO:3 its got some basic weapons but there are alot more guns to choose from making every playthrough unique. There is an endless possibility to the playstyles you can do, you can be a chem addict, you can be a justice fighter fighting off of your own moral code in a city of sin, you can be a mercanary, its endless. You can even choose to be the lone wanderer. Also karma doesn't really have that big of an appearance in this game. The only way it affects you is if (for example) your karma with the NCR is good they will be nice to you and they may let you do more things then if you were neutral, also some factions will give you free things with a good karma disposition to them. If you have a bad disposition to a faction then they will most likely make quests involving that faction much harder and they will probably try to shoot you in the face and once you get a bad disposition with them it is not an easy task to bring it back up. You have to do just about every quest with them for them to think ""this guys 'alright' I guess"" if you want it to go back up once its low. You will never really regain that sense of THIS GUY IS OUR SAVIOR. Also if you have good karma with a faction like the NCR then their rival, The Legion, Will not like you and they will hunt you down, this is both because the NCR will have yous fight the Legion, because you are just helkping the NCR and if you are wearing NCR armor. Now onto mods. There are many visual mods and gameplay mods and they add so many unique features. I would not reccomend a heavily modded game it tends to remove the Wasteland feel of the game. I would only reccomend asthetic mods and mods that do not affect game play unless you are using Project Navada. Gameplay affecting mods would be mods that add guns to the game or mods that make the geme ""harder"" or ""easier"", If you are having trouble doing a quest, press escape and navigate your way to the difficulty and turn the diffculty down. But dying is part of fallout and I would only reccomend this if you have died 5 or more times on the same objective. Also this game has Iron Sights, which I think is amazing. FO:3 only has a zoom that kept the crosshair and there weren't really any ""working"" mods that would add crosshairs, accept for RH_IronSights. And in FO:NV you can use crosshairs which make the gameplay so much more emersive. Also if you played FO:3 with the FOWE mod (fallout wonderers edition) then you should probably pick up fallout Nevada Project for fallout NV it will do just about everything that FOWE did. But I have a guideline that I like to follow for Fallout, If the mod you are downloading makes the game any easier, then don't get it. Trust me you will have more fun play this game casually with beauty mods and emersion mods. This just about concludes my review and recomendations for this game.*** REPLAY ABILITY LVL 100 SO MANY CLASSES MIX EM MATCH EM DO WHAT YOU WANT ITS GREAT SO MANY THINGS TO DO RUSH THE STORY OR DO ALL SIDE QUESTS GUNS OR MELEE LAZORS OR EXPLOSIONS ***I give it a solid 10 Nuka Cola's out of 10.Its like skyrim... with guns			"

												If you're a newcomer to the Fallout series or someone who is a fan of old fashioned RPGs, I would highly recommend New Vegas. Not many games make you feel like your choices have weight and impact the world around you. Political factions are portrayed objectively, each having positives and negatives. The theming and light anachronisms really make the game feel like a topsy turvy wild adventure. The modding community is massive too, so you'll be able to have even more hours of fun with this one. All in all, one of my favorite games, and one of the best I've ever played. More quests and more fun than Fallout 3. Between the way that the developers utilized the engine's resources, the established lore, and the mechanics imposed by Bethesda, I think they did a near as perfect job as possible in making this game. 10/10			"

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed.5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												having played Fallout 3 (did everything to do in that game and it's DLC..yes even Anchorage..) and having a reasonable time,i decided to tackle New Vegas..i didn't expect it to be good since i had problems with 3 but i was gladly wrong,where Fallout 3 suffered The Elder Scrolls problem of having only 4 voice actors for everyone but important characters and (yes hate on me for it) a crap story which i couldn't get into,New Vegas fixes most of that,better voice acting,better music,better AI,ALOT of improvements when it comes to combat(Vats isn't as essential anymore because you can f*cking aim properly now instead of having the gun on the right of the screen -_-) melee combat is a bit on the weak side still it's better than 3's,diffrent ammo types also help for more diverse playstyles,it's in my honest opinion just a direct upgrade from 3,it does almost everything better,the only thing i would like to have seen is more buildings you could enter,a thing i loved doing in 3 because almost every building had it's own little story,New Vegas is also a bit smaller as 3 but with the introduction of factions and the fact that it's more of a ""safer"" place than the Capital Wasteland(and thank good the Brotherhood of Steel plays a small role..) makes sense i geuss,overall i just like it alot more than 3			"

												Fallout is a great skydiving simulator.From an experienced skydiver I can honestly say that the games accuracy is astounding. Just put some headphones on and prepare to feel like you're falling from the sky! Keep in mind this is DLC (Downloadable content) for the orginal Fallout game. The sights of New Vegas while falling from the sky is amazing, though when changing the game to night mode, it's even better.I have yet to play the newer Fallout 2 or Fallout 3.			"

												Even after the release of Fallout 4, I still find myself coming back to this game.  This game is the best of the modern Fallout RPG's.  It improves upon some of the more lackluster elements of Fallout 3 by having some more interesting venues to explore and removing the annoying green tinge to everything in the Wasteland, but still keeps some of the best RPG mechanics of this game that Fallout 4 will do away with, such as the karma and reputation systems.  There's memorable characters and locales to be seen in this game, and it is well worth the price of admission.			"

												Never before has a game made me feel so at home like Fallout New Vegas.  The atmosphere, design, story, combat, strategy, mechanics, etc. blend perfectly togther into a delectable post-apocolyptic RPG cocktail.  It is more family to me than my own damn family.  Sure, mom packed my school lunches, but Fallout threw me a duster that didn't make me look like a tool, a plasma rifle, and said ""Here, my son.  Have a form of aimbot that makes sense and still doesn't ruin the skill aspect of the game.""  Honestly, there are so few games out there that have the kind of planning this game does.  Wanna shoot that store owner to get his nice hat? Have fun not getting the one modification you need for a perfect weapon later on.  Wanna shoot up a city?  You better have saved, becuase half of the quests in the game are probably in there.  Literally every action has a reaction in this game -- it's tough, it's gritty, and I love it for that reason.  Not to mention how well a 1950's sci-fi action movie was dressed up to be embodied by lucky players like myself.  Not only this, but lasers and beams are just as effective as bullets and javelins; it's all up to the player to decide.  So do you love story and atmospher just as much as gratuituos violence?  Good, Bathesda has that.  It's called Fallout, and it loves its community as much as its community loves it back.			"

												5/5 Adds some new flavor to what made Fallout 3 so epic.PROS:+ Same character customization we enjoyed in Fallout 3.+ New, southwestern U.S. environments. From the landscape to the local cultures to the unique political history.+ World is a bit larger than Fallout 3, spanning multiple territories across two states (southern Cali. and Nevada). + More colorful environments; gone are the dull, grey looking locales of D.C.+ Very diverse local factions, each with their own motives, pros, and cons.+ Plethora of side missions.+ Easy to keep track of main missions, even when veering off the main story.+ Modest hardware requirements; most PCs built after 2008 can run Fallout New Vegas.+ Steam version is fully patched to address earlier technical issues.CONS:- No multiplayer.- Same stuttery frame rates seen in Fallout 3 and Oblivion.- Windows only; no Mac or Linux support as of this review (07/2015).

												Absolutely loved this game, the setting, clever plots, and the interesting characters. With much tighter writing it provides plenty of the series' trademark black humor that Fallout 1+2 fans will remember. The only downside is that it still runs on the Gamebryo engine but Obsidian really did push the engine to its limits. Unlike Fallout 3, All the DLC's for NV are tied together; Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues and Lonesome Road, all adding unique settings and characters too each DLC. Buy the Ultimate Edition to this game and you will have hours upon hours of fun.			"

												War.War never changes.Except we actually have a active world and we can aim weapons! Anyways, Fallout New Vegas is a shining example of open world. You want to go to a NCR area and try and kill the troops for armor and guns? Go ahead, just good luck doing that. Or will you rush a cave filled with hard enemies to get that powerful rare weapon? Also, hardcore mode makes it so you have to eat sleep and drink, and as such it is a much easier game to roleplay.The nexus mod manager (or fomm if you want) will quickly become your best friend (and enemy) after your first playthough, as you can install many mods with ease.My main gripe with this game is that it is so BADLY OPTIMISED.Like jesus christ, my computer is rather beefy (can run bf3 1080p maxed, and bf4 1080p on medium with above 60 fps) and it still chugs like a fat person at the bacon buffet, also the lag spikes and glitches are really bad too, as you can go from a solid 60 to 10 just by walking around sometimes. Also the glitches can be super annoying, like a vital NPC will not talk to you, or you knowGet stuck in a cliff?This may be because I filled my game with mods. Great game, get it.Also DLCs are pretty good, just not as good at fallout 3's (in my opinion anyway)			"

												Perfect Gap ClosersFallout New Vegas is the second part of this series I have played. I played Fallout 3 at the first time on the PS3 and I was thrilled by this magnificent game.Introduction to Fallout New Vegas:Fallout 3 used a very good start of the game. He is very weak in Fallout New Vegas. Therefore, I was quite disappointed at the beginning.Graphics:The graphics have not improved particularly to predecessor. The architecture of the game is well done, but the value on good details has still not been set. There are also graphical weaknesses and some bugs. But this sloppiness can not really reduce my fascination.Gameplay:Also in this part of the genre will not change. It remains an RPG/Shooter and that's a good thing. Just as in Fallout 3 you find yourself in an open world. There are very many places to explore (estimated around 250). It is possible to pursue several ways. This results from the individual decisions in talks, behavior, clothing and so on. Depending on which factions you support results in small or large consequences. It makes a lot of fun thinking about which decisions you meet in order to achieve his personal goals and missions. Furthermore, the Hardcore-Mode is a realistic complement to the previous Fallout 3. Also the weapon mod system is an interesting innovation.Overall impression:Fallout New Vegas is an absolutely justified successor to Fallout 3. It includes all the RPG elements you could want. The genial atmosphere in the world has remained. This game can perfectly fill the gap between Fallout 3 and Fallout 4.Play Time (approximately): 40h-60hExtensions:                        - Dead Money                        - Honest Hearts                        - Old World Blues (best DLC)                        - Lonesome Road                        - Gun Runners ArsenalRating: 9/10			"

												One of the best Fallout games there is (until Fallout 4)Set in the Mojave, the game really does take the game back to its western roots with the original factions involved (Mainly the NCR, which is now a superpower of sorts).Though not made by the same team that made Fallout 3, not only does it have the same mechanics (with a few extra ones added such as 'Hardcore mode'.) it really does offer more. For example, there are more requests, perks, weapons in it as well as the ability to customize your weapons.The quests (including DLCs) are much better, in my opinion. In Fallout 3 there is really only 3 different endings but they are more or less the same. The DLCs weren't bad but it did feel repeative and more of a shooter than RGP. In NV, it offers different quest lines for different factions in the story thus giving us a  greater depth to the story and it really does feel like your actions do determin the outcome of the Mojave.The only problems I find with this game is, that is sometimes crashes and gives my PC the Blue screen of death every hour and then. Most of the glitches are patched but it can become a pest. Also, Cazadores are complete c*nts. No matter what level you are, or what weapon you have, they always seem to wipe you out without a problem. And they always come in swarms which becomes impossible to fight unless you have Mini nuke to Shoah the scum.Overall, 9/10 game. Must get!			"

												This is the game that Fallout 3 should have been. The development team consisted mostly of the guys who made the first two games, a lot of concepts were lifted from the canceled Van Buuren project and the game has the best kind of old-school RPG feel to it.The story of the game is very well written and the factions that the player meets are distinct with their own agendas. There are no cartoonishly evil baby eaters or perfect saints in New Vegas; no matter what you do, you're bound to make some tough choices at some point. It's all wonderful shades of gray.New Vegas also has a large cast of memorable characters. For once the companions aren't just dumb interchangeable mules, but all of them have their own background stories that you can dig into and help the people develop themselves.Do get the Ultimate Edition of New Vegas since the DLC for the game is a perfect showcase of DLC done right. All the big story DLCs have a lot of content and they also deepen the story of the main game somewhat. The Gun Runner's Arsenal adds a bunch of new weapons to the game and is fun, if not as essential addition. The only DLC that I don't really care about is the Courier's stash since it just dumps a bunch of pre-order items to your inventory right at the start and damages the overall atmosphere of the start of the game, but then again it's easy to turn off the DLC or just dump the junk in the first container/first shop you see.

												While I don't think the somewhat stilted gamebryo engine FPS combat can hold a candle to ""Fallout 2""'s more elegant turn based model (or basically any other FPS really, at least strictly in terms of pure gameplay mechanics--gamebryo still kind of sucks as an FPS engine), in terms of writing and general world design ""New Vegas"" is every bit its equal.  This game restores everything that ""Fallout 3"" gutted from the franchise: the humor, the factions, the detailed backstory of the world, the interesting companions, and the general desperate feel of surviving in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.  Plus the DLC is generally pretty good (and in the case of ""Old World Blues,"" incredibly good).  Awesome game.			"

												Truly a unique experience, this game puts guns, a big wasteland, and a great story together to make one of the best RPG's of all time. You play as a Courier carrying a platinum chip to New Vegas only to be shot in the head and buried alve, but your not dead as you were dug up and brought back to life by a doctor in the town of Goodsprings. The Mojavi Wasteland is giant, so many things to explore, pick up, sell, shoot, and all that while listening to some good tunes from the 30s, 40s and 50s on your Pip-Boy. The last thing I would like to mention is that the characters of this game I will never forget, simply wonderfully designed and voice acted. This is a must have, Legendary game and a plus is that there is an active community so be sure to check falloutnewvegas nexus for good mods. Simply, just get this game and you will see what I mean.

Pulled once more into the chaotic apocalyptic world that is Fallout you face new hazards in this desert death trap and see a world more alive than DC ever hoped to be yet just as deadly. The possibilities are endless as you journey along making new friends and hated enemies, shaping your character to the world and the world to them.			"

I especially love the content you can add to it, when you mod it. The game is already a helluva lot of fun, but when you add modded content to it, it expands your experience and journey. It's a great game, and I recommend it to everyone. Including you. Yes, you.			"

												First off; you don't need to play any of the other Fallout games to play this one. It's a fantastic standalone game that needs very little explanation: you're in a post-apocalyptic world where people are trying to pick up the pieces of the old world. You just got shot in the head after a botched courier job and find yourself being revived in the middle of the desert wasteland which you are going to explore in an FPS-perspective with a bunch of RPG-elements to make the game an overall fun and crazy experience.I'll keep it short, here we go:GOOD+ The mix of shooter and roleplaying game is almost perfect. Leveling up is fun and it feels great to explore all the possibilities. Which means: REPLAY VALUE. Yay!+ The world and enemies are interesting and fun. The western theme works surprisingly well and you'll definetly find some NPC's you'll fall in love with, while others you will definetly hate. Lots of personality going on!+ THE BEST DLC EVER. I'm not talking about a few extra weapons or missions, these are total expansions adding new things to every part of the game. Old World Blues being my definite favourite, but they're all worthy of purchase! This is how DLC should be done!+ Mods. Mods. Mods. The Modding community is great and they can give you almost unlimited ways to change your game for the better! (Or worse, if you really want that)NOT SO GOOD- Graphics aren't great, epecially on lower settings. Mods fix this, but the vanilla game just isn't very pretty. Visual glitches are quite common too, I suggest patching the game completely before playing.-  The game is huge, which means you will surely run into some bugs and glitches. Be sure to patch your game, but it might still have some stuff that annoys you, which breaks emersion.- Not the most immersive of RPG's, but your mileage may vary.- Friendly companions have the common problems of being suicidal and having bad pathfinding. They're interesting characters, but sadly not very usefull. (most of them)- Some features like crafting are basically useless aside from some specific missions. Unless you buy the DLC, they improve the use of crafting somewhat.So if you weren't sure wether you should buy this game or not, I say give it a try! It might have a few issues but there is A LOT to love about it. And if you're into modding your game, then this is another playground to go nuts in.I'll see you in the wasteland!			"

Shot in the head, left for dead, and already a hand in the total demise of two pre-nuclear apocalypse towns, the Courier's got it cut out rough from the start.War, War Never ChangesIt's been just over two-hundred years since the world burned in the atomic fire of the Great War in late October, 2077. One-hundred twenty years since the Vault Dweller left V13. Thirty-nine years since the Chosen One was sent out to save Arroyo. Four since the Lone Wanderer left V101 in search of their father. 2281 is the year you are ambushed and shot in the head. Odd, it seems, for the simple delivery of a poker chip...You're the Courier. Courier Six, of six, a delivery runner for the Mojave Express. You're a nobody. You're a wastelander. You have no say. But now you're at the center of the oldest power struggle in Las Vegas, and a major player in the current war over Hoover Dam.And you're not about to let a little bullet kill you.- -Fallout New Vegas pulls back to the olden days of Fallout, before ugly Tactics, unmentionable Brotherhood of Steel, and quasi-decent Fallout 3. It's cowboy, it's retrofuturistic, it's got really silly humor in the cracks of apocalyptic deconstruction of modern politics.The game itself plays much like Fallout 3, or Oblivion, or even the newer Skyrim. Awkward menu screens, slow response at times, and an engine that'd make GoldSource weep. The worldspace isn't fantastic, but has some really neat sights and landmarks based off of real-world locations. The combat is also much improved on over Fallout 3 - no more standing around in one spot smashing the fire key, you've got to use tact (or hellfire movement) to keep combat from killing you. It gets way easy at high levels, though.However, New Vegas is more about story. It's actually got four different branches to the main ending, with a few dozen more side-quest endings! There are quests galore in this game, all hidden around the world and within certain factions. I still find new ones, and I'm on my fourth playthrough with upwards of 650 hours! (A waste, maybe, but it's actually gotten me to DRIVE to Vegas to see the sights)There's the NCR, who were in Fallout 2, and sort-of in the original. A democratic, California-based minicountry that is pushing Eastwards for land and profit. They're overstretched and are having no end to troubles, as are the locals, who often complain about NCR taxes.The Legion is next. Caesar's Legion. A military machine of 87 enslaved tribes built in the image of Rome's Empire. A dictatorship run by a previous Follower of the Apocalypse, Edward Sallow, now calling himself Caesar and nursing a brain tumor. Yeah, he's a bit off his gourd, and an egomaniac.Robert House is another faction. A pre-war business magnate and overall genius when it comes to mathematics, House entombed himself and Vegas, to sleep over the war, per-say. Really, it was a coma caused by software crashes when the Lucky 38 nuclear defense system was activated to save Vegas, which could've been avoided with a certain Platinum Chip.Then there's Yes Man, or the Independent faction. This one is especially interesting because, while playing much like House, it's by the player's own thoughts and feelings. Don't like the BoS? Blow 'em up! Or don't, if you like them.The whole plot is about the Courier, Courier Six of six, who were sent out with packages to Vegas, each holding some kind of playing piece. Six was holding the Platinum Chip, which House needed for his software upgrade. Benny and his goons, the Chairmen, want the chip for their own so they can take full power of the Strip. It gets much more split-off after that, and, well, getting shot in the face. Twice. Oh, and there's a war going on between the NCR and Legion over the power/water at Hoover Dam and Lake Mead, but that's a whole chunk of later story.You can decide a faction, though you might be swindled up by House, or NCR, or even Legion, depending on who you bump into and how they strike you. The game gives you plenty of time before mentioning a decision needing made, so you can play the first few quests of each faction safely.There's also the side quests, which are more often linked to small factions like the Brotherhood of Steel, the Followers of the Apocalypse, or maybe one of the few towns in-game, like Goodsprings, Novac, or Jacobstown. These make up the meat of the game, since you'll likely pass through each of them.You also get a decent array of unique, quest-involved companions to drag along. I think there's nine in all, and you can take one humanoid and one non-humanoid companion at a time. There's a dog and a robot who act as secondaries, and they actually have very well-done quests involved in their companionship. But a lot of the triggers for these quests are hidden, so be sure to take everybody everywhere, and listen to everything they say.On top of ALL OF THAT, you get to customize your own character and, left with minimal history to the Courier, decide who they are. The core of a good RPG, if you ask me. Even better than the original Fallouts, with their scary Albert and... that big guy... and, uhm... I only remember Albert. Sorry, Interplay, your characters weren't memorable.The SPECIAL stats remain in, and new perks/traits have arrived with New Vegas. There's so many, though, that I won't go too deeply into them. Just be sure to consider Wild Wasteland. It adds some comic relief to the post-nuclear political state of New Vegas.So, uh, yeah. I feel my playtime speaks for itself. If you like RPG/Shooters, with lots of time to kill, then New Vegas is a good one to get. It's old, now, but the modding community is active, and kept well alive by Gopher, the Skyrim mod guru, and AlChestBreach, the man who made New Vegas (not really, he's just some Long Islander who talks to himself in funny voices).New Vegas. 9/10, for glorious story telling, political simulation, a bad engine, and old ladies beating me up in an alley.

												Just perfect sandbox game. You can edit main story how you like it. It doesn't matter who you kill. If you would kill one missiongiver, you just loose that mission. Thers no stupid thing like ""GAME OVER!"" You can do what ever you like. You can have companions to help you hunt, complete missions and other♥♥♥♥♥♥ And those funny sidemissions, what you can find around Mojave Desert. Game has no limits!       There is thousands of mods too. Myself I use 24 diffrent mods. All of them are useful. Weapon mods, Cars, Helicopters, Companions, new areas, houses, bases, everything ! I even have god items like hammer of thor. You can make mods easily. If you buy this, I tell you that this is not waste of money ! Well.. It is if you are MW3 idiot who yells to TV, what I hope your not. :)			"

												Truly a unique experience, this game puts guns, a big wasteland, and a great story together to make one of the best RPG's of all time. You play as a Courier carrying a platinum chip to New Vegas only to be shot in the head and buried alve, but your not dead as you were dug up and brought back to life by a doctor in the town of Goodsprings. The Mojavi Wasteland is giant, so many things to explore, pick up, sell, shoot, and all that while listening to some good tunes from the 30s, 40s and 50s on your Pip-Boy. The last thing I would like to mention is that the characters of this game I will never forget, simply wonderfully designed and voice acted. This is a must have, Legendary game and a plus is that there is an active community so be sure to check falloutnewvegas nexus for good mods. Simply, just get this game and you will see what I mean.

												A wasteland that I would probably go live in if I could. Fallout:NV has a great depth of story, an immersive surrounding and approachable UI and keeps a lot of what Fallout 3 was. (It's bound to being the same engine and similar graphics etc). It's also very moddable and while on its own, it's starting to show its age, with mods that can be improved. The main story is not always the main attraction of some games, and I'd say that for this. I personally had more fund running the many many side missions there are, and having immersing myself in the feeling of being amongst different people trying to make a new life.Combat is fun, dialogues are well written, and levelling system is well designed. The only downside for me is that the faces of characters (without mods) do often look slightly soulless and are not incredibly well animated.But that said, this is one of those ""must play before you die"" games and I heavily recommend it.

												Prepare for another one of those 150hr immense can't stop playing experiences. Fallout New Vegas incorporates some of the great things from ""both"" of the fallouts. The fps and open world exploration and scavenging from Fallout 3 and the complex crafting system and sacrifice/reward system from the originals. Explore the vast wasteland of the Mojave Desert and decide its fate either under the new yet misplaced rule of the NCR or under the cruel rule of Caesar's Legion, or simply use an army of advanced security drones to self police. Slight Spoiler kind of, no matter what you do there is no good ending only slightly less terrible as is accustomed to the Fallout series. While I love this game so much I simply cant rate it as high as 3 for a couple of reasons. One, the game ""runs"" terrible, to a point where it made me stop playing because of the constant game progress loss due to not saving every 5-10 mins from crashing, and simply modifying game files and .ini gfx options wasn't enough(where in 3 that was just about all you needed to do beside the stupid gfwl thing). With the addition of NVSE, NVAC, NVSR: script extender, anti-crash, stutter remover it ran smoothly but the fact that it cant run nicely on its own is a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The other thing that lowered my opinion about the game was simply the fact of many wanted ""Fallout"" not 3 where you got to be this walking apocalypse with nuts weapons and simplistic game mechanics. And Obsidian delivered stating they didnt want that, then continued on making DLCs with the sole intent of doing that exact thing. Not that its a bad thing mind you its just more about that elitist attitude that comes with these types of games like Deus Ex or Thief, the new ones suck mentality. However Old World Blues has been one of the greatest DLCs I've played in a long while, it was like playing an episode of Futurama in Fallout, and conversly Dead Money has to be one of the worst DLCs I've played recently I dragged myself through that hoping to god it would be over soon.Overall great game like all the fallouts have been and an amazing immersive world(especially with the Wild Wasteland Perk) but with the needed mods to get it to run with moderate stability 7/10.

												Imagine a world where choices matter, people judge you for the slightest action and factions seek vengence on eachother for reasons unexplainable from decades of war. Fallout New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic action RPG game that expands its limits with other 65,000 lines of diolog, memorable characters, badass weapons (Such as the ""Fat man"" that fires a mini nuke that devestates and destroys everything in it's path), however that is not the only weapon of mass destruction, there is much more that you as the player should explore and endure along your treck across the wasteland of the mojave desert.   Who are you?""You are a courier, hired by the Mojave Express, to deliver a package to the New Vegas Strip. What seemed like a simple delivery job has taken a turn…for the worse.""Left for dead and abandoned you make a recovery and thus your adventure begins...where your actions differ the outcome of the game and most importantly the ending. Become a saint among the people and help anyone or needs it and become ""A Hero of the Wasteland"" or turn to the dark side and become evil and sly, killing everyone and making the mojave a living hell. The possibility is endless so what are you waiting for ADVENTURE ON...you dig.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas, a light hearted game where you run around in a slightly glitchy, extremely open world environment where which faction that you side with really does effect the outcome of the game. So far, I have about 50 hours into it, and I am no where near to either finishing the main quest or all the side quests. I highly recommend this game.			"

												Literally the best game ever created, not only that, it furthers it's rightful claim as best game ever with mods, thereby making it the greatest game ever made by not only the Developers, but also a huge community of modders that create the most fun, (optionally) realistic, game you will ever play, PERIOD.

He is very weak in Fallout New Vegas. Therefore, I was quite disappointed at the beginning.Graphics:The graphics have not improved particularly to predecessor. The architecture of the game is well done, but the value on good details has still not been set. There are also graphical weaknesses and some bugs. But this sloppiness can not really reduce my fascination.Gameplay:Also in this part of the genre will not change. It remains an RPG/Shooter and that's a good thing. Just as in Fallout 3 you find yourself in an open world. There are very many places to explore (estimated around 250). It is possible to pursue several ways. This results from the individual decisions in talks, behavior, clothing and so on. Depending on which factions you support results in small or large consequences. It makes a lot of fun thinking about which decisions you meet in order to achieve his personal goals and missions. Furthermore, the Hardcore-Mode is a realistic complement to the previous Fallout 3. Also the weapon mod system is an interesting innovation.Overall impression:Fallout New Vegas is an absolutely justified successor to Fallout 3. It includes all the RPG elements you could want. The genial atmosphere in the world has remained.

												While Fallout: New Vegas has its good moments here and there, I can't help but feel like it was simply a copy of an already successful Fallout 3, including people Fallout 3 mods such as the Workbenches and Cooking mods to name a few then adding a sepia filter to the game world. The scale of the Fallout: New Vegas world compared to Fallout 3 is tiny, if you take into consideration how much of the map was really used... The combat stayed pretty much the same, there wasn't really much that changed, the war certainly didn't... If I had not played Fallout 3 then Fallout: New Vegas would have been all that that I had experienced in Fallout 3, minus the NPC's who brought so much life to the game. Fallout: New Vegas' NPC's were really lacking, both in depth and variety, and I couldn't help but feel that the developers rushed the game adding hundreds of thingamabobs here and there to fill the vast expanse. That's the difference between FNV and FO3, in FO3 one thing would lead to another, which blended in seamlessly whereas FNV you've go from one spot then be like ""what now"".			"

												This is the game that Fallout 3 should have been. The development team consisted mostly of the guys who made the first two games, a lot of concepts were lifted from the canceled Van Buuren project and the game has the best kind of old-school RPG feel to it.The story of the game is very well written and the factions that the player meets are distinct with their own agendas. There are no cartoonishly evil baby eaters or perfect saints in New Vegas; no matter what you do, you're bound to make some tough choices at some point. It's all wonderful shades of gray.New Vegas also has a large cast of memorable characters. For once the companions aren't just dumb interchangeable mules, but all of them have their own background stories that you can dig into and help the people develop themselves.Do get the Ultimate Edition of New Vegas since the DLC for the game is a perfect showcase of DLC done right. All the big story DLCs have a lot of content and they also deepen the story of the main game somewhat. The Gun Runner's Arsenal adds a bunch of new weapons to the game and is fun, if not as essential addition. The only DLC that I don't really care about is the Courier's stash since it just dumps a bunch of pre-order items to your inventory right at the start and damages the overall atmosphere of the start of the game, but then again it's easy to turn off the DLC or just dump the junk in the first container/first shop you see.

												Although not as popular with today's FPS generation, Fallout: New Vegas felt much closer to the feel of the original two fallout games. This is because the lead content developer for the first fallout games, Chris Avellone, was also the lead content developer for this game. This makes F:NV the true spiritual successor for the fallout series... In my opinion.			"

I especially love the content you can add to it, when you mod it. The game is already a helluva lot of fun, but when you add modded content to it, it expands your experience and journey.

												Deeper and more challenging gameplay than Fallout 3, though the main story up until near the end is a little less engaging.  Still, there are plenty of unique items, people, and locations to discover, and you are able to kill or help just about who or whatever you want, making for a great free-form experience.  Mod support at the New Vegas Nexus is overwhelming, and offical patches have made the game more stable and added general tweaks.  Overall, FO3 had more memorable moments and is intangibly better, but FONV makes some much-needed improvements is a solid game in its own right.			"

Posted: September 2, 2016
												Fallout: New Vegas is a 2010 role-playing video game that takes place in the Western United States (particularly on Nevada, California, and Arizona) where major factions want to seek control of the Hoover Dam for strategic resources and political power while the playable protagonist seek revenge on those who tried to kill the character off. The game can be interpreted as an “indirect sequel” to 2008’s Fallout 3 and there are significant improvements on gameplay and removed the “easy distinction” on black-and-white scenarios. Fallout: New Vegas was developed by Obsidian Entertainment (not Bethesda Game Studios) and published by Bethesda Softworks. Is Fallout: New Vegas a “true” Fallout game? Let’s find out. The time period for Fallout: New Vegas takes place in the year, 2281; four years after the events in Fallout 3. The setting and geography is mainly desert, which may or may not appeal to certain people who likes to experience a variety of environments on an open-world game. In addition, the setting doesn’t have a “post-apocalyptic” feeling but the game respects the previous titles from Fallout and Fallout 2. While the game doesn’t feel very “post-apocalyptic”, the NPC personalities from various factions can give you uneasiness (like Caesar’s Legion as an example) or slight hope for humanity to shine through despair and hopelessness. There are a lot of places to explore and quests to do. Each quest is well-thought out and very unique. In many ways, exploring new areas and places can give you the lore or background stories on what happened to the inhabitants who settled there before the player arrived. I find this concept more intriguing than what Fallout 3 offered. The faction system is a major component for New Vegas. Major factions like the New California Republic (NCR), Caesar’s Legion, Robert House, and various minor factions that you can allied with. Unlike in Fallout 3 where the Brotherhood of Steel (the East Coast affiliation) are seen as an obvious group that held high ethical principles and the Enclave as pure evil, New Vegas takes more of a neutral approach. There are many fine points and flaws for all major factions while morality is placed more on ambiguous deeds (like giving pure water to thirsty individuals or provide significant contributions to a settlement/community). Siding with a major faction and aligned with smaller parties can make a big difference, depending if you want to or not. Dislike some, but like the others? Go ahead. The player’s choice is in your hands. The DLCs for New Vegas are more intriguing than Fallout 3 and some are very impressive, notably for Honest Hearts and Old World Blues in my opinion. I don’t want to go into large details, but the DLCs are great and very rewarding with a pleasant experience. With the setting, faction system, and (very good) downloadable content, New Vegas is truly a spiritual successor to the original Fallout titles in many areas.There are some criticisms for New Vegas. The game suffered some technical problems (though I believed the issues were fixed by the developers) and miscellaneous annoyances here and there throughout the game like strange glitches and bugs. The game engine had aged and its graphical fidelity might be a turn-off for gamers who seek more on eye-candy visuals than actual gameplay (the game was released around October 2010). In some moments, I forgot that I was playing a Fallout game since I didn’t get the “post-apocalyptic” vibe or the setting wasn’t very bleak or depressing as it was with previous titles. Regardless, the criticisms for New Vegas (as of today) are relatively minor and can be brushed off as irrelevant since mods addressed these criticisms with ease and improvements.Admittedly, I haven’t played New Vegas since March 2013. Therefore, the accuracy for this review might not be 100% correct. However, New Vegas was a blast for me and really enjoyed putting many hours into the game when I got the game on release date around October 2010 and fully “finished” the game two years later. I didn’t use any mods for New Vegas (though I should have), but I strongly recommend to any person who is interested in the game to get the mods. One thing is certain. New Vegas was developed by Obsidian Entertainment, and not by Bethesda Game Studios. If you play Fallout 3 (or 4) and compare these games to New Vegas, it is clear that Obsidian respectfully pays homage to Fallout 1 and 2 while expanding Fallout 3 gameplay mechanics into something greater, embracing classical and contemporary role-playing concepts into one. Would I recommend New Vegas? You bet! Get the game at its default price of $20 (or regional equivalent) or when the title is on sale. New Vegas might not have the prettiest graphics at its time and some technical problems that might exist, but the experience you will get is astonishing and wonderful for a 2010 video game. I guarantee it.			"

												One of the best Fallout games there is (until Fallout 4)Set in the Mojave, the game really does take the game back to its western roots with the original factions involved (Mainly the NCR, which is now a superpower of sorts).Though not made by the same team that made Fallout 3, not only does it have the same mechanics (with a few extra ones added such as 'Hardcore mode'.) it really does offer more. For example, there are more requests, perks, weapons in it as well as the ability to customize your weapons.The quests (including DLCs) are much better, in my opinion. In Fallout 3 there is really only 3 different endings but they are more or less the same. The DLCs weren't bad but it did feel repeative and more of a shooter than RGP. In NV, it offers different quest lines for different factions in the story thus giving us a  greater depth to the story and it really does feel like your actions do determin the outcome of the Mojave.The only problems I find with this game is, that is sometimes crashes and gives my PC the Blue screen of death every hour and then. Most of the glitches are patched but it can become a pest. Also, Cazadores are complete c*nts. No matter what level you are, or what weapon you have, they always seem to wipe you out without a problem. And they always come in swarms which becomes impossible to fight unless you have Mini nuke to Shoah the scum.Overall, 9/10 game. Must get!			"

												Great game and a great successor to fallout 3.The Story is interesting and captivating especially with the dlcs.Still mostly the same as the last Fallout in regard to graphics and gameplay with some minor Improvements.Dont expect much of anything graphical surprising, but many hours of fun.Best to get Fallout nv with all the dlcs as they add really good content and makes for much more fun hours in this RPG.

												fallout las vegas is a masterpiece game based in piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥state california/nevada. you play as whoever you wanna be, like you can be morgan freeman and nobody would give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game has three main factions and some other factions you can steal♥♥♥♥♥♥from. theres NCR, a bunch of little roleplayers that pretend they are military like when really they are a bunch of asshats, however they are very open to everyone joining no matter who you are unlike the real american army. theres the Legion, which is a bunch of misogynistic dip♥♥♥♥♥ that kill everyone simply because they do not like you. if you are vilified by them, you get free ammo cause they keep sending there scouts after you. then theres mr. house. always kill mr. house, you get his cool robos. the DLC are fun, except all of them are really frickin hard. Dead money has ghosts, literally do not fight the ghosts cause its a waste of ammo, and dead money literally has NO AMMO. also you can attempt to have lesbian sex with the one girl but you cant really sorry. Old world blues is really entertaining until the Ice King sends his roboscorpions to ♥♥♥♥ you up and destroy your armour. then the lonesome road is RIDICULOUSLY HARD the only way to beat it is to stock up on all .50 cal and armour piercing 5mm and run through it with an anti-material rifle and a minigun. great game tho A+, made me gay.

												As one of the first, modern open-world RPGs I've been able to play in a LONG while, Fallout: New Vegas has got me hooked. As the first Fallout game I've ever owned and played, I guess I can't say too much about New Vegas in comparison to its predecessors, but I think the game is just amazing overall. So far, the main story is great, the combat is spread out and fun, and there's just a lot to do. I would say that a half of the time I've spent playing the game I've been exploring the landscape for loot and discovering new places that aren't on the map which then leads to new quests. Character development is also another enjoyable factor of the game I've found whether you're going with a stealthy, assassin like character or a full out explosives one. Much like what Bethesda did in Skyrim, all the choices are yours to make.Although I have played this game for quite a bit of time (some will probably disagree, like those with 400+), I feel like I have barely scratched the surface of this game. I'm looking forward to finishing it in the future and then eagerly waiting for Fallout 4's release9.5/10			"

												My first experience with the Fallout series went well thanks to this game. The story of a war after a Great War is very interesting, and the freedom that you can choose any faction you want to join or simply fight them all and take over the Mojave for yourself proves its RPG elements. The city of Vegas itself is buzzing with lights at night, like its real-life counterpart albeit the scars of war. This game allows you to do things you will not do in real-life, massive killing sprees, drinking from a toilet bowl or urinal, its all so satisfying. The DLC's are also reccomended by me to enhance your experience with this game even more.			"

												Deeper and more challenging gameplay than Fallout 3, though the main story up until near the end is a little less engaging.  Still, there are plenty of unique items, people, and locations to discover, and you are able to kill or help just about who or whatever you want, making for a great free-form experience.  Mod support at the New Vegas Nexus is overwhelming, and offical patches have made the game more stable and added general tweaks.  Overall, FO3 had more memorable moments and is intangibly better, but FONV makes some much-needed improvements is a solid game in its own right.			"

												While I don't think the somewhat stilted gamebryo engine FPS combat can hold a candle to ""Fallout 2""'s more elegant turn based model (or basically any other FPS really, at least strictly in terms of pure gameplay mechanics--gamebryo still kind of sucks as an FPS engine), in terms of writing and general world design ""New Vegas"" is every bit its equal.  This game restores everything that ""Fallout 3"" gutted from the franchise: the humor, the factions, the detailed backstory of the world, the interesting companions, and the general desperate feel of surviving in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.  Plus the DLC is generally pretty good (and in the case of ""Old World Blues,"" incredibly good).  Awesome game.			"

												This game is awesome.Fallout New Vegas really feels like the middle child between the firstborn (fallout 3) and the newest member of the family (Fallout 4).  Fallout 3 laid the foundation for what was to be expected from the next iterations in the series - a solid, well rounded achiever that was the first modern foray into an unexplored first person Fallout.  Being the first allowed it to carve out the series' baseline expectations; a fresh, interesting, and well received experience that introduced a number of new ideas. Fallout 4, the newest bundle of joy, is young, athletic, and good looking - trying to capture its attention from the audience on mostly looks alone, but lacking the depth of the firstborn.  It can run circles around the other two graphically and is good at sports, but spends too much time in front of the t.v.Fallout New Vegas, being the middle child, found its identity by studying hard at school and differentiating itself from the other siblings.  It added the deepest of the modern Fallout RPG elements and excelled in English class, with interesting well-written quests.  It also learned to do things that the firstborn couldn't, building on its foundation, but lacking the flair of the youngest of the family. It can't compete with Fallout 4's superior looks, but knows deep down it will eventually get the girls when they become bored and look for a deeper commitment.Pros;Great quests/faction interactionsRPG elements/perksImproved gunplaycharacterslength (the dlc is fantastic)16,000 + mods on the NexusCons:can be temperamental (glitch)Less emphasis on explorationgraphical fidelityFallout New Vegas is a must have if you enjoy RPG's.  It might have a few pimples, but it can hold a long, interesting conversation with you.  19.99 for the ultimate edition really is a steal, especially compared to what I spent on the original Xbox 360.

												A few months ago I wrote a negative review about Fallout New Vegas. It was wrong of me to only play this for an hour and call it trash without actually getting to embrace the game. Now my playtime is over 30 because I began to learn how much of a fun game this was.Remember those old Fallout games back in the 90s? Those point and click ones? Bethesda came up with an idea to reuse the elements of the old games and bring them back to a resurrected FPS. The execution of this idea does not dissapoint. There were things I liked about the old Fallout games that caught my eye, such as the type of ammo that can either pentrate armour or do more damage. Bringing them back to New Vegas was the bomb. (No war-pun intended) Companions in New Vegas are now more easy to manipulate with the Companion wheel, and the fact that you can choose your own ending instead of the game choosing it for you is like Nuka Cola combined with some Sunest Sarspirilla. However this game is not perfect. There will be crashes here and there when you play, which get a bit annoying if you didn't save your game. Sometimes, the Mojave Wasteland looks blank and dead, which makes sense since the setting takes place in the desert, but nothing like some Fiends and Deathclaws to add a bit of flavor to the taste. Overall this game DESERVES a 9.5/10. I highly recommend you get this game if you enjoy RPG's and like a bit of challenge here and there. But if you do, word of advice...Actually I have no advice to say, only play this game like there is no tomorrow c:			"

												Bethesda Softworks' release of Fallout 3 in 2008 went a long way in reviving a series which looked to have been milked for all it was worth, and brought a new set of fans for the series. Yet, while the new fans were being entertained by Fallout 3, some of the older fanbase – including myself – bemoaned the game for its poor story and dialogue, the liberties taken with the canon, and the disappointing ending. When the development of Fallout: New Vegas was announced, I must admit that I felt a bit of trepidation. Obsidian Entertaiment was composed of members of the Fallout development team when Black Isle was at its prime, but were they the right people to take up the mantle of a new Fallout game?In the development of Fallout: New Vegas, Obsidian drew in elements from the incomplete game which was to have been the third instalment of the main series, Van Buren, with various changes to their implementation to deal with the smaller geographical area. Gameplay-wise, though, Fallout: New Vegas strongly resembles Fallout 3, and could be best described as a refined variant of the first/third-person action role-playing action that distinguished Fallout 3 from its predecessors in the series. The skill set has been cleaned up somewhat, removing the Small Guns and Big Guns categories, and placing their weapons into the Guns and Explosives skills accordingly. The new Survival skill ties into the expanded crafting mechanics, and is of particular concern to the new Hardcore mode, in which the character must eat, sleep and drink, in which ammunition has weight as in the original Fallout games, and in which healing takes place over time, rather than being instantaneous.In an increased attempt to make non-weapon skills useful, the crafting mechanic has been expanded to include the ability to hand-load ammunition using shell casings, powder and lead at a reloading bench, along with cooking and the production of poisons at a campfire. The reloading mechanic is particularly welcome, allowing for the recycling of excess stockpiled ammunition, as well as the casting of rare ammunition types, including certain enhanced ammunition exclusive to the reloading bench. Meanwhile, the cooking mechanic gives a new use to those boxes of Cram which seem to be littered around the wasteland, allowing a skilled player to produce food which can heal more effectively and, in Hardcore Mode, which satiates the character's hunger for longer.Another new addition to the series is the “true ironsights” configurable option, which ties into a general tightening-up of the shooting mechanics. VATS has been weakened from Fallout 3, and in its place, the shooting mechanics feel somewhat more satisfying, at least at long range, where long rifles feel a bit more useful than they did in Fallout 3. Indeed, weapons under the Guns skill feel a lot more capable of getting one to the end of the game than in Fallout 3, and it is perfectly possible for somebody to focus on one weapon skill – apart from possibly Explosives - and to have few problems proceeding onwards.The biggest way in which Fallout: New Vegas is distinct to its immediate predecessor is that it feels like a character- and dialogue-oriented game, rather than the exploration-oriented approach of Fallout 3. One of my biggest disappointments with Fallout 3 was its rather poor storyline, in which one felt railroaded into a set of actions, even when they didn't make logical sense for your character, and which worked to the detriment of the rest of the game. Fallout: New Vegas, on the other hand, allows for a greater amount of flexibility with the storyline, with four distinct paths for one to set on, a lot of choices to make in the wasteland, and far more logical consistency than Fallout 3. This does come at a cost, as the start of the game is very linear in terms of exploration, with powerful creatures making progression directly towards New Vegas difficult, but as this approach was taken – albeit more subtly – in both Fallout and Fallout 2, so this will only be a big concern to the players who enjoyed Fallout 3 primarily because of the exploration elements.Another area which Fallout: New Vegas improves on is the portrayal of its characters. Unlike Fallout 3, in which most of the main characters felt bland or clichéd, Fallout: New Vegas takes more care with several of its characters, giving them a bit more life beyond being simple quest markers. This is of particular note when it comes to the leaders of each faction, and also with the companion characters, all of which possess a well-crafted backstory and a personal quest which progresses their characterisation further. This makes a good comparison to the pack mule approach taken by Fallout 3, and even, to a lesser extent, by Fallout and Fallout 2.A welcome change to the dynamic of the game is the lessened importance of the karma meter, displaced by the Fallout 2 approach of community reputations, which has been expanded to allow for a broader variety of different reputations. A greater logical consistency is created with NPC reactions, something which felt lacking in Fallout 3. What's more, this allows for a bit more moral ambiguity within the game universe, a far cry from the rather binary set of moral interactions which resulted from Fallout 3's reliance on the karma meter.Aesthetically, Fallout: New Vegas is not particularly impressive. Fallout 3, also built on the Gamebryo engine, was not particularly impressive. Fallout 3, also built on the Gamebryo engine, was not particularly graphically impressive when it made its appearance in 2008. With no significant improvements to graphics, Fallout: New Vegas looks mediocre, particularly in the wake of extremely GPU-intensive but especially flashy game engines for the PC in the interim. Sounds are effective, but not particularly striking, and simply serve their purpose without going beyond the call of duty.Inon Zur's backing music from Fallout 3 returns, with a few extra tracks added to the mix. Again, I'd argue that this music is just there to create the right sense of ambience, and rarely goes beyond that purpose. Some Fallout and Fallout 2 players will note the return of some of the music of Mark Morgan from these games, but again, this music always seemed to just serve a purpose with the exception of a few tracks which didn't make it into Fallout: New Vegas.As with Fallout 3, a healthy number of licensed tracks make their way into the game via the Pip-Boy 3000's radio. Some players may prefer this music to the standard soundtrack, while others may tire quickly of the repetition of the small library of tracks, but it's nice to see the option retained. The music also creates the ambience of civilisation within communities, so in that sense, it's still worth having within the game.Unfortunately, there is one very negative area in which Fallout: New Vegas has followed in the footsteps of its predecessors.  Fallout: New Vegas is still not entirely free of bugs, with graphical glitches and clipping issues still remaining. While the Fallout series has not had a reputation for faultless programming, partially a consequence of its extensive scope, it's disappointing and jarring to have an enemy – or worse, yourself – stuck in the side of a rock with no way to escape.Nevertheless, Fallout: New Vegas certainly progresses the series, working on the framework of Fallout 3, while taking more influence from the preceding Fallout games and instituting some of the visions that were planned for Van Buren. Paradoxically, in terms of the series progression, it may have made more sense to term this to be the third instalment in the main series, and have named Fallout 3 something along the lines of Fallout: Capital Wasteland. Either way, Fallout: New Vegas is a reasonably well-crafted and frequently fun game which only suffers from the minor disappointment of persistent bugs.			"

												Even though the initial game isnt as good as fallout 3 its a pretty fun game with plenty of new features to keep one entertained plus really cool DLC's. But the mods make this game incredible. Highly recommended for anyone a fan of RPG's or shooters.Now this game is something special, playing the game with a modest mix of mods make this game quite an experience, better than Fallout 4 by a long shot.First the RPG aspects are LEAGUES better than 4, leveling a character is a lot more advanced, which isn't saying much compared to 4, but it has depth and thought to it. You can create whatever character you want instead of being stuck with a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off dad. Loot is a lot more varied and gunplay forces you to build your character with some thought as that isn't the focus. The dialogue is great as it has choice and can change the tide based on your character.Modding is very easy to do, no wierd way to do it.Once I upgrade my PC, I plan to reinstall this game and mod it to hell. While this game is a 8/10 for an RPG, the overall feel and gameplay makes this a solid 9.5/10, while Fallout 4 is a 4/10 as an RPG and a 7/10 as a Fallout game. Please support this game people, Bethesda needs to make a Fallout game with a lot more focus in the RPG aspect like this one here instead of forcing a backstory and character onto you.			"

												One of the best RPGs made up to this day, Fallout: New Vegas tells a story about a society which is rebuilding around you, and leading into a huge battle, proves that humans don't change, and because of that war... war never changes.A really good story, with really memorable characters and landmarks you'll remember. Huge open world which captures the essence of a nuclear wasteland desert, full of life and funny memorable moments.If you're gonna buy it, please do it with all their DLCs, which also have their own stories, but also, a major story between them all that expands New Vegas' story even further.

												Welcome to the wasteland boys and girls, grab a gun and stay far away from the death claws. As a fan of the Fallout franchise I can still say without bias this game is addicting. Bethesda stayed true allowing players to control their own fate and play the way they want to. From free range character customization,  free roaming an open world, to optional dialogue. You can play the game the way you want to with tons of freedom and a dynamic storyline. The graphics are stunning for their time. There are other perks to this game an active Steam workshop supplying your creative needs, Tons of puns and easter eggs to find.   Got ganked by Deathclaw's 10/10 would play again.			"

												Best Fallout game, with alot of interesting quests, and a huge Wasteland to explore. The story this time is based along the war between the New California Republic (NCR), and the Legion. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, and you can join whichever you want to complete the game, or go through and independant New Vegas, and kick both of them out of Nevada. A vast improvement over Fallout 3 in terms of weapons, iron sights, and locations. The characters are quite memorable, and the companions are badasses if you get them the right gear. Both the Brotherhood of Steel and the Enclave make appearances, but in vastly dimmed down appearances than their Fallout 3 counterparts. Which is a shame, as I like the Fallout 3 Brotherhood better than New Vegas's. There are four pieces of DLC for New Vegas, but they all have their ups and downs.Dead Money is an extremely confusing, and creepy DLC to play, but gives you a good few hours of gameplay. This was my least favorite of the four.Honest Hearts is my favorite, as it gives you a huge part of Utah to explore (namely Zion National Park), gives you some awesome armor to wear, and has some pretty awesome characters, namely the Burned Man himself, Joshua Graham. A must play even just to get the Desert Ranger Armor.Old World Blues was a pretty standard run to this place, grab something, run to this place grab this, and so on and so forth. The one thing that sets this out from the rest is the ""Brains"", a group of former scientists from before the Great War who placed their brains in robots so they could continue living. I won't spoil anything, but their entire dialogue is absolutely hilarious to hear, and it is hard not to like their dialogue. This is my third favorite of the four.Lonesome Road. This is the last DLC, and the second best. The area you explore is extremly hostile, looks great, and everything is out to kill you. You also get to find out about your past before you accepted the ill-fated job from the Mojave Express. Ullysses is a great antagonist. Suffice to say, this is a great one to play as well, and you really should.			"

Has more roleplaying options than any Bathesda game.  Much better than Skyrim by a long shot.  On a 3rd playthrough and already thinking ahead to a 4th.

												Hmm... Fallout: New Vegas. Ya know, throughout this series we've heard the phrase uttered time and time again; ""War, war never changes"". Each installment of the Fallout series has given us insight on what exactly holds for us if we ever do come to some sort of ""End-of-the-World"" pinnacles. Sex, drugs, guns, and money. Seems nothing more than simply a fantasy but when you look deeper into it, it's more than that. It's a reality. A reality of something that could be, because of both the human nature to preserve but also because of the most catastrophical ideal that we humans have. A trait that not a single person on this planet is free from. Something that given time, can destroy lives, families, friends, countries, and well.. even the world. Greed. Pure greed. Now, I may have lost you with the philisophical mumbo-jumbo, but hear me out. Fallout is easily known for reaffirming the negative repercussions of human greed within the series, but Fallout: New Vegas does it the best. Personalities such as Benny, Ceasar, and many other characters shown to us forthright how damaging their personal greed can cause so much chaos is scary. One damn near kills you and another damn near destroys all of New Vegas. As the player, you go through so many different obstacles that while not incredibly damaging to your playstyle, can seriously change the outcome of future events drastically. All winding down to something as simple as not being friendly to someone. In hindsight, this may not seem incredibly.. so much to do with just greed, but all of humanities existence. A test of patience and time, to make choices and risk the outcomes. To make friendships that will drastically alter the course of the game. Given all this, could you really sit here and say that this is a bad game? It takes a lot to accidently make people philisophically question things. It takes a lot more to actually try and do it.

												A classic game for a classic man.The land of the Mojave is incredibly ""colorful."" By that, I mean memorable. It's a mixture of suave 1940's-50's style finesse, and the dry, heated Hell of the Nuclear Desert. The characters you encounter are fun, dark, dry, deadly, and lovable all together. The combat, incredibly satisfiying as you aim, shoot, and watch as your opponent's head gets blown off. The combination of finesse, a great cast of characters, a mind-boggling arsenal at your disposal, and an entertaining story-arc will blow you away. Literally.Fallout: New Vegas truly is easily one of the best games I have ever played, and that's saying something.Traditional Rating: 3 out of 4.Personal Rating: ""Legendary.""			"

I don't care how much gameplay you see, how much you hear, but nothing in this world can compare to travelling through a dangerous wasteland to find a vibrant, living, incredible locaction - New Vegas. It was incredible for me.The only thing I don't like about this game is that it took me two ♥♥♥♥ing days to get it to work, which is fine, but other than that, my only complaint would be that the Sierra Madre DLC is quite boring, in my opinionShould you buy it?

												Updating this review now I've finished the game. Wow. I have not been impressed by an open world this much before ever. I've spend 34 hours in this game, making friends with everyone to, in the last hour, betray them all. This game made me smile, cry, scream and so much more. The map is maybe 1/50th of  the GTA V map, but it feels 50x bigger. After I finished the game, I was left with a bunch of awesome weapons, and a big Mojave desert full of mysteries and factions to explore. Just like when I started the game for the first time. If I could create one game, it would be sequel to this masterpiece. And that, that says a lot.

												War. War Never changes.From the time these words are spoken, to the moment you reach the end of the game, you will experience one of the best game’s out there. Outdated engine, loads of glitches, and too few voices for too many characters. Despite these flaws, I believe Fallout New Vegas is the best game I’ve ever played. A fantastic story, interesting and diverse characters, hundreds of mods, and a return to good ol’ Fallout.I bought this game a few years ago, knowing only a little about Fallout, having only played Fallout 3 a few times, never for long, when I was young. So, with Fallout 3, I bought this game, not knowing what to expect. Here I am, a few years later, with over 250 hours of gameplay under my belt, and still more to come. Over the course of these years I have played every other Fallout game in existence and have learned the lore and history of both the game and it’s world. Every time I play one of the other games, I am hit by a sense of wonder, but I always end up coming back to this one, New Vegas.New Vegas has everything you could want from a Fallout game, bringing you back to the West Coast and the world of old Fallout. Hundreds of cool guns and missions and a gigantic world to discover, not to mention some pretty good DLC, for the most part. Las Vegas, now dubbed New Vegas, is the last bastion of civilization in the world, as far as it’s inhabitants can tell, led by the mysterious and enigmatic Mr. House. The NCR, who you may remember from Fallout 2, have spread out to Nevada to find the Hoover Dam. With the discovery of the Dam, comes the discovery of the antithesis to everything the NCR stands for, The Legion, a group founded under the ideals of old Rome. Before the start of the game, the NCR and the Legion duked it out over control of the Dam, the NCR just barely winning. Now the Legion is back, and after revenge. Mr. House sits in the protection of the walled city of New Vegas, ruling over it’s inhabitants under the ideals of the old world, as the NCR dukes it out once again with the Legion, with plans of his own. You are a Courier, a messenger of sorts, tasked with delivering a mysterious package by order of Mr. House, who must unite the Mojave Wasteland under the rule of either the Legion, the NCR, Mr. House, or yourself. And with that, the best game of the Fallout series starts.So with my FIVE STAR RECOMMENDATION, go ahead, buy the game, and start the journey of your life.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas™; a game everybody has their own, unexplored world in which to conquer, one quest at a time.You, as the main character, are a Courier, your job is to deliver a package to New Vegas; it is from the old world, a torned down, and rebuilt city that is a hubble of life, filled with many, many different opportunities that you get to explore. You are ultimately kidnapped by armed men, which you will get to know more about later in the story, and are shot in the head in a cementary outside of a small, un-disturbed town, known as Goodsprings. From here on out, you get to make your own decisions, and make a rebuttle of what is left of the Mojavé-Wasteland. This game is a huge advancement compared to it's predecessor, Fallout: 3™. The amount of gameplay added to this game, which, might I add, is much, much more defined in the sense that you're really there; you feel as if you know your friends, enemies, and places you've been to. The quests and DLC make a surgated wall that can support the main quests of this masterpiece; as in Fallout: 3™, they don't. Fallout: New Vegas™ adds many more intelligent AI with never-before-seen dialogue that you can fiddle with -- meaning that some of your perks and skills can actually change the way you play the game, if done correctly, that is..      Factions have always been a big-hit in this games overall franchise, and in this game, they really show you how they've completely re-fortified that way it was meant to be. They're not just a few, big ones in this game that are good and evil [Factions] that you only get to choose from one-or-so faction, but many of them. The three main factions in Fallout: New Vegas™ are the N.C.R., Caesar's Legion, and the Brotherhood of Steel. tl;drI highly suggest buying this game - it is absouletely worth the twenty-dollars you will pay for it. I also recommend buying all the DLC whilst you're at it. It will make you have a brand new experience of playing. "

												Great game, Have it on Xbox360 with atleast 250+ hours on it, had to buy it on PC for the mod...but now for the review. It allows for you to play the way that you want to, with i believe 4-5 different game endings for choosing to be good or bad and which faction(s) to follow. Also has a very interesting story for the fight over the dam and all the small things that will pop up along the way. Very detailed in the skill tree and put many skills in their own little btanch instead of bunching them up all together.

												Now this is a game worthy of the Fallout title! Alot of people liked Fallout 3 alot better, and I'm actually not sure why. I LOVED New Vegas! Yes, the Mojave landscape is quite boring, but it brang back what we want to see in a Fallout game! Choice! About 90% of all the quests in New Vegas, have different endings, or at least different approaches to completing it. I was sucked into the world of New Vegas MUCH more then I was in Fallout 3. If you want a game where it's your choice how things play out, this is the game for you. Oh, and it still has the amazing range of weapons, items and quests we all love.			"

												Even though the initial game isnt as good as fallout 3 its a pretty fun game with plenty of new features to keep one entertained plus really cool DLC's. But the mods make this game incredible. Highly recommended for anyone a fan of RPG's or shooters.Now this game is something special, playing the game with a modest mix of mods make this game quite an experience, better than Fallout 4 by a long shot.First the RPG aspects are LEAGUES better than 4, leveling a character is a lot more advanced, which isn't saying much compared to 4, but it has depth and thought to it. You can create whatever character you want instead of being stuck with a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off dad. Loot is a lot more varied and gunplay forces you to build your character with some thought as that isn't the focus. The dialogue is great as it has choice and can change the tide based on your character.Modding is very easy to do, no wierd way to do it.Once I upgrade my PC, I plan to reinstall this game and mod it to hell. While this game is a 8/10 for an RPG, the overall feel and gameplay makes this a solid 9.5/10, while Fallout 4 is a 4/10 as an RPG and a 7/10 as a Fallout game. Please support this game people, Bethesda needs to make a Fallout game with a lot more focus in the RPG aspect like this one here instead of forcing a backstory and character onto you.			"

												Bethesda Softworks' release of Fallout 3 in 2008 went a long way in reviving a series which looked to have been milked for all it was worth, and brought a new set of fans for the series. Yet, while the new fans were being entertained by Fallout 3, some of the older fanbase – including myself – bemoaned the game for its poor story and dialogue, the liberties taken with the canon, and the disappointing ending. When the development of Fallout: New Vegas was announced, I must admit that I felt a bit of trepidation. Obsidian Entertaiment was composed of members of the Fallout development team when Black Isle was at its prime, but were they the right people to take up the mantle of a new Fallout game?In the development of Fallout: New Vegas, Obsidian drew in elements from the incomplete game which was to have been the third instalment of the main series, Van Buren, with various changes to their implementation to deal with the smaller geographical area. Gameplay-wise, though, Fallout: New Vegas strongly resembles Fallout 3, and could be best described as a refined variant of the first/third-person action role-playing action that distinguished Fallout 3 from its predecessors in the series. The skill set has been cleaned up somewhat, removing the Small Guns and Big Guns categories, and placing their weapons into the Guns and Explosives skills accordingly. The new Survival skill ties into the expanded crafting mechanics, and is of particular concern to the new Hardcore mode, in which the character must eat, sleep and drink, in which ammunition has weight as in the original Fallout games, and in which healing takes place over time, rather than being instantaneous.In an increased attempt to make non-weapon skills useful, the crafting mechanic has been expanded to include the ability to hand-load ammunition using shell casings, powder and lead at a reloading bench, along with cooking and the production of poisons at a campfire. The reloading mechanic is particularly welcome, allowing for the recycling of excess stockpiled ammunition, as well as the casting of rare ammunition types, including certain enhanced ammunition exclusive to the reloading bench. Meanwhile, the cooking mechanic gives a new use to those boxes of Cram which seem to be littered around the wasteland, allowing a skilled player to produce food which can heal more effectively and, in Hardcore Mode, which satiates the character's hunger for longer.Another new addition to the series is the “true ironsights” configurable option, which ties into a general tightening-up of the shooting mechanics. VATS has been weakened from Fallout 3, and in its place, the shooting mechanics feel somewhat more satisfying, at least at long range, where long rifles feel a bit more useful than they did in Fallout 3. Indeed, weapons under the Guns skill feel a lot more capable of getting one to the end of the game than in Fallout 3, and it is perfectly possible for somebody to focus on one weapon skill – apart from possibly Explosives - and to have few problems proceeding onwards.The biggest way in which Fallout: New Vegas is distinct to its immediate predecessor is that it feels like a character- and dialogue-oriented game, rather than the exploration-oriented approach of Fallout 3. One of my biggest disappointments with Fallout 3 was its rather poor storyline, in which one felt railroaded into a set of actions, even when they didn't make logical sense for your character, and which worked to the detriment of the rest of the game. Fallout: New Vegas, on the other hand, allows for a greater amount of flexibility with the storyline, with four distinct paths for one to set on, a lot of choices to make in the wasteland, and far more logical consistency than Fallout 3. This does come at a cost, as the start of the game is very linear in terms of exploration, with powerful creatures making progression directly towards New Vegas difficult, but as this approach was taken – albeit more subtly – in both Fallout and Fallout 2, so this will only be a big concern to the players who enjoyed Fallout 3 primarily because of the exploration elements.Another area which Fallout: New Vegas improves on is the portrayal of its characters. Unlike Fallout 3, in which most of the main characters felt bland or clichéd, Fallout: New Vegas takes more care with several of its characters, giving them a bit more life beyond being simple quest markers. This is of particular note when it comes to the leaders of each faction, and also with the companion characters, all of which possess a well-crafted backstory and a personal quest which progresses their characterisation further. This makes a good comparison to the pack mule approach taken by Fallout 3, and even, to a lesser extent, by Fallout and Fallout 2.A welcome change to the dynamic of the game is the lessened importance of the karma meter, displaced by the Fallout 2 approach of community reputations, which has been expanded to allow for a broader variety of different reputations. A greater logical consistency is created with NPC reactions, something which felt lacking in Fallout 3. What's more, this allows for a bit more moral ambiguity within the game universe, a far cry from the rather binary set of moral interactions which resulted from Fallout 3's reliance on the karma meter.Aesthetically, Fallout: New Vegas is not particularly impressive. Fallout 3, also built on the Gamebryo engine, was not particularly impressive. Fallout 3, also built on the Gamebryo engine, was not particularly graphically impressive when it made its appearance in 2008. With no significant improvements to graphics, Fallout: New Vegas looks mediocre, particularly in the wake of extremely GPU-intensive but especially flashy game engines for the PC in the interim. Sounds are effective, but not particularly striking, and simply serve their purpose without going beyond the call of duty.Inon Zur's backing music from Fallout 3 returns, with a few extra tracks added to the mix. Again, I'd argue that this music is just there to create the right sense of ambience, and rarely goes beyond that purpose. Some Fallout and Fallout 2 players will note the return of some of the music of Mark Morgan from these games, but again, this music always seemed to just serve a purpose with the exception of a few tracks which didn't make it into Fallout: New Vegas.As with Fallout 3, a healthy number of licensed tracks make their way into the game via the Pip-Boy 3000's radio. Some players may prefer this music to the standard soundtrack, while others may tire quickly of the repetition of the small library of tracks, but it's nice to see the option retained. The music also creates the ambience of civilisation within communities, so in that sense, it's still worth having within the game.Unfortunately, there is one very negative area in which Fallout: New Vegas has followed in the footsteps of its predecessors.  Fallout: New Vegas is still not entirely free of bugs, with graphical glitches and clipping issues still remaining. While the Fallout series has not had a reputation for faultless programming, partially a consequence of its extensive scope, it's disappointing and jarring to have an enemy – or worse, yourself – stuck in the side of a rock with no way to escape.Nevertheless, Fallout: New Vegas certainly progresses the series, working on the framework of Fallout 3, while taking more influence from the preceding Fallout games and instituting some of the visions that were planned for Van Buren. Paradoxically, in terms of the series progression, it may have made more sense to term this to be the third instalment in the main series, and have named Fallout 3 something along the lines of Fallout: Capital Wasteland. Either way, Fallout: New Vegas is a reasonably well-crafted and frequently fun game which only suffers from the minor disappointment of persistent bugs.			"

												Out of all the Bethesda open world games out there so far, this one is probably the best, and perhaps ironically since this one is developed by Obsidian instead of Bethesda Studios. Though the combat may be dated as well as the graphics, it absolutely nails so much more. The quests are intriguing and probably more interesting than most modern games. The atmosphere and landscape of a post-apocalyptic Nevada is almost impecabble, with enemies that well suited to look like radiated desert monstrocities and a style of music on the radio that just really ties the whole thing together. Even though combat is a little clunky compared to most shooters today, the variety of guns is great and it's still fun to shoot baddies. Mods can do so much too, improve graphics, fix bugs, add new weapons and quests, pretty much exactly what you'd expect from Skyrim or any other game running Creation Engine. Personally I found the story to be more interesting than Fallout 3 and even 4, though it's not perfect. In the end, what's happening around you will be more interesting than the main course. The several large factions in the game are cool but unfortunately because of time constraints Obsidian couldn't make them as impressive as they probably would've liked, a big example being Caesar's Legion. Honestly if there was one major criticism to the game it'd be that it's not as polished as it could be. While most of the time it's a solid package, made much better with the DLC (get GOTY btw, the DLC is amazing) sometimes you get the feeling that if Obsidian got more time this game would be that much better. As it stands though, this is a near masterpiece and I hope Obsidian gets the chance to make another Fallout, combining the great combat and improved graphical fidelity of Fo4 and more fleshed out aspects of everything else from this game.

												Hmm... Fallout: New Vegas. Ya know, throughout this series we've heard the phrase uttered time and time again; ""War, war never changes"". Each installment of the Fallout series has given us insight on what exactly holds for us if we ever do come to some sort of ""End-of-the-World"" pinnacles. Sex, drugs, guns, and money. Seems nothing more than simply a fantasy but when you look deeper into it, it's more than that. It's a reality. A reality of something that could be, because of both the human nature to preserve but also because of the most catastrophical ideal that we humans have. A trait that not a single person on this planet is free from. Something that given time, can destroy lives, families, friends, countries, and well.. even the world. Greed. Pure greed. Now, I may have lost you with the philisophical mumbo-jumbo, but hear me out. Fallout is easily known for reaffirming the negative repercussions of human greed within the series, but Fallout: New Vegas does it the best. Personalities such as Benny, Ceasar, and many other characters shown to us forthright how damaging their personal greed can cause so much chaos is scary. One damn near kills you and another damn near destroys all of New Vegas. As the player, you go through so many different obstacles that while not incredibly damaging to your playstyle, can seriously change the outcome of future events drastically. All winding down to something as simple as not being friendly to someone. In hindsight, this may not seem incredibly.. so much to do with just greed, but all of humanities existence. A test of patience and time, to make choices and risk the outcomes. To make friendships that will drastically alter the course of the game. Given all this, could you really sit here and say that this is a bad game? It takes a lot to accidently make people philisophically question things. It takes a lot more to actually try and do it.

												The Fallout games are my favorite games of all time - I have every one and love every one. Whatever you believe, this game is incredible. I don't care how much gameplay you see, how much you hear, but nothing in this world can compare to travelling through a dangerous wasteland to find a vibrant, living, incredible locaction - New Vegas. It was incredible for me.The only thing I don't like about this game is that it took me two ♥♥♥♥ing days to get it to work, which is fine, but other than that, my only complaint would be that the Sierra Madre DLC is quite boring, in my opinionShould you buy it?

Or, if you don't feel like questing, you can just turn of some Radio New Vegas and let Mr. New Vegas's luxorious voice serinade you as you travel throughout the wastes looking for people to help, or kill. I've not even scratched the surface of this game, there's just so much content, you need to check it out for yourself!			"

												Been a huge Fallout fan for so many years, played the first classic games and even dabbled a bit with fallout tactics and brotherhood. When Fallout 3 came out i spent so much time on that game it was insane, would play it for hours on end only stopping for toilet breaks, sleep and to eat something before i turn into a skeleton. So eventually when New Vegas was released i quickly grabbed a copy on the consoles and not long after on the PC and yet again had my time get sucks down the time sink. After playing it for 500+ hours i can honestly say it was ALOT of fun and i loved the amount of mods and freedom the developers gave to their fans when it came to making your own mods for the game, but of course there are negatives. I hated the setting the game was in, alot of the towns are great i abolutely loved Goodsprings and the strip, but got tired quickly of just seeing just sand, occasional building and flat nothingness. What i loved so much in Fallout 3 was that you were in a destroyed capital, you could walk through destroyed buildings walk across a huge city seeing buildings that collapsed, stores destroyed and so on. But in New Vegas its just....sand.While so many fallout fanboys will comment on this ""Review"" and get all butthurt that i didn't like their precious new vegas game, i by no means say its a ""Bad"" game. Just not a great one in my opinion, and i certaintly don't get how so many people are being butthurt over the newest installation Fallout 4. Don't like fallout 4 then get a refund and stop complaining about the dialogue box or the ""Missing"" RPG elements. Other than that i would reccomend this game to people who want to buy the fallout series and see what its all about and to more importantly have fun. But don't play the game if you are looking for a bug free game, its a bethesda game so its to be expected.			"

												A few months ago I wrote a negative review about Fallout New Vegas. It was wrong of me to only play this for an hour and call it trash without actually getting to embrace the game. Now my playtime is over 30 because I began to learn how much of a fun game this was.Remember those old Fallout games back in the 90s? Those point and click ones? Bethesda came up with an idea to reuse the elements of the old games and bring them back to a resurrected FPS. The execution of this idea does not dissapoint. There were things I liked about the old Fallout games that caught my eye, such as the type of ammo that can either pentrate armour or do more damage. Bringing them back to New Vegas was the bomb. (No war-pun intended) Companions in New Vegas are now more easy to manipulate with the Companion wheel, and the fact that you can choose your own ending instead of the game choosing it for you is like Nuka Cola combined with some Sunest Sarspirilla. However this game is not perfect. There will be crashes here and there when you play, which get a bit annoying if you didn't save your game. Sometimes, the Mojave Wasteland looks blank and dead, which makes sense since the setting takes place in the desert, but nothing like some Fiends and Deathclaws to add a bit of flavor to the taste. Overall this game DESERVES a 9.5/10. I highly recommend you get this game if you enjoy RPG's and like a bit of challenge here and there. But if you do, word of advice...Actually I have no advice to say, only play this game like there is no tomorrow c:			"

												I have put many hours into both Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas and I can solemnly say that I did not waste a single minute. So far, I have found it impossible not to discover something new on each playthrough (Of which I have completed many) and being able to follow a different story path each time has been a large part of this. While this game may throw you in at the deep end fairly early on, you have a clear objective and many different ways of completing it. Any fan of open world games or shooters will quickly realise that they have been missing out on a superb game for some time. I strongly recommend this title			"

												There is some debate over whether Fallout 4 was better than New Vegas, yet few can deny that New Vegas is a classic that still provides players with the post-apocalyptic RPG experience today, 7 years later.New Vegas is meticulously crafted, and the world and lore is immersive. Choices matter. Different people would prefer different endings and it really takes a lot of roleplay to decide which one you would prefer. In creating good and bad, the NCR might fight for the return of old world democracy, but come across as intrusively imperialist; the legion might come across as villanous brutes, but to a certain extent they would bring back order and stability, if you're willing to accept slavery as  a norm of society. House would bring about a benovolent dictatorship, and Independence really looks at the choices that you have made. Sub-factions are pre-determined if you follow NCR, Legion or House paths, but only in independence can you make your own decisions among them.Characters, especially the companions, were people with complex identities. Veronica reveals that she fell in love with a girl, but was frowned upon by the Brotherhood because it demands certain female roles; yet Arcade is openly homosexual and he's just going along, trying to find ways to do good in the wasteland, it brings to light the differing treatment of lgbt's (which Fallout is still opening up to, great!) but neither of their personal quests revolve around their sexuality, which is a genius approach to it; they're just who they are. Veronica is a vivacious, forward-thinker stuck in a conservative society that tells itself it will succeed because it has succeeded before with the old ways. Boone is associable because we've all made grave mistakes that we can't forgive ourselves for - but Boone takes it a step further, by blaming a big personal loss on fate catching up to him for a mistake that wasn't even his fault. You find him in Novac (a play on no vacancy) and it's almost as if he's juxtaposed to be living there as a purposeless wanderer because his past has consumed him so. Nightkin Lily takes prescribed medicine, which keeps her sane, but the medicine also causes her to forget her past life as a grandmother to two children. What you encourage her to do with her medicine also takes a lot of roleplaying and what you feel is best or right for her. Point is, these characters aren't stock characters. Hell, they're more interesting than the people I meet in real life, because I relate to them and in helping them through their personal quests you also come to understand yourself and what you value.Fallout New Vegas gives you a number of perks and skills to invest in, and they change the way a player goes through the game diversely. Female characters' Black Widow, for example, opens up special dialogue options when talking to male NPCs - creating rare opportunities to bypass longer processes. Speech 100 will get you through a lot in the name of fighting with words. Or you could just fight, with guns. 'It's a free wasteland.'Last but not least, I am hopelessly in love with the soundtrack, both orchestral and licensed. Music direction was good and it added to my immersion. It made wandering through the Mojave a little less lonely.I'm hoping, along with many others, that Obsidian will develop the new Fallout post Fallout 4, but this is the game that really piqued my interest in the series, and now I'm headed on to finish my collection.

												I'm on the verge deciding whether I like  Fallout 3 or Fallout NV more, for me they're on the same level. I'm going to make a short comparison:Fallout NV:- Less power armor focused- Strong wild-west theme (some like it some not)- Interesting characters, questline for every companion.- More things to do (like gambling etc.)- An amazing faction system, way better than FO3's karma.- Some of the best DLC's I've played in any game.FO3:- Real post-apocalyptic feeling.- Simpler-cleaner game mechanics- The main antagonists are much more strong and interesting- Less bugs (only for me?)- More interesting locations and landmarks- Creepier, more eerie than FONV.Anyway if you plan on buying the game buy the Ultimate/GOTY edition with all the dlc, it worth it. Just like with any Bethesda game, modding it is highly advised (not only to get rid of the numerous bugs, but to enhanced the gameplay and outdated visuals).			"

												Fallout New Vegas is one of those games that you get addicted to and end up binge playing it for 8 hours at a time.  In New Vegas there is so much to do that this game will keep you busy for weeks and you could end up putting 150+ hours into just one save.  It has addicting gameplay, intresting characters and loads of great side quests that will be more than enough to keep you busy.  But all of these thing aside the game does have some downfalls like texture glitches and fetch quests (Bleed me dry which is seemingly a waste of time except for the awesome rewards).  Don't let these things deter you from enjoying the game because there is plenty to enjoy in Vegas!9.2/10 "

												Fallout: New Vegas is one of my favorite RPGs of all time. It follows the same ""Skyrim with Guns"" approach that Fallout 3 takes but in my opinion has a better storyline, with ""true"" ironsights and better general gameplay. Some people appreciate the grimdark devastated atmosphere of Fallout 3 over the more hopeful, western approach of Fallout New Vegas, and I can understand that. It feels weird in a post-nuclear war to have such thriving societies built in the rubble, but I enjoyed the charm and innovative ways that society has managed to survive. In addition to this, during any kind of nuclear conflict they enemy would send millions of nukes at Washington D.C., where Fallout 3 is located so it makes a bit of canonical sense to have Fallout 3 be way more decimated than the Mojave Desert. I'm a bit too young to have played the earlier Fallouts but from everything I've read New Vegas is a more direct succesor to the older games.Fallout New Vegas has a faction system in lieu of a more traditional blanket morality system, which I find fantastic considering how the various storylines of the game can play out. It doesn't make sense that EVERYONE would be mad if you decided to shoot that innocent wastelander in the face, but if that wastelander happened to belong to a particular faction, they would be unhappy with you. This lets you reliably play as an ""evil"" or ""good"" character without the pre-conceived shackles of either disposition. If you manage to upset any faction too much be sure to expect them to send ""hit squads"" after you that can show up at any time, adding a real danger to exploration. The map also is a lot more packed with interesting locations, and the open nature of the environment means you can stumble across all kinds of mutated horrors that wayyyy outlevel you at any time. Really amazingly terrifying stuff. The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system is still in place, as well as the perk system. I've found speech to be a bit OP, but I really enjoyed talking my way out of dire situations time and time again.Seriously, if you haven't had the chance to play this game yet, buy the ultimate edition now. The DLCs are all great fun and on PC, you can mod the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game. I recommend Project Nevada for beginners, it adds a sprint functionality and rebalances all the weapons and perks to be more challenging, but also more enjoyable. Walking across a desolate desert littered with the remnants of the old world, hearing rifle shots as your companion Boone murders anything hostile that comes within a mile of you while listening to the ""Big Iron"" by Marty Robbins on the radio, you too will come to realize the elegant brilliance of this RPG. If anything, play it to get a handle on the lore of the Fallout universe and prepare yourself for Fallout 4!			"

												One of the greatest games ever made. Although essentially the same base game as Fallout 3 the writing is superb and introduces enough new gameplay elements to really make things seem like a new game rather than a reskin or expansion pack.It focuses on factions and currying favor or hatred from the various groups rather than a binary morality system. As such, the gameplay is different, as you have to decide your allegiances fairly early on. This also really impacts replayability as the game will feel different and play differently depending on which groups you are actively trying to support.Although Fallout 3 really nailed the bleak post-apocalyptic atmosphere, New Vegas's landscape feels much livelier, and more hopeful. Compared to the Capital Wasteland of Fallout 3 the Mojave Wasteland is thriving, including an actual functioning city of Las Vegas. The world is very well populated with NPCs that are all unique and have their own motives and stories for you to explore.My two biggest gripes with the game are: 1. After a certain point enemies become so powerful that small arms fire is almost useless. 2. Unlike Fallout 3 after beating the game you cannot explore the world, so beating the game means you will no longer be able to play as your character, which is disappointing since you spend so much time trying to build the world the way you want, and then have no chance to see the results of your actions.Now I'll do the DLC's as separate, brief reviews:Dead Money: Hard. Although the enemies were not that bad, and the plot was interesting and the characters well written, I got so frustrated trying to navigate the insta-kill mines and bomb collar triggers that I considered skipping this DLC altogether. That said though, The Sierra Madre Casino is a fascinating and unique place and the storyline of the DLC is very well written.Honest Hearts: Again, really great storyline, although overall it is very short. The scenery of Utah is very well captured and beautiful to look at, but the DLC feels a little stifling. Doesn't really add a lot of new weapons or things to carry over to the main game. Worth it for the storyline alone though.Old World Blues: A lot of people consider this to be the best DLC. It is definitely unique, well written, and adds a lot of new items to the game. However, it is very difficult to do since enemies are scaled to your level and very damage resistant. In addition, if you are a guns user, ammo is very scarce. If you enjoy crafting this can be mitigated, but I hate crafting and was constantly having to scrounge for ammo or just use whatever weapons I had to get by.Lonesome Road: Also somewhat difficult. But great storyline. Really focuses much harder on the post-apocalyptic atmosphere that Fallout 3 was so good at capturing.			"

												Very good installment in the Fallout franchise.I still see this game as the best Fallout game after Fallout 4 was released a while ago. This game is very good with dialogue, decent quests, and characters. The only minor issue I have with the game overall is that it feels empty, by that I mean the map itself. I can understand why it may be like this, but it just feels like it should add more to this slightly empty Mojave Wasteland. This is a very godd game like I said, I recommend playing this.			"

												ok so now to fix this reviewi did find a fix and i found this game better on PC and i can tell as i played like 3 hours on xbox but pc im on what 63 hours and i found that on pc i can have more fun and i acctually decided to get most of the unique weapons with the help of eso fallout and elder scroll guides.i found myself constantly searching for new locations and weapons and achievements and its very entertaining.The only downside is that the nexus site wont do anything when i click download but the game is still very good.At the moment i find there is a lot of guns but im getting bored and i havent even bought any dlc for some reason.this game has a reasonable amount of achievments and most are from quests or repairing so its pretty easy to get them aswell.now for the pros and consPROS- very fun gameplay-masive open world-lots of hours of content -nice amount of looting to be done-if u like being killed by very hard enemies *cough cough deathclaws* this a perfect game for u-very good exploration and sometimes it can be rewarded *cough cough bloodboune cave*- wide variety of enemies and companions-gore and dismeberment ++-lots of skills-a gazillion perks to chose ( i spend about an hour going through wich perk to chose)-wild wasteland perk (always a plus) *cough cough alien blaster with aliens to fight to get it*-good graphics-good gun modsCONS -sometimes can get annoying-u could save and then its a very hard part and u wouldnt be able to do itoverall i adore this game so much and the hype for fallout 4 is over the top.i am definetely getting fallout 4, might not be on pc but will be on consoleoverall this game gets a :9.5/10thanks for reading guys and peace ;D			"

												Each time I return to New Vegas, I find my self enjoying it more and more than previous playthroughs.Fallout New Vegas is as close to another Black Isle Studios' Fallout game as we are gonna get. It was made by most of the team that made those games to boot. You are a courier and you were shot in the brain. After somehow surviving that you are dug out of a grave by a sandman robot and you recover in an astonishing amount of time. Time to set out and go kill the limp dicked gimp ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that shot you.New Vegas uses the conventions paved from Fallout 3 except Reputation is something you need to keep in check. Killing factioned npcs will make you lose rep with that faction and they will eventually start shooting you on site, as well as locking out certain side quests.The story is great and includes some characters from previous BIS Fallout games, including Marcus the Super Mutant from Fallout 2.Everyone knows how great this game is but the real reason why people play this game is for the mods. Fallout New Vegas has so many ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed mods you could spend 8 decades modding this game and still find a new way to play.I may be a classic Fallout zealot but I acknowledge good game design, and this certainly is a good game. It can get a little boring, with some quests being point a to b fares, but it certainly isn't as ♥♥♥♥ing crippling depressing as Fallout 4.			"

												OBSIDIAN NEEDS TO MAKE FALLOUT 4!Fallout New Vegas is the best game I have ever played. It's ugly, yes, (fixed with texture and ENB mods) but the world is just so alive compared to F3, Skyrim, Oblivion. There are multiple ways to manipulate the fate of the world and it's factions. Also, there is a lot of humour in the game. Everything from sex robots to people blowing up when you shoot them in the foot. But at the same time, it's a dark dystopian universe with slavery, postitution, war, and serious issues for characters which doesn't feel like just another cardboard mute NPC.  Most of all, it's not F3. Vegas is all F3 should have been but never was. Bethesda has a lot to learn from the masters of Obsidian, which they ignorantly just didn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about in Skyrim. ♥♥♥♥ you, Bethesda, you suck.			"

												when i got this i was just getting over all my skyrim saves being overwritten when i stumbled across this in a steam sale. and. it. blew. my. mind. i found a game better than the elder scrolls!!!!! there are so many choices and events you can litteraly go through almost the entire game without firing  a bullet. and the landscape is astounding even though its an old game and every one looks like giant potatoe mutants the wasteland can look amazin some times. and in NV their not scared to get dirty there,s a dismemberment system the npcs dont have to censor themselves like most games do and even thoug theres some pretty wacky $*** it still pulls you in and immersifies you.in this game i dont feel like i need mods like i did in skyrim or oblivion because they catered for everyone even without the DlCs. and that,s why you should buy this game plain and simple.

												This is my 3rd Fallout game with Fallout 4 being my first and Fallout 3 being my 2nd.I love the story in New Vegas, the gameplay is familiar to me since I started this after I finished Fallout 3. All the factions have their different vision on what New Vegas should be and it's up to YOU the Courier to decide the fate. They made a lot of improvements from Fallout 3 such as optimization (less crashing), slightly better gunplay such as aiming down sights, and a better companion system. Obsidian did a fantasic job making a Desert interesting, not a lot of devs can manage to pull it off but they did. I will finish up writing the rest of my review after I finish New Vegas and its DLCs and I also hope that Obsidian makes another Fallout game in the future.			"

 Fallout New Vegas Welcome to Vegas. New Vegas. It’s the kind of town where you dig your own grave prior to being shot in the head and left for dead…and that’s before things really get ugly. It’s a town of dreamers and desperados being torn apart by warring factions vying for complete control of this desert oasis. Fallout new vegas is a Action, RPG game released on the 22nd October 2010.This game is so Good , The huge amount of choices  the game gives you, makes you want to try every single one which makes this game worth playing. As with skyrim , you can install Mods for this game to make your gaming experience better but i wouldn't see why you would want to, The game is good already.Pros:- Very good gameplay- Good storyline- It makes you want to play more.Cons:- The graphics could be improved ( in my opinion).I will give this game a 9.98/10 because i am a graphics fanboy so that 0.02 percent that didn't get added was because of the graphics but it's a Splendid game.

												You start the game dead and buried, and unearthed by your robot companion who hates you. A kindly doctor breathes life back into you before sending you off to fight in the arena you later learn is New Vegas and it's surrounding desert. Giant scorpions and bandits who explode when punched dot the landscape, eager to greet you with grenades and gunfire as you pop their heads using your godhand and wristwatch calculator. Wearing glasses improves your stats, boosting you from an average Joe to a green beret as soon as you put them on. Ghouls prove to be the most loyal creatures in this game, probably because they understand you're just as dead on the inside as they are.Vegas itself is heavily guarded but not really that interesting, since everything is broken in Fallout except the super computers on top of very tall towers which remain undamaged by the global nuclear destruction.Augementing yourself with a government issue nano-suit, you eventually punch, kick and jab your way to revenge, impaling the villain on a pool cue with the rest of his evil brethren.It's then revealed that computers are the source of all life's misery, and you're given a crucial choice to play the game out or end it there.

												I got so many and mixed feelings for this game. Fallout 3 was mindblowngly good and I had some expectations from New Vegas. I knew it couldn't look like a major AAA title release if it stood in front of FO3, but I was expecting more.Allow me to make things as simple as I can.PROS✔ Loved finding interesting places in the map while scavenging. You can find useful stuff in every corner. There's some attention to the detail in a few settings, like finding hideouts and lookout points that made you feel that someone indeed lived and died there some time ago.✔ Relived the glorious Fallout environment. I enjoyed it, I felt all that overdose of nostalgia left inside me ever since I played FO3.✔ Tribal, racial, community differences. Man I loved exploring them, finding out their background stories. Deciding their future. We need more of that!✔ Side quests with story impact. You know I'm not talking about how one can change a game's ending. But more like how NPCs treat you and talk to you, the way they appreciate you or hate you depending your actions and quests and decisions. i really enjoyed it. it made me feel that what I did mattered, it helped me get into character. It felt like an actually successful RPG element✔ Crafting. ♥♥♥♥ yeah crafting and disassembling stuff rules!✔ Mods. No need to same more. Blow your brains out with tons of them.CONS✖ Terribly limited. One can literally learn byheart every corner of the map. You can literally use and craft every single piece of material in the game in much less time than you could in FO3 or in any elder scrolls game. WTF? Why so small? This game was out as a stand alone title, full priced and with DLCs. There's no excuse to give players such a limited world to roam in!✖ Endless desert. What's up with that? Too bored to design different environments?✖ Cowboy cult. No need to say more.✖ Buggy. It unfortunately still is. My latest example is that my first main character got bugged into a female voice somewhere near the end. Even some NPCs greeted me as a woman lol ✖ Uninteresting story, FO-wise. Nothing memorable to it. No big scale ideals. No massive plans. Just a small story about taking over New Vegas under a power of your choice and a war of hardly 50 NPCs scale. You can literally speedrun the main quest in 2 hours without spending one single bullet and finish it at level 7 or 8.MIXED☢ There were some little graphical improvements done here. I loved the physics from body animations and face expressions. There were tiny bit gore details added when it comes to body dismemberment. Though the rest of the whole game felt exactly the same with FO3. Same engine, same environmental effects and physical geometrical interactions.☢ The voice acting was so carefully done for so many named characters. However the generic onelined greeting and goodbyeing was ridiculously off. For example you could speak to Melissa Watkins in the Brotherhood of Steel, who is designed to have the voice of a young girl, and there was no way in freakin hell you wouldn't miss that different deep mature female voice saying ""hello"" or ""goodbye"".☢ Music. To put it simply; I enjoyed the way all levels and moments were designed to much a musical background, the way only Bethesda knows how to introduce, but there's absolutely nothing memorable to it. There's simply no OST value. ☢ DLCs. Gun Runners’ Arsena and Courier’s Stash should had been given to players at RELEASE and not make then pay extra for them. Also in the rest of DLCs introduced there are major environmental designs showoffs. I REALLY enjoyed most of my DLC gameplay (well except the proximity deaths in Dead Money) but they all left me with the taste of unsatisfaction. They could only make nature and massive city designs just for the DLC? Why? Did the developers got too bored to give us that awesome design concept in the main game so they went on to demo-introduce it to us in tiny short bits of experiences? This is not what I would expect to happen in FO4. They better use the information they got from feedbacks to make an awesome job for the next title! Environment is one of the keys of success for this franchise!!☢ 100% game completion including quests and achievements is more like a chore than a unique experience. After 245 hrs on record in this game, I can safely say as much.FINALMy fellow Fallout fans. I'm a fan of the franchise too. But we need more than that in our games.FO:NV is an example of trying to juice out money from the pockets of a crowd that begs for new content.When Bethesda can prove to make wonders just like how FO:3 turned out, we need to expect nothing less than more major game releases with great improvements. Not modified versions of a previous title with a different story-to-be-told shoved in it and push it out the market to make more money.I'm giving Fallout: New Vegas a 6/10. It would had been an 8 or a 9 if they were more inovative with environmental designs. And it could easily drop down to 4 or 5 for all the reasons regarding lazy money making titles.It made me feel that I played a slightly above average game. It left me with tons of mixed feelings.I hope the next title will blow our minds off like FO3 did.Grab it only on special offersCheers			"

This isn't just a game, its a window to a living world set in the alternate timeline of the whizz-bang neon future of the 1950's torn asunder by war - a future that you must explore!

It's my third time I'm playing through Fallout NV story. First two times I went without DLC but now I got subplots along the main story aswell. New Vegas is huge and there's simply tons of stuff to go through. The story is catchy but maybe not as good as in the previos parts. The Legion, a well organized group of savages dressed like ancient Romans, is a little bit silly crowd to think living in a post-nuclear wasteland. That's probably the most annoying detail in the story. Other than that, I can't really blame the designers not putting enough effort on the story. Story 8/10In Fallout 3, the wasteland was huge and so it is in New Vegas. However, this time most of the irritating (invisible) obstacles that limit player's movements are removed or replaced with more plausible obstacles. Movement and HUD is pretty much the same as in Fallout 3. Again, a lot of time is spent with the pip boy. Using it simple but somewhat inflexible. Companions get lost sometimes in rugged environment but usually they'll find their way back to the player without any bigger hassle. Player can choose whether to fight taking turns or without and it works nicely. Taking turns feels safer what comes to spending ammo aiming a running enemy in the limbs or head is usually sketchy. Gameplay 8/10The overall graphics are fine: nothing extremely beautiful but works nicely in a story that takes place in a wasteland. Sometimes some shining surfaces look plastic especially when moving around with the flash light on and it actually gives me a headache. Soundscape is minimalistic yet working. Appearance 8½/10Overall experience is really good. At least I got what I wanted and I'm really happy with the game. Yes, there are some bugs and issues with the game but considering the extent of the game these flaws are somewhat acceptable. Moreover, gameplay works most of the time smoothly, so the good experience is not often disturbed. Maybe the best way to describe Fallout New Vegas is that the game holds on to its addictivity and after finishing the story for the first time there's still a lot of stuff to do. In general, this post-apocalyptic concept simply works. In my opinion, Fallout New Vegas might be the second best part of the Fallout franchise after Fallout 2, and not even far behind the first place.For a Fallout franchise fan New Vegas is a must-have, and it gives a good run for a Fallout-newbie's money as well.

												A fun and frothy experience best coupled with a tall glass of your favorite champaign, and a bowl dead fish stuff.  ""Fallout: New Vegas"" Is no doubt, an exquisite entertaining digital experience that will leave you satisfied, and yet, will you thirsty for more like a lowlife drunken mongrel who would sell his own mother for just a small sip of alcohol. Of course you withold such pleasures from the desprate man so that he may squirm and shiver for your own entertainment, and with his last bit of strength you promise him he could have the whole bottle if he would just get up do a little jig. Then you sit there, drinking his booze and laughing at him proclaiming ""dance, little man dance!"" Hahaha. Yes. Quite so. There is no doubt that ""Fallout: New Vegas"" is a standout amongst it's peers. Though never quite acheiving the sublimity of it's predecessor ""Fallout 3"", It is still remains  devilishly good fun. By jove, nothing beats the look on the face of unsuspecting passerby as you unceremonously rob him of all he posesses, and then stab him right in the back. Of course there are a number of unsavory mutant types roaming the world. Even the thought of them makes me shiver with terror. But they can be useful in pinch, believe you me, when there is a job that needs doing, a mutant or a raider will get the job done better then anyone else. Or at least good enough. Oh and then there is the music. Simplicity itself. Frank Sinatra would be proud to hear the roaring sounds of Vegas, that once paradice on earth, blasting from the spearks of your personal computer as you blow away yet another unsuspecting innocent with a rocket launcher. Well that's all I have to leave you with for now, dear reader. Enjoy your new digital experience, and remember during those moments of village onslaught, or wandering into some dangerous unknown area with strange green men who own big guns, there is always the load function to start over. Pleasant voyage friend.			"

												The younger and more attractive sister of Fallout 3, New Vegas takes pretty much everything 3 does and makes it better. The gameplay is better, the story has more depth to it, and the setting is just wonderful. It's also worth noting that FO3 wasn't 100% accurate to the FO lore, whereas this isn't the case with FONV.If you're familiar with FO3, FONV's gameplay is basically the same, with a few neat additions. If you're not, think of an FPS mixed with an open world action RPG that's broken up by dialog choices and searching for stuff. It really gets at the survivalist mentality that a lot of people seem to be getting into these days.Where FONV differs from the original, outside the obvious gameplay additions, is the story elements. The characters really feel alive in FONV, there's a real charm that New Vegas has that just makes you fall in love. I wish I had more room to talk about it, the FEEL of the game is just so fantastic.Anyway, I highly recommend this game. Highly replayable.			"

												Though its younger Elder Scrolls sibling gets a lot of credit as the most popular sandbox RPG of all time, Fallout: New Vegas is the best plotted and written. Obsidian Entertainment's respectful treatment of a beloved IP shines through in the innumerable quests and brilliant characterization that is so lacking in other games of its type. This game is a must-have.			"

It's everything you loved about Fallout 3 with all new characters, envloping story, and different setting. Dont miss out on this gem, capable of being modded til your heart's content (or PC's capabilities). Dive on in and shhh- no talking over Ron Pearlman's intro, ""War. War never changes...""			"

												I just finished my first playthrough of Fallout New Vegas and I have say its one of the ,most fun games I've played in an while.My character was a speech,barter and intelligence one and it was pretty fun (not as much in combat).ProsThe story is really intrestingThe factions are amazing, they add tons of replayibilityYou have to go with one build for your character(there's enough)The charecters(including companion-Veronica and Rex FTW)The locationsThe best thing is that the endings notice what you did they mention every little thing(well most) and give it a own paragraph like your companions, its truly awesome!!!ConsStill a ton of bugs, wtf! Luckly non that wanted me kms.You can't play after finishing the main story line, you can still play by reloading a save, but then you're just back and I guess you can do the thinks you didn't and get a better ending.Score 9/10 I'd say its the definite fallout experience.

The only thing im middle of the road about in this game is that during my play throught it seem easier to just shoot then use V.A.T.S where as in fallout  3 i was all ways using the feature, i personaly like V.A.T.S but if you dont you might enjoy this one more then fallout 3			"

I love that the worlds are so well thought out and the story is so interconnected to the player through his/her choices.This game is on another level.  The story for Fallout: New Vegas is one of the best for a game.  Right from the beginning cut scene, it pulls me into the world and gets me to want to play endlessly.  The envrionment in the game is amazing, the music makes the time go by quickly but the gameplay is something that willl just seem so familiar, especially if you're played Fallout 3.I recommend this game, without hesitiation.  This easily becomes a classic in my book, and no game collection is complete without it.			"

												Fans of the Fallout series may have been dissapointed by Fallout 3, the newbies were happy for it, but now us old timers can come back to the midwest for some new advenutres. Fallout New Vegas takes place the Mojave dessert in Nevada, it includes many actual landmarks, as well as it's own spin on things. Don't expect everything to be as it really is, but you can expect an amazing game. If you have the ultimate edition, or even buy the DLCs on your own, then you'll have access to such a huge backstory that your head will spin, and the reveal at the end, well. Anyway, 10/10 buy it now my friends!			"

												I liked it. It was a nice game. However, I'm afraid I can't say I loved it as I did Fallout 3.The Atmosphere of the game was a little dull and boring. ""But it's a nuclear wasteland. It's SUPPOSED to be like that!"". Yes... But it's also a game. To Entertain. No game is meant to be depressing. Emotionally upsetting is good. But not depressing.Fallout 3 was much better in this regard. It had a quirk to it which has simply been lost somewhere along the way in New Vegas.New Vegas also felt a little empty. Especially with the invisable walls around mountain sides etc.The modding community, like with Fallout 3, is incredible. It turns a potentially 50+ hour game into 500+ game. I'm not sure if links to modding sites it allowed, however, a quick google search would probably work. Nexus Mods is the site to visit.			"

												Barring Fallout 4 (which I have yet to play), this game's story really sucked me in more than any other Bethesda game, Skyrim included. There are fewer companions to venture with, but most of them have a back story that leads into some questing. The main storyline splits into 4 directions, and they have huge ramifications. The only complaint I have is with the pause menu in the game, as it's somewhat cumbersome to navigate. Either way, and minor problem is easily overlooked as the rest of this game is just simply amazing.			"

The missions are really interesting and you have multiple ways to complete them which include the factions that you may want to side with. I also have a guide for the game which is good reading and might help you make the best decision for the way you want to play.Also a big modding community for this, but i think that even without the mods this is really great.

One negative that I found with New Vegas was the amount of walking the player will need to take to progress - unlike Fallout 3 where you could walk a few acres and find a new location, easily.			"

												This game is awesome! It improves many of the things that were good in FO3 (RPG, pace, etc.), while it introduces a few new features, like the iron sights, if you prefer FPS. The only real downside could be the story, which is kinda wacky some times, but overall, it's a great game.			"

												The game has many pros but also a few cons. The reason I voted Yes is because I enjoyed the game and I think people who love games from the fallout franchise will DEFINETLY enjoy this game.The game might not be in the same level as Fallout 3 but you can easily explain that because two diffrent developers made the games, Fallout 3 was made by Bethesda itself and Fallout : NV was developed by Obsidian - PUBLISHED by Bethesda.The story itself is great, the stability of the items, the uniqueness and the overall feeling gives you that feeling that you're in an actual wasteland and you should make the right choises benificial to your survival.A few things that bugged me is that the game crashed A LOT. and I mean A LOT. There are some bugs here and there but you can't expect a game that is 100% bug free. Another thing that has bugged me is that if you finish the main story line - there's no continuation, which is kinda understandable because after you finish the main story line you basicly get a cinematic of what happened to everything based upon your final choise.Overall, I think the game is worth the money and you should defintely give it a try :)			"

												One of the best games ever created. This game + all the DLCs is more than worth the 5 bucks you will probably spend for it.Fallout: New Vegas with all the DLCs is at least 50-60 hours long. This game is great for replayability.I spent over 400~ (Not always had this one on Steam) hours playing this game, over 30~ hours modding it, and it never gets old. You can playthrough this game for at least 8~ times,making different decisions and it will never be the same exprience.You can mod it to the core, and there are alot of modifications to be made. If you love modding get this and Skyrim. Only downside to this game is performance, which is incredibly horrible. This game will lag and have stutters with a 2030 hardcore gaming machine as well. If you are going to play this, you HAVE to download mods that will make the game more stable on your machine,because  this game is incredibly buggy and has lots of crashes. (With mods, this can be sorted out)Again, if you like tweaking and modding a game, this game is an absolute must.If you expect an out-of-the-box exprience, go play Skyrim. "

												obsolete engine and wonky animations still don't deride too much from New Vegas. i personally enjoy this game over fallout 4 mainly due to the shining RPG elements and multiple ways to finish quests. fallout 4 was too dumbed-down in my opinion (still a great game though), but New Vegas sticks with Fallout's lore. People may not find the story as engaging, but I appreciate the blank-slate of the protagonist. It really allows you to be the person you want to be, and not be constrained to certain personalities (ahem, fallout 3 & 4). Mods really fix up the game. I made it more like STALKER and I'm having a blast right now.			"

												I finally hit 20 hours after about a month and 12 days (thats a guess) of owning F:NV. I love this game, but it has many many flaws. First off, the open world is pretty big. That isnt normally a bad thing, but when you walk slower than a crippled old lady going up a steep staircase. Seriously, and when you press shift it make you even slower! Besides that, this game is extremely difficult for first tim Fallout players. This was mty first Fallout game. I bought it because I wanted to play one of the older Fallout games before I bought Fallout 4. Also, the open world is pretty dull. It's just a desert with some occasional towns. And the Strip is extremely small and not what the first few hours of this game makes it seem like.  Also, loading screens feel more like a teacher giving a boring lesson becuase they take forever. But if you look past this games flaws, F:NV might be one of the best games on Steam.First off, I love the faction system. I joined the legion, and from that I was rewarded with occasional supply drops of ammo and other useful items. This game is definitely rewarding. Also, I love the plot in this game and how it isn't 80% cutscenes. In fact, the only cutscene I've seen so far is the intro, which is only 6 or 7 minutes long. There is ADS, but I personally don't use it much. VATS are pretty useful for close quarters combat. Lockpicking is awesome, and even better on PC. I know this game is old, but there should seriousy be a Steam Workshop for this game. I mean, people mod this game as much as people mod Skyrim, so I dont see why there Isn't a Workshop.Overall though, I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a good story, a good RPG and an amazing game. Whether it's on sale or not, you should buy F:NV, and maybe even the Ultimate Editon for double price and all the DLC.I'd love feedback on this review, so please tell me what you think! Enjoy Fallout New Vegas!Edit:I just finished F:NV. Wow. I loved it. Except for one thing that makes this different from other RPG's.  After completing the main story, it takes you back to the main menu, and asks you if you want to load a previous save. In other words, you cannot explore the Mojave or do side quests. Also, this game has a painfully low level cap of 30. While it does take some time to level up, this is an extremely small level cap. With DLC, though, the level cap is 50 (Each DLC adds 5 levels to the level cap). As I did the final mission, I began to notice some things. First, using guns continuously for a long time makes them feels weird. Basically what I'm trying to say is that the gunplay feels a little off. This somewhat forces you to rely on V.A.T.S. most of the time. But let me say what I have noticed about the game from finishing it that I did enjoy. I definitely noticed that ADS is important at one point, especially with long range kills. Before I wrap this up I want to point out that this game felt kind of short. I expecting a longer campaign, but atleast the replay value is extremely high. So, to wrap this up, (at least for now,) I want say that even though it felt short, and the gunplay feels awkward, and the level cap is very low, I can still say that Fallout: New Vegas is one of, if not the, best games I've ever played and you should definitely buy it, sale or not, Ultimate Edition or normal.(Yes I know that was the longest sentence ever) I plan on buying the DLC for F:NV soon, and I'll do another edit if on what the game is like with DLC. Buying and investing hours of my time into Fallout: New Vegas is one of the best choices I've ever made, and I plan to do it all again.Also I'd like to mention the fact that I have almost 30 hours of gameplay and I've only come across one Deathclaw. Just a little strange to me.March 21, 2016: EDIT 2: I want to point out something. F:NV is only ten dollars without DLC, (I bought it for $2.49 on sale) and I've managed to get 30 hours from it. Some have even got hundreds of hours of gameplay. Think about that. 30 hours, and thats just the main storyline. Yeah, some games are longer, but for this pricetag, that's a lot of gameplay.			"

												Perhaps my favorite Fallout game ever, despite the bugs, I played it originally on the xbox, and with playing it on the xbox, completely unmodded, I still racked up well over 300 hours of playtime in it. This is the Fallout game I recommend more than any other. It makes you feel like you can immerse yourself in it more than Fallout 3 because of how the story is designed. You're not weighed down by your fictional family. Just your role.			"

True to lore settings with references to the first two games that makes it feel like a welcome transition instead of the voilent gangrape to the lore of a beloved series like FO3. Lots of unique gear to hunt down and interesting armors you can dress up with. More dangerous enemies and a survival mode that's worthy of the fallout series. Also has cowboys.			"

												I've played this on Xbox, and I have to say this is a blast to play. I like it more than Fallout 3 because there's just a better feel to it. There's more factions, which creates more quests, more places to explore, and I never felt like I had to go talk to someone just to find a quest to do. And one of my favorite parts about it, is that almost every choice you make ends up at the slideshow at the end, which is awesome. However, the game ends at the final quest, Luckily it saves it right before you do it though.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is a great game for Fallout fans, old and new. You could help Caesar rid the wasteland of all threats but at a lost for freedom for many. You could help NCR take over but listen to their rules and laws. Let anarchy rule the wastes, but let all be free. Or let Robert House gain total control over the Mojave. One of the terrible parts of the game is the fact that you cannot play after The Second Battle of Hoover Dam. You could destroy all factions, major (such as the Legion) or minor (such as the Kings). You can decide wheter to spare or kill the man who shot the Courier. It shows in-game that starting off as someone of minor abilites could make a large difference, as all Fallout games do, and shows that actions have consequences, good or bad.			"

												Very, very, very fun game. There are many mods for this game so it won't get boring for a couple hundred hours. One new feature about New Vegas is that now there are factions and you choose what factions to help and how the Mojave will be changed by that faction. Karma isn't a big thing in this game, instead it is more focused on factions. Be careful though, if you help out one faction, you might make another faction hate you. The storyline starts off slow but gets more exciting later. While the main story is somewhat short (13 hours) there are many sidequests to do along with sweet guns, secrets, references to movies and cool DLCS. Steam doesn't put this game on sale that often anymore so if you see it go on sale, add it to your cart quickly! I say it is totally worth $20. The only cons about this game are the glitches. But you can get a mod to patch it. Although, after you reach level 30, the adventure sort of stops because you can no longer gain XP to level up. Another cool thing about the game are the vault's stories. Just go and check some of them out. One last downside to the game is that you cannot continue after you beat the main story so you have to continue a previous save and explore all the cool places the Mojave has to offer. Although some of them are a little dull because it is nothing but a shack. Other than that this game is pretty sweet.			"

												One of my personal all-time favourites, Fallout: New Vegas is an amazing entry into the franchise. It includes great RPG elements and a fantastic storyline with several choices available for the player to become immersed in the massive and detailed frontier of the Mojave Wasteland, which has many locations and factions that the player can choose to side with- or destroy.An entertaining combat system is introduced, with iron sights and cinematic kills aided by the satisfying VATS.NPCs and companions are better than ever, as almost every character has their own unique tale to tell and can be linked with a large amount of side quests and unmarked quests, without over-using generic fetch quests and other repetitive mechanics to keep the player occupied.One of the best things about this game is the outstanding modding community, which keeps the game supplied with new content even today, 3 years after its release. From graphics enhancements to new quests, items, locations and characters, it can all be used to make this game even better. I highly recommend this game as it's worth every penny, especially right now with the current Steam sales.			"

												Fallout New vegas was the first of the fallout series I have played, It really threw the player right into it which I thought was pretty good and there is this sense of not being ""taught by the game"" as the mainly goal is given straight at the beginning, kill the guy who tried to kill you! Sounds simple enouph until things get really complicated and everything you do will affect the outcome of the game. I really enjoyed playing it and the addons as well. The only one addon I didn't like was the science lab, old world blues, it didn't relate to the story at all and the bonus perks at the end were a bit too much and gave me a headache after trying to find out which was the main quest to get me out of that damn place. The other negative I have was constant crashing, lucky this is countered by auto saves and the physics as I looted a brotherhood guy early in game and his body fell through the ground and off the map, and I needed to  him again for mission.I loved the graphics, and other physics, and the exploration. really is a game for the hard hearted			"

												One of the best games I've ever played. You can get so many hours out of this game; I only have 25 at the moment but I only got this game recently on PC, I've mostly played it on 360. There are so many different ways to play, I've started at least four different files and each one felt entirely unique.  Add modding and you've got a game that can last you a long time. Also, this game can run on pretty low-end PCs, which is always a plus. If you don't like the graphics, there are a ton of ENBs as well. And don't even get me started on the DLCs; all four are absolutely amazing. Overall, the only negative thing I can say about this game is that it can be glitchy at times, but they can be funny and there are a ton of fix mods to remove them. $20 is a steal of a price for such an amazing game, and if that's still too pricey, New Vegas is extremely cheap during sales. 10/10ASSUME THE POSITION			"

												Fallout new vegas, where do i begin. When i first picked up New vegas for the xbox 360, i thought it felt abit stale, like i had already seen this before. But i was wrong, i bought both fallout 3 and new vegas on the pc (again becuase i had them both on the xbox 360) and i completed fallout 3 almost 100%, I LOVE THAT GAME, then i played fallout new vegas. With the same graphics and style as fallout 3 you woulld be surprised when i call this game different from fallout 3, and it is different. New vegas has got everything from fallout 1 and 2 and then just put it into fallout 3, i can tell you know, they chose well to do that. New vegas feels different because the whole setting is more developed then the Capital Wasteland, as in you would see civilisation more often in New vegas, where as in fallout 3, almost everyone is trying to kill eachother, which is nice for both games since it adds more of a reason for me to those whether i should play fallout 3 over new vegas or new vegas over fallout 3. Also new vegas doesn't have that awesome green tint from fallout 3, which is good since its different.			"

												Epic game. Good Quests. Very good story. Different ways to build your character. A lot of fun, but in my point of view you should avoid the DLCs, because all of them have very linear gameplay and have very annoying level scaling enemies. Specially on higher levels (40+) where you end up pumping countless bullets into every single enemy.			"

												This is an absolutely breathtaking game, from the first cutscene to the final battles. Even once the main game is finished (that takes a while and consists of tons of missions, gameplay, and stories), the DLC's add so much more to the game. I would recommend this game to any single-player FPS fan, and even those who want to have a shooter, but don't have much experience with shooters or long games with great, complex stories. Definitely my favorite game ever.			"

												This game is a great game but not as great as Fallout 3 before it. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that you couldn't play after the main story, but thank goodness there's finally mod for this game that breaks the ending.I do like the factions on how you can join a faction and see how everyone treats with joining that faction. I do recommend this for everyone who like Fallout 3 and I recommend the break ending mod for everyone wish to play after the main story of Fallout: New Vegas.Recommended![rating: 100/100]			"

												Fallout: New Vegas has definitely improved on some technicalities of its predecessors such as weapons, dialogues and the like. If you are a fan of the series, it is a good game anyway. Nevertheless, I did not enjoy the story as much as in Fallout 3. Your only goal seems to reach New Vegas and once you are there you wander around aimlessly at first. I also did not like the supposedly open choice of which group to join when the game makes it pretty clear who the good guys are, i.e. who you should be joining. Despite this, there are fun quests and places and I enjoyed the allies way more than in Fallout 3. I'd be a Yesman any day for that fun robot!			"

												A game of endless content. Great replay value with many different endings depending on the many -sometimes quite difficult, polically or ethically charged- dicisions made. I must've sunk over 400 hours into it (before I owned it on Steam) and on every playthrough I discover new area's and side-stories. When you finally think you've really seen it all... you get into modding. This is when you find out that all flaws that you used to ignore because the rest of the game is so awesome, have been fixed by the community along with plenty new game mechanics, tweaks and hours, no, days of extra, often fully voice-acted content. I would say this is my favorite game without a doubt, if not for the other masterpieces that have been created with the same engine: Elder Scrolls IV and Fallout 3.			"

												Well, here's my review of Fallout New Vegas. I am going to put it in English and in Spanish, so, let's start.I recommend that game, because (in a part I love Fallout) it's fantastic! You can go wherever you want, you can do whatever you want, and you can find weapons, and buy modifications. You can explore the Vaults, with the terminals understand what happened there, and there's one Vault, where, is an arsenal (obviously the Vault is dangereous because there are a lot of gouls and Gecos), where you can find an unique and super special weapon, The Patriot. It's a Tirator Carabine, but with a lot of more damage. You, in Fallout New Vegas (ALERT SPOILER COMING), in the finale, you can fight with Caesar, Mister House, or the RNC for the Hoover Damm. For me, that game it's fantastic, and in the 10th of november, this year, IS GOING TO COME FALLOUT 4!!.SPANISHYo, recomiendo este juego, porqué (a parte, me encanta Fallout) ¡es fantastico! Puedes ir dónde quieras, hacer lo que quieras, puedes encontrar armas, y comprar modificaciones. Puedes explorar los Vaults (Refugios), con los ordenadores puedes entender que pasó allí, y, hay un Refugio, en el qué, hay un arsenal (obiamente el Refugio es peligroso porqué hay un montón de Necrófagos y Gecos), donde puedes encontrar un arma única y super especial. La Patriota. Es un rifle de Tirador, con un montón de daño. Tú, en Fallout New Vegas (ALERTA SPOILER EN CAMINO), en el final, puedes luchar con Cesar, el Señor House, o la RNC, por la Presa Hoover. Para mí, este juego es fantástico, y en el 10 de noviembre de este año, SALE FALLOUT 4!!			"

Are you a hero who tends to the needs of the masses, a selfish prick that watches the hardships of other with indiffernce, or maybe a psychotic serial killer who murders on a whim?  Do you wish to shape the world in your image? Or maybe make as less of an impact on it as possible?

												Almost perfection, I could honestly talk about this game for hours. I'd recommend it to just about anyone whose into dark settings and high quality storytelling as well as characters that really make you think. With like 3 or 4 mods this game is a perfect 10 to me. It's a shame the game launched in such a broken state.             Okay, so I've played through the game 3 times and all of the dlc twice, I've actually only run into a small amount of bugs, things such as scorpions spawning in the grounds with their tails sticking out of the sand, a dog with eyes floating on the side of his head, getting stuck inside rocks a couple times which is easily fixed through tcl or reloading a save and one single quest breaking bug out of the 173 quests in the game including dlc and not including the miscellaneous quests. I also ran into 1 save corruption. That's it, maybe I'm just lucky idk but my experience was relatively bug free. Just save often and you'll avoid these problems by reloading. I also get crashes which seems to be kind of unavoidable with these games but it doesn't happen as often as it does in skyrim, fallout 3 or oblivion for me personally.        I could talk about the story and characters forever and how well done they all are. Veronica, Boone, Joshua Graham and Mr House to name a few were all awesome. Mr House specifically sticks out as a character I could talk about for a very long time. I continue to think about these characters long after I finish the game. Obsidian really went out of their way to give the characters depth on a level that is competetive with bioware games. Something that most of the time Bethesda doesn't even attempt to do.                I don't know what else to say without extending the review for too long. I obviously recommend this game, it's well worth your time and money but if you're new to the Fallout series I'd still recommend you play FO3 or FO1 first. FO3 is a great way to introduce yourself to the setting but if you play FO3 and miss out on New Vegas you really are robbing yourself of a complete experience. I feel like Fallout 3 is the first quarter and New Vegas is like the last 3 quarters that completes the experience and makes it a real sequel to fallout 1 and 2. Everyone should experience both games. To me this is a 9.5 without mods and on launch it would probably be lower because of how broken I hear it was. If you like fallout 1,2 or 3 play this game, it's worth it, just remember to eat, drink and take several breaks because this game will grab you by the balls and won't let go until it's over.			"

												Fans of the Fallout series may have been dissapointed by Fallout 3, the newbies were happy for it, but now us old timers can come back to the midwest for some new advenutres. Fallout New Vegas takes place the Mojave dessert in Nevada, it includes many actual landmarks, as well as it's own spin on things. Don't expect everything to be as it really is, but you can expect an amazing game. If you have the ultimate edition, or even buy the DLCs on your own, then you'll have access to such a huge backstory that your head will spin, and the reveal at the end, well. Anyway, 10/10 buy it now my friends!			"

The first DLC has just recently been announced, and it sounds awesome (even if it's a 360 exclusive for the moment, I'm sure us PC gamers will get it too eventually).If you like RPG's, shooters, or open-world games, give this a try. It's a perfect blend of all three, and one you should definitely not miss out on.			"

												I know that some wouldn't agree with me, but this is one of the most fun games that I have ever played. The modding community is great as well, as it adds countless hours of extra gameplay after you've done everything elso. Trust me, I've been there. Anyways, I highly recommend this game, especially if you are a fan of RPG. The only letdown may be considered to be the bugs and glitches in the game, but that hasn't really affected or bothered me. Other than that, I don't really have many other complaints about the game. 9.5/10			"

												Fallout New Vegas is a wonderful game, incorperating many elements within from quality of items to karma, appealing to people and keeping yourself alive. Weapons, armor, and many other items are found all throughout the game, and the dlc expand the base game way more. A bonus Hardcore mode makes the game even more realistic, allowing you to have to juggle hunger, hydration, and sleep, and more realistic item settings and ingame stats, which are detailed ingame. Post apocolyptic wasteland is so fun to explore, and the story is actually strewn through all the dlc as well, with many interconnected stories that can intertwine and unlock new options and dialogue. Speaking of dialogue, there are many, many options of dialogue, and skill set and specific attributes can influence dialogue, among other things that are affected. They thought of many different aspects of the game and beautifully blended the game operations together. I love this game so much, despite it being over 4 years old, because it plays so well, and is so well crafted, that i play this game over and over again, and my Steam playtime is not an accurate display of my love for this game. I have Probably 300+ hours into this game on my ps3, and it is still fuin everytime I play the game, no matter the platform. I highly recommend this game, and its predasessor, Fallout 3 with all the dlc as well. I would say play the old one first, as it has some different elements to it, and the feel is very different as well. I love this game so much, and believe everyone should play this game.			"

The world of New Vegas definitely feels more lived-in and realized the the previous game.  Be aware, it's much less forgiving than Fallout 3, so get ready to die some in the beginning.  But stick with it, and it's one of the best first-person RPGs out there.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is in my opnion, the best entry into the series. The expierence offered is nothing short of spectacular, it's one of the few games I have replayed on multiple occasions to completion and enjoyed every time. The game of the year edition also offers an expanded universe that complements the main story extremely well. If you're looking for a game that is well worth its price even when it's not on sale then Fallout New Vegas is the one to choose. The expanded modding scene also gives more content to enjoy, one of my favorite games of all time. It certainly has it's issues, but overall the game is fantastic and well worth the buy.			"

												Every fallout game is a must-play, but if your looking for a more fleshed out Fallout 3 taking place in a more wastelandy region, (Nevada) then this is for you.Not only is this game easy to get into as a noobie to the fallout series, but it is equally as easy to get into as a fan of the fallout series. This is mainly due to plenty of easter-eggs and nods to the classic fallout games.Many people complain that the fallout engine's shooting mechanics aren't very good. That is horse♥♥♥♥♥♥ The shooting mechanics feel good on all weapons. Not a big fan of shooting? Try hitting a giant mutant fire ant with a sledgehammer. Not into hitting things with sledgehammers? You can beat the entire game by just punching everything! Its hard but you can.Fallout is one of the only games in the history of RPG's that is a FPS. It is also, literally, the only game on the market where you can just straight up kill everyone and everything. Not interested in getting revenge? Just kill everyone in town and make it your outpost! Sick of the casino henchmen saying baby all the time? Bring a grenade launcher into the lobby and kill everbody!I have played this game for a ridiculous amount of time. Yet, I still havent found everything in the game. There are still secret weapons, quests, companions, etc. that I have not looted, complete, or met. Even if you do, somehow, find everything in the vanilla game, there are still very cheap dlc you can get, that add loads of new content. Are you so much of a badass that you find and do everything in the DLC too? Fallout New Vegas has a rich modding community.Simply google, ""FNV Nexus"" into your local google-o-tron and you will find, literally, thousands of mods that will either add something incredible, or change the entirety of the game mechanics.If you totally have no social life at all, and finish every mod ever made, including the constant pipeline of daily content being added for you, you can always make your own mods with the very interesting Fallout SDK. Make your own quests, make your own kingdom, make your own virtual girlfriend (That you most definitely need), not even the sky can limit you!I give Fallout New Vegas:10/10""Like skyrim with guns""If you liked this guide then go ♥♥♥♥ yourself and spend that time playing the game.

												First off, don't believe all that stuff about the game running like♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics being sucky, everything just being awful, it being boring, etc, etc. It's only boring if you try to have no fun. The wasteland is...Supposed to be a wasteland...Some parts...Are irradiated because they're supposed to be...Be a mann and wade through that radioactive sewage! Be a mann and kill those deathclaws! And if this game bores you, just do whatever the hell you want in it. Get power armor and blow up the BOS Bunker with 20200102001 dynamite, slash through hordes of ghouls, just murder everyone. And if murdering everyone and satisfying your bloodlust isn't enough, do it for the nostalgia. And if nostalgia isn't enough/doesn't exist, avoid this game.Gud?1. Many hours of gameplay, many places to explore.2. You get to do whatever you really want to do. Usually with consequences, but go ahead, kill everyone! It's fun!3. Mods. Are. Amazing.4. If you're like me, and are easily impressed by graphics and say Donkey Kong had the best graphics, well, then the graphics are on par with Donkey Kong. If you actually don't think Donkey Kong had the best graphics, then the graphics in this game are pretty good. If you're a stickler, decent. If you're a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, awful. If you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, go die.5. So fun to explode people, dismember people...God, I am violent. Also, hardcore mode! Fun!Bad?1. You can only have two companions, one humanoid, one non-humanoid. Can be fixed with mods, so you get out there and make a glorious army!2. Nothing...Else?Please realise that this review is extremely biased. In a non-biased opinion, the game is exceptionally fun and has tremendous replay value if you enjoy exploring and RPGS, and action and stuff like that.			"

												Very awesome game!Large modding community, the DLC is excellent.It is a fun and interesting open world RPG with that unique splash of fallout humor that comes more from the orignal games (1 and 2).The game, dispite running on the same old engine as fallout 3, has many improvements from the previous game, like the ability to aim down the gun sights, better speech checks and more guns. :PIf you are interested in modding this game, I would suggest the mods:- Underground Hideout: New Vegas (UHNV)[www.nexusmods.com]- Project NEVADA[www.nexusmods.com]Plus anything else you find interesting from this[www.nexusmods.com] site.However, the game is, like many other bethesda titles, quite buggy. There are unoffical patches you can get to fix most of the bugs in the game to make for a more enjoyable experience.Highly recommend the game (especially if you enjoyed any of the previous fallout games)!

												In my opinion, it's not as good as Fallout 3 in terms of DLC and general gameplay quality. However, Fallout: New Vegas is much more stable and generally more updated than its predecessor and has a far more active modding community than TES V: Skyrim. In all honesty, this game is a bit of a copy and paste of Fallout 3 with updates to certain game mechanics but as I said it usually works much better than Fallout 3 on updated computer OS's. Honestly, I'd recommend this game if you play with mods.			"

												Fallout New Vegas:     FNV is an open world, action rpg set in a post-apocalyptic Mojave desert, with civilization starting to re-emerge out of the ashes. The fairly large map (21 square miles) surrounds one of the few places doing relatively well in the wasteland: Vegas. The landscape in vegas can sometimes be a bore, with a lot of dry rolling hills around you, but the excellent 30's, 40's, and 50's music will make you forget all that, and just hum along.      Story wise, FNV is not amazing, but still good. In the opening cinematic, you, a simple courier for the mojave express company, gets shot straight in the head by a suave, but evil and cocky son-of-a-gun fellow named Benny. Once you are healed in the nearby town of goodsprings, your new goal is to hunt him down and bring him to justice. The story brings the player around the whole map, greeting the player with dozens of side quests. Once the player finally does kill Benny, the story really takes off, allowing the player to join one of the three factions viyng for power, or take over by yourself. The three faction are :The New California Republic, a gorup wanting to bring back the world before the apocalypse, Ceasers legion, a crazy dicator bent on ruling like a roman emperor, and Mr.House, a high tech robot wanting to bring back the 'glory of vegas'.    Gameplay is where this game truly shines. With the old-school RPG like character creation complete with a plethora of unique and fun perks, you can create a variety of different classes, each with their own playstyle, allowing for a lot of replayability. There are dozens of different weapons varying from a simple smg, or an orbital strike cannon, or a plasma rifle, a super-sword thing, and dozens more. With the expansive map filled with locations ranging from a ski lodge with super-mutants, to deep vaults giant fire ants, the postapocalyptic world is a truly crazy place.      FNV is not perfect, though there are hundreds of bugs and glitches, which is to be expected with a game of this size. Some of the quests are bland, and some of the locations are quite small and boring. There seems to also be only a few voice actors, evenif thats not the case. Most of these problems can be fized with mods, which brings me to my next point:the excellent modding community. There are hundreds and thousands of mods on the nexus and various other sites, ranging from high quality lore friendly quests, to crazy weapon packs, graphical overhauls, spiderman cars, companion mods, bug fixes, to more risque things.     With the points made above, I strongly reccomend this game to anybody who loves rpg's action games, well written experiences, and pretty much anyone who has likes video games. I do not reccomend this to a completionist though, much like Skyrim, the buggy quests, and the sheer size of the game makes it quite hard to 100% complete, and maybe not in a good way. To anybody else that likes anything, by this game now.Score(do I need this?) = 8.5/10With mods = 9.5/10			"

												Fallout: New Vegas transports the player to a completely different world. The introductory video will introduce you to people and factions who will become your greatest enemies and your best friends, but it's left up to you to decide who is who. Playing as an amensiac courier, you must piece together your own past, but when you have all the facts, it's time to decide the future. You face difficult choices that will influence the rest of the storyline which culminate in the Battle of Hoover Dam, but your story isn't over. A final video extends the stories of communities and characters well into the future based on your actions.The iconic Fallout style shows throughout the game, and many old factions are shown in a refreshing light. Each faction has a unique style, philosophy, and history, that can only be gleaned through extensive dialogue options.			"

												As a huge fan of Fallout 3 I decided to go back to NV, even though my first playthrough was rather unsatisfactory. This time around I started modding with Project Nevada, and used a little metagaming because NV isn't all that RP friendly, but you do get used to it. On my first playthrough, my PC died during the last part of the game and took me a few months before I concluded my save file, only to get smacked in the face with a no-playing-after-main-quests-are-done scenario, and because I only just tried to get into it again I dropped it and went and played Fallout 3. Now that I'm playing again I plan on getting all the DLCs done and beat the game on hardcore.So I'll start with the positives. Firstly, the lore and setting of the Fallout Universe is such a great concept and allows for interesting stories and quests, however, I do feel FONV didn't quite take full advantage of the series' potential, but I'll get to that when I go over the negatives. I really enjoy open-world, sandboxy games, and being able to walk from one place to another is a feature that gives the game good immersion value. Combat system is lovely, using both skill and level to determine your performance, it's an aspect of the game I really like. Being able to chose what you say and influence how the story plays out is a mechanic that is essential to a Fallout game, and I think New Vegas did this well, with the odd forced-response here and there.One of the big flaws with the game is that you, The Courier, aren't motivated to do anything. Throughout the first segment of the game, it totally assumes you're going after the guy who shot you (Benny) because you want revenge, but if the character you've created doesn't want revenge, then they're stuck twiddling their thumbs in Goodsprings until you decide that your character is explorative and you wander off to some random place in the tiny Mojave Wasteland, with like, 4 towns. Which brings me to my second criticism; the world is tiny, there's barely anywhere to go, and no motivation for The Courier to go there. Finally, the game is unbalanced and glitchy without mods, some enemies, especially at low levels are bullet sponges that lead to conflicts that go for too long, get boring and frustrating.Overall, FONV is an amazing game to play through and I highly recommend mods when doing so. I still enjoy Fallout 3 more but I've essentially played that game to death, hopefully FO4 is released before I'm bored with New Vegas.			"

If you have ever played any bethesda game and liked it you will love this game it is 100 times better than fallout 3 but that games fun too:D.

This game also has a massive modding community which adds an endless amount of gameplay. Would definitely recommend.			"

												So I did a review of Fallout 3 a couple years ago, and I forgot to do one of Fallout New Vegas.  Suprizingly I actually liked FNV better than F3!  Fallout New Vegas carries on the awesome open world RPG gameplay that is found in many other Bethesda games. It is so addictive and entertaining!  FNV added a lot of things that were either lacking or not done as well in F3.  I happen to be a bit of a gun nut in real life, and this game hits home hard for those of use that are into firearms.  The amount of real-world accurate weapons in the game is mind boggling.  I think that FNV is one of the reasons I got into reloading my own ammunitions.  I loved that feature. The environment is FNV is also much more dazling and rich than the environment in F3.  You get the sense that you are really out in the wild west wasteland, where life is beginning to spring back, and people have dropped into their western dog-eat-dog lifestyle.  I played the game through between 2-3 times, and found that I most enjoyed playing as a desperado vagabond that went around doing good for the needy and mercilessly destroying any enemies.  The RP aspect is much deeper than F3, and perhaps moreso than Skyrim.If you have any doubts whether to buy this game, do it.  do it now...or when it goes on sale.  You won't regret it!  Please give us Fallout 4 Bethesda!!!! Put the Elder Scrolls on hold!			"

You have the choice to end the start-game quest/tutorial whenever you want (in case you already know how the survival skill works and how to use VATS). Good game, great DLC.

												*10.6h played on PC, +500h total including PS3*This game is in my opinion the best Fallout inthe franchise. The missions (both main and sidequests) are interesting and varied, the combat is exciting at higher difficulties, the exploration aspect is very enticing because of the multitude of places and buildings you can stumble upon during your playthrough. The game is very fun overall and has a lot of replayability value due to the multiple paths and factions you can take on. There are a variety of weapons and armor that let you follow multiple different playstyles, such as a sniper, a run-and-gun guy, an explosives expert, etc. However, there are bad points too. The game for one, has some weaknesses due to time constraints during development on Obsidian's side. So there is some cut content and some aspects of the game that feel hollow and leave a lot to desire, like the Legion, which is sadly very shallow. And another thing I dislike is that the game is not as difficult as it should be. Hardcore mode doesn't punish enough and it's not too difficult to eat, drink and sleep in the Mojave, you just have to keep an eye on the counter and that's that. Both these issues can be fixed with mods, so yeah, hooray for PC!To grossly sum it up: it's fun, it's crazy, it may make you play for weeks or months, mods are a thing for this and will make you stay for much longer and hardcore mode is not as hardcore as one may think at first.

												Fallout: New Vegas - Welcome to Vegas. New Vegas. It’s the kind of town where you dig your own grave prior to being shot in the head and left for dead…and that’s before things really get ugly. It’s a town of dreamers and desperados being torn apart by warring factions vying for complete control of this desert oasis. It’s a place where the right kind of person with the right kind of weaponry can really make a name for themselves, and make more than an enemy or two along the way. As you battle your way across the heat-blasted Mojave Wasteland, the colossal Hoover Dam, and the neon drenched Vegas Strip, you’ll be introduced to a colorful cast of characters, power-hungry factions, special weapons, mutated creatures and much more. Choose sides in the upcoming war or declare “winner takes all” and crown yourself the King of New Vegas in this follow-up to the 2008 videogame of the year, Fallout 3. Enjoy your stay.Key Features Feel the Heat in New Vegas! Not even nuclear fallout could slow the hustle of Sin City. Explore the vast expanses of the desert wastelands – from the small towns dotting the Mojave Wasteland to the bright lights of the New Vegas strip. See the Great Southwest as could only be imagined in Fallout. Feuding Factions, Colorful Characters and a Host of Hostiles! A war is brewing between rival factions with consequences that will change the lives of all the inhabitants of New Vegas. The choices you make will bring you into contact with countless characters, creatures, allies, and foes, and determine the final explosive outcome of this epic power struggle. New Systems! Enjoy new additions to Fallout: New Vegas such as a Companion Wheel that streamlines directing your companions, a Reputation System that tracks the consequences of your actions, and the aptly titled Hardcore Mode to separate the meek from the mighty. Special melee combat moves have been added to bring new meaning to the phrase “up close and personal”. Use V.A.T.S. to pause time in combat, target specific enemy body parts and queue up attacks, or get right to the action using the finely-tuned real-time combat mechanics. An Arsenal of Shiny New Guns! With double the amount of weapons found in Fallout 3, you’ll have more than enough new and exciting ways to deal with the threats of the wasteland and the locals. In addition, Vault-Tec engineers have devised a new weapons configuration system that lets you tinker with your toys and see the modifications you make in real time. Let it Ride! In a huge, open world with unlimited options you can see the sights, choose sides, or go it alone. Peacemaker or Hard Case, House Rules, or the Wild Card - it’s all in how you play the game.			"

												If you were planning on buying Fallout New Vegas (or were simply considering it), then I recommend you go for the GOTY edition instead of stock Fallout, as FNV: GOTYE comes with all of the DLC for much cheaper, and the DLC is a lot of what made this game so fun.So for the rest of this review, I am going to assume that you have not gotten any of the DLC. Let's roll.Fallout: New Vegas is a first person shooter RPG and the sequal to Fallout 3. In the game you play as a courier in the city of Las Vegas after a nuclear war. On your way to deliver a mysterious package which was turned down by the previous courier, you are captured by a thug named Benny, who steals your delivery before shooting you in the head twice and burying you.Somehow, however, you manage to survive the gunshot wounds to your cranium and are dug up by a robot named Victor and brought to a doctor in goodsprings. This is where the game begins. As the doctor goes through your medical exam, you get to customize your character to your liking, changing their looks, stats, and starting abilities.As you progress, you come to your first decision in the game, where an escaped convict named Joe Cobb threatens Goodsprings because they are holding someone inside the gas station who Joe wants dead. You are given the choice between joining the powder gangers or holding up a defense against them in goodsprings, or even leaving the whole incident alone.The game has a load of weapons, armor, and items to collect, and many different character and faction builds. From what I have gathered, there are 4 different main endings, followed by an explaination of what happened to all of the other characters and locations you met during your journey.Overall, I would highly reccomend this game to anyone.

												The only thing Fallout 3 has over New Vegas is the world map.The things New Vegas has over Fallout 3 is more weapon variety, munitions variety, location variety, a compelling story based on your actions, treatment by different factions, too many useful yet incomparable perks and ways to build a character, more enemy variety, more difficult decisions rather than a boring good/evil system (that's still in and does stuff though, just not as much), aaaaaand the ability to kill everyone. Because, hey, there's always a reason to kill someone in the wastes, even if it's just you against the world, baby. Ring a ding ding!			"

												Fallout new vegas, developed by Bethesda and Obsidian, is a beautiful work of art, this game is what Fallout 3 should have been, its emotionally driven, every person you meet game is perfect. Most of the Side Quest/Stories are well writen.The DLC's and Main Story truely what classifies this game Art. When you leave Doc Mitchells you truely feel free, being able to truely do what ever you want.The atomsphere of this game sometimes reminds me of Mad Max sometimes, due to lonely of the wastes, other times you feel like youre middle of war soon to be over (Depending of your Choices In game.)You as the Courier, are shot in the head and left for dead, but by luck, you are saved by a friendly robot named Victor.He takes you to Doc Mitchells house to get patched up.After leaving his house, its your choice what you do after words.The DLC's (these go in the order they were realeased)1. Dead MoneyDead money is one of the best DLC's of all time in my eyes, after all its amazing writing and interesting characters will you and the others survive this hellish casino in the heist of a lifetime, or will you be a sole survivor, after all,It's Letting Go...2.Honest Hearts You are hired for the Happy trails caravans to get to Zion Canyon and deliver supplies to the tribes (the Dead Horses and the sorrows) until you are Ambushed by the white legs, you alone survive, after being saved by some Sorrows scouts, they take you to the burned man. the first General of caesar, hes hungry for revenge. Can you and the burned destroy the white legs before its to late?3.Old world bluesThere is a expression in the wasteland, ""Old World Blues"", it refers to those so obsessed with the past they cant see the present much less the furture, for what it is.They stare into the-what was, eyes like pilot lights, guttering and spent, as realties of their world continue on around them. (Keep that quote in mind when playing this DLC.)4.Lonesome Road All roads must come to a end in this DLC, a battle between you and the last courier.This is a brilliant conclusion to the DLC's, can you survive the divide before the last courier awakens the divide giants.If youre looking for a game that hits home, and makes question your choices, and looking for a beautiful story, I highly recommend this game 101%			"

												I give this game a B-.The crafting and new ammunition/weapon modifications are improvements over Fallout 3, but the storyline has decidedly less charm (you're not from a Vault).The one thing I really do like about this game are the efforts by the designers to present firearms and ammunition more realistically in their components and effects (i.e. handloading).What's disappointing is that many item textures are poor quality.  Also, items and enemies frequently fall through the world.  These faults were in Fallout 3 and should have been fixed.All in all, it's a good game.  You will have fun with it.  But save often because the bugs will grind on you. "

You are a Courier, and you have just been ordered to deliver a strange package. On your way to your destination, you are attacked, and left for dead. From there, your story begins. Do you wander free through the Mojave, slaughtering bloatflies like there is no tomorrow?Do you hook up with the New Californian Republic, or their rivals, Caesar's Legion? Or do you ignore that completely and simply try to track down those who attacked you and get revenge? This game is filled with choice- and the first choice you have to make is ""Do I want F:NV?"" Yes. Yes, you do.			"

												After pondering for over 5 years, I think I realize why this game is so great... It doesn't take itself seriously.The main character is a mailman. A MAILMAN. Not some generic legendary warrior.But, why would a mailman be delivering mail in a desert? I DON'T KNOW!!Some roman assassins who wear SPORTS EQUIPMENT happens to be the bad guys... WATSome recon sniper who speaks like Batman, HATES these SPORTS EQUIPMENT guys.And... And...! JOHNNY GUITAAAAAAAAAAARTL;DR The game can be pretty serious, but balances the humour so well too. And it never breaks the immersion either. Most videogames suck at this aspect.			"

												The PC version of Fallout: New Vegas is, naturally, th best version. Add the given charm of Fallout with an incredible fanbase yielding a healthy supply of mod support and you easily have probably the best western RPG to come out to date... until Fallout 4, of course.			"

												i take back what i said a year ago, its worth more than one playthrough, and its good. since i first played it a year ago, i liked it, but then started fallout 3 to find that i enjoyed that one more due to its brutality but i never finished that game. fastforward a year and ive got ~25 hours in skyrim and i need something that is a little less, overwhelming.i reinstalled the game to not only find out that new vegas has cloud support, but that i dumped ~80 hours into the base campaign (well, minus th very last main story quest...) and 2 of the add-on/dlc's (""honest hearts"" & ""old world blues"", both of which i loved); and acording to the wiki, i still got half a map to go through and a look at my pip boy says i got several loose ends to tie up. best part is i get to brave through it with some horrible jack of all trades character i couldnt get to work properly!the only real things i still dislike about the game is cazadores (huge amber wing-colored flies that move at the speed of light compared to your annoying snail's pace), simplistic difficulty setup (needing 300 bullets to kill one creature isnt hard, its just boring, time AND resource-consuming, not making a creative way to ramp up the difficulty of a single-player game just makes the game a drag for those who want a challenge), and the fact that you cant continue to play once you finish the game. thats all i can say that's bad about this game, so buy the ultimate edition now!

												I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE THIS GAME!!!I really can't be bothered making some witty insightful or professional statement about the game to open this review because I really can't hold my load for that long. This game is just - wow. This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing masterpiece. It's story, characters, world building, humour, replayabitlity, etc, is through the wanking roof. This is to me what porn is to normal people with lives, jobs, reasons to live, who haven't sunk hours upon hours into this game because they have nothing better to do other than contemplate their miserable, meaningless existence. THANK YOU OBISDIAN!!!This game is so nuanced, so well written, so well thought out in its endings, that it has kept me awake for ♥♥♥♥ing HOURS at night just THINKING about its characters, it's ideas, which ending really is best ♥♥♥♥♥♥ even those Legion♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ISIS in miniskirts, have a reasonable enough sounding leader who provides some genuine criticism of democracy. Still♥♥♥♥♥♥♥though). Which ending really IS best? The NCR (who pretty much represent America) is filled to the♥♥♥♥♥♥with good people with good intentions who could make the wasteland a better place and they can even get you the best short term ending in the game if you play your cards right, but it's crystal clear that they are WAY too corrupt and inefficient to properly maintain their territory in the long term. Mr House (who I imagine would represent the big business and corporate America) has some pretty lofty ideas, good intentions and excellent leadership skills (even wants to recreate civilisation to the point of space travel), but seems incredibly disconnected from the rest of the world, incredibly arrogant, a little bit fascist and authoritarian (though he doesn't wish to intrude upon people's lives or in their private affairs as this would be bad for business) and gets you to whack the Brotherhood of Steel. You COULD just say ""♥♥♥♥ it all"" and take over yourself, bringing freedom and independence to the Mojave, but with that sort of freedom comes chaos and the place just stays an anarchic wasteland, with no one to keep any sort of order throughout the area. You'll see what I mean better if you just PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME ALREADY!!!The DLCs are also pretty GG too, I'll probably write reviews on them too, pick them up. Also, I've heard a lot of people complain that it looks a bit too much like Fallout 3 and looks like Fallout 3 DLC. Those people are all dead now and I haven't actually played Fallout 3 yet as it won't run on Windows 10, but from what I've seen of it, it varies wildly in terms of tone, setting, narrative quality and some other stuff that I can't be bothered going through. What I'm saying is, PLAY THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME ALREADY!!!Also, if you want to do all the main variations of the ending, which you should, do NCR first, independent Vegas second, Legion third and Mr House fourth. I don't know why, it just works that way. The only few flaws I can find with the game are very, very small plot holes in one or two conversations with one or two NPCs that are so inconsequential that I won't bother going into them, the AI's a bit iffy, Benny's voice acting is a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥in parts, Obsidian could maybe have had a bit more time to polish the game a bit (they were only given 18 months after all) and it is a bit glitchy and crashy at times.And in summary - ♥♥♥♥ deathclaws. Also, play this game.			"

												Overall, a great game and my personal favorite video game. Pros:-Interesting characters and quests-a true fallout game-improves on nearly every aspect of fallout 3-amazing, atmospheric soundtrack-loads of replay value (700+ hrs)-great modding community adds even more replay value-great level design across the board-good optimization-simplisticCons:-low-res, unappealing graphics, even for 2010-poor aiming and combat-main story isn't as engaging or interesting as fallout 3-buggyConclusion:A very unique and well done game that improves upon much of Fallout 3's shortcomings. If you didn't like 3, you probably won't like this game, either. Absolutely worth every dollar. There are so many different ways to approach quests & you can be any character you want: bad, good, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, whatever. There are a wide variety of guns and clothes to choose from. If you like this game at all, it can definitely suck your life away. Better than Fallout 4.			"

												I bought this game and expected it to be an ordinary game with a mediocre story, Oh boy was I wrong! I bought this game for around 2.5 euro on the Steam sale and that was one of the best deals I've ever made. This game is fantastic and there's always something new to try out. You can even play ""Hardcore mode"" which makes it so that your character has to eat, drink and sleep.The story is amazing, and with 4 different major factions to choose from there's always something enjoyable in each playthrough.The beginning of the game is rather crap though, I got bored so fast and it was a pain to play through the first 3 hours on my first playthrough, but once you get used to the game and know what to do the beginning is OK.8/10 hands down.

												Set in a post-nuclear desert known as the Mojave Wasteland, you are a courier searching for the man who tried to kill you. Weapon sights, more varied perks, cooking and crafting systems, quirkier writing and a larger variety of gear and characters separate NV from Fallout 3. Unfortunately, the graphics are terrible (no environment shadows, muddy textures, undetailed meshes, and so on), AI is laughable, and combat is a mess of suicidal NPCs either strafing or standing completely still. Fortunately, combat isn't all - conversations and the choices you make are important. You'll be able to threaten, praise, blackmail and so on, influencing other people - alongside the impact that your skills, traits and perks also have. Sadly, most characters are boring or lifeless due to sloppy writing, terrible animations and sub-par voice acting. Plagued by design problems, bugs and a disappointing ending, NV is quantity over quality. It gets the job done, but it could have been a lot better.			"

												What is there to say about the absolutely best game that has ever been created, except that it is the best game ever made?Perhaps that the game is epic in every way possible, that the story is increadibly deep, that there is almost too many guns for you to possible obtain in one gameplay... Wait.. That last one is probably false. But even if you could collect every weapon in the entire game, you sure as hell would never EVER be able to carry all of them. Now where was I?   Yes, there!*clears throat*That you can install mods on most of your weapons, as long as you  have the ultra-cheap DLC ""Gun Runners Arsenal"", that you can blow/shoot/chop peoples arms/legs/heads of, that you can craft both ammunition and various tools and explosives, that every weapon and armor in the game has got a durability, which means that it will break after you've used it a lot, that the game is increadibly entertaining, humoristic, and silly over all, and of course, that YOU decide exactly what you want to do.If you haven't bought it already, you really should.I assure you, it's worth the money to 110%BUTThere is one downside.The game, at least if you are like me, is addictive as hell.Once I start playing it, it's almost impossible to stop.I guess this pretty much wraps it all up.Also, If you've read this far, you've got to buy the game, or else you and all your family will be brutally butchered while asleep.Good night!

												Thank you for reading this.First things first, I love this game, I only liked it when I had it on Xbox [Because I don't like the controller] but, if you're choosing wether to get it on PC, Or Xbox, or, PS3, get it on PC, it doesn't take a medium-end PC to run this game. I have a low-end Laptop here's how my FPS is:Low Graphics: 40+ FPSMedium Graphics: 30+ FPSHigh Graphics: N/AThe only downside to Fallout: New Vegas is that, the map, isn't as detailed to Fallout 3 or Fallout 4.Thats the only thing that really sucks about the game. But Combat and RP Wise, it's amazing.The Thing is, that's theres mods. Now, theres some essential/must-need mods to fix FPS or something else that you dislike, like the map, theres probaly  a more detailed map mod, but who knows? The modding community on Fallout: New Vegas is one of the best. Here's My Essential Mod List:1-) Sprint Mod: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34943/?2-) More Perks: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/35979/?3-) Project Nevada: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40040/?4-) Monster Mod [A.K.A Mo Monsters]: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/41361NOTE: I am not responsible for you corrupting your game, though most mods don't, but if they do somehow then again, I'm not responsible, you're in control for your actions.If you need help modding just simply friend me, then ask. I'll be sure to help. Just because I'm 13 doesn't mean I don't know how to mod. [Also, you NEED NVSE to run these mods: http://nvse.silverlock.org/ ]Now off of Mods, Fallout: New Vegas is an RPG Game, and if you don't like RPG's, then try to get this game free [Like a trial] off of some Torrent or something, then buy the game if you like it, the game really should be purchased. And yes, I know that Torrenting or whatever IS illegal, but if you just delete/uninstall the thing you got, then purchase it, it shouldn't be illegal, but to be sure, Google it.I give this game a 9.5/10 I would give it a 10/10 If including mods, but I'm not since most people aren't into modding [Don't know why] Anyways, thanks for reading, hopefully this review helped, and if it did, then good for you.

I have no doubt that if I were to reinstall it today (2014), I would have every bit as much fun as I had in 2010 when the game was released. I had fun with all of the DLC's available for the game, as well, although I am against DLC in most of it's forms.The only complaint that I would like to voice is that because it's post-apocalyptic, and set in a desert, it's fairly lacking of any kind of color.  The entire game is sandy-colored.  That gets a little tiresome, I suppose, but will in no way effect the immersion or entertainment value that you take from it.You will enjoy this game.  10/10 Bethesda's at it again.			"

												Everything that Fallout 3 should have been. This is what happens when you let the original team work on a sequel, instead of a bunch of self-admitted Jackass fans who thought Fallout was all about the violence, the big guns and the grimdark, not about the morality of the setting, and how people act and survive in such a world. To paraphrase the original creator of Fallout, TIm Cain: ""I want to explore the ethics of a post nuclear apocalyptic world. I'm not trying to make a bigger plasma gun.""			"

												I have too much to say about this game, so I'll keep it short. This is the best first-person Fallout. The story and characters are captivating. Silly, crude, and smart dialouge is around every corner. Intricate quests with many approaches. Lore, lore, lore up the wazoo! It gives you a lot of insight. FNV allows you to role-play as whoever you like. Survivalist, Tech-savvy conman, bare-fisted mongoloid. You can be whoever you want. The dialouge isn't like FO4, with only four options, in the way where you often have many different things to say. And with certain perks you can have special dialouge options. The gameplay is fun, playing like you'd expect a first-person rpg to. Pick things up, upgrade your weapons, buy and sell, use drugs to enhance yourself in battle, but don't get addicted! The combat is satisfying. For example, pulverising an enemy with a minigun, vaporizing them with a laser-rifle, or slicing them to giblets with a ripper. This is my favorite game, jam-packed with content. Get it! And the DLCs, they're some of the best DLC ever made! If only New Vegas still ran, I'd play it so much more. It crashes when I load a game. And remember, patrolling the mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.			"

												So it's the second 3-D entry of the Fallout series, after three. And it's by Obsidian, made up of most of the people who created the original fallout games. As a result, the story is much better than fallout three, even if it does not have Liam Neeson in it; it does, however, feature several more big-name actors along with the vastly improved script.There's a whole lot to do in the Mojave Wasteland, including the far west of California, a great part around Las Vegas (named New Vegas here, hence the title) and even a bit of Arizona across the Colorado River. There are beleaguered, desperate humans everywhere, Super Mutants, rogue robots and the two major factions of the New California Republic and Caesar's Legion. And that's just outside New Vegas' gates.Inside the walls of the shining city you will find dens of iniquity galore, as well as the strongest bastion of humanity who wishes to hold out against the horrors of the wasteland. But there's also a mysterious intelligence floating around, whose influence can be felt in every corner: Mr. House. And as the expression goes, the house always wins…So eventually does boil down to which faction you choose to support: the NCR, Caesar's Legion, or Mr. House. But if you can find a certain character in a certain hotel, can find a way to work in support for an independent New Vegas! If you don't like the NCR's militaristic ways, the Legion's slavery or Mr. House's desire to retain his iron grip on absolutely everything within New Vegas, there is a certain Yes Man rolling about who can help you choose the path that you set out for New Vegas.By now you might be wondering, why almost 500 hours played? Well, I'm glad you asked! Again, mods are the order of the day here; little or huge gameplay changes that extend the longevity of the game by leaps and bounds. I highly recommend looking into them.

												With the launch of Fallout 4 this game may well drop from sight, but that would be a shame because I think (as I've mentioned in the Fallout 4 review) it is still an amazing post-apocalyptic RPG. Yes the new fallout has many features and options that make it well worth the time and money, but Las Vegas still has that fallout dark humour down to a T. The map may not be as big, but with the DLC and extras you won't be lost for places to go, side quests to go or endings to see. So if you've enjoyed any of the other Fallout games (before or after), then I would suggest grabbing yourself a copy of this lovely, thumbs up!			"

												I just finished my first playthrough of Fallout New Vegas and I have say its one of the ,most fun games I've played in an while.My character was a speech,barter and intelligence one and it was pretty fun (not as much in combat).ProsThe story is really intrestingThe factions are amazing, they add tons of replayibilityYou have to go with one build for your character(there's enough)The charecters(including companion-Veronica and Rex FTW)The locationsThe best thing is that the endings notice what you did they mention every little thing(well most) and give it a own paragraph like your companions, its truly awesome!!!ConsStill a ton of bugs, wtf! Luckly non that wanted me kms.You can't play after finishing the main story line, you can still play by reloading a save, but then you're just back and I guess you can do the thinks you didn't and get a better ending.Score 9/10 I'd say its the definite fallout experience.

												The gameplay, while essentially the same, is improved. Ironsighted weapons make for extra degree of immersion or reality to firearms and weapon-modifications take some weapons from good to great  and more. Fallout 1 and 2 fans will notice several nods to the previous games and players of Fallout 3 will also see some nice nods in their direction. The story is more original this time and  quickly becomes more than it seems. Characters are dozens of times more fleshed out than those of Fallout 3 and every companion has their own character, history, and personal quest. Those who look for Dogmeat will be disappointed but for those of you who remember K-9, Rex will be a nice replacement.To put it simply: Fallout: New Vegas is what Fallout 3 should have been and is a game you cannot afford to deprive yourself of. If you mourn the loss of the original FO3, Van Buren then you will see major influences brought from it to New Vegas and it is easily worth the cost.Don't miss this game.			"

The only thing im middle of the road about in this game is that during my play throught it seem easier to just shoot then use V.A.T.S where as in fallout  3 i was all ways using the feature, i personaly like V.A.T.S but if you dont you might enjoy this one more then fallout 3			"

The way factions work are really cool.  Same open ended gameplay as Fallout III.  All in all a great addition to the Franchise.Also this game can become a survival game in Hardcore mode which is awesome in my book.  You'll have to micromanage eating, drinking water and sleeping.

This is what happens when you let the original team work on a sequel, instead of a bunch of self-admitted Jackass fans who thought Fallout was all about the violence, the big guns and the grimdark, not about the morality of the setting, and how people act and survive in such a world. To paraphrase the original creator of Fallout, TIm Cain: ""I want to explore the ethics of a post nuclear apocalyptic world. I'm not trying to make a bigger plasma gun.""			"

												The game has many pros but also a few cons. The reason I voted Yes is because I enjoyed the game and I think people who love games from the fallout franchise will DEFINETLY enjoy this game.The game might not be in the same level as Fallout 3 but you can easily explain that because two diffrent developers made the games, Fallout 3 was made by Bethesda itself and Fallout : NV was developed by Obsidian - PUBLISHED by Bethesda.The story itself is great, the stability of the items, the uniqueness and the overall feeling gives you that feeling that you're in an actual wasteland and you should make the right choises benificial to your survival.A few things that bugged me is that the game crashed A LOT. and I mean A LOT. There are some bugs here and there but you can't expect a game that is 100% bug free. Another thing that has bugged me is that if you finish the main story line - there's no continuation, which is kinda understandable because after you finish the main story line you basicly get a cinematic of what happened to everything based upon your final choise.Overall, I think the game is worth the money and you should defintely give it a try :)			"

												One of the best games ever created. This game + all the DLCs is more than worth the 5 bucks you will probably spend for it.Fallout: New Vegas with all the DLCs is at least 50-60 hours long. This game is great for replayability.I spent over 400~ (Not always had this one on Steam) hours playing this game, over 30~ hours modding it, and it never gets old. You can playthrough this game for at least 8~ times,making different decisions and it will never be the same exprience.You can mod it to the core, and there are alot of modifications to be made. If you love modding get this and Skyrim. Only downside to this game is performance, which is incredibly horrible. This game will lag and have stutters with a 2030 hardcore gaming machine as well. If you are going to play this, you HAVE to download mods that will make the game more stable on your machine,because  this game is incredibly buggy and has lots of crashes. (With mods, this can be sorted out)Again, if you like tweaking and modding a game, this game is an absolute must.If you expect an out-of-the-box exprience, go play Skyrim. "

												obsolete engine and wonky animations still don't deride too much from New Vegas. i personally enjoy this game over fallout 4 mainly due to the shining RPG elements and multiple ways to finish quests. fallout 4 was too dumbed-down in my opinion (still a great game though), but New Vegas sticks with Fallout's lore. People may not find the story as engaging, but I appreciate the blank-slate of the protagonist. It really allows you to be the person you want to be, and not be constrained to certain personalities (ahem, fallout 3 & 4). Mods really fix up the game. I made it more like STALKER and I'm having a blast right now.			"

												I finally hit 20 hours after about a month and 12 days (thats a guess) of owning F:NV. I love this game, but it has many many flaws. First off, the open world is pretty big. That isnt normally a bad thing, but when you walk slower than a crippled old lady going up a steep staircase. Seriously, and when you press shift it make you even slower! Besides that, this game is extremely difficult for first tim Fallout players. This was mty first Fallout game. I bought it because I wanted to play one of the older Fallout games before I bought Fallout 4. Also, the open world is pretty dull. It's just a desert with some occasional towns. And the Strip is extremely small and not what the first few hours of this game makes it seem like.  Also, loading screens feel more like a teacher giving a boring lesson becuase they take forever. But if you look past this games flaws, F:NV might be one of the best games on Steam.First off, I love the faction system. I joined the legion, and from that I was rewarded with occasional supply drops of ammo and other useful items. This game is definitely rewarding. Also, I love the plot in this game and how it isn't 80% cutscenes. In fact, the only cutscene I've seen so far is the intro, which is only 6 or 7 minutes long. There is ADS, but I personally don't use it much. VATS are pretty useful for close quarters combat. Lockpicking is awesome, and even better on PC. I know this game is old, but there should seriousy be a Steam Workshop for this game. I mean, people mod this game as much as people mod Skyrim, so I dont see why there Isn't a Workshop.Overall though, I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a good story, a good RPG and an amazing game. Whether it's on sale or not, you should buy F:NV, and maybe even the Ultimate Editon for double price and all the DLC.I'd love feedback on this review, so please tell me what you think! Enjoy Fallout New Vegas!Edit:I just finished F:NV. Wow. I loved it. Except for one thing that makes this different from other RPG's.  After completing the main story, it takes you back to the main menu, and asks you if you want to load a previous save. In other words, you cannot explore the Mojave or do side quests. Also, this game has a painfully low level cap of 30. While it does take some time to level up, this is an extremely small level cap. With DLC, though, the level cap is 50 (Each DLC adds 5 levels to the level cap). As I did the final mission, I began to notice some things. First, using guns continuously for a long time makes them feels weird. Basically what I'm trying to say is that the gunplay feels a little off. This somewhat forces you to rely on V.A.T.S. most of the time. But let me say what I have noticed about the game from finishing it that I did enjoy. I definitely noticed that ADS is important at one point, especially with long range kills. Before I wrap this up I want to point out that this game felt kind of short. I expecting a longer campaign, but atleast the replay value is extremely high. So, to wrap this up, (at least for now,) I want say that even though it felt short, and the gunplay feels awkward, and the level cap is very low, I can still say that Fallout: New Vegas is one of, if not the, best games I've ever played and you should definitely buy it, sale or not, Ultimate Edition or normal.(Yes I know that was the longest sentence ever) I plan on buying the DLC for F:NV soon, and I'll do another edit if on what the game is like with DLC. Buying and investing hours of my time into Fallout: New Vegas is one of the best choices I've ever made, and I plan to do it all again.Also I'd like to mention the fact that I have almost 30 hours of gameplay and I've only come across one Deathclaw. Just a little strange to me.March 21, 2016: EDIT 2: I want to point out something. F:NV is only ten dollars without DLC, (I bought it for $2.49 on sale) and I've managed to get 30 hours from it. Some have even got hundreds of hours of gameplay. Think about that. 30 hours, and thats just the main storyline. Yeah, some games are longer, but for this pricetag, that's a lot of gameplay.			"

												Ah, Fallout. Such an amazing franchise. And New Vegas is no exception, unsurprisingly.I must admit, most of my friends told me that NV was better than F3, but when I started it, I wasn't quite convinced. It sorta started out a bit slow (more so than F3 anyway), and who can beat Liam Neeson?! I'm not incredibly keen on Westerns, but with all the hype I figured I'd carry on with it. Man, am I ever glad I did.The Good - I don't really like Skyrim that much (yep, currently readying myself for the barrage of insults headed my way) because I find it too open-ended. I kinda find the amount of things you can do overwhelming, since it's more or less ""Ok here's the world, go explore it!"" Oddly, despite Fallout being much the same, I actually really enjoy it. There's enough of a main storyline to keep my ADD-riddled brain interested, and I love the kitschy feel of the game. Of course, the dialogue is also amazing, and the Perks are generally pretty cool/useful (I can't even count how many LOLs the Black Widow Perk has given me). The vast amount of weapons allow for pretty much all styles of battle to be effective. But besides battle, sometimes you just wanna blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, and that's entirely possible/encouraged here.The Bad - Not a lot of bad that I found. Sometimes it's glitchy, but since it's not especially new, most of the problems have been fixed (or at least, I haven't had much of a problem with my version). The few glitches I HAVE come across have been pretty irritating, but nothing to write home about. Some of the DLCs have been hard enough for me to rage-quit several times (but that's not really anything to do with the game, more like my own bad temper, haha).All in all, this game is amazing, and the good far outweigh the bad. I'd recommend it to anyone, regardless of their game preference. If you haven't played, it probably means you've been stuck under a rock (or in a Vault?). If this is the case, welcome to the real world! Now go play.			"

												Perhaps my favorite Fallout game ever, despite the bugs, I played it originally on the xbox, and with playing it on the xbox, completely unmodded, I still racked up well over 300 hours of playtime in it. This is the Fallout game I recommend more than any other. It makes you feel like you can immerse yourself in it more than Fallout 3 because of how the story is designed.

												This game is like a really stupid person. Occasionally it'll bug out and the npcs stand deadly still mainaining eye contact like I'm going to steal their wallets (which most of the time I do), which looks awkward when the characters are shouting passionately. But stupid people are fun to have around cause you can make them eat bugs and touch fences you suspect may be electrified. A fun time sink with lots to discover. 8/10 would bang.			"

												In ''Fallout: New Vegas'', you return to the post-apocalyptic West Coast of the ruined United States of America, like in the first ''Fallout'' game and its sequel ''Fallout 2''. For the first time you get to explore Nevada and the city of New Vegas. A city untouched by the nuclear warheads that devestated the rest of the world. You take the role of a courier from the Mojave Express in Primm. You were supposed to deliver a platinum chip to the Lucky 38 in New Vegas. A seemingly easy task. But as misfortune would have it, you get ambushed near Goodsprings by a man in a checkered suit and a handful of Great Khans (the descendants of the Khans and New Khans). The man in the checkered suit tells you that it was bound to happent to fall prey to his ambush, before shooting you in the head.You awaken in the clinic of Doc. Mitchell, the doctor of Goodsprings. Here starts your tutorial level and you get to create your character and define their traits. The character creation has been slightly expended upon, since ''Fallout 3'', since you have an age slide now, but other than that it's identical.Once you have done that, you are supposed to talk to Sunny Smiles to start the tutorial level. Here you get taught how to use firearms and V.A.T.S. ( Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System ) and have the optional objective of being tutored in the new skill ''survival''. This skill is particularly handy when you're using Hardcore Mode ( where you can die from hunger and thirst. ).Overall the game is really enjoyable and I have spent many hours on it. You have a lot of freedom, because of the enormous mod database at Nexus Mods and the decisions you make throughout the game have impact at the end game. But don't worry, the choices you make are easily recognised wether they're good or bad. Although if you start the end game, there's no turning back and you're just finished with the game after the slide-show and narrating about the impacts of your action. Luckily, the game automatically saves your game, just before the end game starts, and you can just return to the Mojave Desert after that.Overal I give the game a 9/10			"

												Fallout New Vegas is far superior to Skyrim, Fallout 3, or any other  modern rpg IMO,even though it is essentially an expansion pack for fallout 3, it still adds more content and improves on the original.The vanilla game is already great, with 200+ hours of content, just  when you think you have it all, you'll discover a an area that you didn't even know existed, a new unique weapon or quest, storyline, npc etc...With mods, you can improve on the default game to tailor to your needs, I reccomend NMCs texture pack, project Nevada and blackout ENB to give it a next-gen feel.I stole a Nuka-Cola and the whole town pulled out machine guns and killed me, 9.5/10			"

												Fallout New Vegas:     FNV is an open world, action rpg set in a post-apocalyptic Mojave desert, with civilization starting to re-emerge out of the ashes. The fairly large map (21 square miles) surrounds one of the few places doing relatively well in the wasteland: Vegas. The landscape in vegas can sometimes be a bore, with a lot of dry rolling hills around you, but the excellent 30's, 40's, and 50's music will make you forget all that, and just hum along.      Story wise, FNV is not amazing, but still good. In the opening cinematic, you, a simple courier for the mojave express company, gets shot straight in the head by a suave, but evil and cocky son-of-a-gun fellow named Benny. Once you are healed in the nearby town of goodsprings, your new goal is to hunt him down and bring him to justice. The story brings the player around the whole map, greeting the player with dozens of side quests. Once the player finally does kill Benny, the story really takes off, allowing the player to join one of the three factions viyng for power, or take over by yourself. The three faction are :The New California Republic, a gorup wanting to bring back the world before the apocalypse, Ceasers legion, a crazy dicator bent on ruling like a roman emperor, and Mr.House, a high tech robot wanting to bring back the 'glory of vegas'.    Gameplay is where this game truly shines. With the old-school RPG like character creation complete with a plethora of unique and fun perks, you can create a variety of different classes, each with their own playstyle, allowing for a lot of replayability. There are dozens of different weapons varying from a simple smg, or an orbital strike cannon, or a plasma rifle, a super-sword thing, and dozens more. With the expansive map filled with locations ranging from a ski lodge with super-mutants, to deep vaults giant fire ants, the postapocalyptic world is a truly crazy place.      FNV is not perfect, though there are hundreds of bugs and glitches, which is to be expected with a game of this size. Some of the quests are bland, and some of the locations are quite small and boring. There seems to also be only a few voice actors, evenif thats not the case. Most of these problems can be fized with mods, which brings me to my next point:the excellent modding community. There are hundreds and thousands of mods on the nexus and various other sites, ranging from high quality lore friendly quests, to crazy weapon packs, graphical overhauls, spiderman cars, companion mods, bug fixes, to more risque things.     With the points made above, I strongly reccomend this game to anybody who loves rpg's action games, well written experiences, and pretty much anyone who has likes video games. I do not reccomend this to a completionist though, much like Skyrim, the buggy quests, and the sheer size of the game makes it quite hard to 100% complete, and maybe not in a good way. To anybody else that likes anything, by this game now.Score(do I need this?) = 8.5/10With mods = 9.5/10			"

												Plain and simple, if open world exploration where your choices affect the outcome of the game is your thing, then Fallout: New Vegas will be a home run with you. My two biggest beefs with the game are that the graphics look pretty rough and the story is pretty bland. Poor textures and stiff looking characters are seen throughout. I never really got into the lore of the story either. Oh, and the AI for companions is just plain awful. Playing it on hardcore is not worth as your companions will often bolt off to who knows where and you are greeted with an alert that they have died (setting them to stay or passive is no help).The plus sides far out weight the negatives. Complete freedom in what you wish to do, a hearty helping of a variety of weapons and armor, crafting, skills, implants, etc. You really do get to play any way you want to. I would recommend getting all the DLC as each pack ups the level cap by 5 levels so you can go all the way to 50. Granted, once you are this high, you will have so many perks you will feel close to unstoppable but there are still a few legendary enemies out there that you will have to be a bit strategic with. While it is worth it to raise the level cap, do not expect too much from the DLC. Dead Money is pretty bad but the others are passable.Overall, 8.7/10.			"

												Fallout is one of the best games I've played, both Fallout 3 and New Vegas were amazing and have racked up hundreds of hours of my time without any mods at all. I'm the type of gamer that doesn't like using mods in most of his games so taking that much of my time without mods is quite impressive. I'd recommend any Fallout game a thousand times over as long as you're able to deal with the usual fallout buggyness. Get it if you don't already have it.			"

												*10.6h played on PC, +500h total including PS3*This game is in my opinion the best Fallout inthe franchise. The missions (both main and sidequests) are interesting and varied, the combat is exciting at higher difficulties, the exploration aspect is very enticing because of the multitude of places and buildings you can stumble upon during your playthrough. The game is very fun overall and has a lot of replayability value due to the multiple paths and factions you can take on. There are a variety of weapons and armor that let you follow multiple different playstyles, such as a sniper, a run-and-gun guy, an explosives expert, etc. However, there are bad points too. The game for one, has some weaknesses due to time constraints during development on Obsidian's side. So there is some cut content and some aspects of the game that feel hollow and leave a lot to desire, like the Legion, which is sadly very shallow. And another thing I dislike is that the game is not as difficult as it should be. Hardcore mode doesn't punish enough and it's not too difficult to eat, drink and sleep in the Mojave, you just have to keep an eye on the counter and that's that. Both these issues can be fixed with mods, so yeah, hooray for PC!To grossly sum it up: it's fun, it's crazy, it may make you play for weeks or months, mods are a thing for this and will make you stay for much longer and hardcore mode is not as hardcore as one may think at first.

No bad things about the game other than it can be repetitive after your first playthrough as it follows a main story quest with little side jobs. Some better than others like heal a wounded mole rat against a major battle at hover dam.			"

												Undoubtably one of my favorite games. You cant go wrong buying it. At any price it would have been worth my money. The Fallout games always have a strongly immersive enviornment that really grabs you and pulls you into the game. The soundtrack, NPC detail, and substance in the world all contribute to this. NPC's have personality; NPCs act acording to their peronality and the post apocolyptic envionment that surrounds them. The soundtrack (radio songs) give the game an ""Old Western"" type feel that goes great with the chaos and disorder of the world. They also make the world feel somewhat eerie and desolat; wandering the wasteland, everythings quiet, something could pop out and eat you alive at any moment and your listening to Jingle Jangle. It's a good contrast between sunch a ""fun"" song and a dark enviornment. The songs definently end up growing on you. Every corrner has a secret behind it. The world is full of mystery and curiosity. You can wander in some abondoned building only to discover it ihabited by the hostile robots who once used to work there or find some cave at the bottom of an ocean. The more unfamiliar the world is, the more lost you feel, the more exciting the game is. Mods add even more too the game, adding more immersion, longevity, and options. Some mods might be immersion breaking, I wouldnt recomend those. The game runs stable on most machines I would assume. The quests will never leave you unentertained as they are numorous and almost never ""go fetch this"" of ""find this dude."" The DLC adds hours and hours of playtime so I highly recomend you buy the Ultimate Edition. The DLC is unique, adds characters, story, weapons, items, quests. Each of them are like mini-main story lines, heir more than side quests. The Fallout series is just too great. I hope 4 will be as good as this one. War, war never changes			"

The only thing I didn't like was the fact that you couldn't play after the main story, but thank goodness there's finally mod for this game that breaks the ending.I do like the factions on how you can join a faction and see how everyone treats with joining that faction. I do recommend this for everyone who like Fallout 3 and I recommend the break ending mod for everyone wish to play after the main story of Fallout: New Vegas.Recommended![rating: 100/100]			"

												Fantastic game, lots of choice, great writing, fantastic world to explore. Really feels like a wasteland. If you have ever been interested in a Bethesda-style open world game before, this is one of the best ones out there. The only problem is its a 32 bit program so with modding the best you are going to get is 4gb of ram. Which is unfortunate because it seems to run out of that fairly quickly if you use any noteable number of mods. It also isn't as well-optimized as it should be (or perhaps i'm just doing something wrong.), as even with a few performance mods I'm still not able to keep a steady 60 fps everywhere with the highest settings.Nevertheless, a fantastic game and definitely worth a try. Do yourself a favor and pick up the ultimate edition. The DLC is great, and a good number of mods require the DLC.			"

Also, items and enemies frequently fall through the world.  These faults were in Fallout 3 and should have been fixed.All in all, it's a good game.  You will have fun with it.  But save often because the bugs will grind on you. "

												Fallout: New Vegas - Welcome to Vegas. New Vegas. It’s the kind of town where you dig your own grave prior to being shot in the head and left for dead…and that’s before things really get ugly. It’s a town of dreamers and desperados being torn apart by warring factions vying for complete control of this desert oasis. It’s a place where the right kind of person with the right kind of weaponry can really make a name for themselves, and make more than an enemy or two along the way. As you battle your way across the heat-blasted Mojave Wasteland, the colossal Hoover Dam, and the neon drenched Vegas Strip, you’ll be introduced to a colorful cast of characters, power-hungry factions, special weapons, mutated creatures and much more. Choose sides in the upcoming war or declare “winner takes all” and crown yourself the King of New Vegas in this follow-up to the 2008 videogame of the year, Fallout 3. Enjoy your stay.Key Features Feel the Heat in New Vegas! Not even nuclear fallout could slow the hustle of Sin City. Explore the vast expanses of the desert wastelands – from the small towns dotting the Mojave Wasteland to the bright lights of the New Vegas strip. See the Great Southwest as could only be imagined in Fallout. Feuding Factions, Colorful Characters and a Host of Hostiles! A war is brewing between rival factions with consequences that will change the lives of all the inhabitants of New Vegas. The choices you make will bring you into contact with countless characters, creatures, allies, and foes, and determine the final explosive outcome of this epic power struggle. New Systems! Enjoy new additions to Fallout: New Vegas such as a Companion Wheel that streamlines directing your companions, a Reputation System that tracks the consequences of your actions, and the aptly titled Hardcore Mode to separate the meek from the mighty. Special melee combat moves have been added to bring new meaning to the phrase “up close and personal”. Use V.A.T.S. to pause time in combat, target specific enemy body parts and queue up attacks, or get right to the action using the finely-tuned real-time combat mechanics. An Arsenal of Shiny New Guns! With double the amount of weapons found in Fallout 3, you’ll have more than enough new and exciting ways to deal with the threats of the wasteland and the locals. In addition, Vault-Tec engineers have devised a new weapons configuration system that lets you tinker with your toys and see the modifications you make in real time. Let it Ride! In a huge, open world with unlimited options you can see the sights, choose sides, or go it alone. Peacemaker or Hard Case, House Rules, or the Wild Card - it’s all in how you play the game.			"

												So I did a review of Fallout 3 a couple years ago, and I forgot to do one of Fallout New Vegas.  Suprizingly I actually liked FNV better than F3!  Fallout New Vegas carries on the awesome open world RPG gameplay that is found in many other Bethesda games. It is so addictive and entertaining!  FNV added a lot of things that were either lacking or not done as well in F3.  I happen to be a bit of a gun nut in real life, and this game hits home hard for those of use that are into firearms.  The amount of real-world accurate weapons in the game is mind boggling.  I think that FNV is one of the reasons I got into reloading my own ammunitions.  I loved that feature. The environment is FNV is also much more dazling and rich than the environment in F3.  You get the sense that you are really out in the wild west wasteland, where life is beginning to spring back, and people have dropped into their western dog-eat-dog lifestyle.  I played the game through between 2-3 times, and found that I most enjoyed playing as a desperado vagabond that went around doing good for the needy and mercilessly destroying any enemies.  The RP aspect is much deeper than F3, and perhaps moreso than Skyrim.If you have any doubts whether to buy this game, do it.  do it now...or when it goes on sale.  You won't regret it!  Please give us Fallout 4 Bethesda!!!! Put the Elder Scrolls on hold!			"

Anyways Benny shoots you in the head and buries you in the Goodsprings Cemetary, a securitron named Victor digs you out of the grave and takes you to the Goodsprings doctor , Doc Mitchell.So you wake up in the Doc's home and you set up your character and all that, After you leave the doctors home you can go to the ""Prospectors Saloon"" and meet a girl named ""Sunny Smiles"" she will give you a gun and let you do target training. In the Mojave Wasteland you can do quests for four opposite factions : NCR (a military army that tries to bring good across the Wasteland), The Legion (a group of slavers, evil people led by Caesar), Yes Man (a securitron?reprogrammed by Benny that would help him take over Vegas), Mr.House (the father of New Vegas who protected most of Vegas from the nukes of the Great War of 2077) The game is addictive so much greatness, you can do quests for people across the wasteland to earn caps, weapons and good or bad karma. I highly recommend the game if you are a fan of Fallout 3 or the past Fallout games, the game is not really that difficult it depends if you are new to Fallout or not. Sounds are great but the game full of npc's should have more voice actors, Graphics are awesome, The game offers a lot especially the DLC's Just be warned the ""Dead Money"" DLC will fill you with rageThe DLC's are:Lonesome Road Honest HeartsOld World BluesDead MoneyCourier's StashGun Runners ArsenalIf you want  a game thats $10 i highly recommend this games $10 is almost a steal			"

												Fallout: New Vegas is a good game, maybe even a better game than Fallout 3, and here's why. Pros: - The best thing about this game is the music. It's upbeat and hilarious. Even if you're not normally a fan of songs about homicidal cowboys, a lot of these classic 40's and 50's tunes will get stuck in your head all day nonetheless.- The Mojave is a vibrant, interesting background for the kinds of fun shenanigans that make Bethesda games a blast.- The characters in this game are great, and in many ways more interesting than the characters in Fallout 3. - The game engine now allows you to aim using iron sights, as well as a time-freezing mechanic called ""V.A.T.S."" Fallout 3 had only V.A.T.S., no iron sights. - Enemies are more varied and interesting than the same old rehashed enemy types from Fallout 3. Now you can kill ""giant flies"" and ""glorified LARPers in Roman armor made from football gear"", as well as the tried and true ""radioactive zombies"" and ""giant scorpions.""- There's a big modding community that's put a lot of work into creating free content to extend your wasteland experience even further. Sometimes the mods are even as good as the content in the vanilla game.Cons: - It's a Bethesda game. Luckily by now most of the bugs have been patched, or can be patched if you download a few mods from the Mod Nexus. But still, buggy, crashy, sometimes laggy. - The story's a bit meh. Even though the characters are, IMO, better than Fallout 3's, the story isn't quite as fulfilling or engaging. All around, New Vegas is a lovely game with a beautiful soundtrack and a lot of really fun elements to it. Another masterful example of the RPG genre from Bethesda.  "

												I have put countless hours into this and I think it is great you can find new things every play through. The charcter creation is easy to use and you can make a unique charcter. A very good thing is he unique weapons that are better than the normal ones.   I also love the weapons mods that can turn a rifle into a sniper rifle. A litttle tip the hunting rifle is amazing with a scope.			"

If you're going to play it bet you will have over 1000 hours on it by the time you get bored, even if you get bored there are thousands of fun mods you can download:D. This game is best on pc because if you get stuck you can use console commands to help you, unless you're one of those hardcore realisim nibs. There are plenty of mods for that too >:D. If you have ever played any bethesda game and liked it you will love this game it is 100 times better than fallout 3 but that games fun too:D. If you are thinking about buying this game don't think twice, it is not worth waiting for a sale because it's worth the money that it is, so get out there to the mojave wasteland today (y)			"

												I highly recommend this game, to anyone who likes action RPGs. One problem I have with it, is the games abundance of bugs and glitches. Compared to Fallout 3 there are a thousand times more bugs and glitches. Luckily, these problems can be easily fixed with unofficial patches and fixes provided by the modding community. Thanks, to the modding community the lifetime of this game has been increased greatly. One thing I liked most about Fallout: New vegas, is the similar features it shares with its predecessors Fallout 1 and 2, such as traits and getting perks every other level. Fallout 3 was the more stable game of the two, but Fallout: New Vegas gave old players of the franchise a nostalgic feel. Also, Fallout: New Vegas, gave players a wide variety of weapons to choose from, unique locations to visit, and brought back old characters, and factions. Whether you are a longtime Fallout fan or new to the series, you should strongly consider adding this game to your library.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas utilizes the same engine as its predecessor, Fallout 3 & The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, but it offers a new locale within the same imaginative universe of Fallout 3's post-apocalyptic wastelands. If you played and loved the sandbox world of Fallout 3, then Fallout: New Vegas is a must! However, it should be noted that the game's engine still suffers from the same flaws as its predecessor (mouse acceleration, occasional crashes, etc).			"

												Fallout New vegas was the first of the fallout series I have played, It really threw the player right into it which I thought was pretty good and there is this sense of not being ""taught by the game"" as the mainly goal is given straight at the beginning, kill the guy who tried to kill you! Sounds simple enouph until things get really complicated and everything you do will affect the outcome of the game. I really enjoyed playing it and the addons as well. The only one addon I didn't like was the science lab, old world blues, it didn't relate to the story at all and the bonus perks at the end were a bit too much and gave me a headache after trying to find out which was the main quest to get me out of that damn place. The other negative I have was constant crashing, lucky this is countered by auto saves and the physics as I looted a brotherhood guy early in game and his body fell through the ground and off the map, and I needed to  him again for mission.I loved the graphics, and other physics, and the exploration. really is a game for the hard hearted			"

												One of the best games I've ever played. You can get so many hours out of this game; I only have 25 at the moment but I only got this game recently on PC, I've mostly played it on 360. There are so many different ways to play, I've started at least four different files and each one felt entirely unique.  Add modding and you've got a game that can last you a long time. Also, this game can run on pretty low-end PCs, which is always a plus. If you don't like the graphics, there are a ton of ENBs as well. And don't even get me started on the DLCs; all four are absolutely amazing. Overall, the only negative thing I can say about this game is that it can be glitchy at times, but they can be funny and there are a ton of fix mods to remove them. $20 is a steal of a price for such an amazing game, and if that's still too pricey, New Vegas is extremely cheap during sales. 10/10ASSUME THE POSITION			"

I'm the type of gamer that doesn't like using mods in most of his games so taking that much of my time without mods is quite impressive. I'd recommend any Fallout game a thousand times over as long as you're able to deal with the usual fallout buggyness. Get it if you don't already have it.			"

												*10.6h played on PC, +500h total including PS3*This game is in my opinion the best Fallout inthe franchise. The missions (both main and sidequests) are interesting and varied, the combat is exciting at higher difficulties, the exploration aspect is very enticing because of the multitude of places and buildings you can stumble upon during your playthrough. The game is very fun overall and has a lot of replayability value due to the multiple paths and factions you can take on. There are a variety of weapons and armor that let you follow multiple different playstyles, such as a sniper, a run-and-gun guy, an explosives expert, etc. However, there are bad points too. The game for one, has some weaknesses due to time constraints during development on Obsidian's side. So there is some cut content and some aspects of the game that feel hollow and leave a lot to desire, like the Legion, which is sadly very shallow. And another thing I dislike is that the game is not as difficult as it should be. Hardcore mode doesn't punish enough and it's not too difficult to eat, drink and sleep in the Mojave, you just have to keep an eye on the counter and that's that. Both these issues can be fixed with mods, so yeah, hooray for PC!To grossly sum it up: it's fun, it's crazy, it may make you play for weeks or months, mods are a thing for this and will make you stay for much longer and hardcore mode is not as hardcore as one may think at first.

												A fun and frothy experience best coupled with a tall glass of your favorite champaign, and a bowl dead fish stuff.  ""Fallout: New Vegas"" Is no doubt, an exquisite entertaining digital experience that will leave you satisfied, and yet, will you thirsty for more like a lowlife drunken mongrel who would sell his own mother for just a small sip of alcohol. Of course you withold such pleasures from the desprate man so that he may squirm and shiver for your own entertainment, and with his last bit of strength you promise him he could have the whole bottle if he would just get up do a little jig. Then you sit there, drinking his booze and laughing at him proclaiming ""dance, little man dance!"" Hahaha. Yes. Quite so. There is no doubt that ""Fallout: New Vegas"" is a standout amongst it's peers. Though never quite acheiving the sublimity of it's predecessor ""Fallout 3"", It is still remains  devilishly good fun. By jove, nothing beats the look on the face of unsuspecting passerby as you unceremonously rob him of all he posesses, and then stab him right in the back. Of course there are a number of unsavory mutant types roaming the world. Even the thought of them makes me shiver with terror. But they can be useful in pinch, believe you me, when there is a job that needs doing, a mutant or a raider will get the job done better then anyone else. Or at least good enough. Oh and then there is the music. Simplicity itself. Frank Sinatra would be proud to hear the roaring sounds of Vegas, that once paradice on earth, blasting from the spearks of your personal computer as you blow away yet another unsuspecting innocent with a rocket launcher. Well that's all I have to leave you with for now, dear reader. Enjoy your new digital experience, and remember during those moments of village onslaught, or wandering into some dangerous unknown area with strange green men who own big guns, there is always the load function to start over. Pleasant voyage friend.			"

												Geez what can I say about this game. To be honest, when I get bored with the other games I usually play, I end up playing this game, Then I end up playing this game for a whole weekend..I feel like I get addicted to this game, Leave it for a while, play it for a little bit, then BAM, Im addicted again, This game is legendary, just like other Fallout/Elder Scrolls, Addicting.So yeah, I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open worlds with lots to do. I hope you enjoy it like I do.:)			"

												Set in a post-nuclear desert known as the Mojave Wasteland, you are a courier searching for the man who tried to kill you. Weapon sights, more varied perks, cooking and crafting systems, quirkier writing and a larger variety of gear and characters separate NV from Fallout 3. Unfortunately, the graphics are terrible (no environment shadows, muddy textures, undetailed meshes, and so on), AI is laughable, and combat is a mess of suicidal NPCs either strafing or standing completely still. Fortunately, combat isn't all - conversations and the choices you make are important. You'll be able to threaten, praise, blackmail and so on, influencing other people - alongside the impact that your skills, traits and perks also have. Sadly, most characters are boring or lifeless due to sloppy writing, terrible animations and sub-par voice acting. Plagued by design problems, bugs and a disappointing ending, NV is quantity over quality. It gets the job done, but it could have been a lot better.			"

												9.9/10One of the best games i've ever played, along with mods it's EVEN better (aside from all the crashes, lol). only reason im only giving it 9.9 is because there are ALOT of invicible walls in the wasteland and it kind of breaks the fun and limits you to where you can walk some times. ofcourse im going to say that you should definitly buy this game and once you've gotten in to it you'll spend alot of time with this game.

												If you haven't bought this, well, then you're a complete silly since this is one of the best games I've ever played. Fallout New Vegas combines the amazing sprawling open world gameplay of Fallout 3, but mixes in the atmosphere of the first 2 games, making the ultimate Fallout experence. Fans of the first games will feel right at home, and fans who played 3 only will love this to death. The storyline is an incredibly cool power struggle between 3 factions warring for control of Hoover Dam, and ultimately New Vegas itself. New Vegas is the last beacon of humanity, a city untouched by nuclear holocaust. You play a Courier, assigned to deliver a package to New Vegas, when you are shot in the head and left for dead. And so begins a tale of revenge and power. Gameplay is almost identical to Fallout 3, with a few new features. The DLC is great, and it's just fantastic. Buy this now.			"

												I highly recommend this game, to anyone who likes action RPGs. One problem I have with it, is the games abundance of bugs and glitches. Compared to Fallout 3 there are a thousand times more bugs and glitches. Luckily, these problems can be easily fixed with unofficial patches and fixes provided by the modding community. Thanks, to the modding community the lifetime of this game has been increased greatly. One thing I liked most about Fallout: New vegas, is the similar features it shares with its predecessors Fallout 1 and 2, such as traits and getting perks every other level. Fallout 3 was the more stable game of the two, but Fallout: New Vegas gave old players of the franchise a nostalgic feel. Also, Fallout: New Vegas, gave players a wide variety of weapons to choose from, unique locations to visit, and brought back old characters, and factions. Whether you are a longtime Fallout fan or new to the series, you should strongly consider adding this game to your library.			"

This game is best on pc because if you get stuck you can use console commands to help you, unless you're one of those hardcore realisim nibs. There are plenty of mods for that too >:D. If you have ever played any bethesda game and liked it you will love this game it is 100 times better than fallout 3 but that games fun too:D.

												Fallout New Vegas is a wonderful game, incorperating many elements within from quality of items to karma, appealing to people and keeping yourself alive. Weapons, armor, and many other items are found all throughout the game, and the dlc expand the base game way more. A bonus Hardcore mode makes the game even more realistic, allowing you to have to juggle hunger, hydration, and sleep, and more realistic item settings and ingame stats, which are detailed ingame. Post apocolyptic wasteland is so fun to explore, and the story is actually strewn through all the dlc as well, with many interconnected stories that can intertwine and unlock new options and dialogue. Speaking of dialogue, there are many, many options of dialogue, and skill set and specific attributes can influence dialogue, among other things that are affected. They thought of many different aspects of the game and beautifully blended the game operations together. I love this game so much, despite it being over 4 years old, because it plays so well, and is so well crafted, that i play this game over and over again, and my Steam playtime is not an accurate display of my love for this game. I have Probably 300+ hours into this game on my ps3, and it is still fuin everytime I play the game, no matter the platform. I highly recommend this game, and its predasessor, Fallout 3 with all the dlc as well. I would say play the old one first, as it has some different elements to it, and the feel is very different as well. I love this game so much, and believe everyone should play this game.			"

												A game of endless content. Great replay value with many different endings depending on the many -sometimes quite difficult, polically or ethically charged- dicisions made. I must've sunk over 400 hours into it (before I owned it on Steam) and on every playthrough I discover new area's and side-stories. When you finally think you've really seen it all... you get into modding. This is when you find out that all flaws that you used to ignore because the rest of the game is so awesome, have been fixed by the community along with plenty new game mechanics, tweaks and hours, no, days of extra, often fully voice-acted content. I would say this is my favorite game without a doubt, if not for the other masterpieces that have been created with the same engine: Elder Scrolls IV and Fallout 3.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas has definitely improved on some technicalities of its predecessors such as weapons, dialogues and the like. If you are a fan of the series, it is a good game anyway. Nevertheless, I did not enjoy the story as much as in Fallout 3. Your only goal seems to reach New Vegas and once you are there you wander around aimlessly at first. I also did not like the supposedly open choice of which group to join when the game makes it pretty clear who the good guys are, i.e. who you should be joining. Despite this, there are fun quests and places and I enjoyed the allies way more than in Fallout 3. I'd be a Yesman any day for that fun robot!			"

If you like skyrim, oblivion, or fallout 3, or really any good roleplaying, shoooter, open world, or sci-fi game, you will love fallout new vegas.  Also, there is a large avalibility of mods, so if you finish the game, DLC, and missions, you can still have more to do, or just wander the world and cause trouble!  I would highly reccomend this game.

												I give this game a B-.The crafting and new ammunition/weapon modifications are improvements over Fallout 3, but the storyline has decidedly less charm (you're not from a Vault).The one thing I really do like about this game are the efforts by the designers to present firearms and ammunition more realistically in their components and effects (i.e. handloading).What's disappointing is that many item textures are poor quality.  Also, items and enemies frequently fall through the world.  These faults were in Fallout 3 and should have been fixed.All in all, it's a good game.  You will have fun with it.  But save often because the bugs will grind on you. "

												Almost perfection, I could honestly talk about this game for hours. I'd recommend it to just about anyone whose into dark settings and high quality storytelling as well as characters that really make you think. With like 3 or 4 mods this game is a perfect 10 to me. It's a shame the game launched in such a broken state.             Okay, so I've played through the game 3 times and all of the dlc twice, I've actually only run into a small amount of bugs, things such as scorpions spawning in the grounds with their tails sticking out of the sand, a dog with eyes floating on the side of his head, getting stuck inside rocks a couple times which is easily fixed through tcl or reloading a save and one single quest breaking bug out of the 173 quests in the game including dlc and not including the miscellaneous quests. I also ran into 1 save corruption. That's it, maybe I'm just lucky idk but my experience was relatively bug free. Just save often and you'll avoid these problems by reloading. I also get crashes which seems to be kind of unavoidable with these games but it doesn't happen as often as it does in skyrim, fallout 3 or oblivion for me personally.        I could talk about the story and characters forever and how well done they all are. Veronica, Boone, Joshua Graham and Mr House to name a few were all awesome. Mr House specifically sticks out as a character I could talk about for a very long time. I continue to think about these characters long after I finish the game. Obsidian really went out of their way to give the characters depth on a level that is competetive with bioware games. Something that most of the time Bethesda doesn't even attempt to do.                I don't know what else to say without extending the review for too long. I obviously recommend this game, it's well worth your time and money but if you're new to the Fallout series I'd still recommend you play FO3 or FO1 first. FO3 is a great way to introduce yourself to the setting but if you play FO3 and miss out on New Vegas you really are robbing yourself of a complete experience. I feel like Fallout 3 is the first quarter and New Vegas is like the last 3 quarters that completes the experience and makes it a real sequel to fallout 1 and 2. Everyone should experience both games. To me this is a 9.5 without mods and on launch it would probably be lower because of how broken I hear it was. If you like fallout 1,2 or 3 play this game, it's worth it, just remember to eat, drink and take several breaks because this game will grab you by the balls and won't let go until it's over.			"

												This game... When it was released, I hated it. The map was smaller than 3's and it just didn't feel like how I wanted it to. But then as time went on and it seemed as if we were never going to get a Fallout 4, I came back to it, started modding it and really just enjoying the game for what it is. AND THEN, YEARS LATER.... FALLOUT 4 CAME OUT! While I did and still do enjoy FO4 from time to time, it really made me appreciate New Vegas. Fallout 4 has the huge map, the shooting mechanics and the great graphics, but where it failed is where New Vegas shines, in the gameplay, the RPG elements and actually good game mechanics. If you're looking for the REAL Fallout experience then play Fallout New Vegas, it's a great game with a HUGE modding community to keep you busy for hours and hours before or after you fininsh the main storyline depending on whether or not you're using CAGE (Continue After Game Ending). If you're having stuttering problems, get Fallout Stutter Remover. Want weapons? Check out the Millenia team on Nexus. If you're looking for a quest mod, check out the New Vegas Bounties series by Someguy2000. For those of you who are scared by the word ""MODDING"", as a grizzled modding veteran, here are a few tips I will give you.1. The first thing you should do for ALL BETHESDA GAMES is download the corresponding Script Extender for that game, for New Vegas it is NVSE.2. There are numerous tools you can (should) use to mod your game: Nexus Mod Manager/FallOut Mod Manager to install your mods for you and LOOT to manage your load order (which is the order by which your mods are loaded and if done incorrectly you will have compatability problems like missing textures or Crashes) but not to worry, LOOT will do that for you. 3.Then, there's FNVEdit, this tool is used for cleaning mods, and it requires a bit of modding know-how so for people new to modding, don't get this till you're a little more experienced.4. Don't feed the Yao Guai... That is all...Well.... I guess that's it then, To all you Fallout newcomers reading this: Enjoy the ride, it's going to be a long one, and to those, like me, who have devoted countless hours into playing and modding this game, I guess we've got a case of the Old World Blues.

												Superb game whose setting has more in common with Fallouts 1 and 2 than Fallout 3. Fallout 3 is good (I own the disc version) but Fallout New Vegas just edges infront of it. Therefore a much better game for what it brings to the table in the way of narrative, faction reputation and hardcore mode. "

												OH JEEZ. How are you not playing this game RIGHT NOW. No, really, stop what you're doing. Pull out your internet-dollars and get this thing. WHY? Some of the more... non-awesome among you may ask. HERE ARE SOME REASONS1) Solid Gameplay2) Story of an enjoyably decisive nature (ie: several choices for pretty much every quest and the main quest)3) DLCs that are well worth the many 5's of dollars4) Pretty Good Voice Acting5) Faux-1950's Aesthetics with a hint of skeletons all over the place6) Non-Overwhelming sense of humor7) Nuka-Cola: America's favorite beverage even 200 years after a nuclear war8) Interesting/Horrifying vaults (Massive shelters built before the bombs dropped. Built to hold civilians, but the vast majority involved social experiments of a semi-ethical nature IE: A vault with no entertainment material and twice as many guns)TL;DR Fallout: New Vegas is excellent and you, the discerning customer, should purchase it.

												The gameplay, while essentially the same, is improved. Ironsighted weapons make for extra degree of immersion or reality to firearms and weapon-modifications take some weapons from good to great  and more. Fallout 1 and 2 fans will notice several nods to the previous games and players of Fallout 3 will also see some nice nods in their direction. The story is more original this time and  quickly becomes more than it seems. Characters are dozens of times more fleshed out than those of Fallout 3 and every companion has their own character, history, and personal quest. Those who look for Dogmeat will be disappointed but for those of you who remember K-9, Rex will be a nice replacement.To put it simply: Fallout: New Vegas is what Fallout 3 should have been and is a game you cannot afford to deprive yourself of. If you mourn the loss of the original FO3, Van Buren then you will see major influences brought from it to New Vegas and it is easily worth the cost.Don't miss this game.			"

The way factions work are really cool.  Same open ended gameplay as Fallout III.  All in all a great addition to the Franchise.Also this game can become a survival game in Hardcore mode which is awesome in my book.  You'll have to micromanage eating, drinking water and sleeping.

												Old World Blues Specifically: This is the way to do DLC right. They listened to what the fans wanted: more humor, more bigger-than-life personalities vying for attention (Think Tanks! The SINK!), unique weapons that are more than just a higher damage number and a boring same-y model (K9000 cyberdog gun!), a new player home base that's upgradable and alive with activity/things to do, and a new story with an actual twist that makes you think.If every DLC was like this I wouldn't worry about paying $10 for them. One character, one mission and 2 new weapons like most devs give you just isn't cutting it compared to this.Great game and great DLC.			"

												If you like games with deep, immersive story lines, this is the game for you.Fallout: New Vegas is very well written, as it adjoins dark, somber plot points with welcome humor and lightheartedness.  The game is made even more interesting by the degree to which the player can affect the story and the outcome.  There is very little in the way of a linear plot.The game's combat system does tend to get slightly repetitive but very little of the game is actually spent in combat.  It is mostly a matter of making decisions and exploring the semblance of society that exists in the Mojave Wasteland.Although I've heard the game get a bad reputation due to bugs and the like, I found that it ran very, very smoothly on even a standard PC and the few bugs did not interfere much if at all with the gameplay.If you can get this game for cheap during a sale, it is mandatory to purchase it.If you want this game but there is no sale, it is still well worth it because you will probably not playing much else for the next few weeks, at the very least.P.S.: The mods are pretty gorgeous too :)			"

												When it comes to the Fallout games, the biggest questions you need to ask yourself usually consist of ""Is it still canon?"", ""Is it really that moddable?"", and probably ""Is it enjoyable?"". Rather fortunately for New Vegas, the answers tend to be yes.The franchise itself is not without some tarnish (looking at the PS2 and Xbox game I'm not fond of mentioning!) but New Vegas is more than capable of delivering the brand from the dark, gritty, heavy metal future it was careening into and taking the series back to its roots: gratuitous sex, violence, political intrigue, and 1950's Americana.New Vegas isn't exactly a flawless jewel of the desert, though. It does have a rushed feel to the ending, like the majority of Obsidian's games (read: KotOR 2 and Alpha Protocol) and the game has an entire phylum of bugs indicitive of a Bethesda game. The game also lacks any sort of sandboxing continuity following the ending, a major flaw for a game this expansive. Play it, regardless.			"

												I just finished my first playthrough of Fallout New Vegas and I have say its one of the ,most fun games I've played in an while.My character was a speech,barter and intelligence one and it was pretty fun (not as much in combat).ProsThe story is really intrestingThe factions are amazing, they add tons of replayibilityYou have to go with one build for your character(there's enough)The charecters(including companion-Veronica and Rex FTW)The locationsThe best thing is that the endings notice what you did they mention every little thing(well most) and give it a own paragraph like your companions, its truly awesome!!!ConsStill a ton of bugs, wtf! Luckly non that wanted me kms.You can't play after finishing the main story line, you can still play by reloading a save, but then you're just back and I guess you can do the thinks you didn't and get a better ending.Score 9/10 I'd say its the definite fallout experience.

Loads of approaches to combat be it lasers, plasma, things that go boom, flamethrowers, blunt instruments, cutting edges or just a good old fashioned bullet. Dozens and dozens of guns and weapons.But the main attraction is the freedom you have. Don't like the main quest or don't want to do it? Just don't. The MQ limits nothing in the game. You can walk in any direction you like. Assuming that it's not a cliff wall or if you can even survive in that area. :POne of my favourite game franchises of all time.Now there are bugs.

												You're wandering out in the Mojave Wasteland, just wanting to get to a destination for a quest when suddenly you're faced with 3 Deathclaws, giant vicious beasts, coming towards you...this is going to happen at some point, or maybe not? This is the world of Fallout: New Vegas.If you loved Fallout 3, you'll enjoy this game. It features the same engine and overall gameplay, adding in some new elements as well. For example, the companions you get in this game won't die, but they will get knocked out, so you can take them through the entire game, and each one gets a little quest of their own. The game certainly has a Western feel, as one would expect, especially from the radio station playing songs that conjure up images of cowboys and the like. The main story has you being shot and left for dead, but you survive and on a mission to find out what happened...and to  avenge your death as you see fit. You'll come up against familiar and new creatures in the wasteland, meet some new friends and spend endless hours going place to place wondering what's around the next corner.The main hub is, not surprisingly, New Vegas. Here, you can enter casinos and even gamble, plus a few quests including the main one. There's lots to do here in this game.One nitpick I had with Fallout 3, and it's just a personal one, but one I've heard echoed by others, is that the D.C. area was hard to navigate, and the metro was confusing as well. That is one reason I prefer this game over 3, just barely, but I never got lost in this game. If that was an issue for you, this presents a nice alternative.There's more to find out and discover, but in a game like this, it's best if you experience yourself. If you liked open-world games, and maybe more to the point, if you enjoyed Fallout or The Elder Scrolls series, give this one a go. It has its glitches, but nothing I've encountered that's too bad or very often. I highly recommend this game!			"

												Fallout has always been a phenomenon in the post-apocolyptic genre. It is highly regarded for its amazing atmosphere and provoking exploration. In the Fallout universe you are set out into the wasteland to survive, and make difficult choices during odd situations. The humor, and interesting characters you stumble upon during your trek in the Wasteland makes Fallout an enjoyable franchise. Fallout: New Vegas takes place in Nevada, specifically the Mojave Desert. You, the Courier, are tasked out to unite the Wasteland, evil or good. Along the way through your journey in the Wasteland, you will encouter terrifying creatures, and unexplored locations by prospectors.The combat in Fallout: New Vegas is very similar to Fallout 3, if you have ever played it. However, Fallout: New Vegas makes some notable changes in its combat system, and difficulty system. In Fallout: New Vegas, you are able to aim down sights, and are able to modify weapons to a larger degree. A new difficulty system was also shipped with the game, hardcore. Enemies are notably more difficult, and hydration is necessary for surivival. With any Bethesda Softworks game, or in this Obsidian Entertainment. Fallout: New Vegas is completley moddable, for more better experience. Want to download high resolution textures? You can. Want to download more content, such as quests or characters? You're free to do so. Fallout: New Vegas has an unlimited amount of content developed by the community. Fallout: New Vegas is a title that everyone should play at least once.Summary: Positives: +Mods+Humorous  +Atmopsherical+Open World+100+ hours of content+Enjoyable characters+Freedom of choiceNegative:-Crashes (can be fixed with mods)-Buggy (can be fixed with mods)-Companion system is bland.

												If you loved fallout 3, you'll find a new world to explore and waste hours adventuring. The quests are tighter and much more enjoyable. You'll get to do a little vault diving again. The plot is almost nonexistant and the game leaves you to roam where ever, find plenty of new and interesting weapons, and see the sights. On the other hand, the game is as glitchy as ever. I once saw a scorpion clipped through the ground trying to attack me. There are invisible walls everywhere, so that little hill you want to get over is impossible, I don't understand this design choice for an open world environment. You rely much less on vats due to less volatile movements and improved aiming. The special system seemed to be much more important as each attribute has its pros and cons and played in more during conversations. the skills have much more diverse uses, expect finding practical uses for repair and medicine. The worst part however is this amounts to a reskin of fallout 3. While new weapons and enemies keep it fresh, combat is the same and many places seem familiar. If you enjoyed fallout 3, be prepared to be drawn into a new world along with a few hiccups here and there.			"

												Me, being a huge fan of both the post-apocolyptic genre, and Fallout 3, freaked out when I heard of Fallout: New Vegas. I worked up the dough to buy it, and bought it I did. Ultimate Edition is the only way to go.So, I booted it up, started it, and sat there, biting my fingernails. I did the same thing you did in Fallout 3, made and named your character, (Mine being as ugly as can be and being named♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥McGee, also unintentional rhyming!) put points into S.P.E.C.I.A.L., etc etc. When I finally made it out of the shack you start in, I walked straight ahead and never looked back on the little starting town called Goodsprings. That's the amazing thing about the Fallout series: It's completely open! You can ignore the storyline and just go around popping Deathclaws in the face with your 50 cal sniper rifle, or you can bargan with merchants to get better and better gear. You can almost literally do whatever you want from the very start of the game. I haven't quite played another game that felt like this.Final verdict: It is a game WELL worth your 20 bucks. It's a gaming experence you can never truly forget.			"

												If you have any love of FPS+RPG hybrids, Fallout: New Vegas is one of the best examples of the genre.  Building on what Bethesda established with Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas gives you a lengthy, nuanced plot, tons of side-quests, and a robust character system under it all.  An average play through will take 20 hours at a minimum, and that's assuming you skip side quests and DLC. With all that content you can easily spend 60+ hours per playthrough, and you will enjoy every minute.  Throw in mod content and you can easily spend years playing this game.Compared to its predecessor (Fallout 3) New Vegas has a lot of improvements, particularly in terms of balance, stability, and engine capability.  The new repair system is a lot less frustrating, the Cpmpanion Wheel control system is a great improvement, and the expanded crafting system is a dramatic step up from the frankly hacky iteration in FO3.  It's not without its downsides though; fans of FO3 will notice that the Mojave Wasteland has a lot less areas to explore compared to the Capital Wasteland, and will likely also lament the loss of the random encounters system.  Despite that, it's still a step forward overall, even if you might miss the denseness of the Capital Wasteland from time to time.All that said, this is still a game you can easily sink hundreds of hours into.  The plot is good, the game mechanics well designed and balanced, the DLC worthy in its own right, and overall has enjoyable, rewarding gameplay.  In other words, it's a  great entry in the Fallout series.			"

												Rarely do I write reviews for games on here, but this game is too fantastic not to promote. It took me almost 100 hours to do one playthrough with the DLC, and I regret nothing. The sheer size of this game (I believe it's 10BG for the base game) might be a turn off for some, to which I say shame on you. This is a game I keep on my laptop at all times because I can just boot it up and play whenever and still have a great time. The game, of course, is set in a post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland (who would've thought?) better known as the Mojave desert. These games are notorious for the large amount of decisions, and this one is no exception. It might be a bit buggy, but that's a small price to pay for a fantastic game. I would suggest, however, getting the Ultimate Edition on sale. Five dollars for hundreds of hours of fun is a great bargain, and one you should no doubt take advantage of. If you like the Elder Scroll games, but find yourself wishing from time to time that you had a gun or could level up with an experience point system instead of a skill level system, this is a fantastic match. It's also great for science-fiction fans, as laser weapons and robots are abundant in this game. The DLC are all fantastic and are all connected very neatly and in ways it took me until halfway through the third one to realize (I hadn't realized I should be looking for connections yet). Of course, my half-coherent ramblings won't tell you nearly as much as the game can show you. I've played about 50 hours in the past two weeks, and I can think of few ways I'd have rather spent that time.			"

												This is a must have game - and FO NV Ultimate Edition goes on sale for 75% off 2-3 times a year, so no excuse not to get it. Fallout New Vegas (and Fallout 3) are two of my favorite games. Both can be buggy, so I reccomend googling known glitches and researching ways around them (forget Steam assistance).  I have played through New Vegas, Fallout 3, and Skyrim many times (usually alternating between the games and have never grown tired/bored with each new re-play through). I will be most sad when I will be unable to play on pc due to conflicts caused by newer hardware/software (Current issues with Fallout 3). My favorite all time line (my moto in life when things go bad)... ""The game was rigged from the start"" (sometimes fitting with a buggy Bethesda game). Great game if you are into mods as well - huge modding community out there. Probably some of them have fixed some of the bugs in the game, but I haven't checked into it yet. Enough mods to keep the game fresh for people who get bored easily with multiple play throughs (unlike myself). lol			"

												Fallout: New Vegas' Plot and story is very well made and offers something for any kind of gamer. There is no way that you'll ever get bored because there is so much to do. At first, the story may seem slow as you struggle to get decent supplies, but as you progress through the game everything makes more sense and you'll quickly find your bearings. The only bad things about this game that I've realized is that sometimes the game crashes unexpectantly and the terrain can be rather depressing albeit it's supposed to be a wild west theme. Overall, I would give this game an 8/10 for a good story, and great gameplay.			"

												This is probably the closest thing I have to a favorite game. I spend a lot of time drifting from favorites to favorites; some days it's Deus Ex, somedays it's Planescape: Torment. This is a game that I always come back to no matter what because it has everything I really want in a game.- Active modding community.- Well-written story that's faithful to its predecessors.- Opportunity for completionists and roleplayers alike.- Ability to kill very nearly everyone you meet (even story characters!).- Interesting characters (don't get me wrong, I like Fallout 3 but the characters all have the personality of sandpaper).- Infinitely replayable.- Ambient music, as well as some old-timey Vegas music. And Marty Robbins, if that's what you're into.- Actually fun (fun is this crazy new concept in the game world that is, contrary to popular belief, NOT synonymous to overpriced downloadable content).So as not to sound like a blind fanboy, I'll also fault the game on a few issues.- While this game allows you to develop your character as you choose, I will admit that everything leading up to Freeside/New Vegas feels relatively railroady (as in you're not forced to go forward, that's just where all the action is and there's no good reason not to go forward). Not that this is a major issue, as Fallout 1 and 2 were the same way.- Crazy amount of bugs. Like, game-breakingly bad bugs. Some bugs can render the game unplayable, and you may need to reload a save. If you're like me and you tend to play RPG's late at night, you might find yourself getting nightmares from the following bugs:* Dogs with floating eyes!* String cheese people!* Game freezing while really eerie music plays and you're in an underground bunker surrounded by feral ghouls, and all you can hear is a repeated sound clip of their ghastly taunts!* FalloutNV.exe has stopped working.Thankfully, many of these can be fixed with patches, then broken again with the next twenty mods you inevitably add right after.- Sub-par graphics, but they're passable enough to ignore and there's plenty of community-made ENBs, patches, and graphical tweaks.- The engine isn't great, but it's VERY popular with modders. Some people can accomplish amazing things with it, just look at some of the quest mods.Overall, this is the only game I've ever played that I would give a 10/10. Any issues I find that I have a problem with can be patched and improved. This game is extremely addictive, and I have given it at least 500 hours of gameplay when my time playing it on PS3 is taken into consideration. "

												You're wandering out in the Mojave Wasteland, just wanting to get to a destination for a quest when suddenly you're faced with 3 Deathclaws, giant vicious beasts, coming towards you...this is going to happen at some point, or maybe not? This is the world of Fallout: New Vegas.If you loved Fallout 3, you'll enjoy this game. It features the same engine and overall gameplay, adding in some new elements as well. For example, the companions you get in this game won't die, but they will get knocked out, so you can take them through the entire game, and each one gets a little quest of their own. The game certainly has a Western feel, as one would expect, especially from the radio station playing songs that conjure up images of cowboys and the like. The main story has you being shot and left for dead, but you survive and on a mission to find out what happened...and to  avenge your death as you see fit. You'll come up against familiar and new creatures in the wasteland, meet some new friends and spend endless hours going place to place wondering what's around the next corner.The main hub is, not surprisingly, New Vegas. Here, you can enter casinos and even gamble, plus a few quests including the main one. There's lots to do here in this game.One nitpick I had with Fallout 3, and it's just a personal one, but one I've heard echoed by others, is that the D.C. area was hard to navigate, and the metro was confusing as well. That is one reason I prefer this game over 3, just barely, but I never got lost in this game. If that was an issue for you, this presents a nice alternative.There's more to find out and discover, but in a game like this, it's best if you experience yourself. If you liked open-world games, and maybe more to the point, if you enjoyed Fallout or The Elder Scrolls series, give this one a go. It has its glitches, but nothing I've encountered that's too bad or very often. I highly recommend this game!			"

												An excellent game. This review is going to be presented very loosely, sorry. I had owned this game before but decided to get it on steam.There's all sorts of tales this game is waiting to tell. Accepting to do a quest which may seem intriguing at the time may not later as it'll sacrifice others which may seem more worth your time; for example, a companion insists that we take down two big companies as they had done something cruel, however doing this will remove the chance to converse with a myriad of interesting characters, which when killing them, may feel like beating up petty dogs- because you hadn't found out their ambitions and characteristics. The game is tailored to the whims of the player and makes you try to justify your actions in order to avoid feeling regretful. Any game can do this on paper, but to make it this enrapturing, requires a team that's dedicated to setting a benchmark instead of satisfying greedy shareholders. This paragraph also highlights the replayability of the game.The quests are intertwined into a bigger system often making you meet new npcs- they give you a better grasp of the motives of the factions and will give you the neccessary information to make your mind up about the ultimate ending. Go through computers and tapes as these tend to be fleshed out with stories. Another example: There's a staff complaint about the unexpected shipment of stealthboys, as some mischievous staff have been using them to satisfy their curious minds, or perverted in this case.I find the unsettling atmosphere to be very engrossing: the sun soaked visuals, rough tarnished surfaces along with the ambient sounds and fallout's occoasional press of a sombre piano key blend in to make New Vegas a belivable wasteland.More songs on the radio(s) would be nice( mods could sort this out though) but then again you'll spend quite a  bit of time in combat, so listening carefully to your surroundings will help and reward you. You may find this game frustrating on harder difficulties when you're suddenly outnumbered and your skills don't seem to be paying off. You're suddenly relying on vats more often to get the dirty work done, and when you're out of it, you're spamming your favorite pistol- which till now had been working wonders just isn't so you're dead. There's always a way avoid these situations.  This is a role playing game in which all the mechanics and options to manevoure a tricky situation in your favour have been realised. If you think not, there's an abundence of mods out there that are dedicated to polishing this gem.Luckily for me, I played this long after the launch date so I've very rarely encountered bugs and I am playing without mods, which i should have a look at.The game truly has spurs that jingle jangle jingle: there's always something which keeps me coming.

												Compared to Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas is a bit lengthened sometimes, but still a very cool game.---The gameplay is very conformable to Fallout 3 and it's now possible to use ironsights too, but i never played with it to be honest. V.A.T.S (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) + quick aiming via crosshair is the perfect combo in my opinion.Visually it's still looking good after installing better textures and other things from http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/.The story is OK but not good as in Fallout 3. You have to choose a side later in the game. The replay value got increased by that.There are many more things to do as in Fallout 3 quest-wise. It's slightly to much sometimes.Vegas as scenario is very refreshing. :) 8.5/10			"

												If you loved fallout 3, you'll find a new world to explore and waste hours adventuring. The quests are tighter and much more enjoyable. You'll get to do a little vault diving again. The plot is almost nonexistant and the game leaves you to roam where ever, find plenty of new and interesting weapons, and see the sights. On the other hand, the game is as glitchy as ever. I once saw a scorpion clipped through the ground trying to attack me. There are invisible walls everywhere, so that little hill you want to get over is impossible, I don't understand this design choice for an open world environment. You rely much less on vats due to less volatile movements and improved aiming. The special system seemed to be much more important as each attribute has its pros and cons and played in more during conversations. the skills have much more diverse uses, expect finding practical uses for repair and medicine. The worst part however is this amounts to a reskin of fallout 3. While new weapons and enemies keep it fresh, combat is the same and many places seem familiar. If you enjoyed fallout 3, be prepared to be drawn into a new world along with a few hiccups here and there.			"

												Me, being a huge fan of both the post-apocolyptic genre, and Fallout 3, freaked out when I heard of Fallout: New Vegas. I worked up the dough to buy it, and bought it I did. Ultimate Edition is the only way to go.So, I booted it up, started it, and sat there, biting my fingernails. I did the same thing you did in Fallout 3, made and named your character, (Mine being as ugly as can be and being named♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥McGee, also unintentional rhyming!) put points into S.P.E.C.I.A.L., etc etc. When I finally made it out of the shack you start in, I walked straight ahead and never looked back on the little starting town called Goodsprings. That's the amazing thing about the Fallout series: It's completely open! You can ignore the storyline and just go around popping Deathclaws in the face with your 50 cal sniper rifle, or you can bargan with merchants to get better and better gear. You can almost literally do whatever you want from the very start of the game. I haven't quite played another game that felt like this.Final verdict: It is a game WELL worth your 20 bucks. It's a gaming experence you can never truly forget.			"

												Fallout has always been a phenomenon in the post-apocolyptic genre. It is highly regarded for its amazing atmosphere and provoking exploration. In the Fallout universe you are set out into the wasteland to survive, and make difficult choices during odd situations. The humor, and interesting characters you stumble upon during your trek in the Wasteland makes Fallout an enjoyable franchise. Fallout: New Vegas takes place in Nevada, specifically the Mojave Desert. You, the Courier, are tasked out to unite the Wasteland, evil or good. Along the way through your journey in the Wasteland, you will encouter terrifying creatures, and unexplored locations by prospectors.The combat in Fallout: New Vegas is very similar to Fallout 3, if you have ever played it. However, Fallout: New Vegas makes some notable changes in its combat system, and difficulty system. In Fallout: New Vegas, you are able to aim down sights, and are able to modify weapons to a larger degree. A new difficulty system was also shipped with the game, hardcore. Enemies are notably more difficult, and hydration is necessary for surivival. With any Bethesda Softworks game, or in this Obsidian Entertainment. Fallout: New Vegas is completley moddable, for more better experience. Want to download high resolution textures? You can. Want to download more content, such as quests or characters? You're free to do so. Fallout: New Vegas has an unlimited amount of content developed by the community. Fallout: New Vegas is a title that everyone should play at least once.Summary: Positives: +Mods+Humorous  +Atmopsherical+Open World+100+ hours of content+Enjoyable characters+Freedom of choiceNegative:-Crashes (can be fixed with mods)-Buggy (can be fixed with mods)-Companion system is bland.

												My Fallout: New Vegas Review.Yet, another game in the Fallout franchise. Fallout: New Vegas takes place in the Mojave Desert/Wasteland. The Mojave Wasteland isn't as interesting as the D.C. Wasteland in Fallout 3, but it still gives you a good Fallout experience. Now, I've played New Vegas for about 500 hours on the PC, but i have got New Vegas also for the PS3, which i have played New Vegas on for 700-800 hours.Pro's:1. Excellent Gameplay, but the Gunplay is pretty boring without mods. 2. A very extensive modding community. Which add's replayability.3. It's mostly made by the creators of Fallout 1 & 2 (Both great games)4. Has a lot of side quests. Unlike Fallout 3.5. Has ironsights on weapons. Unlike Fallout 3.Con's1. You will crash a lot due to the old engine, but you can fix the problem's in 10 minutes or so.2. Annoying stutters, but also can be fixed quickly.3. A f*ck ton of bugs and yet again can be fixed with modssssssssssssssssssssssssssss...In conclusion it's a lot better than Fallout 3 or 4, so currently it's probably the best Fallout game ever made. EDIT: Forgot to mention, mods are very easy to install.			"

												I waited on rating NV until after I played Fallout 4. I really hoped it wouldn't come to this, but I felt mildly disappointed with 4. After spending around 70ish hours on 4, I went back and played NV. Now I have to say that NV is one of the best fallout games out there. 4 wasn't terrible, it was actually pretty good. It just lacked the genuine ""Fallout"" feel. No karma system, no weapon condition and only 4 vague dialogue options.. If you're wondering why I mention Fallout 4 so much, is because I just want to make a comparison. NV contains those genuine elements which make the game interesting and full of various choices, whereas FO4 removes most of them, making the game much more dull and not as fun to play. To those who want to play a classic fallout game with those [amazing] elements, NV should probably be close to the top of your list.			"

												One of the greatest RPGs of all time. Incredibly expansive, rich, and rewarding, with no cheap content to be seen. Arguably the best addition to the Fallout franchise, taking place in a truly believable post-apocalyptic world with equally believable factions and characters, almost all of which are presented in one shade of gray or another. Ambiguous morality is perfected here and coupled with an unparalleled emphasis on player freedom; presented through a nearly endless supply of highly complex quests that constantly change the Mojave Wasteland. New Vegas is the standard all RPGs should strive to achieve. It is destined to be remembered as a classic and a masterpiece for it is truly without equal.Welcome to Vegas. New Vegas.

												Howdy, pardner! Let's get riiight on with it. Yeehaw!THE POSITIVES:+A well-realized world: The way the environmental storytelling adds to the immersion, stories, and overall feel of the game world never bores me. Hell, I'd bet it'd not bore anyone. There are so many factions each with their own interesting take on the world and philosophy. There are so many quests for all kinds of gamers. There is much to learn about the world and use it in a meaninful way to achieve things.+a unique and interesting plot: You are a Courier who was shot in the head during a high-priority delivery. You made it out alive, quite amazingly. Now you are all set to find the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who shot you between the eyes. Essentially, you're a kick♥♥♥♥♥mailman with a vendetta. Will you ""deliver"" your vengeance to the person it's addressed to?The plot might seem simple but the plot points and events that connect the plot together are amazing in that they offer a variety of outcomes and variety in actions achieving said outcomes. Plus, from a purely writing stand-point, the plot has many surprises and engaging events. Best of all, you made them happen. In essence, the plot goes from being simple to amazingly complex - all because of your actions.+amazing characters that feel real: Each guy you encounter feels different. They don't feel like sacks of exposition and cliches. Their needs, their wants, their actions, their inactions, their beliefs,  all are things that compel us to take action that affects them in some way. What way they're affected, depends on your own opinion and subsequent actions on such people, which can make for some tense, funny, creative, serious, and sometimes just WTF situations and outcomes.All in all, the writing coupled with the gameplay creates an amazing world with rich characters that make us feel part of this interesting world and feel proud and awesome while feeling so. +Gameplay: The perks, the skills, the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system are familiar (but nonetheless awesome) territories, and the game, as a set of rules trying to create a challenge, is good.But the star of the show is the amazing variety in player-influenced situations and outcomes that encompass most of New Vegas. During each mission, you're given an objective. The way you complete that objective is upto you, and the best part is, you don't even know what ALL the things there are that can be done in a certain scenario. You have to stick your nose in others' businesses, pry and fiddle with things and people until you surprise even yourself by the amazing things you didn't know you could do to resolve/achieve/prevent/worsen such scenarios.Also, there's the gunplay - which is okay for a game like this. This game is trying to be an rpg (and kicking♥♥♥♥♥at it) and not an action-y shoot 'em up. For all intents and purposes, the gunplay is good enough. It can even improve if time is put into it. It works in this game well enough. For example, there are some cool emergent scenarios but they're all mostly encounters with different enemies. But they still feel different because you're not the same guy each time you face them. You're more experienced with guns and can almost always land a proper shot by the time you're 25% into the game. It's only a one-way uphill ride from there.Plus a lot of perks are useful, but also, a lot of them are straight up cool. I won't spoil as surprise is key in New Vegas.Too sum up the positives; This game is one of the best combinations of gameplay and writing I have seen in quite some time. It's like being spawned in a random, but real and challenging world full of opportunites worth investing time and money into.NEGATIVES:Maybe I'm too early into the game to fully detail the shortcomings of this amazing game, but as of writing this I've spent 9 HOURS( plus 40 or so hours outside Steam long time ago) and I've seen my share of them:-Glitches. They are not game-breaking. Hell no. But sometimes you'll see a random merchant from another town sitting on plain air in the middle of the road saying ""Howdy"" like he has no idea where he is. Sometimes, it can cause certain events to not happen, or to not happen in time, or to not happen because you didn't so something which it isn't your fault. When I quit the game, I was already experiencing another minor glitch where all NPCs and player just sort of jump in and out of the ground like the ground itself was going up and down.These glitches took up 0.000000001% of my total playtime though. so I guess no biggie. But some people out there might have their immersion broken. -This is, for the most part, not an aesthetically pleasing game. I say this as I have seen visual-minded people all over the interwebs and just my immediate surroundings.  And I'm speaking not just from a photorealistic point of view but also from an artistic one. The choice of color palette, the colors you'll see in the entire game, are, for the most part, dull. I know it's the end of the world, but some color is always appreciated in a bleak world. But you can change that with MODS. Which I'm sure will only improve your experience.And as I sit here thinking of another flaw, I am out of ideas. I cannot honestly list a real flaw that really affected my playthrough.I'll probably update my review if I come across more flaws. No movie is without sins. Why not games?But I've enjoyed all the hours I've put into the game so far, with occasional hiccups here and there.Obsidian has created a gem. Perhaps an overlooked one. Bethesda could really learn some lessons here (particularly in the writing department)Thus far. my rating for Fallout: New Vegas is 9.5/10.Happy Trails, pardner!			"

												Fallout : New Vegas epitomizes what a 3D, action-oriented Fallout game should be. From the gameplay systems to the visuals and story. Fallout : New Vegas nails it perfectly on the head the feeling of playing the Original games made by Interplay in a First Person RPG setting. Bethesda could learn a thing or two from Obsidian's execution on New Vegas moving forward and it really makes you wish that Bethesda lets Obsidian develop another Fallout game.Graphics : 7/10The Graphics in the game while they aren't exactly the pinnacle of last gen's graphics but they take advantage of the setting of the game to really draw your attention away from some shaky textures or color theme. Character models still definitely felt rather outdated even for the time but that can partially be attributed to the Gamebryo engine that Bethesda provided to develop the game in. However for the shortcomings of the character models are more than made up in the diversity and quality of clothing and armor models which you will be seeing more often than your character's face.Setting : 10/10Fallout : New Vegas really optimizes what a Fallout game should look like given the time gap that we see between Fallout 2 and New Vegas in the Western territories. Due to a lack of government it allows Obsidian to present us a great Post-Apocalyptic portrayal of an ""Old West"" style game. The zones in game feel varied, especially if you have the DLCs installed. New Vegas could have been more impressive if console limitations didn't hold it back from being completely open but that's negligible. As for the DLC's the setting really just sets the tone perfectly for what they are about. Honest Hearts feels varied enough from the Mojave to make it feel fresh, same can be said for Old World Blues. Blood Money is a refreshing chance of scenery taking place in an almost untouched Casino and Lonesome Road takes us back to the Mojave feel we have grown used to.Gameplay : 10/10This is where I feel like New Vegas shines over every other Fallout game period. It keeps the skill system we all have grown to expect from a Fallout game that was disappointingly absent from Fallout 4. But let's stay on track. Some skills were condensed in order to bring in other systems that really add more depth to not only roleplaying but giving different avenues to play the game. Survival is a welcome addition to the game as it gives the player character more avenues to explore and really lends itself to Hardcore mode. The change to giving a player a perk every 2 levels and the addition of challenge perks lets the player choose more ""interesting"" perks that change gameplay opposed to just increasing damage by x%. Going back to Hardcore mode, it hones in on the games core... it's a Post-Apocalyptic Survival RPG and it is very well implemented it definitely changes the way you approach the game. The gunplay definitely feels improved over Fallout 3, and is actually tolerable if you invest points into the respective skill and the addition of true iron sights really makes the gunplay feel better aiming downsights as well as firing from the hip. Lastly the skill system really comes in true more in this game than in Fallout 3, every skill you have can allow you to bypass combat... find new avenues to complete quests and you have the option to play the game VERY diplomatically. If you want to avoid combat you can, and that adds volumes of replayability to the game.Story : 9/10The Story in New Vegas takes a step back and emphasizes exactly the lesson Fallout tries to express in every game. War never changes. In New Vegas you take on the Role of a Package Courier in the employ of the Mojave Express delivering a Platinum Chip to a one Mr. House the proprietor of the Lucky 38 and the big man behind the New Vegas strip. Now the story here begins with you getting shot in the head by a man named Benny and it leads you on a quest to find the man who killed you and grows in scope from there.Now the story here I feel is much better developed than in Fallout 3, from the Main Quest, to the side quests, to the companion quests. The main story takes you all the way across the Mojave Wasteland introducing you to the game's major factions (Which play a huge role in the second half of the story) gradually. This definitely helps establish an overall narrative which culminates later during the second battle for Hoover Dam and who you decide to assist significantly influences your route through the game, as a Fallout game has always been about the Journey and not the destination. The factions are well fleshed out and each faction (even the not story relevant ones) feel like they belong in the world and have some purpose in the world as almost every action you perform has a direct repercussion on how the factions perceive you. Examples being if you are a friend of the NCR (New California Republic) and the Legion detests you, because the NCR likes you they will give you a communicator that will dispatch a troop of NCR Rangers to assist when you use the time.... on the flip side there is direct consequence to some of the factions hating you; like in the example above. If the Legion were to hate you they would send out hit squads to kill you, which creates a nice dynamic for random events occurring... such as NCR and Legion teams fighting eachother.DLC - 9/10New Vegas is shining example of how to do DLC right. None of them feel like tacked on content (We're talking about major DLCs not small packs like Gunrunner's Arsenal) much like Operation : Anchorage or even Broken Steel felt like in Fallout 3. Not to mention Fallout : New Vegas granted us with one of the best DLC story arcs in gaming history as they are all tied in one way or another to each other and the story as a whole.Old World Blues is in my opinion the second best DLC available, but is not to be discounted. It is a nice lighthearted step away from the gritty seriousness that is the main story line, playing off 50s Science Fiction featuring some absolutely hilarious characters like Dr. 0 and Dr. Mobius. It also serves to introduce us to 2 characters that would appear later other DLC's if you go out of the way to try and find them. Honest Hearts takes us away from the Mojave and puts us straight into Zion National Park which is a welcomed change of scenery as it feels more like a vacation in the first place. This DLC introduces us to a character only previously mentioned in the main game, Joshua Graham and tells us his story after the events of the first battle of Hoover Dam, and gives us some more development on a character that would appear later.Blood Money is a change of pace; how welcome that change of pace is really depends on if you enjoy stealth missions and a shake-up of the game's mechanics. Regardless this DLC introduces us to Father Elijah who you can hear about and catch references to in not only the main game from Veronica and the Brotherhood of Steel but in Old World Blues. This DLC takes you on a stealth style mission to rob the previously unopened Sierra Madre casino and uncover it's old world secrets. It's solid but if you like it really depends if you enjoy stealth gameplay.Lastly we have the final DLC chapter; Lonesome Road which not only has a great story and ends the DLC storyline beautifully but we uncover ED-E's backstory and really changes at some level how you see the lovable little robot, and introduces us to a character that has been hinted at in the main game and the previous DLC. Ulysses, this is a very philosophical approach to telling the story of the game and creates an almost introspective narrative that really lends itself well to the hard waste of The Divide and is by far my favorite DLC of the bunch.Final Verdict : 9.5/10While Fallout : New Vegas is by no means a perfect game, it is however what I would consider a true game to Fallout's roots and provides hours of enjoyment.

												I personally enjoy the gameplay of New Vegas much more than Fallout 3 or 4. What it doesnt have in graphics, it makes up for in gameplay. I live in New Mexico, so New Vegas takes it super close to home. With all the DLC content, the game is almost neverending, the balancing of enemies to weapons is perfect. Not my favorite story in the Fallout series, but its a top 3 for sure.			"

												Fallout: New Vegas utilizes the same engine as its predecessor, Fallout 3 & The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, but it offers a new locale within the same imaginative universe of Fallout 3's post-apocalyptic wastelands. If you played and loved the sandbox world of Fallout 3, then Fallout: New Vegas is a must! However, it should be noted that the game's engine still suffers from the same flaws as its predecessor (mouse acceleration, occasional crashes, etc).			"

												A fun and frothy experience best coupled with a tall glass of your favorite champaign, and a bowl dead fish stuff.  ""Fallout: New Vegas"" Is no doubt, an exquisite entertaining digital experience that will leave you satisfied, and yet, will you thirsty for more like a lowlife drunken mongrel who would sell his own mother for just a small sip of alcohol. Of course you withold such pleasures from the desprate man so that he may squirm and shiver for your own entertainment, and with his last bit of strength you promise him he could have the whole bottle if he would just get up do a little jig. Then you sit there, drinking his booze and laughing at him proclaiming ""dance, little man dance!"" Hahaha. Yes. Quite so. There is no doubt that ""Fallout: New Vegas"" is a standout amongst it's peers. Though never quite acheiving the sublimity of it's predecessor ""Fallout 3"", It is still remains  devilishly good fun. By jove, nothing beats the look on the face of unsuspecting passerby as you unceremonously rob him of all he posesses, and then stab him right in the back. Of course there are a number of unsavory mutant types roaming the world. Even the thought of them makes me shiver with terror. But they can be useful in pinch, believe you me, when there is a job that needs doing, a mutant or a raider will get the job done better then anyone else. Or at least good enough. Oh and then there is the music. Simplicity itself. Frank Sinatra would be proud to hear the roaring sounds of Vegas, that once paradice on earth, blasting from the spearks of your personal computer as you blow away yet another unsuspecting innocent with a rocket launcher. Well that's all I have to leave you with for now, dear reader. Enjoy your new digital experience, and remember during those moments of village onslaught, or wandering into some dangerous unknown area with strange green men who own big guns, there is always the load function to start over. Pleasant voyage friend.			"

Ain't That A Kick In The HeadWhere do i begin i adore Fallout New Vegas i used to play it on the Xbox 360 and each day i would come back from school and play it until i have to go to sleep, then i got this game on my PC now in reality i have put more time into Fallout New Vegas than any other game but enougth of that lets talk about the game shall we. Fallout New Vegas is set around the old ruins of Las Vegas, the Mojave Desert to be exact, kind of a western cowboy feel now, you can also say that the Wild West meets Fallout for the first time, the are many new factions now such as the NCR, Legion, Powder Gangers and even some old ones return such as the Brotherhood Of Steeal or The Enclave, Remnents to be clear.Some of you may ask is this any better than Fallout 3, and my answer is HELL YES! There are many new and better features in New Vegas than in Fallout 3, such as the reputation system, and many more, also you can chose who to side with at the end of the game, there is alot of choices that will appear in your ending. There is also many amazing and fun quests that it would be hard to do them all in a single play through. The DLC adds many more hours of fun although it is quite varied in flavour and in value, but all of them are worth playing at least once.But then there are also mods. Falllout New Vegas has over 15K mods now that is alot but the thing about it is it goes from Weapons to Armour to hell even a 8 hour long quest mod. You will spend hours upon hours modding your game with new armors, weapons and playing new quests.If you want an amazing quest mod that will give you tons of giggles and laughs, then check out The Christmas Special Quest Mod.http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/54511/?---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Check out Gopher's New Vegas Mod Clinic if you want tutorials on how to install certain mods.

Is Fallout New Vegas worth buying? = Absolutely it is the best FPS & RPG shooter game to date. Oh and one more thing if you say that the game is not worth getting because the graphics suck then dont worry there are ENBs, retextures and a ton of new content which make your game look like it was made in 2015 have fun.

												Undoubtably one of my favorite games. You cant go wrong buying it. At any price it would have been worth my money. The Fallout games always have a strongly immersive enviornment that really grabs you and pulls you into the game. The soundtrack, NPC detail, and substance in the world all contribute to this. NPC's have personality; NPCs act acording to their peronality and the post apocolyptic envionment that surrounds them. The soundtrack (radio songs) give the game an ""Old Western"" type feel that goes great with the chaos and disorder of the world. They also make the world feel somewhat eerie and desolat; wandering the wasteland, everythings quiet, something could pop out and eat you alive at any moment and your listening to Jingle Jangle. It's a good contrast between sunch a ""fun"" song and a dark enviornment. The songs definently end up growing on you. Every corrner has a secret behind it. The world is full of mystery and curiosity. You can wander in some abondoned building only to discover it ihabited by the hostile robots who once used to work there or find some cave at the bottom of an ocean. The more unfamiliar the world is, the more lost you feel, the more exciting the game is. Mods add even more too the game, adding more immersion, longevity, and options. Some mods might be immersion breaking, I wouldnt recomend those. The game runs stable on most machines I would assume. The quests will never leave you unentertained as they are numorous and almost never ""go fetch this"" of ""find this dude."" The DLC adds hours and hours of playtime so I highly recomend you buy the Ultimate Edition. The DLC is unique, adds characters, story, weapons, items, quests. Each of them are like mini-main story lines, heir more than side quests. The Fallout series is just too great. I hope 4 will be as good as this one. War, war never changes			"

												Fallout: New Vegas' Plot and story is very well made and offers something for any kind of gamer. There is no way that you'll ever get bored because there is so much to do. At first, the story may seem slow as you struggle to get decent supplies, but as you progress through the game everything makes more sense and you'll quickly find your bearings. The only bad things about this game that I've realized is that sometimes the game crashes unexpectantly and the terrain can be rather depressing albeit it's supposed to be a wild west theme. Overall, I would give this game an 8/10 for a good story, and great gameplay.			"

												Fallout New Vegas is a game I love a lot. It's a fantastic blend of story telling, fps and rpg elements all mixed in with the classic Fallout post nuclear waste land and bizarre humour.I would highly recommend that anyone who has not played this gem should. You will have a lot of fun and unlike the previous games the story line with the abhorrent slavers Caesar's Legion vs the quasi capitalist, democratic NCR gives you two very different 'protagonists' to fight for with radically different societies and philosophies.All of the DLC you will get has great value (well the gun runners weapons and ammos are a bit iffy) but the 4 main expansions add serious additional content to the game with huge new areas and plots from the Tribals in Xion Valley to the crazy disembodied scientist brains at the Big Empties Think Tank.

												I actually have much more hours but on another version (non Steam version)... just re-bought it and replaying it...oh man. EPIC GAME! Fallout New Vegas is second favorite game of all time. Fallout 3 is my top best.The New Vegas storyline hearkens back to Fallout 1 and 2 which isn’t surprising given that Oblivion is holding the reins again and here is where I fess up to having never played the first two. I had to do a bit of Wiki-ing (which always leads to me reading waaaay too much about Eleanor of Aquitaine – call it Wikigressing) to understand what was going on and I still don’t really get the part about Hoover Dam. Anyway. I’ll have to leave the majority of comparisons between the first two Fallouts and this one to those who’ve played all the games but I will say I was impressed with how seamlessly Oblivion’s New Vegas integrated the Fallout 3 experience – especially The V.A.T.S. system, morally polarizing quests, and somewhat unreliable yet still tantalizing map markers.I know the graphics are very 2001 and the endless running though the wasteland should bore the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of some but it doesn’t and here’s why: The base level of difficulty in New Vegas is hard. Like dying every 15 minutes hard. This is a twenty hour campaign which could easily turn into a nine hundred hour campaign based on the hordes of irradiated critters ALONE. I wish I could explain why this is good rather than annoying and maybe it’s a mixture of nostalgia, the Mister Vegas radio program, and Snuffy the Mole Rat but instead of falling asleep in my sarsparilla I find it soothing.I also find shooting a chem fiend in the face with a sawed off shotgun soothing so take that with a grain of salt.  This is a classic my friends. Don't miss out.			"

												I really love the Fallout series and I have heard from a lot of people that New Vegas was their favorite entry into the collection, and I can definitely see why. Fallout New Vegas takes everything that was great from Fallout 3 and improves upon it. There's a different kind of karma meter, instead now you have fame for each group or town and depending on what you do for or to those people, they will like you more or less, and you'll get better rewards or hunted by mercenaries depending on which extreme you go to. Gameplay is pretty great, they introduced ammo types, so in addition to using different guns you can now use different ammunition depending on the enemy you're fighting. If you're looking at getting this, I would recommend the ultimate edition or whatever they called it, it has all of the DLC, and the DLC in New Vegas is amazing. Same as with Fallout 3, modding is a huge part of this game now and it's easy to understand why. You can add chracters, change the way people look, the way your weapons look, and apply unofficial patches to help with game stability. The modding community for this game isn't as large as say Skyrim, but it's still pretty impressive with all the different ways you can modify the game. Some have said this is the best Fallout game in the franchise, so if you're looking at getting this, go for it!			"

												Thoroughly from start to finish. One of the most fully realized and most weel thought out settings in fiction. Any question you have about the culture, daily lives, or townsfolk of New vegas and the outlying areas will more than likely be answered.Pros:-Great writing-usually Great Voicework-Solid engine-Deep character building, unlike some open world rpgs i could mentions (Cough Cough Skyrim)-Game world feels like just the right size. big enough to feel daunting and massive, but no so much so that hiking from one side of the map to the other ever seems outright impossible.-Sweet mother of mods, Batman! Project Nevada is a must, NMC's texture pack to fix those blurry textures, and whatever ENB fits your preferences and the game instantly gets a hell of a lot better that just ""Great."" Thats not to mention mods for bounty hunting, new quests, a survival system, new lands to discover, and a lot more. Cons-Scenery is a bit repetitive. I know its the apocalypse and I know that its in central Nevada, but holy crap do the endless orange deserts and brown praeries ever get boring. There are a few spots that change it up a bit, but they are far and few between and usually out of the way of your usual walking. -The City of New Vegas is underwhelming. After all the buildup throughout the game that makes out Vegas to be some sort of seedy haven from the harshness of the wasteland, when you finally get there, vegas is remarkably dirty and destroyed looking. This is probably the only part of the plot/setting that I can take any fault with, and I'm aware it's as petty as can be. Im my mind, Vegas should be in perfect condition at all times. Its undoubtedly the largest population center in Nevada, and probably one of the largest in Fallout's America, and should undoubtedly be the most decadent and beautiful. For some reason though, Vegas is in nearly the same state of disrepair as any other town in the wasteland. Given that House has literally an entire army of free labor at his disposal, you would think Vegas and The Strip wouldn't look like a total wreck, and yet it does. Not helping this is that Vegas feels incredibly small, with only around 10 or so buildings that you'll really be visiting frequently. A minor gripe, but one of the most curious setting quirks in the game.-Matthew Perry is a wet napkin in this game. Seriously, he sounds like he's completely stoned, has a cold, and is literally phoning in his lines. This is pretty unfortunate given that he's one of the main antagonists of the game. Overall, should you play Fallout: New Vegas? Yes, and heres hoping that Fallout 4 takes more after this game than Fallout 3.			"

												Fallout 3, while not the most played game in my library, enveloped a deeply rooted love of RPG essence that engulfed my love of Role-Playing/ Open-World games once again. This spinoff Fallout game developed by Obsidian, sparked an ephemeral love of Fallout 3 back to life because of the immersion that it encompasses. Self-proclaimed Intrepids can really get lost in this game.Fallout: New Vegas delivers on the open world experience because of the riveting desert, mountainous terrains. From the rural, isolated and rustic towns to the grand strip of Vegas. From the intimidating tribes to the amicable town-goers comes an immersive setting that grips convivial and intimidating variables to the game that really engages the player to think about their decisions. The apocalyptic setting leaves the player to roam aorund to unearth secrets, locations, expansive quests and hidden incentives to really pleasure the player for the price that they get this game at. The story arc of New Vegas does have a lot less of memorable moments from its predecessor: Fallout 3. Nevertheless, the main tale provides a solid plot from which to hang a  number of tasks and stand-alone parables. Many of these quests are quite lengthy, and great dialogue and good voice acting will engage you to learn more about the characters, as well as keep you elated about what will happen next. The choices you make might lead to a dramatically different experience from another player's experience. The same is true of many supplementary quests. There's a ton of flexibility in how you might approach certain tasks. which can lead to a state of quandary or a state of serenity.The many different personalities can circumvent your own morality, whether it be trust a shifty character or betray a benevolent character. An illusive computer program-man, who presides in the New Vegas strip, focuses is entirely on himself and his robots to alter your experience in the strip either negatively or positively. The leader of a Roman-inspired legion is also an illustrious presence and a violent opposite to the upright and learned leader of the Brotherhood of Steel's local contingent. The player can even find an interesting kindred spirit to accompany you. As with Fallout 3, you can bring a companion along with you; this is handy not only in combat, but it also gives you an extra inventory for dumping detritus. Interacting with your companion is simple, thanks to a wheel that lets you choose behaviors for your fellow traveler. You can only have one at a time, but you'll encounter multiple individuals willing to join you, and they all make interesting and funny quips when you interact with them. They also reveal different quest opportunities, giving you a chance to learn more about what makes them, well them.Fallout: New Vegas is an expansive and sometimes abstruse RPG that encourages you to see and do as much as you can. This is an explorer's game, always lavishing new and interesting quests on you and giving you a lot of flexibility in how you approach many of them. It builds upon Fallout 3's mechanics in interesting and enigmatic ways, making it a comfortable advancement to one of the best games RPG Games. Fallout: New Vegas is periodically awesome and often compelling. If you crave an expansive and branching adventure in which your choices matter, this is one game that will deliver. I rate this game a 8.75/10 and recommend to anyone that has played Skyrim, Fallout 3 or any other RPG's from Bethesda, aswell as advocates of open world games.			"

												I recommend this game to EVERYONE. It's possibly my favorite game ever, with Fallout 3 a very close second. I love everything about it: the world, the lore, the crazy characters. I even love some of the bugs, as long as they're not game-crashing. Yep, it's buggy. Don't care. It's still my favorite.			"

												I am an avid role player myself, assuming she is a nurse and I am a naughty patient. But in real life (otherwise known as video games to me) I have trouble with the concept. I find myself following the pretty arrows a lot rather than creating my own adventure. Then again, I can’t be alone because otherwise they wouldn’t even god damn be there. So in Fallout New Vegas I woke up and was told I might have brain damage. Well good job, game over; it’s hard to save the world when you have a seizure every ten minutes. But I was told by the good people of tutorial village that I should pursue more danger. Well, the glowing arrow meant I couldn’t disagree and so I set out into the Mohave Desert. In usual Sylvester Stallone/Bruce Willis/Arnold Schwarzenegger style (choose your own bloody action hero) I got into trouble and was forced to shoot desperadoes to achieve a meaningless ending. Meaningless in the sense that the story just ends, you spawn back in the world and no one has any idea of the events that took place.Maybe it is just me, but I can’t actually role play in a story that’s already been created and decided. I know it’s several decades before we have more open-ended games but others have been able to hide the closed-endedness (shut up, it’s a word now). New Vegas brought in a new hardcore mode which supplements survival into the mix. You have to eat, drink and sleep to stay alive. I have yet to try this mode, but I can assure you, like always, mods will make it better. So go buy this game and leave me alone. I’ve played it many times and I have better things to do than tend to your need for reassurance and laughter. I have my brain damage seizures and a dog for that.			"

												When I think of Fallout New Vegas I think of many hours of fun. Going through various  murderous rampages killing whole towns or even destroying entire factions.This game has brought the feeling to me of excitement and exagerated fun. There are tons of glitches that just add hilarity into the game making it an amazing experience. One of the greatest aspects of this game is the fact that the modding community is very active. There are gun mods, testure mods, and various gameplay changing mods. Maybe a new npc, a new house, or a new quest. These mods add hundreds of hours of gameplay and I would say this is one of the most inteligent and most rewarding game I have every played. If you want an example of crazy fun check out this mod video.

												A direct sequel to Fallout and Fallout 2 that incorporates many elements from the originally cancelled Fallout 3 (Van Buren), New Vegas shines as a truly ambitious and rewarding RPG where reactivity to the player's actions can be seen in direct and subtle ways. The richness of the Mojave Wasteland's logical consistency and characterisation makes one completely absorbed in the world, where politics, corruption, idealogical clashes and the consequences of war make F:NV considerably more intelligent and thought out than many games out there.Thankfully the final patches to the title have amended the glaring bugs present in the vanilla release, and with a fantastic collection of DLC that expands on the universe's rich canon, one won't easily forget the fantastic side stories such as Randall Clark's trials and tribulations as a lone survivor in Zion National Park, Christine Royce's pursual of Father Elijah from Big Mountain through to the Sierra Madre, meeting the legendary ""Burned Man"" Joshua Graham, and ultimately, the player character being hunted down by Ulysses, the original ""Courier Six"", and uncovering his motivations for doing so. As a side note, I was honoured to have interviewed staff at Obsidian and Bethesda discussing their insights on the development of the game, with links available here:- JE Sawyer - Fallout New Vegas lead designer and Honest Hearts DLC director[www.gamasutra.com]- Chris Avellone - Part 1 - Obsidian creative lead and Fallout New Vegas DLC director[www.gamasutra.com]- Chris Avellone - Part 2[www.gamasutra.com]- Chris Avellone - Part 3[www.gamasutra.com]- Jason Bergman - Bethesda producer[www.gamasutra.com]- Tim Cain - the Father of Fallout[www.gamasutra.com]- The Fallout From Fallout 3 - an analysis of the cancellation of Van Buren through to Bethesda's Fallout 3, and what happened next[willooi.com] "

												Fallout New Vegas is a game I love a lot. It's a fantastic blend of story telling, fps and rpg elements all mixed in with the classic Fallout post nuclear waste land and bizarre humour.I would highly recommend that anyone who has not played this gem should. You will have a lot of fun and unlike the previous games the story line with the abhorrent slavers Caesar's Legion vs the quasi capitalist, democratic NCR gives you two very different 'protagonists' to fight for with radically different societies and philosophies.All of the DLC you will get has great value (well the gun runners weapons and ammos are a bit iffy) but the 4 main expansions add serious additional content to the game with huge new areas and plots from the Tribals in Xion Valley to the crazy disembodied scientist brains at the Big Empties Think Tank.

												I actually have much more hours but on another version (non Steam version)... just re-bought it and replaying it...oh man. EPIC GAME! Fallout New Vegas is second favorite game of all time. Fallout 3 is my top best.The New Vegas storyline hearkens back to Fallout 1 and 2 which isn’t surprising given that Oblivion is holding the reins again and here is where I fess up to having never played the first two. I had to do a bit of Wiki-ing (which always leads to me reading waaaay too much about Eleanor of Aquitaine – call it Wikigressing) to understand what was going on and I still don’t really get the part about Hoover Dam. Anyway. I’ll have to leave the majority of comparisons between the first two Fallouts and this one to those who’ve played all the games but I will say I was impressed with how seamlessly Oblivion’s New Vegas integrated the Fallout 3 experience – especially The V.A.T.S. system, morally polarizing quests, and somewhat unreliable yet still tantalizing map markers.I know the graphics are very 2001 and the endless running though the wasteland should bore the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of some but it doesn’t and here’s why: The base level of difficulty in New Vegas is hard. Like dying every 15 minutes hard. This is a twenty hour campaign which could easily turn into a nine hundred hour campaign based on the hordes of irradiated critters ALONE. I wish I could explain why this is good rather than annoying and maybe it’s a mixture of nostalgia, the Mister Vegas radio program, and Snuffy the Mole Rat but instead of falling asleep in my sarsparilla I find it soothing.I also find shooting a chem fiend in the face with a sawed off shotgun soothing so take that with a grain of salt.  This is a classic my friends. Don't miss out.			"

												It's not as atmospheric as Fallout 3, nor is the story any better than Fallout 3, what you hear from the New Vegas fanboys are just a bunch of idiots following the band wagon. I remember when Fallout 3 was out, everyone was praising it, and then came New Vegas, and all of a sudden everyone started hating on Fallout 3 out of nowhere.Anyway, back to the purpose of the review, the gameplay is quite solid, the ironsights could use a little work. The game also has a hardcore mode which I would recommend for realism/immersion purposes (required to eat/drink/sleep to survive). The companion system is much nicer here than it is in Fallout 3, you're given more choices with them and some companions have their own little quest which tells you a little bit about their background. My favorite part of the game would be the faction system, although it's a bit silly that killing a few of their faction members would make you villified amongst their entire faction, even if you manage to kill all the witnesses, but on the bright side you can suit on one of the faction's uniforms to disguise yourself as one of their own.  What faction you choose to side with determines the outcome of the ending, or if you don't want to align yourself with a faction, you're given the choice to be your own faction in a certain point of the story. This entire review so far has been centered around the base game, if the base game is good, the game is good, unlike Skyrim where people say the mods make it good which sounds ridiculous in my opinion. I would recommend playing the base game before spoiling yourself with mods. Trust me, with the replayability of this game, you'll have no trouble going back from the start and playing all over again.If you're looking for mods after finishing the base game as I suggest you doing, I would recommend these mods, so write them down on a notepad or something:1. Project Nevada (not recommended for casual players)2. ELECTRO CITY3. iHud (for those hardcore immersion players)4. RH_Ironsights (I know the game has ironsights by default, but this mod slightly tweaks some weapons)5. Improved Sound FX (makes gun sound like they actually do damage)6. Populated Casino (ever wonder how the casinos make so much money if only two people are standing around gambling?)7. Fellout (makes the nights MUCH darker, it's a little strange how enemies can't see you with high sneak when you're right at their face in a blue night that isn't even dark, can be buggy at times)8. F O O K [no spaces, Steam censors the spelling of this mod by default] (this mod used to be huge for Fallout 3, but it's not quite as popular in New Vegas, adds new weapons and armor and other content, don't remember the details)			"

												This is one of the best open ended action rpgs. The world is very well designed, having little set pieces such as a camp over run by over sized bugs. The game never directly references it and you have to find it but it adds depth to the world most other games like this (Even Fallout 3) fail at. It has a cast of characters that are pretty good though it has a lot of reused voices. The multiple endings and senerios based on your actions make this game very replayable as you actions have active effects on the world(like enermy spawns faction ownership and so on. The game also manages to make you start as someone who is very unimportant to the man who shapes the world and people react to you based on your actions.I strongly recommend this game and no I do not play with mods other then one that adds music.

												Skyrim is a new game created by treyarch,in Lego Star Wars 2 you team up with Jason Brody as he goes on a journey of self discovery,this game trumps over the previous game, Left for dead 2 because of how much level of detailis in every encounter in the game,these reasons are why Terraria is the best game""Minecraft is a fun game."" - 10/10 GameInformer.

												A sequal to the masterpiece, Fallout 3. This game feels more like your playing a modded version of FO3, but that is because this game uses the same game engine as FO3. Though this game improves off of what Fallout 3 did not have. This game has fun gameplay. You travel the wasteland as a Courier who cheated death when shot in the head attempting to deliver a Platinum Chip, something that has a secret behind it. The story is more badass than FO3. The game is surrounded by choice. Say you were attacking a base you could take a couple different routes which would lead up to something different than the other. There are factions in the game that you can join and each is different than the other. Each unique. There are tons and I mean TONS, of weapons. Each unique in it's own special way. There is also ton of gore in this game. Heads explode, spines go flying out, eyes balls fly. Though you may just asking is the game any good? Yes it is. And it is a hell of a lot of fun. 9.2			"

												I remember drooling at the mouth when I heard that Fallout: NV was in development.  This game is very much like Fallout 3, which I also played endlessly, in that its an open world experience with tons of content to offer.  For those who like to roleplay you'll find a ton of material to work with to craft your character and create your own story the way you want.  The modding scene was never as popular as Fallout 3 and certainly not anywhere as heavy as the Elder Scrolls series.  Regardless, FO:NV has a lot to offer and is well worth any RPG fan's attention.

												Fallout: New Vegas feels very much like the Fallout 3. The main thing that felt different were the different factions that determined the narrative for the game. I checked out a couple of the endings and they had really different feelings to each other. Other than that it’s still just good old Fallout 3 action. You’ll definitely enjoy it as much and maybe even more depending on which style you like more: East or West America. I just jogged around with my hunting rifle and kept raiders hugging the ground. That’s a good gaming afternoon to me. Dialogue was interesting and felt like coming from real people. I enjoyed it.			"

												You should play Fallout: New Vegas. Before buying the Ultimate Edition on Steam, I played over 150 hours on the base game for Xbox. From the first time I walked out of the doctor's office and into Goodsprings, listening to Dean Martin on Radio New Vegas, the atmosphere and attitude of this game hooked me. The clever humor, fun perks, and the variety of characters you meet in your travels through the wasteland make for an engrossing and entertaining adventure. When describing Fallout to friends new to the series, I often describe it as similar to an Elder Scrolls game set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Obviously, there are key differences in gameplay, atmosphere, and mechanics, but they are alike in their near-perfection of the single player RPG. Few single player games come close to matching the depth of either series and even fewer have held such a dedicated and fanatical following. Just check the number of mods available on nexusmods.com (and the fact that new mods are put out nearly every day) and you will get an idea of how people feel about this game. Some people like Fallout 3 better than New Vegas; some people point to the fact that Obsidian developed NV while Bethesda developed Fallout 3 and the modern Elder Scrolls games as evidence that New Vegas a farmed-out product of lesser quality. While there is no accounting for taste, I prefer New Vegas to Fallout 3 because I love the music and old-west atmosphere of New Vegas. While the game is great without mods, I must say that even after 150 hours on the vanilla game, playing again with dozens of mods and all the expansions on PC is close to a totally different experience. Project Nevada, NMC's texture pack, Weapon Mods Expanded (to name a few of the best) really make New Vegas feel at home on PC as a platform and add a level of challenge and scrappiness that should please any Fallout veteran who may find the basic mode lacking in difficulty.

												Okay, so picture this: A bear and a rabbit are pooping the woods. The bear tries to pickpocket the rabbit but fails and his hand gets covered in doo-doo. Well, the rabbit is angry, so he uses VATS to freeze time, and shove the bear's doo-doo covered hand in his face. The bear then screams ""POOPIE IN MY FACE"" and runs away. That's pretty much what this game is. War. War never changes.			"

												I'm not a first person shooter gamer most the time, but I had little trouble playing through this. The gameplay is perfect, there's story EVERYWHERE, and I can always find something to do. Fantastic game. Only complaints is the dialogue is often campy and the voice acting is sometimes unnatural. Biggest complaint though is the AI, which could've used work. Still totally worth buying though just for the hndereds of hours of content.			"
