												What starts off as a promising concept falls badly flat. The first half of the game is all about unlocking more and more features, which is implemented very well, and would have made a great game if they'd stuck with it. But as soon as you unlock ""3D"" the game just becomes alternately a bad zelda clone and a bad FF clone. The concept of ""unlocks"" goes out the window, in favor of ""whatever gimick we feel like giving you for a short while, then taking away"".The puzzles requiring you to switch between different ""eras"" are briliant. Pity that this idea was so sparingly and arbitrarily applied.Bottom line: A great set of ideas looking for a better game.			"

												A short, sweet, but well written love letter to the games of the 80s and 90s, Evoland is a must play for anyone who grew up on classic Zelda, Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. There's even a Diablo level thrown in for good measure. Evoland is quite literally a walk through RPG history, starting with black and white 8-bit and ending with 6th gen level graphics. Nintendo's infamous ""rule of 3"" is in abundance, as are the frequent turn based FF/DQ battles. The game has a few bugs, and hit detection on some things is a bit off in the Zelda segments, but it's hardly game breaking. I have to stress that the game is short and has little to no replay value, but it's still well worth it for fans of the old school.			"

												Evoland is a charming tribute to the history of RPGs. Obviously influenced by The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Diablo, there's a lot to love in this indie gem. You'll traverse the annals of video game history as you move from early 8-bit games through 16-bit and 3D, gaining little bonuses along the way that poke fun at RPG stereotypes. I smiled on more than one occasion at the humor in the game, and I was always looking forward to the next technological progression of my character. In a way, Evoland presents as a haphazard combination of themes. On the one hand, you have the excellent unlockable tributes to video game history. You unlock the ability to enter houses, you gain the ability to fight, and you'll be able to fight random enemies. All good, and all evenly and comically presented. However, the game eventually becomes a casual RPG with a light story that features frequent testaments to the major moments in RPG classics. While it is a little jarring to have your little world suddenly begin to be fleshed out, it makes sense mechanically and keeps the game moving.As you journey on through this adventure, you'll play a collectible card game, solve Zelda-style puzzles, find optional collectible items, and enjoy many different modes of play. Evoland is something special, and anyone who looks upon the roots of RPGs fondly will enjoy this nostalgic love letter.			"

												When I went into this game, I was really looking forward to it. A nostolgia trip that takes you through the best of top down adventure, RPG and turn based battles. What is actually here is a brief parody game poking fun at itself and tropes across two decades of game genres and technological advances.To my dismay, Evoland bluntly tells you, you're in this era of RPGs. I guess its meant for comedy, but I just didn't care for it. You'll unlock different eras of games and different technologies, such as sound effects, music, 16 bit graphics, high definition textures, 3D battle systems and so on. Its all part of the joke. You'll see all the stereotypes and tropes here and the game will be quick to point them out to you so that you'll understand its a joke.Evoland has great graphics, and some gameplay elements that would make for a great game. This feels like a good tech demo since every era is so brief with no depth. I can understand paying $5 if they use this engine to make a real full fledged game, but you'll breeze through this game with no challenge. I would say its the perfect game for kids, but with so much hinging on nostalgia, kids might not understand.You'll play in top down Zelda segments, using a sword to cut down grass, bombs to blow up walls and arrows to transfer fire between lit and unlit candles. Eventually that top down will turn into a 3D version of itself which you can switch between using crystals. Its a nice system that I would have liked to see a lot more of if not be its own game. There are Final Fantasy 2 style towns, random battles and turn based combat, but there is no depth to combat. Its all turn based fighting where your main character has no skills. The secondary character has spells, but nothing lost for using the spells like a traditional turn based RPG would have. Eventually the old school RPG updates itself to be 3D later on in the game.Eventually, you'll find a Final Fantasy 8 style town. After that you'll find a Diablo styled dungeon with gold, health orbs and loot dropping on the ground for you to collect. It felt like a button mashing chore to get through it. Nothing intelligent to the gameplay, just button mashing.In the game you'll collect gold, cards and stars, but other than that, there's not much going on. There is little need for gold since there is barely anything to buy. The stars just go to an achievement. The cards lead to a Final Fantasy 8 inspired mini game that is nice to play where your cards have numbers on each of the four sides of the cards and you lay them down in a grid of 3 by 3 to determine who has the most cards once you've thrown down. It is a great feature to have and they went the extra mile to include it.With that said, the game just feels so hollow, all style, no substance. There is no storyline twist, such as an evil wizard devolves the land once you've easily breezed through the evolutionary eras. I knew how far I had progressed based on what evolutionary stage I was on. It just felt disappointing. Since there is no depth, the combat is really just tedium if not button mashing. The focus was on making the game feel like the other games we know and love.As a comedy game it missed its mark with me in the 3 hours it took to complete it. There were definitely highs and boring lows. If it was more difficult the game wouldn't be fun after the laughs wear off. I've gone through it twice now and disliked it more the second time.			"

												It's not often that I find myself really enjoying a game but agreeing wholeheartedly with the people who gave it a negative review. Yet, that's what I experienced with Evoland, an RPG that bills itself as a ""journey through the history of action/adventure gaming"".Evoland exists more as unrealized potential than as a genuinely good RPG. The gameplay/story elements it gets right are amazing, but it also has many problems that keep it from being a standout in the genre.The game itself takes heavy influences from the Final Fantasy games. You start out as an random knight in a forest, quickly gaining the ability to do basic things like walk in different directions, fight enemies and learn more about the plot (which is only there for the sake of an achievement joke). From there, you meet a young girl who aids you in your journey and you both set off to defeat the evil lord who's trying to take over the world. Pretty standard stuff.More than anything else in the game, the plot (and by proxy, the introduction and jokes about various RPG concepts) is really only good for the first hour. Many of the gameplay elements fall apart the further you go into the game.Chief among them is the random battle system. Not only is it incredibly annoying (you get attacked every few steps on the world map), but there's no real purpose for any of it. You can attack or heal, and you gain levels that give you more HP or magic power, but this doesn't translate to the rest of the game. There are three distinct battle systems - the standard RPG turn-based system, a Torchlight-inspired hack-n-slash with a health globe, and a Zelda-esque dungeon mode with heart containers. None of these systems have anything to do with each other, and there's no point grinding in the overworld.The same goes for the collectibles you find. There are gamecards (based off Triple Triad/Triad Master from Final Fantasy) that are scattered throughout the world, but their purpose is never clear until halfway through, and playing games with them is pointless. There's a powerful magic attack that unlocks after a boss battle, but you have to wait a very, very long time to use it, and its only use is to kill trash mobs. You get a bunch of items dumped on you during the hack-n-slash dungeon, but most of them don't do anything at all, and the minimap you gain in said dungeon doesn't even work half the time.It's frustrating, because when the game is firing on all cylinders, it's a wonderful experience. There was a moment where I was trying to figure out a puzzle in a forest, seamlessly switching between 2D Zelda-style graphics and a full 3D realization of the same forest, and marveling in awe at how fluid the transition was. Likewise, there are some amusing jokes and throwbacks to games like Final Fantasy VII and VIII that had me smirking as I played.The best part of the game is the sense of achievement you get when you find a new chest, and open it for a random surprise. This runs the gamut from increased graphics to gameplay changes, new weapons and more. It's that sense of pursuit for the next unlock that drives my enjoyment of the game.The gameplay itself is also enjoyable, and the constant belittling of the main characters by NPCs is quite amusing, especially when you can't speak to adults in the early game until you eat a magical seed that inexplicably causes you to age a decade and become an adult.In the end, I felt that Evoland was a great experience in spite of the problems associated with it, and I'm excited to see what the developers will bring to the table for the sequel (also available on Steam). The evolving gameplay and charming characterization is what sets this apart from a lot of other RPGs.Definitely worth checking out, if only for the first hour.For more reviews, visit my Curator page, Alex's RPG Recommendations!

												Might not be the best RPG around in terms of story and lenght, but it features a very interesting concept of multiple environmental and combat systems which can be found througout the history of RPG games (i.e. Legend of Zelda, Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy and Diablo game mechanics and graphics, among others). As you continue through the game, you'll unlock new mechanics and new graphic modes which resemble the next step in the genre's evolution - hence the name ""Evoland"". It's worth the price for a couple of hours of fun, a nice story and a look through the story of the genre.			"

												I feel bad giving this game a thumbs down, because it has (or had rather) lots of potential. What it turned out to be was a short, extremely underwhelming mishmash of classic games, dumbed down to the point where all of the enjoyment of the originals is gone.How can one make a game that is part Zelda, part Final Fantasy, and part Diablo that sucks? Well, take 5 minutes worth of Zelda gameplay, make the controls slightly less responsive, and stretch it out for 30 minutes. Final Fantasy? Have 3 - and only 3 - different types of enemies that require the same amount of attacks to kill whether you're at level 1 or 5. And imagine Diablo with no difficulty and pointless item drops.The whole game is an exercise in redundancy, filled with stolen famous one-liners from games we love, only to be regurgitated out of the context that made them memorable in the first place. Had the game been much, much longer, with more variation in enemies, items, and, well, basic gameplay, Evoland could have done well.			"

												My opinion: Evoland was a good game, but I was expecting way too much from it.I was sorely disappointed when the game ended. But that doesn't mean it was bad. On the contrary, it was, for the most part, pretty enjoyable. Evoland shows the history of game design (limited exclusively to adventure games) from it's very beginnings, but disappointingly stops short of modern day. This made the game surprisingly short, but they weren't kidding when they said 'A Short Story'. My major gripe with it, is that it's not the evolution of adventure games as much as it is 'The Evolution of The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy Games'. There's obviously more to adventure than that, and even though those two are both superb series in themselves, the spotlight could have been cast to others. And the fact that those two games are featured so predominately kind of makes the slight reference to Skyrim and League of Legends seem out of place.But aside from the limited scope, that limited scope is done fantastically. Since this is a game about gameplay evolution, new mechanics and features are introduced constantly. But their introduced so seamlessly that it feels natural. You never have to take a pause to read instructions or do a tutorial, you just get it. That's where the game shines. It sets out to show gameplay evolution, and that's what it does. If you're an veteran of video games, you'll enjoy being able to relive some past experiences that you just don't get in AAA titles today. But, if you're a veteran gamer, then you'll be annoyed at some just as you smile at others.Want to continue reading for a more in depth review?

OverviewEvoland is a game that fails to achieve its potential. With good intentions, it pays homage to the evolution of the video game industry by allowing the player to travel through iconic RPG of the past. However, behind the cute references, Evoland is severely lacking in content.GameplayThe majority of the advertised unlockable features (improved graphics, sound, or combat) happen at the beginning of the game. After that, the player is forced to battle through ♥♥♥♥♥♥ renditions of Final Fantasy, Legend of Zelda, or Diablo. 95% of the items you encounter are completely useless and combat boils down to two commands: ""attack"" or ""heal"". To boot, the level-up and currency system does nothing (read: nothing), making the random encounters both intrusive and useless.VerdictWith some fumbling around, I was able to personally discover / beat all the content to the game in a measly three hours, including the main story and all secret unlockables. I bet you could do it with just two if you really tried. There is zero replay value. It's a shame really. Evoland was one of the wishlist games I had the highest hopes for.			"

												Evoland has charm with an interesting concept to boot, traverse through gaming history. An appealing visual style encapsulating the likeness of each era, from Game Boy 8-bit to PlayStation-esque polygons, harmonised with an exceptional soundtracks re-creates an extremely nostalgic sensation for those familiar with the related retro consoles. Not only that but there are many nods and gameplay elements referencing various game franchises not limited to: Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Legend of Zelda, Diablo, and most surprisingly although perhaps unintentional YS. Changes to gameplay are achieved through an unlock system, one problem is that several of these feel like complete gimmicks and don't add to the game as much as others. However I will admit there has been a vast amount of improvements when compared to the original game, which can still be played on the developer's site.[evoland.shirogames.com] So if you're wanting a taster of what to expect you can try that out for free first.

												The first hour or so of Evoland is fun. Its premise -- explore a world where the graphics and game mechanics continuously evolve via treasure chest unlocks -- is a good one, and one that I don't see enough in gaming. It's nice to see the world shift around you, as you go from a monochrome, GameBoy-esque scene with only one usable button to a 3D world with prerendered graphics, and the sense of generational progress really applies to my sense of nostalgia.If only they taken that idea and run with it.About halfway through the game, when you go to 3D, the tone of the game noticably changes. The focus of the game is no longer on constantly evolving graphics and game mechanics; instead, the game tries to be a straight-faced clone of Zelda and Final Fantasy at the same time. If well-executed, this would also be a welcome development, but the game from this point onward has no depth; sure, there are Zelda-like dungeons, Final Fantasy-like random encounters and a story going on, but the dungeons have fairly basic level design, the random encounters occur WAY too frequently (one every five-six steps in the overworld), the combat draws from a miniscule pool of enemies, and the story is so shallow that I couldn't bring myself to care about anything. The first hour was great, but from there the game got very dull, very quickly.			"

												Evoland is game that is interesting for the first hour and then a tedious gimmick for the rest.  And the rest is maybe another hour and a half unless you're an achievement completionist.The premise is that you guide your character though the history of Zelda/Final Fantasy style computer games whilst saving your village from Evil.The problem is that with the exception of the early Zelda'esque gameplay Evoland is just not very fun.  There is less than three hours of game and it still feels drawn out.  The puzzle sections see you trudging backwards and forwards along the same path time and time again.  The traps are cheap and the monsters re-spawn which makes reloading and replaying the same stage a chore.Once the game has evolved to Final Fantasy style random encounters it becomes very annoying as an encounter happens every three to tens seconds on the world map.  There is almost no need for interaction during encounters as the combat is basically: hit with one character heal group with the other.  Walk through some trees.  Repeat with the next encounter.The Torchlight styled sections could have been fun but the collision detection is so utterly awful that melee hits tend to miss.  Fighting degenerates into mashing the hit button until the area attack is charged.  Again repeat.Really this game had a lot of potential but there is so little content (repeated ad-nauseam) that I do begrudge the time I spent to complete it.			"

												Evoland is a game that tries to grab your nostalgia of great classic games like The Legend of Zelda or Final Fantasy 7, but all you get while playing it is the urge to play those better games.The core concept is cool, as you play through the game the graphics get more modernized and new mechanics get added as well, but it rarely treats it as an actual gameplay concept rather than a clever visual gimmick.The game takes different gameplay styles for different dungeons. One dungeon and the world map will play like Final Fantasy, a few are like Zelda, and another like Diablo. I would look past the lack of consistency if it wasn't for each of these playstyles being a poor man's version of what they are mimicking. The Zelda sections are okay, but have clunky level design and bare-bone puzzles. The Final Fantasy sections require little strategy with your caster only knowing two spells she can spam because there is no MP (or any spell limitations outside of the hero's summoning spell for that matter). And finally, the Diablo section is just a really basic beat 'em up with a single combo.The game constantly screams unused potential, but the developers were just satisfied with offering the player minimum depth in gameplay and writing. There are clever moments, but it does nothing memorable to stand as it's own game. That may be the purpose of the entire game, but at the very least it could offer HALF of what it's trying to replicate. More spells for the turn base combat sections, one other combo for the Diablo section... I should be able to look at each of these playstyles separately and be convinced that it could stand as it's own game.Positives? The game as a whole looks decent. The pixel art in the 2D segments look like an typical SNES RPG and the 3D graphics could pass on the PS2, that's not bad for an indie title. Outside of that though I can't say any element is better than average.The game is about three hours long for the main story, you could argue it's a bit longer if you do EVERYTHING. But there's no real payoff for finding all the collectables, so what is the point outside of just collecting them? Playing a card game that randomly selects my cards? Why not just find the strongest cards and just use those?If you can get this for a REALLY low price and just want to waste a couple hours, I guess you could do worse.However, If you are wondering if you should play this game before playing the second, don't. In a lot of way Evoland 2 is what 1 should've been. A tangible plot with actual characters with more engaging gameplay elements that does more than just be there for the refrence.			"

												Evoland is an Action RPG that takes the player through the history of gaming in a thoroughly humorous and nostalgic experience. Unlike most RPGs, the game is focused less on character development and leveling up and more as a humorous experience designed to bring a smile to the faces of veteran players as they progress through the various ages of the RPG, taking in the sights and bringing up fond memories. Packed to the brim with endless references, it’s clear from the start that Evoland was made with the utmost love for games of time gone by and provides an authentic experience throughout.Evoland is a game with a lot of charm, not least due to its sincere parodies of aspects such as the linearity of open world games like Final Fantasy, complete with a suspiciously named substitute called “Kaeris”, who specializes in magic asks our hero (and the player) politely to help her save her town.  Of course the player is forced to agree as to set into motion the events of the game. The humor makes sure that the player knows that this is clearly a game made from the heart and not once do the references feel forced or contrived. What will appeal most to gamers are the faithful replications of games like Final Fantasy and Zelda. Beginning the game with nothing more than the ability to move right and with Gameboy era graphics, the player soon, “unlocks” features such as SFX, 3D graphics and HD textures which are used uniquely as an aspect of the gameplay, becoming more advanced as the player progresses through the game. It’s hard not to raise a smile when switching from 2D to 3D within a matter of seconds and such use of visuals and sound is nothing if not innovative, helping to immerse the player into a game that reads like a history book of the gaming industry.That’s not to say that the game is perfect by any means, as there are several flaws that stick out as surprising, considering the obvious care to detail within the game. Factors like the lack of a sprint unlock came as a surprise considering just how expected it is in line with the other unlocks, and in certain parts of the game, it comes across as a very much needed feature which lack of inclusion can only serve to puzzle players. The switch to Diablo-like gameplay for a dungeon is very much less polished than the rest of the game and it’s not rare to find yourself shouting out in frustration as you try to adapt to gameplay so clearly not replicated to the high standards of the battle systems for the Final Fantasy and Zelda sections. That’s not to say it’s bad by any means, but the high standards laid down previously by the game serve only to emphasize just how annoying it is to have to deal with the clunky controls that are introduced and the dungeon will have players pulling their hair out in frustration as they die many a death trying to come to terms with the controls.The balance of the game also works against it as the various unlocks, arguably the most intriguing parts of the game, are largely completed within the first third. It’s hard not to feel that they should’ve been spread out further throughout the game, as you find yourself wanting to spend more time immersed within the 2D world, which is soon eliminated to make way for 3D, proceeding to make up the bulk of the rest of the game. That’s not to say the 3D sections are any less impressive, it’s just the enjoyment of the game as an interactive history of gaming is over all too quickly and leaves the player crying out for more. Such weighting to the first third of the game can also be seen in its references, which gradually decrease as the game goes on. Early in the game everything the player interacts with has a witty remark or object leading to several genuine laugh out loud moments whereas the latter stages lack interactivity leading to a loss in the charm that the game possesses as the game becomes an almost straightforward RPG.Evoland is a unique game in that it’s impressive to see the scale of references and care to detail that is present within it. Despite several surprising flaws, it’s not often in a game where one can relive some of the greatest game-playing experiences from Final Fantasy and Zelda in a couple of hours and the combination of the two games is almost seamless in their execution. Nothing less than a love letter to the games of yesteryear, Evoland will delight players both old and new as it takes them on a journey of nostalgia through a loving send up of the best games of years past.Recommended "

												Quite an interesting approach on the visualisation of evolution of the virtual RPG standarts over time. When I just heard about this project, I thought ""wow, cool, must've been smth worth to look at!"". Then I bought it - probably at some sell event or in the bundle, as I'm sure I was not buying it the moment it got out of Greenlight. And then... I haven't touched it until now. Two years passed by, the game achieved positive background and its devs even released Evoland 2, which is basically just one more try to do the same trick - but better... So yeah, now there are some reviews which points to the Evoland 2 immidiately, like the first one Evoland is obsolete now. Is it? Nope.I have to say, one of the things that kept me away from Evoland was the fear that the devs will mess something on my ""so precious"" gaming experience over all those years. It's the same thing as touching the HD remakes of Heroes of Might and Magic 3 or Baldur's Gate - which I haven't done yet - just to not mess the memoires of good old times with another portion of disorder every reinstallation usually creates. Happily, I have to state, that's not an issue of Evoland.While it ceratinly does just as promises - showing you the evolution of trends and game mechanics in some part of virtual role-playing - it does not insists that it was Strictly That Way. You know, as it usually goes with history lessons - like when Soviets poses like it was them who beats all the Nazies - and forgetting totally about Lendlease. Or like Americans poses it was them who finished Hitler and all around - oh yeah, and with K/D ratio of 10, above all... Sorry, I'm slipping away.So, have I enjoyed the game? Certainly. Could I recommend it to buy? Only if you're already used to play wanna be jRPG projects (like RPG Maker stuff), as Evoland generally follows the ""evolution"" on the eastern tread: Legend of Zelda mixes with early Final Fantasy tunes, whereas the promised reminiscence to the Diablo feels... just slightly common. Anyway, as of ""evolution"" theme, Evoland concentrates basically on the technological stuff - like adding more and more pixels on the screen and more tones to the sound, while the story and other most basical RPG elements remains on the level of the games in early 90's.So! As of overall, speaking of ""cultural value"" of Evoland, I can say it's a good tribute, which is worth your attention, if you've been long on the gaming stage. However, if you're expecting a very good RPG experience from Evoland itself, I'm sorry, I can't see, how this can be done in project like this, with all that mixture of styles, game mechanics and other stuff! Were that game any longer, I must add, it could have been even worse than it is now. Because tribute - is always just a tribute. If you want authentic taste - you obviously need to play all those classics like Diablo or Zelda by yourself.My mark for Evoland is 7.5/10. Nice project, and easy gold on achevements. Worth its price.			"

												Evoland may seem like a good game, however after the first hour or so everything becomes really tedious. Once you've unlocked all the upgrades you're left playing a game who took basic features from several games (pokemon, final fantasy, zelda), and threw them all together, nothing new is really added. The story line is dull and short, and once you complete it there's nothing to do except discover a few easter eggs.While this game is not the worst out there, I would not recommend it.			"

												Note: I haven't 100%'d the game or played Evoland 2. I beat the game with something like 87%.  A neat concept that leans more ""overly referential"" than ""love letter.""Why don't I like this game? When I go to play a classic RPG, I think it looks beautiful, but now I want to play it on an emulator because without the option to speed up the game I just feel like I'm wasting my time. Games used to have more of a public stigma and were often called a ""waste of time."" For some reason Evoland doesn't want to move past that, but, intentionally or not, it seems to imply that /this/ is the pinnacle of gaming. These loathsome turn-based battles wherein I'm not scared I'm going to die from facing four enemies, no, I am scared of the animation of four different characters, which means each. One. Hits. Then. You. Attack. And. Oh. You. Didn't. Kill. It. So. Let's. Do. Another. Four. Attacks. For some reason Evoland stops in this weird middle-ground of floaty combat, dull puzzles, and poorly written dialogue. Evoland fails because it's either too scared to critique or because it doesn't realize we all grew up, and I don't know which is sadder.  Perhaps worse, is that this was a perfect chance to play with genre tropes and yet Evoland decides to mimic tired mechanics.  Who is this for? I don't know. If you like Big Bang Theory's or Family Guy's referential ""humor"" and you like Zelda and FF7 then I guess this the game is for you. This ""humor"" is encapsulated by the annoying ""beeping"" sound when you get to critical health. The game even points it out. ""Remember how annoying that was in Zelda? DO YOU REMEMBER?!""    Play the Ludum Dare entry and save your money and, most importantly, time.  "

												Evoland is silly nostalgic trip to anyone that has played RPGs but mainly Final Fantasy. Evoland puts you on a quest to save Evoland and you along the way you unlock tons of stuff by opening chests, it can be higher quality soundtrac, the key to move left, 3D graphics, pixelated textures, you name it, it can be pretty much anything a game needs in order to be a game, if that makes any sense whatsoever. Speaking of which, the soundtrack is amazing, specially the turn based battle theme along with the victory theme which remind me alot of Final Fantasy VII. Let's be real though, the combat is pretty clunky and you might get annoyed due to the fact that when you're travelling you get a battle every 5 seconds. Evoland is not a really good game the way I see it but the way it was executed based on the ""unlocking stuff mechanic"" (excuse me for my english) and the nostalgia that it brought to me I think that's all it needs to redeem itself and be worth the time to play it, it's a fairly short game, 3-4 hours. That said, if you're a fan of RPGs and have been playing those for a few years you should totally play Evoland, you might like it and you may not still, I think it's worth the risk.			"

Inspired by Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo.The credits don't lie. Gameplay changes every few minutes, adding features that ""evolve"" the gameplay. Starting with an homage to zelda on the gameboy and ending in Final Fantasy VII, there's plenty of references for the experienced game player to enjoy.Similar to DLC-quest, this game keeps the new gameplay elements inside chests, so there's a strong incentive to explore the world. Having spread the game over so many genres, any one gameplay type is comparatively shallow. Thankfully, no aspect of the game overstays its welcome. One hour later you'll be playing a completely different game.Clocking in at 4 hours, this game is definitely worth the sale price of three dollars I picked it up for. Prepare for tonge-in-cheek humor and servicable (though constantly changing) gameplay as you expereince this expertly crafted combination of the dev's favorite classics.			"

												the game was short but it was fun!it has a mixture of final fantasy, zelda and a little bit of diablo. If you are looking for long playing RPG, this game isn't for you. and the joke is only relevant if you are FFVII player. You are playing as a hero that will save the world, the story is very shallow but that's not the selling points. It teaches you the history of RPG from era to era. at first you are in 2 bit mode (4 color with bevel) something like first gameboy and then you get 16 color then 256 color. The game are evolving each time you open treasure. I really like when you are able to explore the worldmap in mode 7 (It was introduced in FF IV SNES If I'm not mistaken). I beat the game in 4 hours, the game didn't quit correctly so it shows my playtime is over 100 hours :(.so to put if brief:pro : - great game for nostalgia- you are playing the game with different control/mechanic-  You are clink (cloud link) and your partner is kaeris. Her uncle is Sid and your enemy is Zephyros! LOLminus:- too short- the hidden object/secret are too obvious- story is too linearI recommend this game, but for the full price I personally think it's expensive for 4 hours+ game. I got mine from humble store when it was $1.99 and it was worth every penny! "

												Great fun! One of those games I didn’t put down until I was finished.So before I actually get to the game stuff, I want to point out a couple of things. The first being that this game seems like it’s a lot better when played with controller. After playing for a short while I tried to use mine and it didn’t work. I had to fiddle around with the files to actually get it to work. Which was mildly annoying and brings me to the second thing. After I fiddled around with the files to make it compatible, the Steam overlay stopped working. Which meant that Steam seemingly stopped recording my play time (hence the pathetic 39 minutes) and I could no longer take screenshots. Which I would of liked to have been able to do. Either way, I reversed what I did in the files after I finished the game to take a “100% yay me I did something pretty pointless” screenshot. So I’m fairly happy. Getting back to the game, I thought it was a lot of fun.I was pretty impressed with the whole aspect of the game’s graphics and features evolving as you played, it gave the game something quite unique about it yet they still managed to keep the story interesting enough that I didn’t just feel like I was just getting a history lesson.The humour was quite good, the text seemed rather sarky at times and us Brits love a bit of sarky. There is a lot of game references involved in this game and it made it all the more charming for me on top of everything else it has. I think I was expecting this game to be shorter than it was. I’m not 100% sure on how long I actually played it seeing as Steam seemingly stopped recording my play time. But I feel like I got a good while out of it. So it’s always nice for a game to feel like it lasted. After I finished the main game I continued playing for achievement purposes. After what felt like a few extra hours, I managed to find and do everything for the 100%. I would say it’s a very easy one to perfect so no worries achievement hunters!All in all I really liked this game, I would definitely recommend it to anyone that has a slight love for these style games or even just gaming in general. I’m not really sure what the label is for them, but the “handheld Pokémon-style RPG games” is what I’m going to go with. It was a fun adventure game and I look forward to trying the sequel. TL;DR : Although might need tampering with to get a controller to work, this game is a lot of fun. It has great graphics, of which evolve throughout you playing, a decent story, a lot of game references, sarcasm and charm. I would say this is definitely worth a go. Especially if you like this genre of game.It’s a fun little game to play through and an easy 100%.  "

												I rarely put this small of amount of time into a game before reviewing it, but I just don't see a light at the end of the tunnel.The only thing this game has are references. I admit it's neat at the beginning as you unlock things like better music, graphics and gameplay features, but that's the only susbstance it has. It has no interesting characters, no fun combat system, and puzzles are easy and unsatisfying. And even the references and humor become a negative and the game seems to hide its own faults behind being an homage.""LOL town music was bad back then!"" while this game's music consists of gratingly repetitive 5-second tracks on loop.""LOL remember random encounters?!"" while the game has an absolutely obnoxious amount of random encounters anywhere on the map. You can try out an alternate path, a battle every 5 or 6 steps, find there's a dead end, then fight another 3 or 4 battles on the way back to the fork, and get thrown into another battle before you even get to try the correct path.""NPCs are so annoying!"" As you run into characters of no substance whatsoever that can't even tell a decent joke when going for humor.And the rest of the faults are just inexcusable. The turn-based combat is entirely substance free and impossible to lose. The Zelda-style combat is dull, uninteresting, and poorly-designed (you can't even attack if holding down more than one directional movement key, and hitboxes are absolute lies). The game gives a series of fetch quests in a PS1 style town where there are loading screens between sections (not actual ones, just LOL reference ones) that you can remove if you collect a stupid amount of money. And the little game upgrades become sparse later on so the one fun thing it does just becomes too rare.The game just sacrifices so much for its references that there's nothing left to satisfy me to keep playing. If you want a retro-style reference to old RPGs, try something like Zeboyd's games. They're much more fleshed out and substantial than this.			"

												Evoland is as much a small parody as it is a game of it's own. It borrows heavily from other RPG games and classics (such as Final fantasy and Zelda), meaning mostly that it mocks them in that loving parody way. The game story is pretty... simple. Big evil destroying world, you must go and defeat it. Along the way, you evolve... not in power, though you do get to level up. The selling point of Evoland is the ""RPG through the ages"" bits. You start off as a pixelated character in a plain world with no enemies, and as you find chests, you start earning things. Such as enemies, the ability to level up, town citizens, pixels, and yes, 3D with nothing, then textures, and finally HD definitions. Combat is both action based and turn based; during world map encounters you will have turns, and during dungeons you will be fighting real time. The game also has one card minigame for your enjoyment. While the story is nothing to call home about, the evolving aspect of the game is fun. The graphics, even when you're just playing your pixel form, are really quite cute and very well done. The world is nice too, although the puzzles/level design/secrets are not really too difficult and everything was far too visible. I don't think they were meant to be difficult, though. The music I was not a fan of, however, it evolves as you do as well and seems to match the game perfectly, so thumbs up on that. The story is also very short and the replay value is really null unless you want to go back and do 100% achievements (which are also not terribly hard to get, but I frankly couldn't be bothered to go search for them). The parody aspect also makes it fun if you love these type of games and have a good sense of humor (see quote above and on image below for an idea of the type of humor). Actually, this was the one thing that made me rate it so high - I had great fun discovering all the chests that made the land evolve and gave me things that had funny captions, or talking to townies and seeing what they would say. I do have to say though, the battles do get a bit annoying after a while, and once you've unlocked everything and seen all the world has to offer, there's really little reason to keep playing, too. There's not much else to say about this game. Did I have fun? Yes! Exploring was fun, fighting was meh (there's really not much you can do, just attack and heal). I will full on admit I quit halfway through the last boss not so much out of frustration, but because there was really little else to do but beat him.Does it get boring if you take it seriously? Also yes. Don't even bother grinding your levels, it will not make a difference. Is it worth full price? Don't think so.Finally, if you like this type of game and get it on sale, it might be a fun little game to spend some time on for a funny, nostalgic ride into the past. Otherwise, I would recommend you pass.			"

												I can barely recommend this game. It has a LOT of problems. But overall I feel as a concept it does work well and did educate me into the story of RPG games.I will start by explaining all the problems I found with the game.Combat This is probably the biggest problem and will put the most people off buying the game. The combat is incredibly boring. In evoland you have 2 different combat styles. Turn based or normal 8 directional combat. The turn based combat is basically like in games like pokemon except with absolutely no depth to it. By the end of the game you only have the choice of 2 different attacks and a heal ability. The attacks don't do any kind of special effects. Each enemy only has one attack and they don't do any kind of special effects. Then the other combat system is just as boring. It basically consists of spamming the attack button and that is it. You have 1 combo that gets activated also by spamming the attack button but that's it. You also have the choice of using a bow and bombs later in the game but you probably won't be using these. Overall the combat is just not fun in the least.Random encounters There are sections of the world that when you explore you get random enemy encounters. Again similar to pokemon when you are exploring in grass. These sections are very common and will probably be where you spend the majority of the game. The problem is that you get way too many of these random encounters. You probably get them once every 10 or so steps. Attached to these random encounters is the incredibly boring turn based combat. I found myself extremely angry with the game all while exploring these sections. Story There is a kinda very lackluster story. It won't catch your attention at all really. The story is basically that you are rescueing a village from an evil attacking it. But the game's main focus isn't really in the story.Length I completed the entire game in just over 3 hours. Not incredibly long really. I would have liked more. It just seems to be over when you are just starting to get into it!Checkpoints Very bad placement of checkpoints. The final boss fight is the worst example of this. The checkpoint is placed just before the cutscene with talking to the boss meaning that everytime you die you get the experience of listening to what has to say all over again. Oh how fun! It took me a lot of tries to complete the boss so this annoyed me a lot! Another example is when exploring the dungeons. So when you die all your progress saves ,like enemies dead and doors opened, but you are spawned at the beginning of the dungeon. Why? I have no idea. It just seems like making you do meaningless exploring all over again. And the dungeons are fairly large. On top of all this the game takes you to the main menu everytime you die. There is no reason for a game to have to do this!But this game does have some merit despite all these annoying issues. Concept So the concept of evoland is to show the progression of RPG's over time. This includes every element annoying as it may be. This is one thing that it does well. I learned a lot during this. The game evolves as you play. You pick up chests that progress the game through the eras. It gives a great oversight. This is probably the reason that I managed to continue playing despite all the issues and just about redeems the game. Soundtrack There aren't too many songs in evolands soundtrack but what it does have is good. I love the main menu music in particular. They even have different styles of the same songs such as 16-bit or modern RPG style. The only is that since there are few tracks it can get a bit repetitive after some time. So if you think you are ok to put up with all the annoying issues of evoland then go ahead and buy it. You will find a game that does actually teach you a lot about the progression of RPG's. If not then you may be best with picking up evoland 2 instead which seems to be a great improvement from this. I am currently beginning to play through that myself and will have a review coming in the coming weeks. It doesn't follow on from evoland 1 either so your fine with skipping it.TheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game. Maybe consider it on a sale. An average game.A good game that should definitely be considered.A must play! "

												It's worth checking out (on sale, at least) for the first couple of hours. The gradual upgrades you get to the art style, perspective and gameplay are a charming tribute to games of old like Zelda and Final Fantasy to name a couple. Once all that is out of the way, however, it becomes a bit of a slog. I get that the random encounters and story cliches are also there  for the sake of paying tribute, but a little of the former goes a LONG way and it quickly becomes annoying (especially when you pretty much have no need to level up for the final boss). As for the latter, I would've liked a little bit more done with it rather than just a basic retread (if it went full deconstruction of the genre this could've been amazing). Still, the art style is pretty, there are some clever puzzles involving switching back and forth between gameplay modes, and the in-game card game was enjoyable.Worth a look, but I won't blame you if you give up after the first splendid couple of hours.

												Negative reviews will say that it's short, or a bad knock-off.  This game is what it is: a proof of concept. A throwback. An awesome revisit to the various generations of action/adventure fantasy RPGs. Get it on sale like I did, and you should not be disappointed. In any case, I thought it was awesome and I look forward to playing Evoland 2. Word to the wise: if you run Windows 8 or 10 and you have issues getting the controller to work, be aware that there is a dinput8.dll file in the game directory that is used by pad.exe to pass controller commands to the game. If you take this file out of play (by removing or renaming it) the pad.exe will work, and if run will tell you what it sees as the controller. If it's not the one you want, unplug whatever it is and repeat until it sees the right controller, and now you will have no issues playing the game with a gamepad. From what I've heard, Evoland 2 does not have that issue.			"

												This game is hard to recommend as I can see few people getting their moneys worth from the tiny bits of entertainment they will get. Evoland takes the character on a lackluster journey through various rpg games, paying homage so hard to older games that the younger folk will miss it completely and the older folk will be beaten over the head with it. And by pay homage, I mean the bad stuff too.  This game feels rushed as it just scratches the surface of things, and ultimately anything you do, you will probably only do once as the game certainly feels unfinished and hollow.  It is a real shame as this potentially would have been something amazing if more content was added and the story went somewhere long enough I could feel invested. The music is passable boarding around annoying. The enemies are trivial and bosses finicky and troublesome puzzles. I’m glad I only spent a few quarters on this game as I bought it on sale in a bundle, because that is how much this game is worth to me in its current state.			"

												This is a very interesting idea -  a computer game that evolves from 8 bit graphics, incorporating advances sequentially as they happened in real computer gaming history. Some ideas are very strong such as time travel that allows you to use different modes to solve puzzles.However, much of the gameplay is anachronistic for a reason, it's just plain bad. The game speeds through early gaming upgrades but then bogs down in a bad period of easy but irritating non avoidable fights. My motivation for labouring through these was the promise of further upgrades to the game engine, but unfortunately the game kind of just stops in 1995 gameplay. As soon as I realised I was close to the end, all interest in playing the game just evaporated.Very strong idea, initially well implemented, but it feels like the developers lost interest at around 4hrs of gameplay.

												Don't be misled by the 100% completion I have or the hours invested, this game is not worth playing.It starts out sort of cute and novel, the premise being that you unlock new abilities as a sort of video game history unfolds before you. But don't be fooled, the facade begins to fall apart within the first 20-30 minutes. A game pitched as a delve into gaming history very quickly unveils its true colors as a simple list of tired references to ""gaming culture"" with a few lines from movies thrown in for variety. Even if you can handle the completely unsubtle references (the earliest and most glaring one being the retrieval of the buster sword, where they literally say ""doesn't this look familiar?"" with a straight face) the game doesn't stand on its own in any fashion. The art is uninspired.The multiple battle systems suffer every issue from miserable and unfair hit boxes to simple math miscalculations for damage. It pretends to be Zelda, Diablo, FF, and more, and yet pales in comparison to the most rudimentary of battle systems (I wrote a more complex system on my graphing calculator back in 10th grade math) and has zero loot system whatsoever.The RPG system is literally nonexistant save for 3 items you can buy in the first hour. It pretends to have progression but the numbers don't effectively change anything as the whole game scales directly to you.The puzzles are long, boring, and unforgiving in required precision at times.The bosses are tedious and boring, even worse than the 20-year old counterparts they are rehashing.The random battles do nothing but draw out the length, and trigger frustratingly often.The writing is sad.The plot is nonexistant (references=/=plot).The ending is anticlimactic.And to top it all off, there's the option to use a gamepad, but it is never mentioned, let alone recommended, and without it, you are limited to 8-way movement, making much of the game much harder than it already is.I know this was originally part of Ludum Dare, but trying to pitch this for $10 is hilarious. Even at $1 I don't think it's worth playing simply because it intentionally disrespects your time by dragging things out. I'd honestly be more happy with the money I paid if it were 45 minutes long.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or self respect.			"

												It's honestly not that bad. It's a fun little history lesson packed with references to classic games. However, perhaps because of that it is somewhat disjointed and honestly not that fun to play. Also, a big part of why I enjoy games and especially RPGs is the story and although Evoland tries to reference all the great RPGs of the past it doesn't really have a good story of it's own. Referencing many different RPG stories means that all this game really does is highlight RPG tropes and cliches. So although it is an interesting and fun history lesson/experiment overall I can't recommend it.			"

												Oh man, this game was a treat to play. It takes you on a charming homage of the development of series like Zelda and Final Fantasy over the course of a couple hours. You start out as 8 bit as can be, and throughout chests you find, you unlock sound, better graphics, enemies, and pretty much everything else. Your travels help the world to evolve to a more modern style of gaming (equivalent to the Ocarina of Time I would say). After a bit, you can go back and forth between old school and new school as a direct homage to The Ocarina of Time. Throughout the game, the developers maintained a sense of humor while not taking themselves too seriously. The game shares that in common with DLC Quest actually...and there are game development jokes in this game as well. You at one point unlock a ship which will take you wherever you want to go without random encounters and looks very much like  helicopter version of a Star Wars ship we all know and love. The battle systems also evolve and work well. Everything about this game was done right and I cant recommend this game enough. A definite 10 out of 10.			"

												Evoland, Where to start.. This game has one of the most interesting and awesome concepts i have seen in years.You start your quest in the NES days working your way up to n64-ps1 type graphics/music which you unlock from chests as you progress. I played the game 100% threw including all the achievements in about 6 hours. This is where the problems start. The game is far too short.. All the evolving takes place in the first hour or two and what your left with is a pretty bland and very rushed JRPG. The battle systems are fun MINUS the classic turned base fighting (think final fantasy) which are just horrible. You have pretty much no skills.. gaining xp is virtually pointless and you can only heal during a fight not outside and the encounter rate is about every 3 steps. Enjoy!I still am giving this a thumbs up for the amazing concept and suggest you pick it up during a sale as i don't think it's worth it's full price, If someone were to take this idea with a decent budget they could make something truly amazing! But Evoland however did not live up to it's potential.			"

												As an older gamer who has been playing RPG's since the eighties, I really got a kick out of watching the game upgrade and evolve itself as you play. It pays homage to the gameplay styles of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo, amongst others. I was expecting the storyline to take a back seat to the evolution gimmick but it was surprisingly well implemented as a framework for everything else. If you have played a large variety of RPGs in your life, from classic JRPGs to the more modern action oriented RPGs, you will definitely enjoy not just the game, but the nostalgia that it taps into.

												I most certainly do not reccomend this. Evoland had been on my wishlist forever, and when i saw it was on sale a couple of days ago, no purchase button had ever been smashed so fast. I've sunk a large chunk of my time into this game, and the dissapointment grows as the game progresses. What started as a cute throwback quickly turned into refrences stitched together with awful combat and even worse playability. the traps are annoying, the dialogue is bland, and the ""random battles"" make me want to pull my hair out because it happens every 15 seconds. TL;DR dont buy it, you'll regret it.			"

												IF you played any of the original Zelda games, Final Fantasy, Diablo and so on, you should absolutely check this game out. Honestly, if you only liked Zelda and FF you should pick this up. It's a great homage to great games from the past. My only complaint is that the game felt short, but that's only because it's so much fun.			"

												Evoland is one of those joke games where you progress by unlocking a bunch of the fundamental components of video games, such as a pause menu, sound effects, save points, and color graphics. It presents the joke much better than DLC Quest did (And unlike DLC Quest, actually lasts for over fifteen minutes). However, it makes the terrible mistake of emulating some of the worst parts of the games it’s trying to pay homage to, and forcing you to unironically play through them. Such things include:Areas with random encounters every ten steps,A save point system; dying will make you lose progress and revert back to the last save,Entire rooms filled with invisible pits which only appear when you stand next to them,Enemies which teleport around you, enemies you can only attack from the back, and the ever-popular irritating bats,A painfully slow walking speed within dungeons,No minimaps (For most of the game, anyway)Secret collectables hidden behind fake walls with no hints whatsoever,A ridiculously long desert you’re forced to walk across with random encounters every five steps.The game starts out showing such promise as you unlock interesting bits of game history such as non-grid-based movement, 16-bit graphics, Zelda items, and eventually hi-def 3D graphics. You will even encounter some puzzles which require switching between 2D and 3D versions of the game. However, this all falls apart about halfway through the game, as the game seems to just run out of things to unlock. Before you know it, instead of unlocking cool stuff like minimaps and combo systems, you’ll mostly be getting messages like “You unlocked fireball traps in the next room!” or “You unlocked an enemy ambush!” …I wish I were joking.The music is nothing spectacular. Most is forgettable, intentionally generic midi-like renditions for satire's sake. Then there are the stylistic and gameplay inconsistencies. It seems like Evoland is actually 20 separate programs cobbled together in a big pile. Most unlockables will only work for certain areas of the game; Some areas keep their 2D graphics for the entire game even after 3D is unlocked. At one point, you unlock a minimap that only works for about three areas in the entire game (and not the places where you really need them). Plus, you actually have three different, independent kinds of HP which apply to different game areas (Zelda hearts, RPG HP, and a Diablo-style red orb), and getting “fully healed” in one area will only heal you for that specific kind of area. So you might get healed in the town or drink a life potion, only to discover you’re still at half a heart when you return to hunt for secrets in the mine dungeon. It’s not a very well-polished game in this regard.I give Evoland a 4.5 / 10. There was obviously a lot of soul and humor put into the game by the designers, but the joke goes a bit too far as the game forces upon you hundreds of tedious random encounters, slow-paced dungeons, and unfairly-hidden secrets. The first hour of the game is decent as a work of satire, but everything after that gets tiring fast. Recommended only for the patient.(It’s about 5 hours to fully complete for an achievement hunter, but be warned: if you’re going for 100%, you might want to forego the blind playthrough and keep an eye on the guide from the start, since the game gives no indication of which collectables you’ve found already. If you’re not careful, you might have to play the game twice.) "

												Evoland is a game that works like a time machine. It goes back to the roots of RPG gaming and slowly trasitions into the RPGs of today. If you had an NES or SNES when you were young, this game will make you feel nostalgia on so many levels.But unlike most RPG's, this game lacks any decent story which is a shame. It sticks with the NES story type in which there really isnt one which hurts the later part of the game.but over very fun and unique title 7.5/10			"

												Please, dismiss reviews that attempt to claim that  ""this is a Diablo/FF7/Zelda clone"". I don't want to sound disrespectful to other reviewers but one must be really thick for sarcasm to think that ""Boots of Vaal Undersoul"" that gives you ""+10 to hit & run tactics, for when the boss is just too strong"" is an item that pertains to a game trying to pull the Diablo tone.This game is, instead, a parody, or a humorous homage if you will. It changes its gaming style between dungeons rather quickly, starting from the most basic 2D game, and thens slowly evolving into FF7/Diablo/Zelda-like. This game doesn't give you any depth in any of these gameplay styles and that's why it is interesting: the focus is not in the combat, nor the graphics, nor the puzzles, the story, the character development, the plot... everything in this game is a parody. Take it or leave it boys, this is a parody. Got it?The achievements are fun, I had to consult a guide to get some of them. It also works natively on Linux if you follow this guide, but be warned that it is not supported.The only downside of the game is that Gamepad is not supported. Shame on you, Shiro Games, shame on you.			"

												The start of this game feels very exciting and promising but it's really just a tonne of wasted potential at almost every corner in this game, which left me feeling very uncomfortable with how little this game managed to pull off in the meager 3 hours of gameplay it offers. I'm not sure if the developers got lazy or just ran out of funding/time but it feels like something went seriously wrong less than half way through the game.The creators made some fairly decent engines for each 'era'/'genre' but ultimately they failed to maximise on anything other than a few gimmicks and some braindead puzzles.Check it out if it's ever 75% off again, otherwise don't bother wasting your time or your money.

												Evoland is a retro inspired game with lots of references to old games. Some things to make you laugh, others to bring back fond memories.At first it may look a little old and stale, of course because that's the way it's intended to look when you first start the game. But it's like DLC quest in the way you unlock game features. For example, being able to travel back and forth in time to complete puzzles or 3d mode. The game becomes very visually pleasing once you unlock a lot of the game modes that change the appearance.Give this a try for sure. It's well worth it and your time. I'm sure you'll find yourself hours later wondering where the time went.			"

												Great concept with a solid artistic and technical delivery, but featuring ludicrously shallow gameplay.Evoland delivers on all it's ideas. Its an adventure through gaming. From 8bit 2D adveture, to 2.5D ""HD"" hack and slash, to pre-rendered backgrounds, to turn based RPG, to even ARPG, etc. It accomplishes them all and presents them in a cohesive way with dashes of lighthearted homages and references to the games it is emulating. It definitely ""brings you back"" to the eras. But all of it comes with extremely shallow and downright silly easy gameplay. Turn based is unlimited heal and attack, your numbers always win. 2D adventure is single hit bland enemies with easy pathways. Most of the 2.5D adventure is actually clunky on top of being simplistic. And anything else is just button mashing. Its a shame too, because the foundation could support a skyscraper, but all we got was a hut. That being said, I still had enough fun. I spent my time searching for all the 100% achievement stuff to find the fun though. Some of the hidden chests and puzzles off the beaten path were the best bits of fun to be had. There's a couple levels where you actually actively switch between eras of game style to solve puzzles. Almost feel like with how atrocious the gameplay was otherwise perhaps this game would've been better served as more of a puzzle oriented game. Its painful to to start thinking about all the missed opportunists here, which seems to be an all too common theme amongst this genre on PC. I have reserved, but optimistic, hopes for the sequel though. And plan to play it soon. Because there is indeed that foundation there... Fingers crossed for marked improvements! The game is interesting enough in what it does accomplish conceptually that I definitely recommend it if it looks appealing to you. But pull back and reel in those expectations as far as you absolutely can when it comes to gameplay. I'll also say that I've seen it on sale for 90% off and in bundles plenty of other times (I got it in a bundle somewhere along the lines), and those are probably the only prices I'd recommend but its your money.

A good, interactive history of the evolution of RPG's told with a flair and a slew of references make this an incredibly charming experience from beginning to end. Even if you aren't interested in the history the game itself is a colorful fun experience that will at least bring a grin to your face as you follow Clink and Kaeris on their adventure to restore their land to its former glory.

												Evoland is an original game, with a great idea, but to be honest, it doesn't really work as a game, no matter how small or big it is. It starts off brilliant, in black and white old school 2D. Opening treasure chests grants you access to other features, features frequently seen in other RPGs, like 3D mode, loot and NPCs. That all sounds amazing, right ? It is, but the game lets you unlock all the features way too soon. Halfway through (the game lasts about 3 hours, 5 hours max if you want to collect everything) you've seen everything there is and the game starts focusing on the story (if you can call it a story). I was a bit disappointed by that, because the things that made the game so original became unoriginal and uninspired near the end. The random battles were especially starting to annoy me, since it triggers every few seconds and it's not always clear where to go. Like I said, it's something you see a lot in other RPGs, but in Evoland it backfires. A 3 hour game shouldn't become boring that soon.Get it when it's on sale. Because even though it isn't the best game out there, the idea behind it is good and should be witnessed by others.[Rating: 66/100]			"

												Total waste of money. Game was charming and fun at first, until it showed it true colors. Whole game is just bunch of most annoying thing in RPG history glued together. You hate fetch quests where you need to walk (very slowly - no running in this game) across the town like 5 times? Lucky you - there is one here just for you! Or maybe you hate random battles what happen literally every two steps? Well, as soon as game introduces FF mechanics you will be forced to play one of 3-4 random battles every freaking step you take. And let's not even start about battles! Every FF-style battle in the game can be easily won by attacking as boy and healing as girl. You literally win every battle by just mashing A (with one down press when girl is active to switch from useless ""attack"" to the ""magic""). And did i mention that most of the game you will fight with 4 types of enemies in 1 of 10 packs? That's it. And you'll do it for 3-4 hours. And yes, there is 3D battles... But let's not talk about it, especially the boss battle. This is just too sad. Let's just say that 3D collision detecting is awful and buggy as hell.			"

You keep finding chests to unveil some new graphic mode or mechanism. It is fun through the first hour. The minute you reach ""the town"", the whole game begins to fall apart. That town, OMG that town. NPCs make yo go through screens over and over again. Then the Diablo-like dungeon... it was somewhat fun, but not that much. Then that forest where you need to torch some bushes over and over and over again touching crystals going from present to past... over and over and over again!I really tried to like this game.

												Special message to my little thumbs-down stalkers:  Grow some balls and grow the f*ck up.  If you're not speaking up just because you're on my block-list, that means I don't f*cking care about you.  Get a hint!(This game was provided courtesy of my good pal Crywolf.  Thanks, dude!)In simplest terms (as other reviewers have said), Evoland is essentially a tribute and a documentary about gaming, mostly involving legendary titles such as The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy, but with elements of Diablo, the Mana series, and Dragon Quest.  The gameplay essentially switches between a JRPG types with one exception where it becomes a WRPG.The humor in this game is fresh and the references are rich.  Evoland (as the name suggests) also evolves as the game goes on.  It starts with simple Gameboy-age gaming, becomes an NES-style game, then SNES, and so-on until it reaches the 3D age.  Although Evoland is simple and short, it's still pretty fun.  I can see myself re-installing this game in the future.  My only gripe is that the Piranha Plant enemies are a little rough, but it is a late-game area...so there's that.This game is currently priced at $10.  If priced at $5-$7.50, you'll find a more satisfactory experience for your buck.  A really good experience presented as a playable documentary dedicated to gaming.9/10  I evolved to like this game pretty quickly.  No regrets playing this one.			"

												Spurned forth from the success of Evoland Classic that won the 24th Ludum Dare, Evoland is like a short love letter to gaming history. Giving plenty of nods to well known classic games that set the bar for games of their time, like Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo. If you've been a long time gamer, and looking for a trip down memory lane, then look no further than this series... Though I have heard that the sequel to this game does it better.=Complete Review==The Story: 2/5= Sadly, for as innovative as the game itself is, there's not much in terms of Story. You play as Clink, who is one of the few remaining members of the Order of the Dragon Knights, a group who roams the world aiding those in need and vanquishing evil. As things have been peaceful, there's not been much for the Order to do. But, with a uprising evil, and monsters flourishing in the world, there's once again need for a hero. And, being named after two already well known heroes, it's obvious who's going to fit the bill here. So sadly, it's a pretty cut-and-dry formula. Even their sort of plot twist near the ending kinda didn't come off that surprising, given who the two main characters are kinda named after. Still, they at least get a two for trying to have some semblance of a story here, as opposed to having none. =The User Interface: 2/5= This is, yet another area that is unfortunately lacking. Aside from what's typically on the screen, such as health (once you unlock it) and swapping weapons (again, once it's unlocked) there's literally not much you're going to do with it. They have a sort of stats and item menu, but there's not much you can even do with it. Still, as lacking as it is, it's at least there. Granted, I can't really name a game where you have no sort of interface to work with... =The Gameplay: 4/5= Ahh yes, one of two of the main boasting points of the game. The gameplay, if you're a long time gamer, will definitely seem very nostalgic, as it starts off in a playstyle very akin to the old 2D Legend of Zelda games. And through advancements and progression, eventually upgrades to a older Final Fantasy RPG style, before advancing to a 3D action adventure feel, with the overworld being that of a Final Fantasy 7 styled RPG combat system with a single area being reserved for a original Diablo style of combat. And while, it doesn't bring anything overly new in those styles, It manages all of this while managing to be fully functional in each playstyle and in the same game at that. Which, getting all those functions to work smoothly in one game is impressive alone. Not only that, there are a few puzzles that use switching between 2D and 3D to overcome, which is a pretty neat idea that was executed fairly well.=The Graphics: 4/5= Like the gameplay, this was another selling point of the game. Not because the graphics are like, next generation or anything like that. But because the game improves the graphics through progression. Starting out as a black-and-green LCD-esque display a la Gameboy, and later on advancing to that of 3D chibi-ish graphics akin to, but not up to the standard of the Final Fantasy DS remakes. And, just like the game play, the graphics are done well, and seem to have been seamlessly integrated in to the same game, and even switching between 2D and 3D is managed well with only little delay. Which, is quite impressive on it's own.=The Music: 3/5= The music isn't anything that would be the kind you'd be listening long after you played the game, but it doesn't downright suck either... But, it's also clear what games' tracks they're parodying as well. But given it also advances as you go through the game, and from what I remember, it compliments the Atmosphere of the game as well, it at least deserves a even score.=The Atmosphere: 3/5= It's basically your typical RPG Atmosphere. There's forests, grasslands, caves, deserts, and places where you know just from the look of things, that intense stuff's going to go down. Sadly, there's no nice snowy lands to see in this game. Which is a shame, as I'd have loved to see how they would have handled it. But, from what I recall, the music supports the atmospheres pretty nicely. =TL;DR/Pros & Cons=ProsInnovative idea that was pulled off fairly well.Various gameplay styles integrated well in to a singular game.Atmospheres are done decently, with music and tone to match setting.Neutral/Your Mileage May VaryThe entire game is primarily made to appeal to one's nostalgia of older games.There is a LOT of parody content, even the main characters are parodies.Graphics and Music improve with game progress.A LOT of things to collect up.Plenty of achievements.ConsPretty poor storyline.Not really much of a UI.=The Conclusion: 5/10= This is another one of those games that I wish Steam had a neutral rating, as it's just too hard to make a solid call on this one. As I did find quite a bit enjoyment in the game, I will have to list it as a positive instead of a negative. There is a lot of content that is a sort of your-mileage-may-vary on if it's the kind of game that you'd enjoy or not. It is definitely the kind of game to pick up when it's on sale, as it is sadly pretty short with little to no replay value. If you're a retro game lover, then it's definitely a game that would be worth it to purchase for you. But if you prefer graphics and newer model games to the old, then this game won't really do much for you. I hear the sequel has improved by leaps and bounds over the formulae presented by the first, and I do look forward to playing it and reviewing it some day. But, for now, thank you for reading my review.			"

												Normally I don't write recommendations when a Steam Event isn't involved. But this game was really something else. I can't even gather the will to write a sarcastic anti-recommendation. I hate fewer things more than self-aware games laden with ""funny"" and ""random"" achievements. Every step this game takes further in evolution makes it more and more insufferable. Crammed full of jokes and references that most half-witted gamers will clap their hands and giggle at, all I can do is groan and wonder just where this miserable excuse for a game will take me next. The music manages to become increasingly grating as it ""evolves."" Simply miraculous. Though billed as ~video game evolution~, the evolution itself is rapidly toned down after the first five minutes, and then you are sucked into a horrible slog of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ generic RPG.Please, videogames, stop trying to be clever.P.S. thank you buun			"

												A great but somewhat short RPG for all the fans of the genre out there from all the different decades.So many nods to other RPG's that we all know and love on some level, some subtle, some not so much.Despite its short playabilty and lack of replay value, this title is worth a look, I wouldn't pick it up unless it was in a sale however.I personally 100% cleared all the game had to offer in 11 hours, if you play it more casually and don't go for every single unlock in the game it might be a few hours shorter.Despite this, its still a great game, I look forward to playing the next one when the time comes.

												You can buy an item that reduces loading times/screens. They thought that on top of slowly unlocking basic features and better graphics, it would be a good idea.Also the random encounter rate is obnoxiously high and you can't save on the world map, or maybe I didn't unlock that feature?Not worth the time.

												Evoland is awesome.  It starts off in monochrome, original Gameboy graphics and--through in-game actions--gradually becomes a 3D, high-def game with dynamic lighting.  There are homages to The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Super Mario Brothers, Dragon Quest, Diablo, even the Terry Pratchett ""Discworld"" series is given a nod.  This game is short, but it is fun and is very well done.  I recommend Evoland to anyone, but especially those who have lived through the evolution of video gaming and can appreciate seeing the technology's emulated evolution as you play.			"

												The price is low and so should your expectations be. The game is both short & misleading to some extent. By the looks of the teasers you get the expression that this game will take you through a journey through the evolution of gaming from the first console till current time tech. ""Well how bad could it be"" you might ask? Lets put it this way; You bought some chips, but you quickly realize theres nothing inside. Happy times.First of all. The whole evolution process happens within a blink of a moment. Some minutes of gameplay and you're already ""HD"". Your Chiwawa was sleeping on your bed, you went to grab some water and by the time you got back your dog is suddenly a St. Bernad.-Oh boy! What awaits you now that the whole point of the game has happend and you just started?-Compressed levels inspried by the early Legend of Zelda games, but it just doesnt feel right. Why? Because they tried making their own type LoZ. How did it go? Toilet!But it gets better! Suddenly you get to do turn based combat. Horray!.. Waite... Why is the only ability i have called attack..? Thats right! No abilities, only ""chop-chop"" becuase who likes variarity!?And so it goes for roughly two to three hours cause that's how long it takes to beat this game. You can add an additional hour or two if you wish to do a 100% run. Games are supposed to give you a good time & make the time fly. This game, on the other hand, tortures you while you're playing the game. Why should you buy this game?You get to (barely) play the game in classic/ old fashion style..You see some familiarity with other great games (Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy ect).A somewhat feeling of nostalgia.Why should you buy that bag of chips instead?You're not going to get what you think you're getting.Very Short game.There's no variarity in the game.The bag of chips does infact have chips inside of it.Do yourself a favour and buy yourself that bag with chips instead of investing here.

												This game isn't nearly as cute as it thinks it is.One of the devs must have wrote an exhaustive list of every cliche in video games, and then put every single one in a checkbox, to use once and then ignore. Pushbutton switches? Okay, walk over one and then never see one again. An enemy you defeat by bumping into a hole instead of attacking? Great, you've got it, moving on now...Evoland never does anything interesting with any of the mechanics it shows you; it just points out that they exist and then hurries you on to the next mini-achievement or lame fourth-wall-breaking gag. I suspect the developers do this because they realize the gimmick of the game runs thin fast, and they're just trying to get you through it mercifully quickly. Hopefully, they reason, you'll be too distracted by the next flashy graphical effect to realize the game is all smirking irreverence and no substance.This attitude reveals that the devs don't understand why the games they're aping are great. People didn't like Zelda becuase it had 8-bit graphics, a sword that you can cut bushes with, and  the ability to move from one tiny corridor and cramped room to the next. They liked it because the world was expansive and interesting, the combat was challenging but fair, there were actual puzzles where the solution wasn't immediately obvious (because, haha, the JOKE is that the solution is obvious, get it? Isn't this a fun way to spend your time? Haha!)Evoland isn't a good game, and it's not even a good homage to actually good games, because it merely mimicks the surface of classic gaming. This game is the kind of mass-produced soulless single-severing Nostalgia™ that you see on ThinkGeek or LootCrate. Don't support this.			"

												The first 30 minutes to an hour are great. Afterwards, you can put it down. It tries to have a story, which pathetically weak. In summary, bad stuff is apparantly happening, though it's hard to actually tell anything is wrong. A few hours in, you find the bad guy. You immediately go to another place where you face him, and the game is over. That's the plot. None of this is in the early part of the game, and that's fine. You're too busy getting frequent upgrades to the graphics, sound, gameplay, and the UI. Unfortunately, this means there are few left to find for the majority of the game. In one dungeon, you transition from top-down Zelda style gameplay to Diablo. This even includes equipment which do absolutely nothing to your character. Oh, and this system is completely gone after that dungeon. There's no real reason why. The final boss is fought back in the top-down Zelda style, but performs quite poorly. You're stuck with 3 hearts, no manner of pausing, and you can only use your sword instead of bombs or a bow. Those upgrades you found throughout the game? Can't use them for absolutely no reason. Not even a BS reason like dropping them. You just can't. The boss is simple, but inconsistent in movement. This is compounded with framerate issues that I didn't have until that fight. It's frustrating to have a small opening to attack, but the framerate jumped, so you broke a sprinting record. I loved the concept and was hooked from the start...until they made it clear that this 3 or so hour game was made by people with only 30 minutes of good ideas.			"

												Evoland is a frustrating experience. Many reviews already cover problems with Evoland's execution, but several problems that affected me include: Two types of collectibles, stars and cards. Understandably, there is no record of which stars you have collected, but there is no reason why there should not be a record of the cards you have collected, as they are used to play an in-game card game. Immensely high frequency random encounters. An extremely poor game design choice, the random encounters occur after no more than 5 seconds of walking in the overworld and take a long time to either fight or run from.Sub-par saving system. While it can be an important part of the design of a game when saves are allowed, Evoland does not seem to be a game that aims to punish you through lack of saves, yet it does. Namely, on one of the mid-game bosses you can die on the way back to town after his defeat, which is entirely possible if you simply try to run from fights on your way back to town due to the aforementioned high frequency encounters (as one may very well do, as the game is rather boring anyway). After dying on the way back to town you will find yourself having to repeat the boss battle. As the battle is one where you are scripted to die, you will try to just die as fast as possible until you find out that you actually had to make it rather far in the battle before you die or you get a game over screen instead of story progression. Frustration thereby abounds. Honestly, the save system is adequate enough in any location except this particular boss, but is aggravating enough on that boss to have warranted a large chunk of this write-up.Very possible to softlock your game. As happened to me, it's not difficult to land the airship you get for overworld transportation towards the end of the game (which finally bypasses the random encounters!) in an area where you can no longer get back into the ship. Not a deal breaker if it was only a luxury, but it is actually required to make it to the final boss. Ultimately, this game does do a bit of what it aimed in terms of telling a tale of the history of video games, at least in the RPG genre, but several major errors with design really make it an overall unpleasant experience. For those looking at Evoland for a 100% achievement game, it will likely not be the most fun you've had perfecting games, but you will find it managable in about five hours if you remember to keep track or remember the locations of the stars and cards you have collected.

												I cannot comprehend the fact that this game was sold ten euros/dollars.I'll explain ; to me, this game is very fun at first and is a good way to learn more about how video games evolved. It's also funny in some little references to other games or persons from the video game and internet culture. Though positive points about this game end here.First of all, as I said, the price ; for a game 3-4 hours long, ten euros is too much. For the same price you'll find games like Terraria on which you'll spend hundreds of hours. Spot the difference.Then, what shocked me the most is the complete lack of personnality of that game ; it looks like Shiro Games wanted to put as many references as possible, so much that there is nothing in this game who makes it stand out from others, apart from the obvious fact that you evolve across history (though it IS fun and kind of addicting at first, it quickly gets completely useless). The gameplay has nothing special (since it's just a copy and paste of other games, with all the actual interesting stuff gone), the characters are plain annoying, moving around is painfully slow, and... Good lord, can this game be more boring? In fact, it feels more like a very long tutorial then an actual game, and I think that's what makes it the exact contrary of fun. Past the very first zones, you quickly start thinking ""Hey, when's the true game gonna start?"", and all you get is a very synthetic and really bad version of good gameplays, which you don't even have time to enjoy.Apart from the failed gameplay, the thing that angried me the most is THE FINAL BOSS. As of now, this is the worst final boss I've ever seen, adding a huge difficulty spike right at the end for free and gratuitous rage. Three phases, all more and more horribly, ridiculously, horrendously annoying, for a disappointing end. After a game full of video game puns, you'd expect a little cutscene, something to make you feel AT LEAST like you've achieved something, even if it contains a terrible joke.. Too bad ; you get nothing but credits. Thanks for the effort.As a rating, I won't recommend this game. Or at least not when it's at full price ; it'll keep you from extreme boredom for a few hours. Though seriously, at the same price? Read a book. You'll have more fun than in this insipid game.			"

												Evoland's gimmick is a progression through different graphical and gameplay styles using the usual fantasy adventure and RPG tropes. As you progress through the game, you discover different graphical upgrades (from black and white to color, from 2D to 3D, etc.) and gameplay systems (now you have save points!). Different areas of the game feature different combat mechanics, from sword-swinging action to turn-based RPG battles to point-and-click ARPG encounters.Evoland is both a parody and homage at the same time, primarily riffing on the Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo (but there are nods to others). It's appreciation for the source material is obvious, but it's not afraid to poke fun at the tropes, either. Some of the humor didn't hit squarely for me, and produced more eye rolls than laughs, but it didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the game.The gameplay is neither long nor deep, but if you have an affinity for the source material it draws from, Evoland is an enjoyable way to spend a weekend.

												Let me start by saying this game is pretty excellent, though it has some design errors that are kinda exasperating.The game is awesome in doing what it wants, giving you nostalgia and making you remember the good old days of your childhood!The errors in design (like asking you to complete a collection of cards but showing you only X/23 instead of which cards you are missing or earning) are pretty hurtful. However the concept of this game is pure awesomeness.I personally, who would like to make my own videogames someday, enjoyed the mechanic of progression in game a lot.7.5/10 Has some flaws by trying to keep it simple but the concept is pretty awesome and its shortness allows you to not get frustrated that much by its flaws.

												A relatively short romp through a game full of various artistic styles and JRPG cliches, shamelessly taking wholesale from retro games. The game exchanges depth for breadth, choosing to give you lots of new systems to make up for no one system having a great deal of complexity. The game is short enough to where none of it wears on too long, and if you're an avid fan of JRPGs, you'll probably catch every tongue in cheek reference along the way. For some, it could wear thing, but it didn't for me, so I had a good time with it. Your mileage may vary. The game is fun enough, but the plot is thin and serves more as a parody of RPGs than a story in its own right.Was pleasantly surprised by one particular segment towards the end of the game that gave a dramatic shift in game style for the area, and was a great change of pace.Music direction was not great for me. It felt very repetitive and monotonous, and I found myself tiring of it very quickly. It, along with the simplistic combat, and the irritation of hitboxes in the ""zelda"" sections were my main flaws I found with the game.Would recommend on sale.			"

												Evoland is a walk down memory lane for anyone who has played a flurry of early adventure and rpg games. The game mimics styles of black and white, limited color, turn based battle, & real time battle games. It cycles you through these game types in an attempt to display a timeline of the evolution of these games. Through style or substance you may find Evoland ""winking at you"" and reminding you of past gaming experiences. Near the end of the game you may find yourself searching through the various evolutions of gameplay in order to achieve a higher completion level of the game.Evoland offers real time battles and turn based battles. The real time battles can be frustrating at times and the turn based battles seem lackluster in a game with so few items and so little to gain from turn based combat. The game is fairly short but can be adequately drawn out by collecting all the cards and stars. All in all Evoland offers a unique experience but may end up making you yearn for a more complete version of one of its styles of gameplay rather than the game itself as a whole.			"

												If you played through the gaming age so far, you'll more than likely like this game.  It's a mixture of Zelda new and old, and the entire Final Phantasy series.  Even a little bit of Ys.  Evoland includes a small bit of everything in the RPG series from NES to playstation 2.  It even includes a little bit of the hardware side in way of virtual hardware upgrades (ie. better graphics, better dvd drives, upgraded soundcards...)  Evoland is a overall decent game well worth a it's short play through time.Combat wise you start in a top down Zelda/Ys style gameplay, hacking and slashing mobs away.  You then transition into Final Fantasy style combat (turnbased with similar menus) and then into newer age Zelda gameplay.  It's very fluid in doing so as well.Graphics slowly upgrade throughout the game from simple 8 bit, to 16 bit, to 32 bit 2D, to 32 bit 2.5d (prerendered backdrops), and lastly to 32 bit full 3d.  It transitions fluidly and even lets you head back into previous areas to experience them in their updated new age qualities.The game is rather enjoyable, being someone who's played through the original games it's mimicking.  My younger sibling who hasn't played much any of them didn't enjoy it however.  No word on their review though.  However, being that I've enjoyed it, you can expect 3-5 hours of gameplay out of it, more if you want to get all the achievements and items.  If you've played the games it mimics, I highly recommend picking it up on sale, if not outright.			"

												Evoland is game about the history of action-adventure games, with a few RPG elements mixed in.The game starts as a simple, black and white, 8-bit adventure, but as you progress, you gain more elements such as music, color, 32-bit graphics, and overworld, turn-based-battles, and other elements of action-adventure games. This is by far my favorite part of the game, it's fun, humorous, and is reminiscent of early NES-SNES games. More things elements pile on, such as a partner, NPCs, shops, and currency. Eventually you gain the third dimension. However, that is when I feel the game takes the most risks, and also the experience starts to dampen. The first official dungeon in the third dimension is frustrating, the combat is slow and ineffective at some points, requiring you to run away, or face having to start over the dungeon. This is probably the most frustrating part of the game, but alas, you get to the boss. The boss is unexpectedly difficult for first-time players. Afterwards, you re-emerge in a new area of the overworld, with new enemies, and HD graphics. After this, the experience is still slowly dampening.. There is a small required side quest. If you bought an item called the ""Fast CD player"", this side-quest is much less time-wasting. Without it, the game creates fake loading screens that are nothing but unnecessary.  After this, you access two of my favorite areas of the game, an area where you use crystals to change from 2-D to 3-D, which works as a time puzzle. In this area you gain the bow, which is very useful here, but not anywhere else. Afterwards, we visit an area which both parodies Diablo and useless items in video games, such as an item that grants +300% damage to walls. Around here I should mention the humor. Evoland, is a very witty game. Making lots of jokes and some of its areas are parodies of other games.  I should also mention that whenever you gain an element, a small text box appears and says a short joke, or a relating commentary of some video games.The final boss is interesting; it uses mechanics of other games, and puts them into one boss. However, one flaw with this fight is your character's speed. At every other areas in the game, your speed is perfectly fine, but here, you sometimes make the fight too easy or too hard.There is one minigame, Double Twin, which I find to be great fun, it is a card game, requiring you to use the cards you have found all through the game. Double Twin has around 4 levels, which are all different in their own way, with the opponent using a different deck of cards every time.I feel lke $10 is a little much for a 4 hour game, but the creators did go for quality and humor for the entirety of Evoland. It is a fun game, I actually recently finished my second playthrough, which I felt was more of an achievement run. The game does have its flaws, but it also has its great moments. Evoland earns a 7/10. "

												This game takes you thru the history of video games. You start out with black and white visuals, no sound and only the ability to move right and left. Slowly it evolves through all the visuals, sounds and game plays over the years, that are seen in the so well know: Zelda, Mario, Dragon Quest, Diablo and Final Fantasy games.The early stages of the game look a lot like the old Zelda games. You start with a sword and have to hack thru bushes and monsters, all along the background music seems awfully familiar and gives a nostalgic feel. Ah those good old days and decent games, where have they been? WELL RIGHT HERE!!! Bundled in one amazing and special little game.As you play thru this game’s different game styles, you notice the small details that reference to oldies, for example: is the main character’s name by default Clink and wears a green outfit and has blond hair, does he start out as a kid and grows into an adult (might be Link’s younger brother). The currency that is used is gli... apposing the final fantasy currency gil.Along your journey you come across people in need who gladly join your team and fight the big bad monsters in some gloomy. There isn’t any deep storyline, besides the regular: girl needs help saving her village from an evildoer.If you like old-school rpg/adventure games this game will put a smile on your face. This game is a must-play!+Pros:- Reliving childhood memories of classic games.- Experience the evolution of graphics, battle system and sound in games.- Highly entertaining-Cons:- Not much of a storyline.- Simple combat system and exploration.- Can finish the game in a few hours.Score:7.9			"

												When it comes to humor, gaming humor is about as low-brow as it gets, as it consists on not so much jokes or satire as it is a vapid stream of obvious and shallow references. Evoland is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek love letter to classic jRPGs. Unfortunately, as a love-letter, is is a flaccid and unflattering presentation, and as a piece of gaming humor, it doesn't do much more than ape Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy 7 and Diablo.One of the defining points of this game is that as you play through it, you collect systems that slowly update the game's graphics and gameplay, giving the impression of the game evolving through the ages. Unfortunately, of all the systems they aped for the gameplay, this game somehow manages to make them less compelling than the original material. From the janky hitboxes for the top-down gameplay system, the overall lack of enemy variety, the annoyingly high encounter rate for the random turn-based battle encounters, to the Diablo-style loot that does absolutely nothing. (Which completely misses the mark because almost every loot item in this type of game adds something new to the play style.) In fact, when the world opened up near the end of the game, I was so daunted and irritated by the tedious and frequent random encounters that I would have put the game down for good if if weren't for the fact that I am literally one fight away from finishing the game. There are a couple of good things I could say about the gameplay, and it involves the dimensional swapping mechanic, and the action RPG bit of the final boss. (Which is still not as exciting or compelling as the boss fights from Ys Origins, and lacks the dungeon crawling action that is often associated with them.)The story is the weakest point of the game, which is ironic since it's supposed to be an RPG that is a love letter to RPG games of the past that had a lot of imaginative and epic stories. In fact, it is one of the most creatively bankrupt RPGs I have ever seen as far as stories go. It is very little more than copying the tropes set by classic RPGs of the past, and the fact that the title and the world is called Evoland should be indicative of this, and that isn't as bad as it gets, believe me.The only really good point about this game is that the music is really good. On their own, they would be really fun to listen to, and I really wish that the soundtrack was more varied than it was.So do I recommend this game? No. Even if it's on sale for less than a dollar, I cannot really recommend this game because it is not only priced more than it is worth, it is also very taxing on your patience as it does nothing with the premise that is compelling or less aggravating than it was in the old games, nor does it do anything fresh, inspiring or funny with the premise, story-wise. All it does is remind me how much I hate random encounters, and how I am glad that some modern jRPGs got rid of it for something that lets players initiate battles themselves.Save your time and money. Use it to buy and play the actual old-school RPGs like Ys, Titan Quest, Diablo, The Elder Scrolls, Half Minute Hero, The Carpe Fulgur Collection, or even Final Fantasy. They would be far more worth your time and money than this vapid piece of gaming junk.			"

												Really well made nostalgia trip for any jRPG fan, but not necessarily a good game on its own. Evoland takes you through the ""evolution"" of the genre with ideas and mechanics taken from titles such as Zelda, Final Fantasy, and even Diablo. It's really clever, original and quite accurate, as it shows not only how the games changed from the gameplay standpoint, but also on the audiovisual level.That said, on its own Evoland is not a great game. It's simple, linear, often tedious. About halfway through you unlock the ""final"" graphics style, but there's still a lot to do. At this point the game starts to drag on, as none of the combat systems is fleshed out, enemy variety is very small, levels are hard to navigate without a map, and the story is basic and straightforward.I'd still recommend it as a cute and funny experience. Any person familiar with some of the old-school RPGs will find a lot of references here. Plus, the game isn't long, so it may be worth getting during a sale.			"

												Evolution of JRPG from point of view of US is main concept of this game.The concept is very interesting, but this game failed to realization.Why did this game mix FF and Zelda? They are another species, it's like confusing with the dog and cat.Why did this game implement ""HD-UI"" before ""Pre-rendering graphics""?Why did this game start by monochrome graphics?  First zelda is colored.Why did this game take Diablo-style? ""Hack & Slash"" style like Diablo is not typical style of JRPG. If this game's purpose is follow all RPG, this game lose Ultima/Wizardry/Dungeon Master/Rogue/Might and Magic/And more.But, the above dissatisfaction is trivial.The biggest problem of this game is ""boring"".In FF-like part, ATB is very simple. You can win the enermy just to select 'Atack' and 'Heal'. (MP is no limit.) Strategy has been lacking this game. In addition it, In this game, frequency to encounter the enemy is very high!Zelda-like part is just deterioration version of zelda. I got flustrated by slow speed of walking. There is an excellent idea only one, that is ""switching 2D-3D"". But, that is very small part of this game.If you have strong nostalgia for JRPG, I wouldn't stop you to buy this game.But, you should be prepared to boring.			"

Seriously, they change the whole game, literally. Fun at first, but soon traps you in an endless loop of ""Where do I go?"", and ""This again?"".Collecting everything is a pain too, so I wouldn't recommend trying to do that on your first playthrough.The cards are a waste of time and the stars give me no motivation to try to collect 'em all.Short and kind of innovative, but after you upgrade to the 3D RPG, it falls flat.

												DISCLAIMER: This is a repost from my blog at www.stanislavcostiuc.com. I don't write reviews. I write opinion and impressions pieces, meaning the detalization may vary from just general feelings about a game to indepth critique of particular game mechanics. Read if you're interested to know if I like a game or not (and for what reasons), which parts intrigue me and which parts push me away, but don't expect in-depth description of all gameplay and systems. Thank you.From the very moment I pressed ‘New Game’, I fell in love with Evoland. It’s a game that integrates evolution of the action/adventure, RPG and JRPG genres in its mechanics, starting out with a GameBoy black and white Zelda-like experience and ending with a full-fledged 3D boss battle. It’s simply amazing. But.It doesn’t really hold up as a game that well. Ironic, isn’t it? It’s a great, and, most importantly, niche experience. If you’ve played video games for the past 15-20 years at the least, or you were/are interested in a lot of old games before your time, I think you’ll find this nostalgic trip quite enjoyable. I mean, come on, you get to buy an upgrade that removes CD loading times (that were indeed put on purpose) from the PlayStation era locations. How cool is that?But the game is very basic. It’s got mechanics from Zelda, Final Fantasy and Diablo, and they all, while present a solid foundation, don’t have much depth to them. There are clever moments, don’t get me wrong, and the part where you time travel between Old and New graphics has got to be the most enjoyable section of the game, but it doesn’t feel enough. The soundtrack is really cool though, and game-related humor is amazing.Still, this brings up an interesting question. Does a game need to have flawless mechanics that do not get old quickly to truly enjoy it? Perhaps that’s a topic that requires a more detailed discussion later. But at least in case of Evoland, I can honestly say – no. No it doesn’t. I loved every second of it.			"

Okay as RPG creator i can say the story was build randomly like: I think i try something and writte a old script down. But the story isn´t really the factor on this game.

												Evoland is terrible. Do not buy it. Do not support people that make such a terrible product for the sole purpose of cashing in on the retro game type. It does a disservice the fond memories I have of older RPG styles. Instead of taking the cherished concepts of older RPGs and enhancing them while learning from or smoothing out the more archaic contrivances of older games, Evoland takes those slight annoyances you feel while re-playing an older Legend of Zeldas or Final Fantasy and makes a game out of them. Go replay an older FInal Fantasy, Legend of Zelda, or Dragon Quest instead of buying Evoland. I recommend burning your money rather than buying this game.You will be a better person for not purchasing this game.			"

The game was really fun to complete, it had good graphic, an excellent history and some interesting characters.Cons: There may be an error called ""(null): TypeError: error#1006 (null):1368x768,"" which will be stuck on your screen until you restart the game.9.5/10			"

												While clever at times, it has its head stuck up its own ♥♥♥ when it comes to the jokes and tropes in RPGs and runs them into the ground. Enabling random encounters is one thing. Making them literally every 5-10 steps on the overworld is another. The turn-based combat is shallower than the first FF entries, and the adventure combat is a step down from LoZ: A Link to the Past. After two hours, I grew tired of it and have no intention of coming back.  "

												Welcome to Evoland! The story a boy who starts off in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2D evironments. But as he evolves, so does the world.First let me tell you what this game is:This game is for fans of Zelda and Final Fantasy type RPG's. It basically shows the evolution of RPG's, and how they start boring and 2D, to a great 3D environment. In this review I'll be giving the brief description, plot, creativity, graphics, sound, who's it good for, how enjoyable it is and the verdict. Each part of the review I will rate it out of 10 and then at the verdict, I'll give the overall score which will be an average.Description:Title: Evoland Rating: Not RatedPlatform: PCGenre: RPGPlot:Now like I said, this game shows the evolution of RPG's though still has a plot. You start of waking up and exploring the land. As this is the evolution of RPG's, this game starts off 2D and black and white. But that soon changes to colour, then 8 square movement, then soon 3D, and HD. I love the idea of that. Everytime you open the chest a new improvement happens to the game. But as you trek further into the game, you'll realise that some of these upgrades you were given, were given way too early. And by the end of the game there's barely any chests. The plot is about a boy who finds out that he is the key to saving the world of Evoland and treches through the small villages and the tricky dungeons. Thats all there really is about the plot. There is a little bit of twists and turns but not a lot to make me like the plot. What did make me keep playing was how every chest I opened I was excited to see what happened to the game. But as their are fewer chests later during the game its hard to keep playing.5/10Creativity:Well, this game is centered around the evolution of RPG games, as a video game! Hell, the game ain't perfect but this idea is EPIC!10/10Graphics:Yes, this game starts off with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics. buts its supposed to give ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics to tell you how RPG's were back then. But as you open more chests, the game turns more modern and just the same to the graphics. The graphics are pretty good though there are some frame rate drops.7/10Sound:I haven't played this game in a while, so I can't remember the music that much, but all RPG's are expected great music. Now this music is pretty good, but, (yes I know this is an indie game) compared to other RPG's, the music stands nowhere near.6/10Who would like this game?This game incorparates two of the most famous RPG styles. Adventure and turn-based. When I mean adventure I mean Zelda style. And when I mean turn-based I mean Final Fantasy style. Now this game incorporates both, (and a bit of puzzles too), to make a pretty good game. Though who is it good for? Well if you don't like RPG's then you'll hate this game. But if you like RPG's, definitely try this. Its nowhere near those great RPG games like Pokemon, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Skyrim. But you will be satisfyed, Definetely if you are curious on how RPG games evolved. But like I said, if you dont like RPG's, don't even consider this game.How enjoyable is this game?This game is best enjoyable at the start, definitely at the start, its so fun adventuring, waiting for the other chest and then the how screen just turns into something different. The end can get quite bland though as nothing new comes and it gets really boring. I have to admit, I haven't finished the final boss fight. I just can't be stuffed.5/10Verdict:Fans of RPG games will like this. There are some downfalls, but the start will suck you in and I hope that you do play it, even if you can't be stuffed playing the end.Plot: 5/10Creativity: 10/10Graphics: 7/10Sound: 6/10Enjoyability: 5/10OVERALL: Buy this game only if your sure you will like it (6.6/10) "

												Eeh, I dunno. I like the starting parts, but after the start of the game it quickly abandons its premise of being ""a journey through the history of action/adventure gaming"" and just becomes a straight parody of a few different games, most notably Final Fantasy 7.Also, ""it's a parody of JRPGs!"" does not excuse being a terrible JRPG with bad combat. Dragon Fantasy Book 1 for Vita needs to have heard that too.			"

												Sad to say, this is like lots of games you remember fondly, except not actually good.There are much better homages to retro games here on Steam. Things that do it better, or cross the old with the new. One I would recommend is ""A Pixel Story"", though the gameplay is 2D platforming rather than RPG.We also have such things as ""Virtual Console"" and PSN and GOG nowadays selling older games, and there even some oldies here on Steam; you're much better off hunting down actual downloads of these classic games and playing them for a while.

												Evoland is a great game that will take you back through time.You'll get a chance to revisit the evolution of adventure/rpg games and perhaps even meet some of your old friends along the way. The transitions and handling of the different styles of play is beautifully accomplished and the game does everything it intended to accomplish. The story is a little simple, but that's not why we are playing Evoland. We are playing it to experience our own experiences again. And if you're too young, then you'll get a chance to see what some of us suffered through in our willingness to enjoy a great story. The game handles almost everything well except for a few things.When movement is mostly free and open, the airship can only go up/down, left/right.When features have been unlocked, sometimes they don't work in previous areas: mini-map, hp-meterBut the most important issue that plagues this game, is the controller support. This game essentially requires it, but semi-hacks are required to get controllers working. This is not a good solution. I had to give the game and pad detection program admin rights in order for it to recognize my Logitech Gamepad. Similar stories abound in the Discussion forums.Aside from these issues, this game is fun to play, and going after the achievements is not the horrible grind it could be. The game actually helps you with the two hardest ones by giving you clues to the location of things you are missing. <3Hopefully the developers will get the gamepad nonsense sorted out before they release Evoland 2, but if you haven't played Evoland it is definitely worth it. 8/10 (Primarily because of gamepad issues & backwards compatible upgrades)P.S. I'm not sure why Steam thinks I've played it so little, it probably has something to do with giving Evoland admin rights. :/ Another issue. I've 100%ed the game but Steam thinks I have 5 mins on it.			"

												An incredibly interesting concept that ultimately flops on its face. Play your way through an evolving game world that begins as basic as an NES game and ends up as advanced as an NES game with the graphics of a playstation 1 game. Combat evolves from basic ""press A to slash your sword"" into final fantasy style turn based combat that that boils down to ""press A to slash your sword...on your turn"". The story offers no explanation as to the changing game landscape and playstyle and opts for a trope heavy ""evil wizard in a dark tower torturing the countryside"" plot that really adds nothing to keep you invested in playing the game. I had to muscle hard to pay attention through just a few hours of gameplay. It seems like the developers got so excited to run with their core idea of an evolving playstyle game that they ran right past the part of development where they make the game fun or interesting beyond the original idea. The only potentially redeeming quality is if you are an extremely nostalgic person who misses playing great NES, SNES and PS1 games and wants to tumble through those same types of games without having to worry about becoming emotionally invested in characters, environment, story, or even exciting or challenging gameplay. But if you wanted to do that then your time would really be better spent on playing one of those older games instead, cause this will leave you yawning instead of satisfied.			"

												It starts really promising and keeps getting better until about half-way into the game. The idea of the game is really good and for about 2 hours it works out great... and then the game just becomes utterly boring and tedious. The game is too short, parodies its originals badly and has absolutely no replay value at all.With a play time of 5-7 hours (which will include a fair amount of grinding) it's not worth 10$. If you have a chance to get it for cheap you might want to have a look for the gimmick that it offers, but it wears off quick and the 'leftovers' of this 'game' won't keep you entertained.			"

												Don't buy this game. It thinks that making the joke/referece over and over again is a good idea, instead of just pointing at it a little and be done with it. You even have to buy an item to reduce the loading times for quite a hefty sum of gold.Evoland has the problem that even when they use a tried and true formula, it's still really boring and while I was determined to finish the game, I bumped into a game-breaking bug and was never able to finish the game. The bug was initiated backtracking to the very beginning of the game after getting the Bomb if you still want to pay for this game. I strongly advise not to, if you want to relive the quirks of old games, just pop a ROM into an emulator, you'll get much more from that.			"

												For the first half hour to an hour this is pretty fun, as you constantly ""unlock"" new game mechanics and improvements, such as scrolling screens, various eras of sound and colour, turn-based battles and 3D environments. This all comes in a quick burst however, and you quickly stop discovering anything ""new"", leaving the remaining few hours of gameplay as a cheap Legend of Zelda clone with some Final Fantasy elements and a brief Diablo-like section.At points the game pokes fun at the early days of video games, mentioning the shallow plots and 8-bit music. However, this seems to be a cheap shot, as (even if intended) Evoland has awful plot and music, and even the sound effects that you ""unlock"" are pretty terrible. As for difficulty, even the game's ""completionist"" achievements, collecting stars and cards, are mindlessly easy which leaves a rather empty feeling of accomplishment upon finishing everything Evoland has to offer.If Evoland had continued on as its first hour does, and provided the promised journey through the history of early video games, there would be a bit of potential here and could even make for a quick, fun and interesting game. As it stands though, there's little here beyond the first section, and we're left with a rather boring and pointless offering. Shame that.			"

												If you are fan of games like Final Fantasy (Sakaguchi era), Legend of Zelda or Dragon Quest and you would like to take few hours and reminisce about these gaming gems Evoland is the game you want to play. Main essence of this game is unlocking various upgrades for the game itself. So instead of finding a treasure with new equipment you might find a new view perspective or resolution upgrade. Other than that Evoland is constantly switching it's gameplay mechanics between Zelda-like adventure and classic turn-based JRPG with a few minigames and puzzles here and there. Lore of the game is not so original yet interesting and fun. The story, characters and locations are all paying an ultimate homage to the Zelda and Final Fantasy (VI and VII) games and everything is presented in very genuine and entertaining way. If you haven't played any of those games I wouldn't recommend the game to you since the references are main source of amusement for players.Gameplay is very casual and the game takes between 4-6 hours to beat and complete so don't expect to get engulfed to the long story with evolving characters. This game is no way an RPG on it's own. But if you don't have the time to go through those old Japanese masterpieces again but you want to bring up some quick nostalgia - pick up Evoland.			"

												It's...not a good game. It would have worked better as a flash animation or Youtube video. It has some laughs. The transitions between the eras look good. The nostalgia factor is there. But its major failing is that it's the sort of game that thinks simply mentioning a trope and winking is enough.The hero's a Cloud/Link mash-up named Clink. He meets a healer girl named Kaerith (spoiler). The bad guy's named...Zephyroth? Something like that. You start off as a kid. You get a huge sword. You meet a guy with an airship named Sid. You end up in a village where everyone's afraid of some nearby environment that's begun to show signs of corruption. And the list goes on and on. It never does anything interesting with these tropes, or comments on the bygone era beyond, ""That was silly, eh?""Evoland features basic versions of turn-based, adventure and ARPG combat and lasts longer than it should. In the end, it feels like an exercise more than anything. As in, if it wasn't about 3 hours long, I would have quit an hour into it.Know what game's actually successful at what Evoland tries? Half-Minute Hero. That game actually manages to be a nostalgia trip and a very interesting and enjoyable new experience at the same time. Evoland's more of a slog.			"

												Though I like the concept of playing through the evolution of RPGs I cannot recommend this game.This game is grindy. And not the positive kind.

												Whilst the concept is promising, and the art is attractive, Evoland fails to be anything but a bland mess. It starts off with high hopes for itself, unlocking different technologies and gameplay mechanics, but never uses these in any significantly clever way. You unlock SNES-era graphics before fighting the first boss, and 3D immediately after, without exploring any of the pre-3D game eras in any depth, reducing the ""Evo"" part of Evoland to a lame gimmick.The game itself is a shallow parody of RPGs, where the only tactics you have during the Final Fantasy sections are ""Clink attacks, the girl heals"". There is no strategy involved, just pure grinding. Even when you get an attack spell for her, it's completely pointless, as healing will make you untouchable. The Zelda parts are better programmed, but suffer from a lot of technical issues, such as poor telegraphing of enemy attacks, camera angle issues, projectiles blending into background objects (such as fire over lava), poor telegraphing of trapdoors (that will instantly fall away when you are close to them, rather than at a distance where it is comfortable to react to them), and a lack of reach on your weapon, which barely covers one player length.In general, the camera is too tightly shot, making the player character huge in comparison to the screen, leaving the player to feel claustrophobic even in the most cyclopean vistas. The enemies have very poor attack patterns (the red wizards in particular, whose attack comes directly after they teleport with no antipatory action, and their teleporting away comes directly after that). The final fantasy sections have the random encounters ramped way up, and with no strategy for dealing with the enemies, it becomes boring and grindy almost as soon as you realise there's no way to defeat said enemies apart from bashing them with your sword.The Diablo area is a huge mess, using the Legend of Zelda mechanics to bitterly jab at Diablo's loot-centric and many-enemy mechanics. It is clear that the game designer doesn't like Diablo, and hasn't played for more than ten minutes. The only way to complete that area is to stay back and use the otherwise pointless combo attack, which locks you into attacking straight in front of you without invincibility frames. I would have liked to have seen a spinning attack, since the game cribs on Legend of Zelda in every other regard anyway.The final boss is a boring slog, again, too fast and not telegraphed enough for it to feel natural playing against it.The game had potential, but squandered it by not having any decent game mechanics, or a story that wasn't slapped together in five minutes to brainlessly parody Final Fantasy. If you watch the trailer you've practically got everything the game has to offer.Stay away from this non-game.			"

												This game has such a good idea going for it. And it really uses that idea effectively early on, but then it just gets dull.You start of with very minimal black and white graphics, and from then on you progress throughout mechanics and innovations in gaming over the years. It's really engaging and interesting! You slowly increase the graphics from 8bit to 32 and so on. You unlock these features through the opening of chests. And it's a really nice feeling when you stumble upon one, and get to see the big improvement. - It's really satisfying.But then about midway through it attemps to have a story and it's own unique gameplay. And it sucks. Suddenly, this nice fast paced game becomes a slow, repetitive, irratating snorefest. At one point you come into a cave - and your goal is to find a crystal to save your companion's village. (Honestly the second you get the companion ""feature"" is when this game goes downhill) So you go into this cave, and you unlock the random encounter feature (Think tall grass in Pokemon). And then every two F$%@ing steps you fight one of 3 boring monsters. It really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.Finally you get the crystal after an unnecessary amount of time. But it's not over. You travel to a dungeon.  Now your bombarded with ""uh oh you can't go in here. Go find the ""feature"" to be able to progress. (You have to, again, fight an unnessary amount of random encounter fights) unlock the passageway, then walk all the way back and fight all of the monsters ALL OVER AGAIN. And then do it again.Okay, good. Do it again.'esc' - Quit game - uninstall.Good idea, good start. Then almost unplayable about midway til' the end. "

												Short and fun game that takes you back to the origins of graphical RPGs, like you know them from the NES/SNES/PS1.The lovely graphics and the constant 'evolution' of the game (you evolve the game mechanics by findings chests) make for a great nostalgia trip. The game is long enough to have enough content, but short enough not to wear thin, which is a good think if you're short on time.Highly recommended.			"

Note: I got this game on sale for $2.50. At that price it is worth it. At full price? Not so sure.Evoland is a nice piece of nostalgia for anyone that played the old Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Dragon Quest games. And I'm talking way back, like starting with the originals in each series. There are references abound, making for some good fun. The gameplay is what you would expect from this genre, though very thin in depth. It feels more like a snapshot of the older games than an actual copy. A taste rather than a full meal.The game's ""evolution"" is a wonderful feature. Sadly, much of it happens way too fast and way too early. A pity. So much potential was lost because Evoland rushes to reach a certain level. And this game needed that potential added.As an old console RPGer, it was nice to take this trip down memory lane.			"

												To say that this game is simply a bad nastalgia joke is heartless. This game made me so happy to play. It has a wonderful concept and said concept was well done. Multiple battle modes have been seen thus far, as I am not very far in the game yet. The thing I beleieve would ruin the game is playing it straight through. That sets you up for failure with any game I think. So if you are someone who likes to beat games, rather than enjoy them, surely this is not a game for you. The game is wonderful in my opinion, and did a great job at making me smile with small nastalgic jokes in every nook and cranny. So its not final fantasy, or a hyper-in-depth rpg, but that is not what it is supposed to be anyways. The games target was hit on the dot in my opinion. If you are looking for a fun little game to play, this game is surely a good one. I absolutely recommend it!			"

												I have mixed but afterwards slightly positive feelings of Evoland.Initial concept of Evoland is interesting: you begin with very crude controls, graphics and game mechanics, to find and discover new, nicer ones along the way. This is the premise. The game play changes between Legend of Zelda like free roam fighting and associated (actually quite nice) puzzles involving arrows, bombs and ""time travelling"" mechanic, and Final Fantasy / Dragon Quest style game with frequent random battles. There's also a scenario where the game goes full Diablo for a short while.While initially entertained, I grew utterly bored after a short while into the game because of its low difficulty level and the lack of story. Granted, the latter is (albeit true-to-form) introduced only later into the game and built upon for a mediocre tale heavily inspired by Zelda / FF games. The boredom only wore off after meeting the villain for the first time. With the fast-travel by airship and an in-game guy assisting with finding of the collectables I was finally enjoying myself again. I could have sworn I had fully cleared several previously visited locations but instead found some nicely hidden puzzles.Lasting only few hours and providing mixed amounts entertainment, I'd advice getting it on a sale. You should also have played some of the early RPGs like mentioned in this review: Evoland contains loads of references you could appreciate but might find silly if uninformed.			"

												I love the concept of the game and how it highlights the evolution of the RPG genre; however the game itself isn't a very good RPG.  The game lacks the character growth you would expect in an RPG since your experience points really don't matter.  You pretty much switch between 3 gametypes (2d Zelda, Final Fantasy, Diablo) without your player progress continuing to the next sequence.  So for example if you battled and gained experience during the Final Fantasy segments it doesn't transfer when you play the Diablo segment.  This wouldn't be such a big deal; but the overworld portions have lots of random enemy encounters that feel tedious without the benefit of any real player progression. Overall though, if you have fond memories of NES through PSone era RPGs you may enjoy the game for the references alone.  I don't regret my time playing it, I just wish it wrapped a better game experience around the trip down memory lane.			"

												Evoland is based around gradually unlocking new or improved versions of technology and mechanics. If it sounds gimmicky, well, that's because it is.The reason the gimmick doesn't wear thin so fast is that the game's constantly shifting gameplay manages to keep itself fresh for a longer time. There are Zelda inspired levels, Final Fantasy, Diablo... This is, however, a double-edged sword: the game will often not develop certain mechanics enough, reducing them to button-mashing. Turn-based combat is the most egregious example of this.Overall, I can say I enjoyed the game quite a bit, and I'd recommend checking it out. I can see the points being made by ""No"" reviewers, though, they're definitely not wrong. Get Evoland on a sale if you want to be on the safe side.			"

												First and foremost, this is a very interesting concept for a game. You start out on a monochrome screen where you can only move in one direction, and slowly unlock more and more elements of the game such as sound, color, Mode-7, and eventually full 3D HD, as if you were traveling through the history of video gaming. The only thing it really misses is the text adventures, but I'm willing to overlook that.However, there are quite a few problems this game runs into. In its attempt to include as many elements of video games as possible, it has both hack-and-slash and turn-based RPG parts, and neither of them feel particularly polished - there are only very few attacks you can use in either of the situations. Similarly the game's story doesn't feel completely developed, and by the time you start to really get into it you're already at the final boss battle. In the RPG section, your characters never learned any new attacks through level up (at least to level 10, as far as I grinded up to) and there was no way to avoid random battles in the turn-based section of the world until the very end.However, I still enjoyed this game. I enjoyed watching the world getting built up around me, and there were some Easter eggs and moments in the story that I thought were at least somewhat good. If you enjoy playing video games from different eras, this game is definitely worth a look.			"

												Definitely a fun little game. While I myself would have prefered it to draw out the different time periods of gaming, and also for some of the play mechanics to be slightly more fleshed-out, it can't really be held against the game but so much. Evoland is not an epoch, it's exactly what it's meant to be: a nostalgic and fun trip down memory lane. I don't imagine the younger crowd will enjoy the journey as much, but any other older gamers who grew up playing games in the 8/16-bit era will certainly have fun strapping on the old nostalgia-goggles and remembering what games were like before all the fancy bells and whistles of today. A simple little game that accomplishes it's goal of being a fun and humorous romp through the RPG's that brought us to where we are today.			"

												Would recommend it to anyone who finds it interesting to look from trailer, it is pretty great fun and I think if you plan to get 100% it can take you about seven hours with minimal use of guides, but if I have to be blunt only get it if it's in sale, not at full price. I feel it's very flawed game, and if I paid about six pounds for it I'd feel disappointed. But for £1.74, I can't complain much.The problem is it does go to 3D too quickly - I'd love to see 2D sections more before moving onto 3D; and the battle encounters are way, way too high. It discourages me from exploring the areas that has battle encounters really and the ending is bit eeeeh.Otherwise, I did have fun with it, so it does the job nicely.

Took me close to 5 hrs to play through it and I enjoyed the nods to the classics and sense of nostalgia the game instills. The concept of gaining newer features and technology from 16-bit color schemes to 3D, turn based combat, and pre-rendered backgrounds is very fun, even if towards the end of the game this does pretty much stop in favor of ""go here to get this item"" and ""go here to fight this bad guy.""

Note: I got this game on sale for $2.50. At that price it is worth it. At full price? Not so sure.Evoland is a nice piece of nostalgia for anyone that played the old Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Dragon Quest games. And I'm talking way back, like starting with the originals in each series. There are references abound, making for some good fun. The gameplay is what you would expect from this genre, though very thin in depth. It feels more like a snapshot of the older games than an actual copy. A taste rather than a full meal.The game's ""evolution"" is a wonderful feature. Sadly, much of it happens way too fast and way too early. A pity.

												I love the concept of the game and how it highlights the evolution of the RPG genre; however the game itself isn't a very good RPG.  The game lacks the character growth you would expect in an RPG since your experience points really don't matter.  You pretty much switch between 3 gametypes (2d Zelda, Final Fantasy, Diablo) without your player progress continuing to the next sequence.  So for example if you battled and gained experience during the Final Fantasy segments it doesn't transfer when you play the Diablo segment.  This wouldn't be such a big deal; but the overworld portions have lots of random enemy encounters that feel tedious without the benefit of any real player progression. Overall though, if you have fond memories of NES through PSone era RPGs you may enjoy the game for the references alone.  I don't regret my time playing it, I just wish it wrapped a better game experience around the trip down memory lane.			"

												    One word describes Evoland... Nostalgia.  Evoland respectfully pokes at the evolution of the action/adventure rpg genre.  You start with top down monochrome 8 bit graphics only being able to move right, and you have to unlock new evolutions to the game i.e. the ability to move left or up and down or music.  Every time I unlocked a new dimension to the game (in one case literally unlocking three dimensional graphics) I laughed and my inner child cheered as I memories of games I grew up with came flooding back.  They pull heavily from Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Diablo, and even one liner nods to modern games like Skyrim.    My only real complaint with the game is the length.  You can easily beat it (including all of the ""secrets"" and extras) in a day.  But, that seems like a minor issue when you remember that the entire game was produced in just 48 hours.  I sincerely hope that they put out a more complete edition mostly because there are so many things still to satire.  I would love to see battle pets of a pokemon-esque nature and you never develop the abilty to jump or swim.  Still, all told I'm very happy with the what I got for only $10.			"

												If you look up the word ""tedious"" in a dictionary, you might find this game as its definition. Tedious. There's bactracking, and it's not even for miscellanous items. There are so many random encounters I have ever seen and not enough monster variety to even make it worth while, and the monsters just give EXP and money. Random encounters wouldn't even be necessary. Plot is very cliche and cookie-cutter. The only redeeming quality that Evoland has to offer is the evolution of graphics, sound and combat. It's like watching a Final Fantasy game slowly move up in the graphics and world rendering departments. The camera zoom feature could be removed. It literally makes the game an hour longer just from that short cutscene but it starts every time you open a chest.			"

Note: I got this game on sale for $2.50. At that price it is worth it. At full price? Not so sure.Evoland is a nice piece of nostalgia for anyone that played the old Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Dragon Quest games. And I'm talking way back, like starting with the originals in each series. There are references abound, making for some good fun. The gameplay is what you would expect from this genre, though very thin in depth. It feels more like a snapshot of the older games than an actual copy. A taste rather than a full meal.The game's ""evolution"" is a wonderful feature. Sadly, much of it happens way too fast and way too early. A pity. So much potential was lost because Evoland rushes to reach a certain level. And this game needed that potential added.As an old console RPGer, it was nice to take this trip down memory lane.			"

												Evoland is based around gradually unlocking new or improved versions of technology and mechanics. If it sounds gimmicky, well, that's because it is.The reason the gimmick doesn't wear thin so fast is that the game's constantly shifting gameplay manages to keep itself fresh for a longer time. There are Zelda inspired levels, Final Fantasy, Diablo... This is, however, a double-edged sword: the game will often not develop certain mechanics enough, reducing them to button-mashing. Turn-based combat is the most egregious example of this.Overall, I can say I enjoyed the game quite a bit, and I'd recommend checking it out. I can see the points being made by ""No"" reviewers, though, they're definitely not wrong. Get Evoland on a sale if you want to be on the safe side.			"

												This game is truly awesome! In the short time I've played so far, it has reminded me of old NES style RPG's, through the 16-bit era and on to full blown 3D. Covering Adventure and RPG style games, the game draws heavily from the Zelda series and the early Final Fantasy games. At certain points in the game, it plays out as a Zelda-like dungeon crawler/puzzle adventure game, and almost seamlessly transforms itself into an RPG with Active Time Battle systems!The artstyle is beautifully reminiscent of early 8-bit games, all the way through to late DS style Zelda Phantom Hourglass/Spirit Tracks animation, and the music evolves with the graphics.All in all, I'd say this is a must-buy for any Zelda or Final Fantasy fan(boy/girl).

												Would recommend it to anyone who finds it interesting to look from trailer, it is pretty great fun and I think if you plan to get 100% it can take you about seven hours with minimal use of guides, but if I have to be blunt only get it if it's in sale, not at full price. I feel it's very flawed game, and if I paid about six pounds for it I'd feel disappointed. But for £1.74, I can't complain much.The problem is it does go to 3D too quickly - I'd love to see 2D sections more before moving onto 3D; and the battle encounters are way, way too high. It discourages me from exploring the areas that has battle encounters really and the ending is bit eeeeh.Otherwise, I did have fun with it, so it does the job nicely. Just wait till it's cheap, then buy it.			"

												It's a short game but by god it is amazing! It brings back nostalgia from old consoles and old games and smashes them into one. It then brings forward present day graphics and adds that too it, when you find a new chest you have no idea what you will find next! Really good, I completed it in my first playthrough (2 hours) but I had only completed 87% of the game. I just did the main story but there are little secrets to be found out there :p It's worth the buy if you like Final fantasy or Legend of zelda as it has a resemblence to htem :)			"

												Best Game Ever, the Music was well done, I don't even know how they made that music. Graphics were well done too. But I dont like how clink was named after Cloud and Link. However, Kaeris was one sexy gal', she almost reminds me of Tony Bennett and Douglas Fargo, uh, nevermind, no more changing subjests. The Game has alot of humor though, and I like how it evolves through, but too many worthless items :P. 1 Downside: The game is too short and it desurves to be much longer, and their only 2 characters to play as :P. I also think it is a little Random how you suddenly appear in a grey area. :PBut none the less, great game. 5/5			"

												To say that this game is simply a bad nastalgia joke is heartless. This game made me so happy to play. It has a wonderful concept and said concept was well done. Multiple battle modes have been seen thus far, as I am not very far in the game yet. The thing I beleieve would ruin the game is playing it straight through. That sets you up for failure with any game I think. So if you are someone who likes to beat games, rather than enjoy them, surely this is not a game for you. The game is wonderful in my opinion, and did a great job at making me smile with small nastalgic jokes in every nook and cranny. So its not final fantasy, or a hyper-in-depth rpg, but that is not what it is supposed to be anyways. The games target was hit on the dot in my opinion. If you are looking for a fun little game to play, this game is surely a good one. I absolutely recommend it!			"

												Excellent game for what it's been made - showing the evolution of games!Highly recommended for people who's interested about history of rpg games and for those who's involved with game development. Also Legend of the Zelda and Final Fantasy fans.. go for it !Pros:++ Shows the evolution of games this genre.       (means you will experience various styles and differences in gameplay)++ Quick travel back to past.++ You can ""upgrade"" the game by playing.++ Puzzles are easy, but seeing the solution is hard in some places.++ References to other games are finally done in a nice way!++ You are mentioned in credits !Cons:-- 99% playthrough takes 6 hours, what is too short in my opinion - but is acceptable     when you understand the meaning of this game.-- Price is between ""instant must buy"" and ""expensive for this content"", so if this game is on sale you know what to do.Attention!There probably will be a part where you do not enjoy playing. My advice for that is to just play through that phase.Reward is waiting in the end. It's only 6 hour game anyway.			"

												Evoland is a game that reminisces about classic RPG and turn-based RPGs like Zelda and Final Fantasy. It is not a game trying to rip these ideas off, but rather take you back in time to look at the history of the two genres. It starts you off in a classic 8-bit setting, standard of the early Zelda games and works your way through to evolve into more current, cartoony 3D RPGs. And this aspect of the game works. What doesnt work is how short the game is, and how linear or unintuitive some design aspects are. I paid £1.74 for this game, and completed it, along with all achievements in 5 hours. For the sale price, I would say its worth it. But for its full price I would not. It was cheap fun and a nice tribute to days of old.			"

 I Mean, It Is a Love Letter to Old RPGs... So, I got around to finally playing this and I put it down for 3 months. I decided that I needed a review and here we ♥♥♥♥ing are. How is the game? Well, you already know by the fact that Steam tells you right away what my verdict is, but let's go through anyway and you can hear my 5 paragraphs of reasons why you should get this game. Sorry, you need to read anyway and this game will make you do it too.Remember the Gameboy? No? Then sucks to be you, but if you do remember, then you'll have a nice trip down memory lane as you start off the game with a green shaded screen and sweet 8-bit graphics as the game starts granting you rights to move up and down and opening chests.Yes, this game literally has to grant you rights to do stuff. As you progress through the game, you unlock features via opening chests and some features overwrite other features like: they took my ♥♥♥♥ing Turn based battle system from me! You ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s... I don't like clunky active battle systems... They will take the normal way of opening chests and make it like how Link opens chests in Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. This game even pays homage to Final Fantasy games for PS1 with rendered backgrounds, that's epically awesome. The game is linear however, the open world isn't open when you get into that and rather large open areas like in Final Fantasy 4 in the beginning of the game. I don't like linear in video games with the exception of the horror genre because being able to go anywhere in a horror game is like getting threatened to suffocate with a tight plastic bag over your head with holes poked in it. It just doesn't work.The graphics are everything in this. From 8-bit to full fledged 3D. Its amazing how this game changes graphics on the fly. The game probably looks its best when imitating 16-bit graphics because I think that's as polished as 2D RPGs get when it comes to graphics. I really liked that look and I still miss it. The game won't let you choose the graphics you want and will just force you to stick with one since you need them in some situations to progress. There is a puzzle that lets you switch graphics back and forth because you're ""traveling through time"" to get through certain areas. It's neat some of the things they do with the graphics.Sound is the same way. The music is very nostalgic to hear and definitely has inspiration from older games, again,  like Zelda games and Final Fantasy. I know I'm using those over and over as examples but its really the only way to describe it. They go from old to new sounding as usual. The music will evolve as you progress. Obviously, it being the name, ""Evoland"".This game is a one trip journey and has no replayability. Moving on.The game is extremely linear and it can be a fun trip down memory lane seeing how far RPGs and video games in general have come. Its a fun experience and if you can get it on sale, and you'll probably will, you cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, then I highly recommend it to RPG lovers new and old. The only problem is that the game lacks replayability and is only meant for one game play experience. I can't see it having multiple playthroughs. Just like the Tiger Electronic devices you get at cheap dollar stores, meant to be played once and never again, only Evoland isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												I want to love this game. Cleverly designed, thoughtfully presentation, this is a nearly anthropological presentation of the history of role playing adventure games that doesn't insult your intelligence. Unfortunately, the frequent 'evolution' of game mechicanics can leave the player puzzled about which of those recently applied mechanics apply to the present puzzle.Fortunately, this brain teasing is pleasurable, and consequences are forgiving. Technically this game is a marvel with frequent graphical mode changes. The music, forgettable, does suit the presented game styles, which are many and varied, though not always consistent with the material from which they are sourced.It may be a little much to ask for a casual player at full price, a bundle of both games would a great addition to any ARPG player's library. This is a great, fun, semi-educational experience, something any role player shouldn't miss.			"

Don't buy this game if you're expecting a 'game'.  Buy it if you wanna feel nostalgic or have a unique experience.  I can recommend this to people who've played or grew up with old school adventure games or to those who want to feel nostalgic or just see what games were like on the earlier hardware. Just be warned that this barely qualifies as a game & is much more like playing through an interactive documentary that jokes about older mechanics & hardware limitations as you progress.			"

												This game has a great concept, play from the oldest style of RPG games through to a much more modern RPG style. Treasure chests give you new RPG gaming features. Switch beween 2d and 3d to solve puzzles. If you have old gaming memories and still like the old games, then you will simply love this game. The game was a fun experience, especially at the start. But it is everything you love and everything that you hate about old RPGs. So expect to be frustrated! Personnaly, I always get lost in games and so the high frequency random encounters were totally irritating! As the RPG style is always changing the game constantly feels fresh and the graphics and music are constantly evolving and getting better. The story and characters are simple and forgetable but are enough to keep you playing to the end.It is not trying to be an epic RPG, it is just an enjoyable trip down memory lane.			"

												Hey Everyone this is my review about the game!This is a ""Evolution"" Action RPG game. (starts in 2D and goes higher in graphics)Interface/Settings/MenuYou can turn the Music and sound volume higher or OFF.  There is no slider but numbers.There are 3 languages, German, French or English.You can play this game with a xbox controller. But has no Rumble option.You can change the controls on the Xbox controller.The graphics are amazing! They changes and updates! From time to time.Music is very good too! With alot of Variety! (Bosses has boss music, villages has villages music etc)About the game.You have to see this as a game that starts off with a gameboy-pocket and will be updates until the PC versions with better graphics.There are chests in the game which are improving your gameplay! EACH TIME AGAIN.The game is super interesting.There is a decently good story line!A very short game. (I think it can be completed in like 2 hours).There are save stations and Inns to save the game!This is an action rpg game which evolves with upgrades and updates over-time.You start off 2D with not sound, But as you progress and collect you will find sound,music and graphical updates.Sadly there are collectables in the game! Stars and Cards!Fighting method and ways will be changing over time aswell. Like Press a button to attack or an actually an RPG style (which is turned based).You are able to change names on playable characters!Playable characters talk, EVEN THE MAIN CHARACTER.There are bosses, ""Quests"" and a level up system.Other Things.There are references from other games. Like Zelda or Mario.There are some items hidden in objects, Like potion in a barrel.Some Meme's.If you are going for all achievements, I do wish you good luck. As some is difficult and require alot of time.Sometimes you have to farm up, to buy good items. Which could slow you down.I have never seen a game like this before and i do recommend this. TOTALLY!I give this game a 10/10!			"

												Evoland is an interesting tour of retro gaming with an odd emphasis on some specific franchises.  I'd like to call the game quaint.  THe only issue I really had is that it doesn't work with my game controller, despite that it does support controllers.  It isnt's really difficult to control on the keyboard, but it does hamper the experience a little.			"

												I want to love this game. Cleverly designed, thoughtfully presentation, this is a nearly anthropological presentation of the history of role playing adventure games that doesn't insult your intelligence. Unfortunately, the frequent 'evolution' of game mechicanics can leave the player puzzled about which of those recently applied mechanics apply to the present puzzle.Fortunately, this brain teasing is pleasurable, and consequences are forgiving. Technically this game is a marvel with frequent graphical mode changes. The music, forgettable, does suit the presented game styles, which are many and varied, though not always consistent with the material from which they are sourced.It may be a little much to ask for a casual player at full price, a bundle of both games would a great addition to any ARPG player's library. This is a great, fun, semi-educational experience, something any role player shouldn't miss.			"

												A short RPG that mixes genres with a list of obvious insperations. It goes from Zelda style gameplay, to Final Fantasy, back to Zelda, to Diablo all while shifting graphical styles greatly. This game though is more about the experience than it is directly the gameplay. The gameplay is simple, you're not going to level and get wild skills nor are you going to find much in the way of equipment. It's about traveling through the different 'eras' of game technology and styles, Gameboy to SNES to modern PC. It's all netted together with a simple but enjoyable story. They do it with a lot of charm to boot.You'll go through forest areas, dungeons, towns, more dungeons, explore caves and all the cliche stuff. My one complaint is there's no run button so the game does drag a bit because of your movement speed. It's a fun romp that will last about an 1.5-3 hours depending on your urge to explore and collect stuff.			"

												To skip a lot of reading: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.I got it for about 5 bucks through the Humble Store, at about 2.7 hours in I'm already at the end of the game, the unlocks basically end about an hour and a half into the game, turning the game into a Final-Fantasy parody on the overworld, and a zelda parody for one dungeon, but then diablo on a different one, but all of the changes you make don't really matter in other zones... It's deceptive on the store page, it basically gives up on it's major draw and the rest of the game just turns into dumb references and jokes to other games... Not to spoil the twist but your other ""party member"" (In that she plays healer on the overworld BUT ONLY THE OVERWORLD and one dungeon where you have the option to play as her) is named Kaeris.... so take from that what you will...It's not offensive, but it's short, and gives up on a really fascinating idea in favor of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ references. DO NOT BUY.			"

												This is a very short game. I'd say not get it at full price, hell no. I got it at like $2 and it was well worth the time I had with it. I liked the game very much; it was basically a celebration of how far RPGs have come since the olden days. The inspirations and/or parodies of certain game series are blatantly obvious, even going so far as to a certain famous sword's look entirely.Bottom line, buy if you can get it cheap.

												Evoland is exactly what it advertises itself to be. It truly felt more like a tribute to the history of video games than a video game itself.The game is filled with (really not subtle) references to some popular RPGs or more precisely Zelda, Final Fantasy and Diablo.Because the way it's described you'd expect much more from this game but it's very short. Completing the game, collecting most of the stuff you find along the way, takes around 3 hours only.  It's divided into a few segments that explore different genres.It's honestly more about unlocking game elements than the game itself, which provides very little challenge and overly simple gameplay. That being said, unlocking stuff is pretty exciting and I was always looking forward to see what I would unlock next.The game is often clever, loves to poke fun at you and is pretty funny in general. Another game that is a really cool and clever experience without being all that much of a game by itself.11$ is a bit much for a game that you can finish in 3 hours, however. So I'd suggest getting this on sales, definitely worth a few bucks but nothing more.			"

												Evoland, A land of adventure! It sure is one and the ability to fit story in an ever changing eviroment is what makes this game great. It's terribly hard and it's not terribly easy. I haven't beaten the game yet as I write this review but I can say the concept is amazingly interesting and the minigames such as the Card game you can play versus npc's makes it feel less like a single player game and a lot more like your standard top down view mmorpg.(Somewhat Cons)I'm uncertain if the game will have much more costly items as you move along in the game but I felt asthough the loot you were given (Glis and Exp) was much too high as combat lasted up to 30 seconds versus normal encounters and 2 minutes againts bosses. When you add in your first combat partners ability to heal you and herself this gives you and unlimited supply of HP and the ability to simply farm for hundreds of thousands of ""Glis"" (The games currency) without any worry of dieing.(Somewhat Pros)The game gives you a very clear depiction on how games have evolved and managed to smoothly tell a story within that evolution and adabt to those changes as the game moves along while still making sense. And with minigames on the side the game never gets boring and the gameplay rarely gets repetitive as its constantly changing.What would I do differently with the game?I would of added note bubbles that tell you what controls do what as you move along as it took me 5 minutes to figure out how to leave the game. I'd also add in a map function like what many horror games have that will show you a map of the game or dungeon but will only show you area's that you have been in. It would make navigation throughout the world much easier.My opinion is based off of 1.7 hours of gameplay to which in those 1.7 hours I made it to the point in the game where we meet our first companion uncle for the first time. Those who have played will know what I mean by this. So yes talk my opinions litely as i have not unlocked the complete evolution of the game yet ad it is possible that what I recommend wil be unlocked by playing further into the game.I do recommend this game to those interested in experiencing a game that gives you a gameplay style from the first ever pokemon to the modern Diablo 3 Style games.

												This is kind of a weird review considering all the negative I am going to say about it, but I will also say why I recommend it.Pros:-Great refrences to other games.-Intriguing use of evolution of gameplay.-Some puzzles were actually more 'challenging' and fun then anticipated-Art style is beautiful.-Music is simple but fun.-Get to name a worthless character.-Final boss was actually fun and troll-ish.Cons:-I wish the between the different game styles, the damage you take will transfer over. For example, in the open worl combat if you lose 1 our of 3 hearts, then during the turn base battle system, you will have 1/3 of your health missing.-Random encounter was too much for me, but I do see how this is necessary due to small maps.-Mana. Need mana for them spells. Make the game atleast a bit more challenging/interisting.-Potions and Phoenix Downs were kind of pointless.-During the turn base, your character's speacial attacks were only available until the last moment of the game. It kind of teased you, then it just became pointless.-Overall, more fine-tuned turn base system (this can mean a lot of things, but I think you'll figure out as you play)-Needs to be more challenging, or atleast have a difficulty setting. I know that this game isn't suppose to be hardcore or anything, but still...the grinding was boring.-You can move diagonally (eventually), but can't shot an arrow or swing a sword diagonally.-SFX for stepping does not match character steps. Probably not the biggest concern, but it bugged the hell out of me.-Pause button.-Disperse stars and cards more-Little kid in village running in circles keeps pushing you if you're in his way. So while talking to the card game guy at certain spots, the little kid pushes you away. Pretty far for a runt. Makes me want to punch him!- For a game about the evolution of gaming, make more refrences to other game since that's one of the heavy details going for the game.I understand that I have more cons than pros, but hear me out why I recommend this game.Summary:       I would like to call this game more like a simple adventure than a game since I found no challenge in the gameplay or combat. However, this ""simple adventure"" does its purpose and illustrates the evolution of gaming. It's funny and had an appropriate art style. My favorite part was when the game went into a dungeon crawler. Overall, I would like to have seen more effort in fixing the small details listed in my con list to make this a more polished game.Recommended:       Buy this game when it's on sale since I find $9.99 a LITTLE too much money. $6.99 would be a better price.If you have anything to add to my 'Pros' and 'Cons' list, mention it in the comments and I will look them over then edit them into my review.Thanks!

It's full of parodies and inside references, and is superficially similar to DLC Quest, but very different. The boss fights are tough, but not too tough, just tough enough to be extremely rewarding to defeat. It's funny, but not overly silly, and I totally recommend it.			"

												Evoland is one of those games your really hesitant on clicking the purchase button, though i'm so glad I took the leap of faith. It's a great hidden gem! This game truly shows the journey role playing games have taken over time. The action is one of the main reasons why it can be called a gem. By creating alluring zones, enemies, and bosses with constantly shifting combat. The art is another factor of why this adventure is so entertaining. It changes along with the times while retaining it's own style. In my opinion replayability is why you really play a game, evoland practically defines the word replay! Don't go  buying it just yet because of course there are flaws.  Evoland has a fine story, but thats not really what it is about. The collosal fall of this game, the length. I have 6 hours on it and I have already got all the achievments. So it is short, it is sweet, it is worth the buy. 8/10			"

												This game showed me much of what has happened in the three decades of Video Game History. It was a mind blowing experience for me to go from Classic action-RPG of Zelda to a 3D RPG like Final Fantasy, Diablo, and some other popular titles under those titles. When I played through certain parts, There was an mini-game which remind me of Final Fantasy VIII and IX, which was a card game. The Combat even varys as you go on through the game, giving you different experiences all together.I will have to say, This game was inspiring. Inspiring to those who loved the older RPG classics, giving them an memory lane like trip with notable easter eggs from Final Fantasy, Zelda, and Diablo. Still I wish that it could include some Platformer elements or other game elements, so it felt like it spread out more than just the RPG titles, but throughout a part of gaming history. This game is still great, even without the additional stuff I mentioned above. It's a game worth looking into, allows you relive the RPG experience of the past 3 Decades or learn of those elements from those times. The game deserves an 8 out of 10 for the experience it gives out. I doubt anyone is gonna care for my review, but I wrote it anyway.			"

												If you find referential (and very obvious) jokes funny, then you will probably enjoy this game. Otherwise, it isn't really worth the time.After the initial 20 minutes, all the charm and mystery is gone. It just turns into a very, very dull game as you power through the unsatisfying and very clunky combat systems just to keep the barebones story going. The last 10-15 minutes pick up a bit, but by that time you will probably be fed up with the game already.Have to give props to the art and the music though, as those aspects are probably the best the game has to offer.This is one of those cases that might sound good on paper, but the actual result is a lot different and less interesting than the original idea. This may be explained by the fact that it all started as a 48-hour game jam project.			"

												If you've heard of Evoland, then you already know that it's designed to be a love letter to RPGs and action-adventure games, most notably the Legend of Zelda series and Final Fantasy series, but also Super Mario Bros., Dragon Quest, Diablo, and who knows what else. The beginning, where you get the different features, is very smartly implemented, and the game has a nice sense of humor. Once you get all of the different features about 40% of the way through the game, it slows down and loses all its novelty.The game itself at this point alternates between a bad Final Fantasy homage and a bad Legend of Zelda homage, as other Steam reviewers have pointed out. Combat and movement are stiff, the world is tiny, the encouter rate in the overworld is ridiculous, the random battles themselves are completely devoid of challenge or purpose, and some of the stars and cards are pretty difficult to find without help.On the plus side, again, it has a sense of humor, it's short enough to not overstay its welcome, and it features its own clone of FFVIII's Triple Triad. It's worth playing once, but you should absolutely not pay the full price for it.			"

												This game starts off really well, as the transition from the old 8-bit era to the 3D part is pretty cool. But this transition happens in a space of half an hour and the game turns for the worse after the game becomes 3D. After that it becomes a bad zelda and final fantasy clone.The turn-based strategy is way too easy, as your partner has a heal spell that is effective considering how little damage the enemies do. She doesn't do a whole lot of damage (except for x-crystal, but the hero can do just as well.), there is no limit on how many times you can use her spell and it heals both characters. At the moments when she isn't around, you have enough money to buy a bunch of potions to last you until your partner comes back. Because of this, the battles will get boring and mind-numming very quickly and you'll start running from battles just to get past them.The action-adventure gameplay isn't as bad, as some of the levels have intresting mechanics like shifting back and forth from 16-bit to 3D but these sections don't last as long and they don't get repeated. They should've stuck with these ideas as it could've added more puzzles and ways to get around them. Instead it focuses more on the combat, which is stiff to say the least.Overall, it takes a lot of ideas, some from other games and some entirely unique, and sticks it all together instead of getting a few ideas and expanding upon thoses to make the game feel like an exploration through the action/adventure genre rather than a game that took ideas from other games in hope of it working well. Combined the fact that the game is really short and that it's $10, this game isn't worth getting.			"

The evolution element is put together well and feels quite fluid and natural as the game progresses. The 8-bit music and different combat styles also brought back some memories of days gone by. The gameplay actually feels a lot like DLC Quest where you open new chests to unlock new graphics and abilities, the early ones being almost trivial. Beyond those aspects, the rest of the game is fairly boring and unoriginal, although it was worth one playthrough.			"

												Evoland, A land of adventure! It sure is one and the ability to fit story in an ever changing eviroment is what makes this game great. It's terribly hard and it's not terribly easy. I haven't beaten the game yet as I write this review but I can say the concept is amazingly interesting and the minigames such as the Card game you can play versus npc's makes it feel less like a single player game and a lot more like your standard top down view mmorpg.(Somewhat Cons)I'm uncertain if the game will have much more costly items as you move along in the game but I felt asthough the loot you were given (Glis and Exp) was much too high as combat lasted up to 30 seconds versus normal encounters and 2 minutes againts bosses. When you add in your first combat partners ability to heal you and herself this gives you and unlimited supply of HP and the ability to simply farm for hundreds of thousands of ""Glis"" (The games currency) without any worry of dieing.(Somewhat Pros)The game gives you a very clear depiction on how games have evolved and managed to smoothly tell a story within that evolution and adabt to those changes as the game moves along while still making sense. And with minigames on the side the game never gets boring and the gameplay rarely gets repetitive as its constantly changing.What would I do differently with the game?I would of added note bubbles that tell you what controls do what as you move along as it took me 5 minutes to figure out how to leave the game. I'd also add in a map function like what many horror games have that will show you a map of the game or dungeon but will only show you area's that you have been in. It would make navigation throughout the world much easier.My opinion is based off of 1.7 hours of gameplay to which in those 1.7 hours I made it to the point in the game where we meet our first companion uncle for the first time. Those who have played will know what I mean by this. So yes talk my opinions litely as i have not unlocked the complete evolution of the game yet ad it is possible that what I recommend wil be unlocked by playing further into the game.I do recommend this game to those interested in experiencing a game that gives you a gameplay style from the first ever pokemon to the modern Diablo 3 Style games.

												This game showed me much of what has happened in the three decades of Video Game History. It was a mind blowing experience for me to go from Classic action-RPG of Zelda to a 3D RPG like Final Fantasy, Diablo, and some other popular titles under those titles. When I played through certain parts, There was an mini-game which remind me of Final Fantasy VIII and IX, which was a card game. The Combat even varys as you go on through the game, giving you different experiences all together.I will have to say, This game was inspiring. Inspiring to those who loved the older RPG classics, giving them an memory lane like trip with notable easter eggs from Final Fantasy, Zelda, and Diablo. Still I wish that it could include some Platformer elements or other game elements, so it felt like it spread out more than just the RPG titles, but throughout a part of gaming history. This game is still great, even without the additional stuff I mentioned above. It's a game worth looking into, allows you relive the RPG experience of the past 3 Decades or learn of those elements from those times. The game deserves an 8 out of 10 for the experience it gives out. I doubt anyone is gonna care for my review, but I wrote it anyway.			"

												To be completely honest, I didn't expect much from Evoland. I got it during the Winter Sale, and thought it was going to be a straightforward RPG. To a certain extent, I was wrong.Evoland takes you through the history of the RPG genre: through Zelda, Pokemon, Diablo, and many more classics. While the gameplay itself isn't stellar, the parodying of RPG classics, along with a beatiful representation of the RPG timeline, definitely makes this game a worthwhile buy.It is rather short, and doesn't have much replayability. Furthermore, the game does get a bit ""grindy"" at times, a la Diablo. Nevertheless, it's worth it, as you explore a beautifully animated world, and changing the medium that you look at the world.I'm not trying to say this game provides Skyrim-depth plot, replayability, or graphics: but for 9.99, it's a great steal for several hours of fun! Definitely would recommend for a casual game.P.S. It says I only have 0.1 hours because of a Steam Offline Play glitch, I have about 6 or 7.			"

												Evoland is one of those games your really hesitant on clicking the purchase button, though i'm so glad I took the leap of faith. It's a great hidden gem! This game truly shows the journey role playing games have taken over time. The action is one of the main reasons why it can be called a gem. By creating alluring zones, enemies, and bosses with constantly shifting combat. The art is another factor of why this adventure is so entertaining. It changes along with the times while retaining it's own style. In my opinion replayability is why you really play a game, evoland practically defines the word replay! Don't go  buying it just yet because of course there are flaws.  Evoland has a fine story, but thats not really what it is about. The collosal fall of this game, the length. I have 6 hours on it and I have already got all the achievments. So it is short, it is sweet, it is worth the buy. 8/10			"

												If you find referential (and very obvious) jokes funny, then you will probably enjoy this game. Otherwise, it isn't really worth the time.After the initial 20 minutes, all the charm and mystery is gone. It just turns into a very, very dull game as you power through the unsatisfying and very clunky combat systems just to keep the barebones story going. The last 10-15 minutes pick up a bit, but by that time you will probably be fed up with the game already.Have to give props to the art and the music though, as those aspects are probably the best the game has to offer.This is one of those cases that might sound good on paper, but the actual result is a lot different and less interesting than the original idea. This may be explained by the fact that it all started as a 48-hour game jam project.			"

												Evoland is a game that I think pours with nostalgic feelings for most any veteran RPG player.  The evolution from early gaming, to 20 years down the road through unlocks and treasure hunting is a fine touch.  You will find yourself loving the early concepts of the gameplay and how they play out.  By games end you will have revisited many of your childhood memories through either visuals, gameplay, fights, or just hidden (or not so hidden) nods to Hall of Fame games of past. (Dragon quest, Final Fantasy, Diablo, Zelda etc.)  The game itself is not very long, 8 hours to fully beat with all collectables is where I clocked in, before letting the Fiance have her shot at it  Probably shorter if you feel like not exploring and just getting it over with.  There are 30 stars and 23 cards to collect and even a small card game to challenge yourself with, albeit for a very short while.All in all, I enjoyed just about every moment in game! I wish there was a run button, but thats just me being impatient.  I had fun finding all the hidden objects and easter eggs in game, and when it was over, I had a smile on my face.  Sometimes we just need a short, sweet game to conquer.  This one delivers on that in spades with that sweet ole' nostalga thrown right in the mix.			"

												Interesting ideas, poor execution.The idea of switching between modes, or ""generations"" in an action/RPG hybrid sounds very interesting, but instead, the developers of this game decided to aim for cheap ""homages"" and cutesy tongue-in-cheek references. For most of the game, Evoland isn't sure whether it wants to be a Zelda clone, a love letter to Final Fantasy 7, or a history lesson on RPGs. Like I said, some of the mechanics in the game are interesting, but ultimately it doesn't come together, and much like when I collected the 30 stars to get absolutely nothing, at the end of the game, I thought: ""Well, what was the point of that?"" The ingredients are all there, it feels familiar, but something's missing: fun.			"

The problem is its not really a fun zelda game (i do enjoy actual Zelda), the enemies aren't challenging or interesting, at best they're either frustrating or boring, and unfortunately, the zelda stage makes up probably the largest portion of the game, making it especially sad that its the least well done and impossible to skip.Non-Zelda parts of the game: A+Zelda parts of the game: D-			"

												So much waste of potential. Its an RPG that is literally half Legend of Zelda and half Final Fantasy only that everytime you find a Treasure Chest, you upgrade the game itself such as getting new graphics, NPCs, or improving the game mechanics. This is a brilliant idea with a lot of possiblities but they aren't explored at all. Because of that the game lacks any depth, complexity, or challenge. Although there is one part where you switch between 2D and 3D graphics to get past an area. I WANT THAT. I WANNA SEE MORE OF THAT. But the whole game is super charming with evolving from the past but the most it does with this idea is make other references to video games. Its also super short. Even with the extra stuff you can beat it within 4 hours. The evolution idea is fantasic but it is wasted on nothing more then what is trying to be a parody making the game average at best.

												Evoland is one of those games that tells you what to expect from the outset - and it does what it says it does on the tin. The graphics are suitable for the time periods of when each generation of the games it imitates are out and there's a lot of references to other games throughout the adventure. Even having not played it for several months now, I can recall references to Mario, Final Fantasy, Zelda, Diablo and others besides. The soundtrack is equally as engaging to the nostalgic senses in the brain and it feels like it enhances the experience that you get when you play through it.Unfortunately...it doesn't quite have much of it's own two feet beyond that. The gameplay is often an imitation of it's inspiration - and often a very limited experience of what it's imitating - and has far too much crossover for any one influence (or even it's own design) to actually cement itself as an overarching gameplay foundation. For those not floating on the nostalgic waves, this can make the game feel disjoined and maybe scattered in it's design, as if a clown was juggling too many balls to do the fancy tricks other RPG games can do to greater effect.There have also been some issues that I recall from my last experience of it (hence the 12 hours of playing) where I lost access to my airship through a world map issue and had to restart from the beginning to get full achievement completion. And where item collection doesn't become a habit of face-hugging every wall looking for that one invisible area where it might be hiding, the other time-waster is the puzzles. I will admit, the puzzles sometimes can be pretty challenging to work out and do require some measure of thought, but others bordered the line between tedium and simplistic and a few were essentially efforts to get from A to B taking as little damage as possible.For those who remember having their chunky white Game Boys in-hand in their teenage years or loved some of the original elements of Final Fantasy, this may be worth the few second-hand DVD's you'd get instead of this game simply on the nostalgic vibes it brings, but even then it may be better to just play the games this one imitates due to the imitation being the game's only strength - and not even that strong with very limited ability set to use. For everyone else, see what the reviewers are claiming this game reminds them of, read up on the games this one imitates, play those instead: You are more likely to get an immersive experience from those than this scripted love song to them.

												This was certainly better and longer than expected.In its core it is mostly Zelda and final fantasy gameplaywise, with short references into other games, thus this being part of what (admittedly small) length it has.  It uses those 2 rather well though, allthough the random encounters felt far too frequent. You unlock new graphics etc. by opening chests zeldastyle.To get 100% you will probably need a couple more hours without google, since the game is pretty good at hiding goodies or even entire areas and at locking them behind puzzles. Without any sidedestractions id say you will beat this in 3 hours at most though.There isnt a reason to go 100% other than the sense of achievement either, since the game isnt exactly keen on giving away cool stuff, which is also part of what bothered me: I beat your little mini cardgame with 10 cards, in every difficulty I dont WANT the other 13, I dont WANT another hidden star, i want some cool kind of equipment. The music is pretty decent sometimes but mostly just gets the job done. Perhaps I entirely missed so many hidden audial messages in the music, aside from the expected 8-bit to 16-bit etc switch, but in case I didnt I think it would have been decent to think of something there, since this tries to represent the evolution of games and boy did music evolve with it.Graphicwise it is pretty cool that they added quite a few layers between first and final graphics (with jabs at ""HD"" versions of stuff from the past that still looked like crap), but I still feel like they could have done more steps in between, and the final graphics look kind of ugly in my opinion as well. Going fruther than that would have also enabled more steps in between.The story is absolutely not worth mentioning, it wont be why you played this, same goes for character development etc.All together I love it though, it is full of hidden references, it copy pastes gameplay from the other games in ways that work well and I love the idea in general, very decent for a part 1 gonna play part 2 now and hope a lot of things improved. Is it worth 10 dollars though? Hmmm that depends on if ""well that was kinda fun"" as a result after 3 hours is worth 10 dollars to you. I guess most would say no and should wait on a sale			"

												6/10 - Evoland is a lot of fun for a short period of time.Evoland is a game perfectly described by its own name: As you progress through the game, you and the game itself evolve.  Starting in old NES The Legend of Zelda style, you go though a vary of stages until you get full controlls and 3D-Vision. The different stages, that kind of display the history of RPG gameplay and graphics, have a quite nostalgic effect. The only sideffect of that concept is, that it affects the players perception of the storyline: I cannot even quite recap what the story really was all about. Atmosphere, gameplay and graphics are continuously changing through the stages of the game and are always quite fitting. The playtime with about 5 hours (for 100% achievements) are a little bit weak in comparison to the price of 10€.Gameplay - 8/10Atmosphere - 8/10Storytelling - 3/10Graphics - 8/10Playtime - 4/10Total: 6/10 - Nice concept, worth a try!

												   An enjoyable gaming experience for anyone who grew with the early rpgs. This game is a great game for Redditors and fans of Family Guy as much like those things, this game brings almost nothing new and interesting to its format, and steals (relativiely poorly at that) all it's aspects from other games. Even a majority of the enemies are simply references to other games.    There are 3 games this game takes most of its gameplay mechanics directly from; Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo. This would be ok if this game blended these playstyles together well, unfortunateley this is not the case. Instead you really just find yourself playing 3 different games that are really not connected to one another. leveling up in the final fantasy gameplay has no bearing on how play in the other games. The same can be said about the loot you get from the Diablo scenario.  Overall if you like those games this game will be an enjoyable playthrough (especially since it's incredibly short), but the originality leaves something to be desired, and the flow of the game is entirely too chopped up. Well worth the sale price of 2$ but hardly worth a penny more.   A solid 6/10			"

												There was a lot of wasted potential with this game.  It was one of the first games to get put through greenlight.  I recall it mostly being like an exhibit in a museum on the evolution of the console JRPG.  Lots of Final Fantasy references and a very short Diablo-esque part.  I wanted it to be so much better because I thought it was quite charming initially.  They introduce a couple mechanics during the game for puzzle solving that were cool but you quickly move on never to use those mechanics again.			"

												A short game with an interesting concept. Seeing the game evolve from something very simple, into a 3D based game was pretty neat. Too bad everything else about it was very basic. The combat has pretty much no depth to it, and it feels very simple. The puzzles are all based on jokes usually. The boss fights are also nothing special. The random encounter rate is way too high and it feels like you get into one every few seconds. It takes around 3 hours to finish, but you can add another hour or 2 if you go for the couple sidequests it has.			"

												Starts out clever enough, tracing the early history of console RPGs at a fun clip as it introduces new mechanics and art styles at a fast clip. By around the 90-minute or two hour mark, though, it's more or less run out of gas and you're just playing a shallow, unoriginal RPG instead of a game with anything interesting to say about them. Save your time and pass on this one.			"

												I really want to like this game, but I just can't. I understand what they were going for. They borrowed from some of the greatest games ever made, however it still seems to fall short of the mark. The puzzles were too easy and somewhat monotonous. However, the boss fights were very good. Also, I have about 3 hours on the game and I have 85% done; it’s too short. The evolution part I feel they did very well. I really enjoyed playing in the different styles and the change in graphics was pretty cool. If I were to to rate this out of ten I would give it a six. If it’s on sale I’d recommend buying it, but not for the $10.99 asking price.			"

												The main idea of the game (2D/3D world transformations and upgrading graphics and the whole gameplay while playing) is the only positive thing that comes to mind. Well, some dialogs are not so bad. Problem is the world upgrades end very soon and 2D/3D focuses are too rare and similar. And other parts of the game (story, quests, fights) are too primitive and boring. Especially those JRPG-style fights - they are far too frequent and repetitive. Evoland greatly lacks content and at least a few more interesting ideas. Really sad to see such good idea lost in such mediocre game.------------------------------Ключевая идея игры (2D/3D-трансформации игрового мира и ""апгрейды"" графики и геймплея в целом по мере прохождения) - это единственный плюс, который приходит на ум. Ну, некоторые диалоги неплохи. Беда в том, что эти ""апгрейды"" быстро заканчиваются, а фокусы с 2D/3D слишком редки и однообразны. Остальные же элементы игры (сюжет, квесты, сражения) крайне примитивны и скучны. Особенно пресловутые схватки в стиле JRPG - они ну очень уж часты и шаблонны. Evoland катастрофически не хватает наполнения и ещё хотя бы пары интересных идей. Очень жаль видеть, как оригинальная идея совершенно пропала в такой посредственной игре.			"

												The game was developed during the 24th LUDUM DARE competition, and that's the problem: 48 hours to create a game concept, and anyone can see its limits. Kudos to Nicolas Cannasse for sure, but Evoland is still a really boring game with childish structure, that mocks 3 big series (Final Fantasy, Zelda and Diablo), without even scratch the surface of one of them.""What did you expect from a 48hrs game?"". Nothing good, if not a glimpse of something that could have been good, if they had more time.The idea of a treasure trove that Evolves an old GBA game to a nowadays game (sort of) is good. The rest... ALL the rest (game mechanics, levels, interface and interaction) is not. They're just ideas joined together with tape and glue. I understand is not easy putting together something fast and with so many layers of famous mechanics, but I'm not for half-done games and boring wannabes.My compliments for the winning, but as a whole, this game is to avoid. Sorry.			"

												Cannot recommend this game. Sadly. It definitely took some work and have some nice aestethics at times. Yet, what a complete blunder both as a game and as a tribute to games. Can't say it any more nicely.Now, let's start picking this game apart. It becomes obvious from the first minutes, that this game was made with sole purpose of referencing and tributing old Action-RPG games (from 8 bit up to Diablo 1, as far as I gathered). Now, that in itself isn't a bad idea and leaves some room for leniancy when judging it as a game. Still, you cannot do sloppy job here.1) First and foremost, I personally found references to be... dull? I get what they mean, I get what they are referencing, but realization is simply uninspired. Like ""hey, remember how good it was to actually have a heart healthbar in Zelda?"". Well... yeah, I guess. So what? And this ""so what?"" remains unanswered till the very end. This is not some complete and independent game, where ""tribute"" serves sole purpose of Easter Egg. You built this game around the very notion of tributes. You can't simply reference the games and leave it at that. Simple reference can't replace gameplay, it can't be entertaining on its own without YOU, as a developer, MAKING it entertaining. Make witty remarks, push old mechanic to absurdity, demonstrating how flawed it was (or maybe better than modern?). Take your cues from ""Bard's Tale"" made in 2005. It seriously lacked in gameplay, but still kept player invested, because it provided witty remarks non-stop. It didn't simply reference ""oh, in Diablo stuff drop from mobs"". It referenced ""hey, remember when you got your rare armor from wolf? Isn't it kinda funny how wolf actually carries something worthless to itself?"". It didn't simply reference, it scrutinized, studied, demonstrated how silly and funny those things that we accepted before were (and many still are!) about Action-RPG games. Not simple notebook containing notes about old, but a full fledged monologue from developers to player, through their game. Monologue which more often than not felt like dialogue.2) Very bland and primitive gameplay. Yes, I know, I stated above that in this case some leniency may be given. But not THAT much, as per my opinion. You reference random encounters from Final Fantasy and what not? Well, okay. But why, for the love of all that is living, are you making them so boring, so dumb, so mind numbingly NOT FUN. It is one of the most controversial points of jRPGs in itself, the boring grinding, 99% fights which don't require ANY input other than mashing single button. You didn't simply reference old games. You presented some elements in the abhorent and repulsive way. And then FORCED player to play in this framework. What the hell? You can't claim you're demonstrating how boring random encounters are when you force player through them for 1/2-3/4 of the game. It completely misses the point. Either do those mechanics in an entertaining manner or refrain from pushing them onto player for the majority of the game. Take your cues from ""Cthulhu saves the world"", made not too long ago by indie developer. Yes, they to reference a lot of jRPGs, mostly jRPGs. But they also bring to the table a very solid and intresting mechanic into random encounters. Moreover, they introduce ""random encounter limit"" for each location, when after certain number of battles you are no longer forced through those fights with those enemies. You still can farm using specific option in character menu and people don't feel punished for retracing their steps and checking every corner for secrets. This is what this game should've been about. You reference old games and present solid entertaining mechanics from them while you're at it. You cannot force down the throat mechanics, that are much worse than even those you reference in the first place. And we're talking about Final Fantasy, the mother of all ""boring and uninspiring"" random encounters, the epithomy of the problem both in days of old and modern age. Yet even in those games certain steps were taken to ensure at least some interest and diversity. When you introduced Babamut in your game, it was a point where you should've made him a ""one-button-win-them-all"" ability, which would allow to travel the world and wrap up the remaining secrets. Yet even there you introduced ~5 real minute timer. Real minute. For crying out loud... why this? What purpose does it serve? You consider that at that point ANYTHING from random encounters can actually pose a threat to player big enough that it will make fight not trivial? You're wrong, your random encounter mechanic is too flawed and too primitive from the beginning. You can't exactly make a challenging fight when your character can do only two things - hit or heal. Literally.3) While the rest of the references and mechanics aren't AS bad as those described in second point, they are too bland and uninspired most of the time. This game, while trying to reference many others, falls flat at each and every one of the attempts. It never begins to come close to NES Zelda in terms of combat, it never begins to come close to Diablo. Puzzles and trap sections are way too primitive and boring, so much that I actually couldn't remember any of the location and basic order of rooms right after leaving it. It was THAT boring. Yet there was intresting mechanic, with time changing. If only developers focused on this mechanic, made it more pronounced and built game around it. But no, it mostly serves secondary purpose in some of the puzzles. The rest is a mesh of ""hey, we tried to make X reference, but kinda stopped at the very beginning"". I understand, that it would be way too hard to make many good games inside one game. Don't. Make ONE good game and shift its mechanics slightly to represent your references. You'll be surprised how much being subtle and precise will enhance your points. Consider it an uncanny valley of sort, sometimes small changes are much more pronounced because you can compare it to almost same thing.In the end, I cannot recommend this to anyone. Two games I mentioned above, ""Bard's Tale"" and ""Cthulhu saves the world"" provide much bigger impact. And even without them this game is too bland to be both the reference book and an enjoyable game. I sincerely hope that developers will try their hand once again, but this time put much more effort in concept and basic mechanics.			"

												Evoland is a game with a good concept but terrible execution. In Evoland you go through the different ages of video games; from 2D to 3D, and even through different styles of games like Diablo, Zelda and Final Fantasy. It sounds pretty cool right? However I was very disappointed with the game. My biggest problem with Evoland is that everything is so simple. The games Evoland are referencing are fairly complex (like Zelda and Diablo) but since Evoland lacks depth these sections quickly lost their charm and became a massive grind. Relying on the occasional funny reference to keep you playing. The worst offender was the Final Fantasy section. This area has timed battles, but the the main character can only attack and heal which made these sections so frustrating to play. There's no summons, leveling up or any of the depth that FF has (you can't even heal OUTSIDE of battle). Depth is what makes Final Fantasy fun. Like think of the difference between a level 1 and level 50 character, now you're forced to play as the level 1 character for the entire game... yay?Next the story... it sucks. Early on it's fine since stories weren't a big focus back then... but it never improves. You only ever get 2 party members and by the FF section the story is still ""the bad guy is doing bad things, kill him"". I wish the story went completely wacky and over the top (as FF's are known to do) but it never puts in the effort to improve it. The game is also filled with unmemorable and bland characters which doesn't help.The rest of the game handles fine. The music's nice with some good tunes, the controls are smooth and the artstyle changes with the different eras of gaming (from 2D to full 3D models). For anyone wondering these changes happen after you find them in a chest.Evoland relies on nostalgia and witty remarks over good gameplay and story. You might find a funny reference, but at the end of the day the game is so shallow that it just feels like a waste of money. I finished it in two and a half hours and I would not recommened Evoland.			"

												Not even remotely worth the on sale price. This game is a very shallow send up of the 3rd through 5th generation of video games. There's barely a few hours of content here, all of which rellies on reference humor that dries up i nthe first hour or so. There are one or two good puzzles among a string of identical random encounters using a battle system with 0 depth.

												Claiming to be a parody of JRPGs as a whole, it is actually just a parody of Link to the Past and Final Fantasy VII. Though it's interesting to see the game evolve as you progress, the ""parody"" aspect gets old pretty quickly. After 30 minutes of gameplay you've pretty much seen everything this game has to offer. (Which isn't much)Bottom line, it uses humor as a crutch- but it isn't actually that funny. Even on sale, this game was a waste of money.			"

												I don't know how a game that is only 2 hours long can manage to so thoroughly overstay its welcome, but Evoland achieves it with such ease that even half way through I could barely stand it anymore. The game jumps often from mechanic to mechanic, each time executing its new mechanics even worse than it did the previous ones. Starting as a clunky, imprecise Zelda clone it swiftly shifts gears into a dull and grindy Final Fantasy Clone, switching back and fourth between the two for a couple dungeons before introducing the worst possible Diablo clone ever conceived. Finishing off, it moves to a side scrolling action sequence for the last boss. The boss itself is dull and predictable, but due to unresponsive controls, tiny hitboxes, and him having more health than god, the fight with only two phases, each only having a single attack pattern can draw out for 20 minutes.The game wouldn't even be so bad if it were at least moderately consistant between mechanics, but it basically throws everything away when you move to a new section. The bombs and arrows you get in the zelda sequence can't be used in the Final Fantasy section, so you end up just mashing attack and waiting for everything to die. The potions, healing spells and phoenix downs you get in the Final Fantasy section can't be used in the Zelda, Diablo or Final boss sections, something that even contradicts the ""plot"" of the game. All the ""power"" you obtain before the final boss, a power which is supposed to help you defeat him, goes completely unused because none of those abilities are available outside of the Final Fantasy sections.Evoland is a novel idea executed in the worst possible way.

												Evoland is a game with a neat concept that ends up being super mediocre. The idea of slowly expanding and evolving the world around you is really cool, but the world itself ends up being very bland.The combat is typical, boring, and repetitive. The game spends most of its time mocking gameplay tropes and parodying Final Fantasy VII. This wouldn't be so bad, but it really feels like there's no creativity at all in the end game.The beginning of Evoland plays a lot like Zelda, then it moves into Final Fantasy, and it throws some hack-and-slash nonsense at you.

There is alot of Final Fantasy and Zelda, and little hints of Super Mario Bros., among others. You start in black-and-white with no sound or frills, and gradually earn more modern luxuries in video games.

You have to muck with files to get it to work each and every single time you play. No thanks.-Storyline is super genericI got it on sale over at HumbleBundle. I don't regret it, but it is what it is.

 Evoland Evoland is a cute little game that takes you through the history of J-RPG games. Visual: 8/10 It is very difficult to review evolands graphics and art-style, as it changes multiple times...The game starts off with a simple colourless 8bit style, similar to the first pokémon games, but it quickly evolves and gains colour. Eventually the game turns 3d, and that's the end of it.The art style nails what it tries to do, which is replicating RPG games throughout the ages. I do think that it's good for what it is, but the need to replicate it makes the art-style boring. Sound 6/10 The music in Evoland is mediocre through the entire game. There aren't any memorable chiptune tracks in the earlier part of the game, or any epic battle songs in the later part of the game. Honestly I had to google the soundtrack and listen again while writing this to make sure that I wasn't talking out of my ♥♥♥♥. Gameplay: 7/10 The gameplay is slightly above average. There was hardly any depth to the gameplay since they had to shove so many different combat types in the game. They started off with a style similar to The Legend of Zelda (Yes, the first one!), then they moved over to a typical turn-based J-RPG style, similar to the older final fantasy games or the pokémon games. The second reason as to why there is no depth is that the game is so shockingly short. I beat the game over the course of approximately 3 hours and I played quite slowly and looked for secrets. Time/Money: 4/10 I beat the game over the course of 3 hours (as mentioned above.) and bought it for the full 9,99€. By using the witchcraft that is commonly known as simple division, I figured out that I spent approximately 3,33€. Keep in mind that I played the game slowly, so if you enjoy speeding through games, then your cash per hour will increase. If your not comfortable to pay 10€ for 2-4 hours of gameplay that is mediocre at best, then you probably shouldn't get this game.			"

												You, like I, may have been enticed by the short browser game came before this, however in this new edition they see to have forgotten what game they were actually trying to make. The entire game was initially based around the graphical evolution gimmick, and a very entertaining gimmick it is, but after the first 40 minutes or so the game just runs out of evolutions and stays where it is. What you are left with is a quite shallow experience with no worthwhile story, combat or exploration. Perhaps worth buying for the enjoyable start if it is significantly reduced in price, otherwise don't bother.			"

												One of the worst games I have ever played. There's so much to say about this game, that I would prefer to summarize:Take EVERY SINGLE bad, annoying, horrible, unbearable, inconsistent and awful aspect and feature from the jrpg games (but not only) of our childhood (and some more recent); and add ONE good idea (namely, the evolution of the rendering quality and gameplay as you go through the game), and you get Evoland.Note if you are the developer: sorry for the absolutely not constructive review, but I don't feel like I have any reason to put effort into a constructive review after having witnessed the astonishingly poor quality of that ""game"". Of course, if you would want to remunerate me to list all the bugs, annoyances, and other problems I have encountered in the game; I would probably accept, depending on the sum. And if such a thing would happen, expect it to take many days, if not weeks (yes, I, unlike the people who commited this atrocity, like to get my job done, and correctly).			"

												It's an interesting concept, but it feels like it runs out of ideas about 40 minutes in. The first 20 minutes will be the most memorable, since that's where the bulk of the technology upgrades happen, while the last hour or so will be an annoying attempt to work against the game to try and even beat it.While it's obviously drawing on the generic tropes of fantasy action and rpg games, I can't help but think that the story could have been more inspired, despite being generic. In the end, it's a game that began with a cool concept for a game jam, but might not have deserved a full game release without being fleshed out a bit more. I honestly recommend the demo more, since you won't get much more out of the full game.			"

												An extraordinary journey through the history of video games, you start as an 8-bit version and end on a 3D version of the game. Puzzles are fun but the turn based battles and the soundtrack starts to get annoying in some moments, but overall is an excellent game which ends before getting tiring and that is great.			"

												Evoland is a trip through some of the worst features of games past, and reminds you why developers have since moved on to better mechanics.  Here are a few of them that the game indulges:1. One-hit game overs - You're in this mode at the beginning of the game.  Add to it that you're on a grid and so are the randomly-moving enemies, and it's a recipe for disaster.  I died at least 3 or 4 times, starting the whole game over every time, before I could reach the first save point.2. Really annoying low-health sounds - I get it that we're supposed to be careful, but come on.  It sounds like the alarm clock from hell, and I had to actually shut off the sound when it came on.  Don't believe me?  Search for it on YouTube and listen for yourself.3. Backtracking - Notice that chest that seems impossible to get to?  That's right, if you want to get 100% completion, you're going to have to backtrack a LOT.  You only get certain skills later in the game, and will have to head back to earlier areas to use them to get all the collectables.  The game world isn't massive, but the random encounters will be fighting you every step of the way.4. Loading screens - Yeah, yeah, reading data from disks on the PS1 was a tad slow, I get it.  But don't give us artificial loading screens at every one of the four area transitions in a town, and especially not in a town with...5. Multi-layered fetch quests - We need bombs!  That guy probably has some! ""Well I used to, but not anymore.  Go talk to that gal.""  ...and you finally get the bombs FIVE PEOPLE (and even more loading screens) later.6. A lack of mid-boss checkpoints - Figure out the boss's first stage, only to get stomped flat on the second?  Too bad!  You get to fight the entire thing all over again.  (I normally wouldn't complain, but the second stage is essentially random and requires a lot more luck than skill.)While interesting at least in concept, it doesn't stand up in practice.  Aside from the interesting time travel puzzle and the surprisingly functional Diablo section, it's all incredibly boring and tedious.  You're much better off playing the games it borrows from (2D Zeldas, Final Fantasy VII, Diablo), than this mess.			"

												The last half of the game really ruins it. While its cool going threw all the different styles of RPGs it stops at Final Fantasy 7 for more than the last third of the game (which has you get into a random battle every 5 sec with the same 4-5 monsters). I enjoyed the first half of the game but its really sad to see the game pretty much run out of ideas without being able to finish their story.If the Developers ever add new free content that fixes or enhances the back end of the game it might be worth it but for now just save your money.

												A great game if you're a lover of the RPG genre. It is kind of short but very enjoyable and in my opinion worth its price. The story is kind of generic but you really get to enjoy the game through its references and changes among genres (from an old Zelda-style of gameplay, to a turn based RPG, to an action-rpg. And those gameplay changes make sense within the story!) Really enjoyable game for people interested in history of videogames as well as RPGs. 8/10.			"

												This charming game grabs a fistful of nostalgia and hits any gamer around during the early years straight in the face. At it's core it's a fairly simple game made up of popular mechanics that tells a tale we've already heard... but considering it's made of games we've already played, that makes sense, right? The Zelda-like dungeons were clever, although I'm a little annoyed by walk-through walls to hide collectibles.I thoroughly enjoyed the game, although I'm sad it was so short. My game time is only so high because I grabbed all the achievements; the story itself could be done in probably a 2 or 3 hour session the first time. I value games on average (more or less depending on reviews/hype) at $1 per hour of gameplay, and since I got this game on the summer sale it was very much worth it. I'd probably still recommend it at the full $10 price, but it doesn't hurt to slap it on a wishlist and wait for some sort of sale or discount. Much like a Zelda game, I'll probably not touch the game again for a few years and then randomly pick it back up to play through in an afternoon or two.I'd give this game a 7.5/10.			"

												This is a gem you wouldn't wanna miss. While others think that the concepts became switched up mid-game and misapplied, I feel as if it has a linear progression to it. The game starts off, with the very humble begginings of how video games started. Then, you must collect upgrades which takes you on a trip through video game history, showing milestones we have achieved through time with things such as; better graphics, different point-of-views, and combat systems. It heavily references to Zelda and Final Fantasy, calling for some fine nestalgia. For the price The game is more than worth it, especially if you like upgrade games with adventuring mechanics. It's just whatd you expect out of a $10 game, but with a tad more captivity. Sure, they could have implemented more to the rather short game, but I feel to them it was more than just a game, it also traversed you through the history of video games itself and to me, was a very fun experience.

												I don't recommend Evoland.I beat the game in 2-3 hours using an x360 controller. It is neat to start out with b&w 2d graphics and slowly watch them become better, but the feeling runs dry in the first hour. The game is completely linear and serves mostly as a tech demo for all the different puzzles, playstyles, and visuals that the many adventure games of the past have already done.Any type of major puzzle used to block progress that you can think of has probably been used. Burn down saplings so that they don't block your path when you teleport to the future (Oracle of Ages/Seasons.) Find the right path to walk across a room or you will fall through the floor (Link to the Past.) Bomb through cracked walls. Find all switches. Push blocks to make a path. And so on.Most combat is in 2d Zelda format, followed by turn-based, FF style battles, and some light ARPG style combat. Evoland is not unpleasant, but with no real story, it's not exactly memorable either.			"

												Evoland has really clunky controls and a poorly written story that feels hastily put together.  I beat this game and 100%'d the achievements in just over ten hours, then I uninstalled it, and I don't know if I'll ever play it again. But don't let that discourage you from making this purchase.Evoland is a wonderful trip through the history of video games.  Its a homage to the entire genre of Action/Adventure games.  Its full of quips and references to so many of the classic games centering around Zelda and Final Fantasy.  Two games I've never played, in fact I only caught a couple nods towards other games but have had friends point out many more to me.  I bought this game to enjoy a little trip down memory lane and experience what I thought was a fun way to appreciate the evolution of games.And that's exactly what this is.If you weren't around for the early days of gaming, then this game will give you that glimpse of a part of video games you've missed.  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute I spent in this game and will think fondly of it.  But it has little replay value, so I probably wont play it again.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't. To best describe it, it basically tries to pay homage to The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo for the most part. The only sections I found fun in the slightest were the boss of the sole Diablo section, and very small parts of the Zelda pieces. The Final Fantasy mechanics were not enjoyable at all. It has you spamming the Action button to select your main attack, and then repeat until all the enemies die. The random encounters are especially annoying because of this. There's also a lot of questionable design choices. For instance, when you die, you go to the main menu. Rather than just get a normal game over screen. The saving is left to odd save points that end up just costing you unnecessary time. There's a lot more that I don't want to type out, though.In addition, past the first few areas, the writing is god awful. It doesn't seem to follow proper grammar, and if it does, then it's doing an extremely poor job of writing in general. First few areas had funny text, but none past that.All in all a poor game. I wouldn't reccomend spending your time or money on it.To the dev: I hope your next game is a hell of a lot better than this.			"

												1.2 hours in: Enjoyed the quickly evolving graphics/playstyle as you run around. Hack and slash mechanics are fun, as are the turn based battles (makes me want to play some Final Fantasy games). I've gone through one dungeon and fought a boss. Wasn't difficult, more just figuring out the mechanics of the fight and doing the right thing at the right time. So far, enjoying the game and want to play more!2 hours in: I've finished the story up to the last boss. Let's be honest here, not an amazing story. The time travelling section was more tedious than creative or tricky. I plan to collect all of the hidden items in the game, but I think that may wait as I just don't really feel like playing more at the moment. But I do want to 100% the game. 6 hours in (I admit some of that time was spent afk with the game open): Just got 100% completion on the game. Was definitely tricky to find some of the hidden stars/cards, but once you figure out where you need to go, you can usually find the ones you missed the first time around (hint: wall hugging is a good idea). Some of the end game areas were rather tricky with the time travelling mechanic, so that was nice. The final boss was actually quite perfect. Took me a few tries to understand how it worked, but once I did, I was able to down him quite easily. Overall, I would say it's an enjoyable game. After the first hour, you've pretty much unlocked all of the visual and/or mechanic upgrades that you are going to get. That being said, I did enjoy playing through different game styles; it was definitely fun and brought back some great memories of other games. I don't think there is much replay-ability with this one. I would say the game is worth at least half price. Definitely enjoyable, but gets a bit repetitive after the first hour when you are going back and hunting treasures. I think I physically played the game maybe four hours, so I would recommend, but only if it's on a sale.			"

												It's good for what it sets out to accomplish but get it on sale... If you want to feel nostalgic and make fun of nearly every stereotype in the JRPG and Adventure game genre... this is the game for you.It's short, took me about 6 hours, used the collectable guides because some of the secrets were just a bit too much (invisible walls... hate those). Backtracking is pretty annoying in this game due to the random fights on the overworld so make sure you get everything on the first pass if possible.There's a card game parody of Triple Triad from Final Fantasy 8 but it's much more simplistic and it's called Double Twin... so if you enjoy card meta games, you'll enjoy that little inclusion.As for the con's it's a bit too simple, somewhat short and not overly challenging, just tricky in some parts. It also plays a bit too clunky for my liking which I didn't exactly enjoy... I was trying to use the D-Pad but I was forced to use the analog stick as it doesn't register the finer movements on the D-Pad. 7 / 10			"

												Evoland is a hilarious title brimming with nostalgia. The number of times it cracked a grin on my face or made me laugh was more than the number of dollars it cost... until it stopped evolving (which was maybe 90 minutes in). Then it was just ""crappy FF / Diablo / Zelda land"" with a hard emphasis on the crappy.The best hours of gameplay are the first 2, the game is pretty short (I did literally everything in 10.3 hours), and the fact that it took no effort to make its Final Fantasy random encounter battles at all interesting (which end up being a good chunk of the middle of the game) are some pretty big downsides.There are definitely some funny parts and some nostalgia pangs to be had. If you absolutely loved Final Fantasy 7 and old school Zeldas, and you find this on sale, you can probably expect to get your money's worth.You'll likely get 6-10 hours of gameplay, with no replayability except possibly to show a friend the first hour of it which is a very interesting look back into the history of game development.

												I would almost consider this game a tragedy if it were longer or had more effort put into it, because perhaps then it would inadvertantly be a failure instead of just a lazy piece of garbage. Its sole selling point is of course the gradual unlocking of basic game features meant to mimic the growth of genres over the decades. Unfortunately it gives up on this gimmick after surprisingly little gameplay, gameplay elements come up once or twice at best, only the Zelda-esque segments are at all fleshed out (and even then, you only get a grand total of 2 items and 4 significant mechanics... including those items), the writing is barely even worth calling a parody with so little effort put into it, and the game comes to a screeching halt after the second town. The jRPG side of things only ever features 3 spells/skills, no MP, and no strategy whatsoever. How this can be called an ""homage"" or an ""affectionate parody"" when the creators can't be bothered to achieve a tenth of the gameplay complexity of even the original Final Fantasy is beyond me.Oh, and when the selling points say ""Revisit the starting area rendered in full 3D or explore the overworld with your own airship!"" they only mean the very first dungeon-y area you start out in, not the first officially recognized dungeon, and not the first town. The game makers couldn't be bothered to render those in 3D. (And the world you get to ""explore"" on the airship is TINY.)With such a lack of content, coherency, consistency, features, affection, or even effort, the only favorable way I could describe this is ""a tech demo,"" and it is certainly not worth its full price of $9.99.

												Neat concept, but lacking in implimentation. Gameplay is pretty shallow, and while the references to game culture and RPGs of old is fun at first, it starts to wear thin really quick.A simple example is this. You open chests to unlock ""features"", for example, moving left or right, or up and down, to music, experience points and every other improvement, gameplay or graphical throughout the game. However, you eventually gain 3D graphics and a camera zoom in for when you open chests. When you reach this point you can only open chests from a specific side, and have to wait for both the player's animation and camera animation to stop to continue the game. This is after having chests that opened instantaniously and didn't pause player progression. This is just one example of how something wasn't throught out past the initial concept, and the game seems to be full of these. after about 45 minutes of play and two dungeons I was incredibly bored and felt like I had seen everything the game had to offer. Spending 6 hours to complete the game just didn't feel worth it at that point.Again, the concept is great, but it's all fluff with no substance it feels like.			"

If you've played this, you have officially experienced every different kind of RPG Imagineable. 2d, 3d, hd, sd, all sorts of viewpoints, fighting styles (real time and turnbased random encouters) lets not forget a built in Collectible Card Game. This is Legend of Zelda meets a different Legend of Zelda meets Final Fantasy meets Dungeon Crawlers. Not to mention the funny references to old and new video games alike (Zelda, Mario, etc...) I would have paid more than $10 for this if I knew it would be this good. And I never would have waited a week to try it either. BUY IT. SPREAD THE WORD.			"

												This charming game grabs a fistful of nostalgia and hits any gamer around during the early years straight in the face. At it's core it's a fairly simple game made up of popular mechanics that tells a tale we've already heard... but considering it's made of games we've already played, that makes sense, right? The Zelda-like dungeons were clever, although I'm a little annoyed by walk-through walls to hide collectibles.I thoroughly enjoyed the game, although I'm sad it was so short. My game time is only so high because I grabbed all the achievements; the story itself could be done in probably a 2 or 3 hour session the first time. I value games on average (more or less depending on reviews/hype) at $1 per hour of gameplay, and since I got this game on the summer sale it was very much worth it. I'd probably still recommend it at the full $10 price, but it doesn't hurt to slap it on a wishlist and wait for some sort of sale or discount. Much like a Zelda game, I'll probably not touch the game again for a few years and then randomly pick it back up to play through in an afternoon or two.I'd give this game a 7.5/10.			"

												This game is about the history of video games as told by a mashup of Zelda and Final Fantasy. Starting you off at the beginning of video games, and unlocking improvements to the game was very fun. However, there quickly got to be a plateau where it changed from fun to grinding, mainly when the Final Fantasy elements became the final stage. When I was getting frustrated by artificial load times and the game offered a grind-required option to disable the load times, I bailed. Pretty painful in its last third, which is why I'm not recommending it.			"

												As it turns out, the entire history of [action/adventure] video games can be summarised by mashing together Zelda and FF7. Literally that is all this game is. It starts out all interesting by going through the motions of evolving controls, graphics, sound and all that before just completely ripping off the two aforementioned with a very minor Torchlight-esque sectionette and Triple Triad card game (without even a catchy BGM to go with it). Also a nod to UT's announcer with text kill streaks popping up and a Minecraft item. Still, thats barely a handful of games.Granted, its quite impressive for a small indie team to pump out but it was perhaps too big an undertaking for them to utilise to its full potential. Its too quick to climax, forgets what it was doing and then just proceeds to end on a low. Much could have been done if it continued its tongue-in-cheek parodies while exploring other genres, even if it kept its Zelda/FF overworld, there could have been multiple dungeons covering them like it did with what it claimed to be Diablo but felt more like Torchlight.Like a firework; this game provides wonderful anticipation when lit and a grand display upon exploding but the only way to know its all over is when you hear the distant ""thunk"" of it hitting the ground in the distance. And even thats only two and a half hours worth of time. Bloody long-♥♥♥♥ firework, that.			"

												Evoland is a hilarious title brimming with nostalgia. The number of times it cracked a grin on my face or made me laugh was more than the number of dollars it cost... until it stopped evolving (which was maybe 90 minutes in). Then it was just ""crappy FF / Diablo / Zelda land"" with a hard emphasis on the crappy.The best hours of gameplay are the first 2, the game is pretty short (I did literally everything in 10.3 hours), and the fact that it took no effort to make its Final Fantasy random encounter battles at all interesting (which end up being a good chunk of the middle of the game) are some pretty big downsides.There are definitely some funny parts and some nostalgia pangs to be had. If you absolutely loved Final Fantasy 7 and old school Zeldas, and you find this on sale, you can probably expect to get your money's worth.You'll likely get 6-10 hours of gameplay, with no replayability except possibly to show a friend the first hour of it which is a very interesting look back into the history of game development.

												I would almost consider this game a tragedy if it were longer or had more effort put into it, because perhaps then it would inadvertantly be a failure instead of just a lazy piece of garbage. Its sole selling point is of course the gradual unlocking of basic game features meant to mimic the growth of genres over the decades. Unfortunately it gives up on this gimmick after surprisingly little gameplay, gameplay elements come up once or twice at best, only the Zelda-esque segments are at all fleshed out (and even then, you only get a grand total of 2 items and 4 significant mechanics... including those items), the writing is barely even worth calling a parody with so little effort put into it, and the game comes to a screeching halt after the second town. The jRPG side of things only ever features 3 spells/skills, no MP, and no strategy whatsoever. How this can be called an ""homage"" or an ""affectionate parody"" when the creators can't be bothered to achieve a tenth of the gameplay complexity of even the original Final Fantasy is beyond me.Oh, and when the selling points say ""Revisit the starting area rendered in full 3D or explore the overworld with your own airship!"" they only mean the very first dungeon-y area you start out in, not the first officially recognized dungeon, and not the first town. The game makers couldn't be bothered to render those in 3D. (And the world you get to ""explore"" on the airship is TINY.)With such a lack of content, coherency, consistency, features, affection, or even effort, the only favorable way I could describe this is ""a tech demo,"" and it is certainly not worth its full price of $9.99.

												If you're picking up this game for the nostalgia factor, I'll give you a word of advice: Don't.I don't care if it looks cool or something that may interest you, this is just a bad game.I will admit, the graphics are pretty good and the concept's enjoyable, it's just heavily flawed and priced at $10 which feels like $5 more than I would care to give it.You see, Evoland is a game ABOUT the nostalgia factor, it embraces the tropes of its forefathers and parodies it in a delightful (if not openly obvious) manner, the gameplay takes time to be varied to show the evolution of the Adventure RPG, and it even comes with a cute little card game which is genuinely interesting. But it's ABOUT the nostalgia factor, so rather than be a game that can stand on its own, it makes itself feel like every game it ""showcases,"" just not as fun. Its most unique feature is a point in the game where you can shift between the ""past"" and the ""future"" to make it through an area, which was enjoyable! But that's literally the only unique feature it has. The rest is a lackluster adventure that is blatantly inferior to every game it pays homage to.If there's one good thing Evoland does, it serves as an example when games choose to be retro, thinking that it would be simple, and put no thought into just what made it simple and fun. While it may be funny, that isn't enough to justify a four hour slog.			"

												Evoland is, definitively, the worst game I have ever played. It feels a rushed, half-♥♥♥♥♥ attempt to make use of a cool concept.A major fault of the game is simply in the amount of content; it says that it will take you through history of gaming. Yet the only thing it delivers on is having a couple of sections kinda like Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo.Is that all the gaming history there is? What about some point and click? what about real time strategy? The other problem is the quality of the limited amount of content. Throughout the 2-4 hours of the FF section of the game, you have literally 0-1 spells. And the amount of times you will randomly encounter enemies is absurd. You will sit there spamming left click as the repetitive battle animations play for the same 2-3 enemies in the game. The difficulty in this section is either stupid-hard because your survival is based on your luck not encountering a random enemy. OR stupid-easy because you have a spell that will heal you more then enemies can damage you, so you can just spam it and live through anything.The Diablo section has only 1 button. You spam it three times to do a slightly more powerful move. You do this for about an hour after which you leave this section. ...Yup that's it.The Zelda Section is probably the best it offers so alright puzzles and some actual non-receptive crap content. However this section is less then 1/3 of the game. Not to say this section is ""good"" just not as horrendous as the others.All in all, worst game I ever played. Literally painful to play. Buy yourself some ice-cream instead it offers more enjoyment.			"

												A loving parody. Evoland is unquestionably that. It conjures memories of the all-time greatest RPGs, like Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Diablo, and Dragonball Z.Yes, that is definitely all of them. No other RPGs have ever been significant.I can't help but gawk at the lack of content. This is supposed to be an homage to the history of RPGs? This feels like I paid for a tour of an art museum, and was shown three rooms before being thrown out onto the street. The laziness shows through at the seams. They didn't even bother arranging the small amount of content they had into a full map, instead clustering every location together and then filling three-quarters of the world with impassable mountains.The length of the story is also a disappointment. Part of the problem might be that it does the job of reminding you of other games too well, or at the least, too bluntly. Despite the fact that many great RPGs can be completed in a single sitting, this game fails to acknowledge those games at all, choosing instead to constantly reference series that create the expectation that both the storyline and the difficulty curve will be slowly, patiently built up. However, since this game is so short, that doesn't happen. The endgame remains pitifully easy, and the ""expected"" RPG scenes play out in quick succession without bothering to give you enough context to make anything matter.It doesn't even work as a parody. It's about on par with the ""Movie"" movies. References are not the same as jokes. The few actual jokes that could have been funny are skimmed over in favor of getting on to the next thing as quickly as possible. Don't buy this game as a gift for a friend. Buy it as a gift for an enemy. Then apologize.			"

												Evoland tugs at the player's nostalgia so hard that it forgets to accomplish anything else.  Referencing old game mechanics or design choices makes for a better wiki than an actual game.""Remember random encounters?"" Evoland asks.  I do, and I hated them less than when you implemented them. ""Remember when games like this were challenging?"" Evoland reminisces.  Again, yes.  But your game is not hard and it's not very fun.

												Great, great, GREAT concept. Fantastic art, decent music, decent gameplay. This game does not do anything that you haven't seen before... and still manages to be original.However, the game is a bit short (4 hours, 6 if you want full completion). It also suffers from a sometimes questionable level design, and a repetitive soundtrack. Finally, Evoland suffers from a pretty major pacing problem. Early on, you will keep on noting how clever the mechanics are, how cool the nods and references to videogames tropes feel, and how the world is evolving with you. However by mid-game, this sensation will be gone - not because you get used to it, but simply because the game stops throwing anything your way. It just becomes a barebone version of existing games, and by the end you may find yourself thinking you'd rather play the masterpieces Evoland references rather than Evoland itself.Evoland is a brilliant idea, and an absolutely cute game which loves to take advantage of your gamer instincts and reflexes. Sadly besides its concept, the game itself is a bit stale, if not repetitive. I didn't think I'd say this one day, but I wish the game held your hand more, because this is where the game shines. Evoland starts off strong, and ends rather weakly. The games has tones of potential, and for the prices, it is definitely worth getting a look at, but don't expect too much out of it.With all that said, I am extremely excited for the upcoming sequel. Evoland is a rough diamond and with enough polish, could be a BRILLIANT game. Wait and see...			"

While its cool going threw all the different styles of RPGs it stops at Final Fantasy 7 for more than the last third of the game (which has you get into a random battle every 5 sec with the same 4-5 monsters). I enjoyed the first half of the game but its really sad to see the game pretty much run out of ideas without being able to finish their story.If the Developers ever add new free content that fixes or enhances the back end of the game it might be worth it but for now just save your money.

												This game is awesome in my opinion. It sort of shows the history of games and evolution of gaming as a whole, but in its own interesting way. You start off in a Black and White 2D platformer, then 'upgrade' your game all the way to HD. It gives homage and a tip of the hat towards many gaming greats including Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy and even Skyrim! There's many, many refrences which probably alot I missed too! Anyway a fantastic game! I absolutely loved every single minute of it. Brought me lots of nostalgic feelings towards older games in the way it makes you grind for xp, levels, abilities and money. You need to search every corner of dungeons for loot and secrets and fight hard bosses until you learn their attack patterns and just roll them. My only problem with this game is that it is too short! Honestly you can finish the game in less than an hour. The only reason my playtime is 6 hours is because I went collecting everything and getting 100%. It's not worth the full price for that little gameplay. Try to get it on sale! :D			"

												The game presents the battle system of many rpg, like The legend of zelda, Diablo and Dragon warrior/Final Fantasy and  rich of easter egg from this game , for example the name of main character (Clink, Kaeris), that refers to Link (The Legend of Zelda) and Aeris/Aerith (Final Fantasy VII) or the name of the villain, Zephiros. Evoland relies on nostalgia, starting from the plot to the musicThis game is amazing for the retro-gamers and i like it.metascore 88/100			"

												A very cool jorney through RPG history with tons of references to tons of other games, also wit ha very cool soundtrack. Can't recommend this enough.BUT if you are a person who wants to complete it to 100%, keep in mind that the stars and cards sometimes are hidden in very very hard to find places, which can get frustrating after some time.

												Nice little game, really interesting and exciting at the beginning, then it gets a little repetitive after a few hours of gameplay when you get all the upgrades.I liked the story, even though it's a little short and simple.Lots of references and some funny parodies about some known games.Not too hard to beat the main story, the real challenge is to get all the collectibles.I would recommend the game if it's on sale, nice concept.

												It can be a little gimmicky at times, but it has enough depth to interest an RPG fan. The progression system is interesting, and it is fun to swap between genres and dimensions. However the soundtrack is easily my favorite part of the game.			"

												Evoland is the good kind of nostalgia. It made me warm and fuzzy inside to see the evolution of videogames in one game. i got to see things i had forgotten and things that where before my time. I highly recomend this game to anyone that just wants a nostalgia trip to remember all the tings we used to love and all the things we are glad is gone.			"

												Evoland has really clunky controls and a poorly written story that feels hastily put together.  I beat this game and 100%'d the achievements in just over ten hours, then I uninstalled it, and I don't know if I'll ever play it again. But don't let that discourage you from making this purchase.Evoland is a wonderful trip through the history of video games.  Its a homage to the entire genre of Action/Adventure games.  Its full of quips and references to so many of the classic games centering around Zelda and Final Fantasy.  Two games I've never played, in fact I only caught a couple nods towards other games but have had friends point out many more to me.  I bought this game to enjoy a little trip down memory lane and experience what I thought was a fun way to appreciate the evolution of games.And that's exactly what this is.If you weren't around for the early days of gaming, then this game will give you that glimpse of a part of video games you've missed.  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute I spent in this game and will think fondly of it.  But it has little replay value, so I probably wont play it again.			"

												I don't recommend Evoland.I beat the game in 2-3 hours using an x360 controller. It is neat to start out with b&w 2d graphics and slowly watch them become better, but the feeling runs dry in the first hour. The game is completely linear and serves mostly as a tech demo for all the different puzzles, playstyles, and visuals that the many adventure games of the past have already done.Any type of major puzzle used to block progress that you can think of has probably been used. Burn down saplings so that they don't block your path when you teleport to the future (Oracle of Ages/Seasons.) Find the right path to walk across a room or you will fall through the floor (Link to the Past.) Bomb through cracked walls. Find all switches. Push blocks to make a path. And so on.Most combat is in 2d Zelda format, followed by turn-based, FF style battles, and some light ARPG style combat. Evoland is not unpleasant, but with no real story, it's not exactly memorable either.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't. To best describe it, it basically tries to pay homage to The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo for the most part. The only sections I found fun in the slightest were the boss of the sole Diablo section, and very small parts of the Zelda pieces. The Final Fantasy mechanics were not enjoyable at all. It has you spamming the Action button to select your main attack, and then repeat until all the enemies die. The random encounters are especially annoying because of this. There's also a lot of questionable design choices. For instance, when you die, you go to the main menu. Rather than just get a normal game over screen. The saving is left to odd save points that end up just costing you unnecessary time. There's a lot more that I don't want to type out, though.In addition, past the first few areas, the writing is god awful. It doesn't seem to follow proper grammar, and if it does, then it's doing an extremely poor job of writing in general. First few areas had funny text, but none past that.All in all a poor game. I wouldn't reccomend spending your time or money on it.To the dev: I hope your next game is a hell of a lot better than this.			"

												This charming game grabs a fistful of nostalgia and hits any gamer around during the early years straight in the face. At it's core it's a fairly simple game made up of popular mechanics that tells a tale we've already heard... but considering it's made of games we've already played, that makes sense, right? The Zelda-like dungeons were clever, although I'm a little annoyed by walk-through walls to hide collectibles.I thoroughly enjoyed the game, although I'm sad it was so short. My game time is only so high because I grabbed all the achievements; the story itself could be done in probably a 2 or 3 hour session the first time. I value games on average (more or less depending on reviews/hype) at $1 per hour of gameplay, and since I got this game on the summer sale it was very much worth it. I'd probably still recommend it at the full $10 price, but it doesn't hurt to slap it on a wishlist and wait for some sort of sale or discount. Much like a Zelda game, I'll probably not touch the game again for a few years and then randomly pick it back up to play through in an afternoon or two.I'd give this game a 7.5/10.			"

												It's like DLC Quest only it's good.If you like the Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy series, you'll love this game. You start out in a monochrome 8-bit world with basic features. Once you progress throughout the game, you come across chests that give you more features. Eventually the game will be in 3D and have HD textures. I've played over an hour and I don't even think I'm a quarter of the way finished. The game has been really fun so far, and I can tell it'll get even more fun!			"

												1.2 hours in: Enjoyed the quickly evolving graphics/playstyle as you run around. Hack and slash mechanics are fun, as are the turn based battles (makes me want to play some Final Fantasy games). I've gone through one dungeon and fought a boss. Wasn't difficult, more just figuring out the mechanics of the fight and doing the right thing at the right time. So far, enjoying the game and want to play more!2 hours in: I've finished the story up to the last boss. Let's be honest here, not an amazing story. The time travelling section was more tedious than creative or tricky. I plan to collect all of the hidden items in the game, but I think that may wait as I just don't really feel like playing more at the moment. But I do want to 100% the game. 6 hours in (I admit some of that time was spent afk with the game open): Just got 100% completion on the game. Was definitely tricky to find some of the hidden stars/cards, but once you figure out where you need to go, you can usually find the ones you missed the first time around (hint: wall hugging is a good idea). Some of the end game areas were rather tricky with the time travelling mechanic, so that was nice. The final boss was actually quite perfect. Took me a few tries to understand how it worked, but once I did, I was able to down him quite easily. Overall, I would say it's an enjoyable game. After the first hour, you've pretty much unlocked all of the visual and/or mechanic upgrades that you are going to get. That being said, I did enjoy playing through different game styles; it was definitely fun and brought back some great memories of other games. I don't think there is much replay-ability with this one. I would say the game is worth at least half price. Definitely enjoyable, but gets a bit repetitive after the first hour when you are going back and hunting treasures. I think I physically played the game maybe four hours, so I would recommend, but only if it's on a sale.			"

Short ReviewThis game is a great exhibition of the evolution of gaming. From colorless 2D movement without the ability to access a menu to a full fledged 3D rpg, Evoland brings nostalgia in full force. The first game in the series is rather short. Evoland II improves upon the first in almost every way. Get both and enjoy every style of gaming past, present and future.ScoreVery Good- 8/10			"

												I want MORE!! I really hope the developers decide to do a sequel or at the very least make another ""nostolgic/retro"" evolution game, weather its another RPG game or an Action, shooter, stealth, platformer etc. etc. I love the overall humor and style the devs put into this game, they did an amazing job paying homage to the classics like ""Zelda"" ""Final Fantasy III-VIII"" and even ""Diablo"" while putting their own twist on things. Amazing little indie game that will make any oldschool RPG gamer very very happy!10/10			"
