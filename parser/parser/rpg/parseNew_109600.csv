												I liked this game up until about four to six months ago. The game was fun to play, had some intuitive controls, and had graphics that I've never seen in another MMO.However, it has turned into nothing but a money grab.The devs have made absolutely abismal design choices, and have made no indication that they're going to stop. The most recent is Module 6, which was chocked full of awful surprises. It raised he level cap, but in order to get to it you were stripped of your epic/legendary gear that you JUST obtained through the last module released four months prior. On top of this, the new maps that you have to play through to get there are a massive grind, made from minimally reworked content. Endgame content was made virtually impossible, and was filled with bugs.Back to the money grab though. Basically, what it comes down to, is that this game belongs to Cryptic Studios. They've made that abundantly clear. It doesn't belong to the players a single bit. ANY purchase you make belongs to them, and they have a right to change the parameters of that purchase at any time; for instance, the bags from the cash shop that WERE bound to your account were just changed to be bound to character on equip. Considering that your character, given they have an empty bag slot, will automatically put it on when you purchase it, this basically means that the bags are now bind-to-character-on-purchase.Why would they make such a change? What does it fix? Well, I have the answer for you: It sells their bags. Or so they think. With this ""patch,"" they released a bag with a few more slots on the cash shop.Mind you, this patch was added AFTER a new dev acknowledged all the problems with their pre-alpha-quality module, and said that he would ""work hard"" to ""fix the problems on hand."" His first action was to fix almost nothing that anyone had complaints about, and try to score Cryptic some more cash.This game is just too wildly inconsistant. Even purchases that I've made have been changed. I purchased the Bahamut Legacy pack off of the cash shop, because it came with a title, some costume weapons (or ""transmutes"" as they're called), and a companion. Up until recently, these weapons were reclaimable on any character multiple times, in case you wanted to get your free weapon change at any level. This is the case no longer. If you want your weapon to have the Bahamut style, you must now spend an excess of Astral Diamonds to transmute your new weapon into your old, crappy one.Cryptic is not about customer convenience. They are about THEIR convenience, and nothing else. Any and all of their ""convenience"" items are slowly being made as inconvenient as humanly possible, given they aren't already. I wouldn't be surprised if account-wide mounts were made to be purchased on each individual character in an upcoming patch.TL;DR, if you're going to spend your money on an MMO, don't spend it on a free one, and ESPECIALLY don't spend it on this one. I can't stress that enough. Any purchases you make will be nullified in some future patch. Go buy a subscription to WoW or something, it'll cost you less in the long run. And you can get all the mounts NWO ripped off of it for free with the full game.			"

												So I wanted to love this game, I really, really did.  In the end, I just can't recommend it in the current state.Pros -If you loved the forgotten realms books, and setting for DnD you will feel like you just walked in.  They really did a great job of capturing the essence of the world.The character leveling system is intuitive, and things are explained fairly, if briefly.The game isn't really Pay to Win in that you can if you try hard get everything a paying player could.The combat is fun, and diverse.  You can learn many different skills and slot the right ones for a situation, and make a build you play well.The playerbase is amazing, at times.  No one complains about kill stealing, most people I encountered were friendly and helpful, and I never once had problems finding a group to take on a quest.  As a soloer the part I really liked, no one whined when the group immediately disbanded after the quest it formed around was completed.The quests for getting to max level are interesting, diverse, and straightforward.  I very rarely was confused by anything laid before me, and found the game fun to play.  Until I hit max level.Cons -The servers lag like you wouldn't believe.  The amount of rubberbanding and failure to accept inputs is just ridiculous.  This really becomes painful in combat where the situation gets worse.  I played as a rogue, as a rogue you have very limited armor, and very good dodging ability.  A skilled player can dodge nearly any attack because of how the game shows them to you, well, you could if the game wasn't constantly lagging.  Half the time I would go through the dodge animation and take the damage anyways finding myself now out of position, and half dead because the server couldn't decide if I dodged in time, so decided I dodged, but too late.Remember that thing about 'technically not pay to win'? I'm about to take that back.  Admittedly, it is technically possible through the game to get a reasonable amount of Astral Diamonds, the currency of the player based economy, and exchange them for Zen, the currency you buy with real money.  This can be done all through the game.  The problem is they are undergoing a major AD revision trying to rebalance the economy.  This means that a new player just starting out will find getting any reasonable amount of AD together in a timely fashion nearly impossible.  Players haven't adapted to the new scarcity of AD yet, so all pricing is still way overinflated for what you get.  This problem may eventually sort itself out, but as of this review it has not.Max level is a horror show for a new player.  There's no good way to put this.  When you are leveling up from 1-70 your character 'fits' it's role.  If you're going for pure DPS you can put up some huge numbers, and work well in a team.  I've heard similar from clerics, support, and tanks.  You feel like you fit in a group right where you should.  From the time I hit level 30 I was constantly at the top of the damage charts for any given dungeon, usually #1, sometimes #2.  How it should be for a dedicated DPSer.  The second you hit 70 kiss your role goodbye.  You are now in the part of the game known as hell.  You don't have the gear to do well in any dungeon, or even any of the lvl 70 questing areas.  Some players won't want to drag you along, some will flat out insult you and leave you to rot.  You are expected to find a way, by hook or crook to get your item level up to a competitive level, and no one, and nothing in game is going to tell you how.  The game itself won't tell you item level matters, other players will.  But they can't really help you get it up, because they don't know how you can do so either.Those beautiful quests I mentioned that lead you straight up the levels until you're ready for end game content?  They run out just before you hit level 70, actually I started during a 2x experience event, and I ran out of quests at level 68.  I didn't want to put in the time to test, but I suspect without that advantage of 2x experience you might run out sooner.  It also has to be mentioned that the developers made one of the most bone-headed decisions I've ever seen.  They're trying to revamp all the end zone dungeons.  As a result, they removed all the old dungeons.  In and of itself this isn't a real problem.  It makes for less dungeons available as you grow, but you can manage.  Here's the big problem.  They left all of the quest lead-ins and references to events in place.  If you're following the quests along you will suddenly hit a 'party needed' quest that can never be completed because the zone for the quest no longer exists.  This all stems from a recent increase in the level cap.  They increased the level cap, but never changed the associated xp rewards to get you there, never changed the references to level requirements in tips, and never bothered to think of how that is going to impact new players.The 'crafting system' or what passes for one, professions, are a joke.  It is a tiered system of hire people to do things for you.  But the catch, always a catch, you can't directly hire the best guys.  They're items, you have to find them, or buy them.  I won't comment on how easy they are to find beyond saying in the time I played I only found 1 green level, and 1 blue level worker, both for professions I wasn't currently training.  I will say buying them is god awful expensive.  So why bother?  Gear is limited in choices in this game.  The best rings you can wear, you have to craft.  There's no getting around it that I was able to discover as the items bind to the character.  Same for the highest tier armors.That brings me to my next point.  You want to pass on that lovely sword you've been slicing kobolds with to a new character?  You want to maybe sell the old one to finance your new one?  Too bad.  You can't.  Once an item is equipped to a character it is permenantly bound to that character.  At which point you have three choices.  Equip it.  Unequip it. Sell it to a vendor for a handful of silver that is vastly less than the item is worth.  That's it.  Those are your options with anything you've ever used for even the shortest amount of time.  You can sell equipment you find, but only if you do not ever use it yourself.Everything FEELS like a cash grab.  I will not say this is intentional, I have no idea what the developers were thinking.  Everything from the way equipment works, to the way you feel underpowered the moment you hit max level, to the fact that your 'end game' healing potions heal for a fraction of your health and they sell an upgrade in the zen shop but no other way to get them.  The game feels like a cash grab.  Hell, even the servers being on their last legs, and barely able to take the strain of running the game makes it feel like they just want to make a buck and bail out quickly.I wanted to love this game.  I grew up with the forgotten realms books, I knew the setting and felt right at home.  I wanted to at least like this game.  But the truth is, this game is broken, back-loaded, and feels like an attempt to extract money from gamers.My recommendations are as follows: If you find the setting interesting, as I did, play until you hit level 70 and quit.  Do not under any circumstances give these people money.			"

												This was probably my favorite MMO for quite some time. I love the combat in the game, and it is still the standard for which I hold other MMO-type games too. The Cleric Class (my personal favorite) is probably some of the best I've seen in a game.But it's turned into a total cashgrab game.I've stopped playing for a while now, but all the events that I took part in during the last few months I played were something that you'd have to grind for the entirety of the event to even have a hope of getting a chance at some of the end-items. Of course, if you wanted to drop some cash on it you could increase your chances.They've got an incredbly great system in place for a lot of things, but the game got too greedy for me. Which is sad, considering how much fun I've had with it.EDIT: For izzy4020[ECDC]I most certainly did spend money on the game. I don't fault any game for trying to make money. It's when games try to make participating in the game cost money in a FTP game. It was getting to the point (when I stopped) that every event they had took a full weekend of grinding to get a decent prize. I can hear you say, ""Oh, you aren't entitled to things! It's free to play! You should enjoy whatever you get from it!""That's the issue. To me, it seemed like as the events grew harder to achieve, the more they started introducing ""bonuses"" to make the events easier. The events started having better loot once that started as well. I still ♥♥♥♥ing love the game, and want to go back to it at some point. But it got god damn greedy. I spent money on it in order to have some things made slightly easier (like traveling), but it just started to feel dirty to me. Of course, there were other things that drove me from the game (Faction Drama), but feeling like I had to pay money to participate in events was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to me. I still hold the mechanics of the game as the best MMO I've played. I plan on playing it again. I just want better for it..			"

												REVIEW EDIT: Installed it again, its even worse than it used be when i left.Nevermind my playtime, as i have played this game since early beta (back when healing aggro wasnt fixed and clerics were the tanks, the top players were farming Castle Never with 11k Gear Score, etc). I have +15 days of playtime on several characters, i own all classes at max level and  a least decently geared up, having tried several specs for most of them. I have played the hardest dungeons sucessfully since beta and mastered 3 of the many available classes (for PvE).Most reviews of this game are either very good or very bad, ill try to balance mine. If you dont feel like reading the entire review just read the end.Lets start with the pros:-Its a very fun game. Combat is easy to get, but fast and still challenging, while being adictive. Endgame bosses can and will 1 shot you if you screw up.-The classes are very different from each others, each one has its perks, and some of them are extremely fun to play.-The background lore is right on WoW level. -There's new content like, every 6 months.-Foundry quests, made by users for users.-Leveling doesnt take too long, but its not too quick either. Its just right on spot.-You dont have 4 bars of abilities like in wow for example, its much simpler. You have 2 spammable At wills spells (mouse buttons), 3 Encounter skills (Q,E,R) that usually have average cooldowns, and 2 dailies that require you to fill a bar to use.  All classes have a special effect on TAB button, and you have a key (usually 5,  6 or 7 on your keyboard) to use your primary artifact. However you have many skills to slot on those few spots, so your rotation and playstyle are very customizable. For example, on my CW (Control Mage), with my rotation, i could keep 100% uptime of CC on packs of mobs if i played it perfectly, while still dealing top damage.-The community isnt bad at all. Ive made some good friends, as most players are older than the average gamer.-You can get anything in the game without paying a cent. Just get ready for the massive grind.The Cons:-PvP is rly messed up. Some players went all out on P2W, and are packing the most ultimate enchants, which you will never get even close to, since 1 of them is worth more than the average player's account, and the best armor available. They'll steamroll you so hard that you wont even have time to bite the pillow. And some classes are just too strong.-PvE is pretty meh. The old dungeons are useless and empty due to the release of the latest +25man ""raid"", which consists on a zerg rush of people dealing damage. The drop chances for lower tier gear (from the older dungeons) are good, so basically you're being ""forced"" to do that zerg rush. Oh and i was unable to do that with my friends. Going in party wasnt working, it was random for everyone.-Too much currency. There are literally +50 types of currency or tokens you can use, and most of them are useless.-Cryptic doesnt listen to the community, and they are very incompetent. They enforce their changes even thou 95% of the people disagree with them. A dungeon was impossible to finish for like 2 weeks because the item used to enter the boss room was missing. Dunno why they didnt just disable it, instead it was running but you couldnt finish it. They usually fix something and break something else with each patch.-The game pulls so much out of the computer that i had to buy a new fan (mine got busted from working 24/7, and i had my graphics pretty low. I can play most games with medium or high definitions). Some players using high end machines get like 40 fps with low graphics. Too much bad coding, and on top of it, graphics arent even that good on high settings.-The healer role is basically disappearing. You can have your tank run a toggle skill called Knight's Valor. This allows him to take half the damage for the party, and since everyone else just stacks lifesteal....Instead, the DPS Clerics came into scene and became mainstream (in PvE and PvP) after being buffed pretty hard. LOL!-The Foundry. I know i listed this as a pro. But its also a con, since it demonstrates the lack of courage (or brains) of the team behind this game. They could easily give the players tools to make their own dungeons and bosses. It would set this game apart from the competition and put it on a whole new level. It would be the next level of mmo's. Instead they refused to do it, and repeatedly release new content full of grind, grind, grind until your eyes bleed.-The Carpal tunnel inducing mechanics and grind in this game are over 9000. Seriously.-The bots and exploits. There are bots everywhere. Cryptic isnt rly doing much about it, and when it does, it hurts the community. And some people exploited so hard they had hundreds of million astral diamonds (the most used in game currency), while the average player doesnt reach 200k. The most known exploit is laughable as it shows how bad the people programming this game are. This happened like a year ago and its known as Caturday (happened on saturday and everyone was walking around with cat pets, which are expensive). If you entered negative values while bidding on AH, you would get those many astral diamonds back. Everyone was doing it.I dont even have words for how amateurish this is. An intern would do better. I could do better and i havent programmed in 3 years. They rolled back the servers a day, but sincerely, the damage was done already, and not many people were banned or punished, they just kept rolling on their rich and packed accounts and ruined the economy of the game.In the end, this is a game that had a fantastic potential, and could have been the ""next"" mmo. But it was given to people that didnt had the ability to take it there, and honestly, its getting worse each expansion, with huge lack of imagination that results in endless daily grind, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs that are a reflection of their inability to put their ""duh"" ideias into practice.Its not a bad game at all, its fun and adictive, and easy to play but hard to master; but you will struggle to reach the real items without paying; the grind is insane and getting worse; and finally, the company behind the game sucks really bad, at almost every level. It wont be hard for you to find something else better to play within the genre.			"

												The devs took all the fun out of this game. They say it's free to play but it's not. It used to be. Now it's free to sample.   There is NO way to get good gear anymore unless you are ok with spending hundreds of dollars to get gear only to have it rendered almost useless with the next mod, I wouldn't bother...			"

Keep in mind:  THIS GAME HAS AVAILABLE SINCE APRIL, and was officially released in June.  It was released on Steam less than a week ago, hence the ""1.4 hours"", meaning 1.4 hours since less than a week ago (that's how steam hours work...)  I have quite a bit of experience with this game.Pros: FREE! Fun, varied combat and classes.  Lots to do, and the Foundry adds endless adventures.Cons: Extremely Pay to Win at higher levels, quests are linear, classes all fall into boring MMO standards, strays too far away from D&D (a Cleric that can't Turn Undead?  No Draw Upon Holy Might?  Common Cryptic...)My opinion: Avoid.  I had fun for the first couple dozen hours, but I soon felt the pressure from all sides to spend real money on ridiculous things, which usually doesn't bother me. But the bigger issue is that free players are at a MASSIVE disadvantage.  Fusing shards and runestones is a giant cash grab, considering a ""Greater Thunderhead Enchantment"" is nearly impossible to craft through the game unless you shell out roughly $160.  The worst part, it IS usable in PvP.  Other monetary attrocities include $40 mounts, $10 slot bags, $6 skill respec, and $35 hirelings.Conclusion: Try it out for yourself, it's ""free"".  The combat is fun and Foundry is great to explore.  Be warned though that this is just a semi-typical MMO with limitless pay restrictions at every turn. I felt that throughout my gameplay, there wasn't any part of the experience where the developers weren't trying to squeeze every last penny out of me.  And that, to me, isn't fun.  6/10NOTE: Steam says I've played for 1 hour, but this game has been officially released since June, and was in open beta for months prior.  I quit in September after leveling a Cleric and a Rogue._______________________________________________________________________________EDIT 12/8/13: I had no idea that my opinion of this game would receive this amount of attention.  I had no idea people would get so worked up, it's kinda funny watching people raging so hard at the opinions of one person.  Makes me think I made the right choice not to support this game  ^.^EDIT 12/9/13: Here's a brief explaination of one of the ""Pay2Win"" elements of the game, as requested by PredatorAncient:Players are given the option to add additional stats/effects to their equipment in Neverwinter. These come in the forms of Runestones (pets) and Enchantments (Armor/Weapon). For pets, the Runestones are split into Offense and Defense. For Enchantments, they are split into Offense, Utility, and Defense. A single Runestone/Enchantment provides different bonuses depending on which slot there are equipped to. These also have ranks and start from 1 and ends at 9. Four of the same kind may also fuse to move up a tier. The chance of success starts at 95% at rank 1 and 10% at rank 8. You will lose a single Runestone/Enchantment upon failure.There are two ways to circumvent failure: Preservation Ward and Coalescent Ward. Preservation Wards cost 10 cents each and prevent the loss of materials upon failure. They are also only consumed upon failure. Coalescent Wards cost 10 dollars and guarantees success of fusion. Small amounts of both of these wards may also be obtained on a weekly basis through Celestial Coins (the later being rarer). (link)[i.imgur.com] Now you may be wondering why there's a huge discrepancy between the two Wards. I was wondering for a while too until I stepped my foot into endgame and found out there was an entirely different type of Enchantments: The Armor/Weapon Enchantments.Armor/Weapon Enchantments are for specific slots in your weapon/chest and grant special effects. They come in shards and have a chance to drop from Epic Dungeon bosses. You must combine 4 shards to create a Lesser version of the Enchantment. However, the success chance of fusion is at a staggeringly low 1%.(link)[imgur.com] To compensate, they have very strong effects. An example would be the Thunderhead Enchantment. However, the real kicker here is that these ""Lesser"" versions may be fused again to gain a stronger version. Those may also be fused again to create the strongest version. Ultimately, the Greater Thunderhead Enchantment will have a 30% on crit to damage and stun foes. To create the strongest Enchantment possible, it will cost 160 dollars and 64 shards. Unlike companions, these can be used in PvP.			"

												Whenever you play a MMO published by a Chinese or Korean corporation, you can expect certain aspects of the game and payment model to be different. Neverwinter is no exception. This game happens to be run by a Chinese corporation called Perfect World Entertainment. It is their ""North American"" division of Perfect World.The big issues brought up by many North American and EU players is Pay2Win. Something that is rampant and very accepted and acceptable in Chinese, Korean, and SEA cultures among PC games. Neverwinter is an attempt to get away from some prevalent Pay2Win features otherwise present in their Chinese counter-parts and to a degree, has almost found an acceptable amount for NA players in their action games, such as Blacklight Retribution and Tourchlight. But these are exceptions to the rule, and these are not MMOs.Neverwinter does have Pay2Win aspects, make no mistakes. Without paying any cash, it will require a hardcore player months to be on equal footing compare to what a paying customer can achieve in a week or two if they take their time.These aren't the things I personally have an issue with the game though. Because, with the exception of the price of coalescent wards constantly on the rise, an item required to craft high level weapon and armor enchants, most things a player can attain in a few months play, if their okay with settling for rank 7 and 8, maybe rank 9 enchants, instead of rank 10s.The issue I have with PWE is that forum discussions about the game among players almost exclusively happens on their official forums, which are heavily censored. Not surprising coming from a corporation that formed in Beijing, outside of China's Special Economic Zone(SEZ), their quasi-capitalist zones. Even though these areas aren't officially ran as communist zones, their strongest political party remains the communist party, and many North American and EU peoples would be unable to differentiate between the two because their are so many similarities to a full on communist country.--To get a quick idea of internet censorship in china, check out the wikipedia of Internet Censorship in China.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_People's_Republic_of_ChinaHere is another link to a similar topic, a news.aky.com journalist story about Facebook having issues entering the Chinese scene because of internet censorship.http://news.sky.com/story/1206329/the-great-firewall-blocking-facebook-in-china--You don't have to read those links, they are just to give you an idea about why a corporation in a different culture might have different views of what's acceptable.--Discussions about Pay2Win, so that potential customers can decide whether they want to invest time into this game or not, are full censored on the official forums.Drop chances for dungeons are censored on the official forums, luckily these are large enough chances that they are generally well known, just don't post on the forums.Drop chances for lockboxes, which function as in-game gambling using Zen(cash) are fully censored and users can be banned from the forums for posting results of their findings. Users that have opened over a thousand lockboxes worth thousands of dollars, have been censored and banned for posting their results.Please individuals reading this, understand that when I say gambling, I mean wagering money for the chance of something of value, in this case, in game items. I actually saw a PWE forum moderator tell somebody that whether something is considered gambling or not is only determined by a court of law instead of the definition of the word and what the large majority of people understand it to be.It is believed among some individuals whom commonly open large amounts of lockboxes, that the chance to receive the rare item, which typically sale for between 300k-1m AD, which is equivalent to the price of 6-20 *keys, that the chance for an item fluctuates depending on a proprietary algorithm, and that a player's chance can be higher or lower depending on how long it has been since the last grouping of rare items were distributed from the boxes.Of course their is no way to know this, all we can know, is that it's over a 99.99% probability that a player has less than a 1% chance to receive $10+ item per box, which costs $1.25 to open. That it takes over $120.00 in keys purchased through PWE to average 1 of these $10+ items.One of the excuses moderators of the PWE forums use to delete such threads, is the claim that players present the data as factual drop chances while not knowing for sure because it's a proprietary system. Not only is this not true, because the players have only presented information as data representative of a sample, but is in actuality only used as an excuse to censor the information from the players. It is PWE forum policy to censor this information, they are the most strict regarding winning from their lockboxs.It's important to understand that this is a form of gambling that is not only unregulated, but is completely proprietary with chances and even results of other players kept secret. There is a reason this kind of secrecy isn't allowed in any gambling recognized by a regulatory body. It is for this reason it is unsurprising, that any discussion about winning rates be kept completely secret, and any discussion of Neverwinter's lockbox system being compared to gambling being a bannable offense. It is my belief that PWE, being a branch of a Chinese corporation, doesn't understand that this kind of censorship is unacceptable to North American and EU players. It is understandable that they don't understand this, but a corporation will have no idea that it is unacceptable to their customers unless we say so. The problem is they censored us!			"

												Run by HUGE BAIT AND SWITCH CorporationDecisions made with no consideration of player feedback, bugs do not get fixed.Enormous cash grab platform.   Love the game itself it's a shame that it's run with such an intent on the money grab.Any method a player finds to build some currency is systematically shutdown.   The latest change comes in the next patch removing the Astral Diamond generation from the Leadership profession.   Astral Diamonds are the main currency in the game that can be exchanged for ZEN which is the cash shop currency.   Leadership has provided a good way for the free to play mantra...  now the game has nothing going for it.   New players coming in fresh will need to spend a lot of real cash to be viable to play epic dungeons at end-game.... I came back around 12/2014 and STILL am not ready to play some of the end game content and I play daily.			"

												Pros:- graphics is good (when they're loaded properly on server), though not perfect even on Ultra- Combat is fast and fluid (better than TERA)- Story and Lore is just amazing - some NPCs are pretty funny- somewhat acceptable F2P model>>You can beat the game without spending a dime; all you need for sacrifice is time and a lot of Gear Score points.- challenging and difficult maps (good for end-game players)- good community (I love their Facebook page!)Cons:- skipped the DLC (HotN and GP are too expensive)- some quest items are even RNG-based- LAG EVERYWHERE- crap maintanence team. - Arc/Gateway website is buggy.- Frequent login issue- Server rubberbands like h377, making game unplayable.- sometimes buggy- feels P2W in PVP (those that paid for Slot enchantment/Weapon-Armor specials/Legendary gears have a high advantage due to high GS)- Poor guilds system. Was invited to a Guild after Mod 2's release and months later that Guild died. It's still there, but the GL abandoned the game, and rarely anyone but me logged in every day. - You actually have to buy some pack to play some exclusive race. And they're overly expensive. If you're going to play the upcoming XB1 version and you previously bought the DLC race packs, you have to buy it again. i.e Gold/Metal/regular Dragonborn, Wood/Moon Elf, or the MR Drow. - Some class are just unbalanced (CW, SW, and TRs are WAY TOO OP!!!) - Runestones/Enchantments/Weapon-Armor Specials feels P2W at high rank. The success gap between 5, 6, and 7 is just staggering. Also, Armor/Weapon Enchantments upgrades are always at 1% success PLUS ANOTHER ENCHANTMENT, forcing you to buy Coal Wards at $10 each. The Shards needed to forge an A/W Enchantment are rare to epic Dungeon drops. - the best looking/stats companions and mounts are usually in the Zen store, at a ridiculous high price ($30-$45). - Overall RNG is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The gloves/MH in Mod3 IWD and Mod4-5's Artifact Gear drops are the best examples. You grind for months and still not get a decent loot while the lucky ones do. I spent some Zen cash on lockboxes and was lucky to get an Owlbear Artifact belt (very decent one) for my GWF. Still grinding Mod5 quest, eLOL, and eSoT for the Legendary Artifact Sword (Golden Dragons series). - annoying chat. Everyday I login, a  handful of new Goldspammers, bots, Trade Frauds, and Fake Selling Accounts starts PMing me with scamming Broken English item sale crap... ON MY CHAT BAR!!!!! Used to take part of the [NW_Legit_Community] chat subscription group but now it's just full of elites talking about the latest stuff; the newbs and low-GS players have no idea what's going on. -UPDATED: new VIP bull****. I don't mind locked content like Moonmask Lounge only for paying elite players, but adding other things like Trap Injury Immune perk is the biggest ripoff I've ever seen.-Furthermore, gears are now P2W. you can find overpowered Epic gears straight from teh Zen Market cash shop which allows you to buy to get ahead. Absolutely dumb and nastily greedy.-Lots of useless things cluttering my inventory. There's several variants of the same item, such as a normal unbounded Superior Potion of Healing, a Bound to Character SPoH, and Bound to Account SPoH! WTH?! are you forcing me to spend real cash on inventory spaces? I did the latest Scrying Orbs quest to unlock another free Emboldered Bag of holding, yet I'm still running out of space. Some of these items I get are unsellable, and I can't discard them!VERDICT: STILL A NO. these guys never learn their lesson on how to really make a good game.			"

												Been Playing this game over an year now.[Note: before reading the review of any player, please check the time the person has actually invested into the game. Since most of the reviews are terrible and are writen by players who hardly played 2hrs in total]PROS:-Good class and race selections.-Medium character customizations.-Good power animations and combat system.-Currently 7 different classes and all of them unique in their own way.-Really addictive.-New Maps and content every few months to keep you stuck to the game without getting bored.-Foundry system lets your craete your own interesting quests which you and other players in the game can play.-Premium contents aren't game performance affecting items. So you can really become a pro without spending a dime. Im a total free player without spending any cash on this game and I got almost every end game content. [Also there's an option to convert in-game cash (Astral Diamonds) into Premium cash (Zen). So you can buy all the premium contents with a little grinding of course]CONS:- Premium cash (ZEN) is too expensive if you choose to spend real cash in buying it.-Transition of the game from last year to now is big. The game has become heavily grinding game.-Poor Graphics Optimizations. [Not the best looking game out there but If I can get 50+ fps in most games of current graphics demanding games @1080p High settings, why can't a medium graphically looking game like this give poor fps? gives me 40-45fps in medium settings with some settings maxed. Very Poor Performance optimization.]-Heavy Server Lag issues [If there are too many people in 1 instance, then it starts to rubberband like hell making it literally unplayable]-DLCs are crazy♥♥♥♥♥expensive. Hero of the North pack is 199.99$? seriously? I can buy 2-3 award winning games for the same price!-TERRIBLE RNG LOOT Drop!!!! Which means some players grind for hours and hours and get♥♥♥♥♥♥from the Quest's chest where as some people get crazy luck to win the best thing! Would have been great if the % chance of winning the best gear of the ccheat increases with each run through into same dungeon.-Terrifying PVP Matchmaking sometimes. It's been over an year and it's still not fixed. High Gear score players facing up against low gear scored players. Making the defeat certain.This game would have got much better appreciations if it was made little easy for new players without banging our wallets to forcefully spend real cash too much. I agree that every Free2Play game has the option to spend real cash to get Premium stuffs. But there's a limit to how expensive it should get. This game crossed the line far beyond the limit..!!!The game runs purely because of the famous Dungeons and Dragons Title. Conclusion:Do I recommend it? Sure, the game is still lots of fun and it's fun to grind to some extent. It's great to play with friends. But this game is a killer for free players because for a new player to grind through all stuffs and get the End-game content will take nearly an year.			"

												Previously I recomened this game for various aspects like game play, roleplay and the fact that it was actually free, With the advent of Elemental Evil or as some call it the ""Great Unbalancing"" or the ""End of Faerun"" I can not recomend it to anyone that wants a free roleplay experience that can be played in a reasonable time with out paying large sums of money. The latest patch has removed nearly every feature to earn astral diamonds or currency you earn to purchase things in game or even to get Zen to buy things from the shop where people spend real moeny. Yes it used to be things many people bought with money could actually be bought with in game currency if you had enough patience. Invokes which used to give you 1,000 now only give you 250 if you are lucky. Some of the high quality gear on the exchange can cost nearly one million astral diamonds. To make matters worse many quests to earn astral diamonds have been removed. Many of the dungeons with the best equipment can not be entered until level seventy.           Why does that matter you ask? Well the game used to be only until level sixty. In the latest module there is much hype about the ""amazing paladin"" and how it will save Faerun from the Elemental Evil and how they will add ten more levels to game experience. There is just one problem existing classes already fufilled the role the paladin is supposed to play, There is a cleric, there is a tank and there is a warlock which drains health. The paladin is just a cleric in a tin suit with too much power. So how did they make this class relavant? First all methods of healing have been destroyed. Regeneration, lifesteal, potions, companions, spells from clerics ect all wrecked. Many spells that used to heal you now only give you a small chance at healing you. What does this mean? With out a highly skilled paladin in your party you will die over and over and over again. Also remember if you already played the game before Elemental Evil you worked hard to earn the best equipment for you experiecne after level sixty. This was now a waste of time since your characters will die at every turn. Everything to keep the game functional now relies on the ""Oathbound Paladin"" or as most call it simply ""Over Powered"" This healing tank in a party is the only way to do anything in the game now. Potions, clerics, self healing abilities all useless. If you try to level up to seventy now I pity the poor souls that struggle to get to that point.            You will hear how this balancing was put in place to strengthen tanks, encourage diverse parties and improve game play. Well if that was the goal you could also say dropping an atomic bomb on Neverwinter will improve the scenry. Frankly it is a lie and most will not realize it until the dust clears and everyone makes the grisly discovery Neverwinter has become a silent graveyard for adventurers that died everytime they turned a conner. This module has nothing to do with game play. All the other classes have been thrown off a cliff with a rock called Elemental Evil tied to their neck and left to figure out how to swim on their own. You will not be able to level up by yourself if you want, you will not be able to get anywhere in the game with out purchasing booster packs and buying Zen to get the best equipment is the only way to do anything in this game in a reasonable time. I have played this game for over a year and I am sad to say all my work and money I spent was a wasted effort.  Do not beleive the hype Neverwinter is not a free to play game in any sense of the term. It is a pay to win game that now only favors the PvP experience. If you want to do something else like level up and spend time with freinds in a party where everyone has a role. This is not the game for you. If you have more money than sense and love to smash other players while marching around as the most over powered class have at it while you can, this game will not be up for much longer with all the people leaving.

												Having played this game over the years, for a long time,  I have seen it fall in quality pretty hard.  At first it was ok, challenging, but not impossible to gear up your character.  But that is now in the past and sadly it is impossible. This game has 2 sides to it,  First the levels 1-69, and then the endgame after 70.   Here is the deal, cryptic has gutted the endgame so much, that it is not free to play at all.  The whole point of the endgame is to gear up your character, and be a badass in dungeons. But the only way to do that is earn some AD (Astral diamonds) by doing specfic quests.  This has been nerfed, over and over and over.  They have removed the ability earn it so much, that if i was to start fresh it would take years of constant playing to get everything i need in the game to be competive and win.  Now say i wanted to buy everything with real cash.  Well then to fully gear up your charater, it would cost you over 1,000 dollars.  It is a joke, and sadly even after all these years, paying over 100,  i'm still not even close to bing best in class.  The endgame is dead, don't waste your time with it.  I was lucky to play back in the day, but now forget it.  Because of this, there is a real gap between players who play for free and players who pay.  There is no balancing to be had, thus PVP is completly broken and croweded by geared guild players vs the unlucky few who are first trying to play pvp.  IT is a broken system. levels 1-69 was the best part of this free to play experience.  It is the part of the game where you level your character, and not your gear.  The bots have taken it over.  As stated above, cryptic has taken steps to limit AD gains, and one of the reasons for this was to combat bots from earning AD.  Like life, bots find a way.  The new thing is they are crowding dungeons, PVPs, and skirmish queues.  It is now comon when queuing up in the lower levels, to be placed in a game populated entirally by bots.  It is pretty funny to see them robotically run around.  Now if you want to play the main story quests, go ahead.  Those are still there and will never be ruined.  But by god don't spend a dime on this game.  It is No longer worth any money.  The game is going to be dead soon at this rate.  It is a pay 2 win game now, make no mistake about it.			"

												I really want to give this game a thumbs up. I really do. But I just can't. I love the combat, I love the mechanics, I love the class synergy. Its all there. But I can't give it thumbs up for a multitude of reasons. The first and primary reason I am giving this game a thumbs down is because server side latency can make this game literally unplayable at peak hours and unbearbly annoying at not peak hours. I can't even count how many times I've been fighting the boss of a dungeon and been forced to wipe because me and my entire party couldn't control our characters for 15 seconds, and when we regain control, everyone is dead and we have to start the boss over from scratch. Even when lag isn't this severe, theres always constant rubberbanding issues and unresposive abilty usage. This coupled with the fact that endgame bosses have extremely powerful attacks that must be dodged, can make for some extremly agrivating gameplay. I also can't count how many times I've been straight up kicked from the game while I was innocently running around doing daily quests. Sometimes I relog and I'm back up and running no problem, while other times I relog only to get kicked again in the next 10-15 minutes, and still other times I can't even relog even though the game says servers are up. Its annoying at best and downright aggrivating at worst. Lag is constant in this game, and makes what would be a well designed combat system aggrivating to deal with.Another reason I have to give this game a thumbs down is the lack of endgame scaling. In order to acquire the best gear in the game, you have to run dungeons. But in order to be effective in those dungeons, you need to be properly geared. But the only way to become properly geared is by running the dungeons. Its the chicken/egg paradox. What you end up with is people who queue in for the dungeon fresh off of hitting level 70 with regular rarity trash equipment, hoping to get carried by teammates so that they can get better gear, and with enough of these people the dungeons become impossble because you and your teammates aren't properly equiped to handle mobs and bosses. And its not their fault, its Cryptics fault for not including content that scales towards endgame appropiately. Its frustrating for new level 70s, because they can't contribute to dungeons, and its frustrating for veterans because they are forced to be matched with improperly geared teammates.My final complaint about this game is lack of endgame gear. Where is it? There is one set of gear you get from running T1 dungeons, another set from running T2 dungeons, and some PVP gear. You can also get some gear from crafting, but unless you've been playing the game for multiple months and have your crafting levels up, you're not going to be crafting anything worthwhile any time soon. And thats it. All of the gear from the campaign areas is still set at level 60, and no new gear has been added in those areas when they increased the level cap. Its garbage. The point of games like this is to personalize your character by finding the gear that fits the role you want your character to fill. But if there is only one set of gear that is viable in the endgame, then what is there? It just becomes a grind to get that set of gear, and then thats it. There is nothing else to do at that point.I love this game. I feel like it has a lot of good things going for it. I love the combat, I love the class variety, and I love the (few) dungeons that there are. But because of all the glaring flaws in the game's design, as well as the unbearable and constant server side latency that exists, I just can't in my right mind recommend this game to anyone looking for a new mmo to play.P.S. Something I feel I must mention (but didn't effect my decision in giving the game a thumbs down) is the fact that PVP in this game is awful. The pvp maps themselves are fine, and the tried and true king of the hill system works fine in this game, but the true flaw here is in matchmaking. Anyone who is level 70 will get matched with anyone else who is level 70, regardless of item level, class, pvp experience, record, anything. As best I can tell, the game just matches the first 10-20 (depeding on which pvp map you play) people in a match, randomly assigns them to teams, and lets it go. Needless to say, this does not make for any sort of competition at all, but instead becomes a battle of ""which team has RNJesus blessed with the higher geared teammates"". Rarely is there a PVP match that I have been placed in that was competitive. 90% of PVP matches are stomps one way or the other. This could be easily fixed by more intellegent matchmaking, but until that happens, just stay away from PVP entirely.			"

												I used to love this game to pieces, but with module 4 became the grand realisation that the game is just a massive cash grab for the end game players, they literally pull in player's, take their money and spit them out without listening to community input. Its sad and really pretty annoying how badly the game has been managed, it could of been great but you just feel cheated of your time and perhaps money if you spent zen.Id stear clear of this and Perfect World games alltogether.

												Well if you've read the (currently) top reviews by Dark Sun Silke and Blackdragonbird, they cover the bulk of it very well. I enjoyed the game for the first few hours when you're not subjected to the Pay2Win mechanics at every turn. You get eased into that, then can't escape it. Get ready to have your immersion completely sodomised.I wanted to like the game, really I did. I played the Neverwinter Nights games several times through, and have always been into D&D and Forgotten Realms, but if you're looking for that here, you won't find it. The developers are using the franchises for exposure, but aside from references, place names and deities who really serve no in-game purpose, the rest of it is just a bog-standard copy and paste mmo.The game is riddled with bugs, which I can live with - it's pretty standard in mmo's as they're pretty complicated with all said and done, but Neverwinter does seem to have more than the norm.. really silly ones that shouldn't be there this long after release, but then the developers are too busy making things you can pay for. It's a plague just like Team Fortress 2 and the hats.. oh the hats...Not that the game needs to be made easier.. so far in almost 100 hours of play, I've not died once, and not for lack of trying.  God knows I love to push the limits of what my characters can do, and regularly Leroy my cloth and leather wearers into the frey, but enemies just aren't a challenge, and bosses are just as easy but with larger health pools.Here are some more specific points:-Level design is ok if I'm generous. There are some areas that are nice enough, but certainly not inspired, and with the dire lack of graphical optimisation, I had to have the settings so low it looks like an mmo from 8 years ago just to have it not playing like a slideshow, and it's still less than 10 fps in the capital. My comp isn't great, but I can play most games at full settings. Any nice areas that might exist are lost to the battering the settings have taken.-Quests are mini-hub based, and your standard tired fare. There are voiceovers for all of them as far as I can tell (well, in fairness I haven't paid alot of attention to it beyond the first couple of zones), which is nice, but you'll probably end up just grabbing them all and ignoring the 'story', as ultimately you're just sent off to kill a bunch of things or click on something on the ground. The quests feel like they were just dumped in to fill out the zones with something to do and aren't engaging. Grab a few, complete them, and gain a new level. The level cap is 60, and you can get to 20 in a few hours of speeding through quests without reading them.-Music I can't really comment on, I have it turned off as I use a table mic for voicechat.-Voiceovers are hit and miss for me. I've read several reviews which like them, perhaps because people tend to recognise them from other games, though personally I find that the accents aren't done too well. An example is Sergeant Knox, the main go-to guy for your level quests throughout the game. He'll start off sounding Scottish, and then kind of slip into English, then the American accent comes through before pulling it back to Scottish. Some of the voiceovers are native speakers, and they sound fine, but it breaks immersion for me when a voiceactor doesn't get it right. Having said that, there are a few noteable exceptions, and the voice acting in the Linkletter quest line was actually quite good considering the difficulty of that kind of emotiveness.-Combat is reasonably action based, with dodging and timing your abilities for best effect, so positioning can be an advantage, but you can only slot a few abilities at any given time, so you'll spend most of your time feeling like there should be more to do as you'll be restricted to spamming the few you've chosen. For skills, feats and abilities, the descriptions often lack details, so you have to spend points on the skills/abilities to see if they're any good. Those wasted points can only be reassigned by spending real money on a respec, which will cost a few quid/bucks.-Healing is a lost cause for so many reasons. If, like me, you tend to play a healing class, this is a game to avoid. Aside from making life a little easier in end-game content (of which there is a woeful lack!), there's just no need for a healer. At release the sole healing class (Divine Cleric) was fairly balanced I suppose, but got nerfed for whatever reason, and is by far the least played class. In PvP the Cleric is simply dead-weight unless the player has spent a few hundred dollars on gear. Heals are generally Heal-Over-Time (HoT), and somewhat lackluster. They're fine for PvE, but are lost to the rediculous burst damage of PvP.-PvP is enjoyable ONLY when the teams are fair. On the rare occasion that both teams consist of players who haven't really spent much or anything on overpowered gear, you can enjoy it whether you win or lose and are satisfied in a balanced match. However, most games will just be utterly dominated by those with more money than sense. It simply does not matter how well you play, or how much better you are to your opponent, if they've paid out for gear you'll be the one face-down at the end of any fight. Not fun at all. You'll be repeating that scenario over and over, so bring spare lube. The fun matches are few and far between, and there's nothing enjoyable about a rogue unstealthing and killing you from full health in less than a second, even though you saw them stealth and were ready for them. Oh, and if you're riding one of the mounts you can get for in-game currency, you can be dismounted and land on your face if you take 3 hits of damage, or lose more than 10% of your health in a hit, while riding at +50% speed.. or you can spend £40 (about $65, though I think it's cheaper on the US Zen Market) for a mount at +110% that you can't be knocked from. Ahh the joys of Pay2Win. Gear has an overall score, and you could easily be matched with other players of similar scores, but then where would the incentive be to pay for all the best gear with real money if you couldn't dominate those who can't afford it? Noo, they'll never be adding that feature.Utimately Perfect World are farming the players for every last penny they can suck out of them. You'll feel like cattle being herded into pens ready for them to milk money out of. When you step into the capital, PvP matches or higher level areas, get ready to feel like a homeless person in the rich part of town. Everywhere you look you can take in the beauty of what could be yours if only you had loads of money - and loads of money it is too. I deeply regret buying just £17 ($28) of Zen tokens and adding to the whole farce. I feel dirty and used, grasping the soiled sheets to my body to hide what little dignity I have left. You only start with 2 character slots, so I bought the Zen to get another 2 slots and have some left over for something else. Hmm, perhaps a 24 slot backpack to help with the constantly full packs that are deliberately full of enchantment stones etc to make you need more space. That'll be £10 ($16) please.At least, I like to think they'd say please.			"

												Free to play, yeah sure. But the DLC listed on Steam alone adds up to 420 Euro. (Yes, 420!) This doesn't even include any of the in-game purchases, some of which are required to progress at a humanly acceptable rate (companion level unlocks for example).And it's a pity, too, because the basic mechanics of the game are decent and the combats are quite fun. I really wish they had published this as NWN3 instead of going down into f2p hell.			"

												Pay to win.The devs are greedy. The price it costs for max level items like mythic artifacts is quite funny. Maybe a few thousand dollars to get your char near max or more, it has been a while since I played so I'm not sure how much it is now, but everytime lots of players get maxed they increase the gear further, making people need to spend more money.I loved this game, the best combat in any MMO I have tried but after all the hours I have put into this game  I can be 1 shot by other players because of p2w and in pve the paying players can clear content so much easier. I have played nearly 1900 hours and not even close to being maxed. You will need to spend money to buy a mount, have fun using the slow one you get for free, it will make most content terrible. You will need to pay for inventory slots since items have soul bound, shared bound and about 4 other types even if it's all the same item they won't stack. A good way for the devs to make people need to spend money on extra slots.If your rich or don't mind never getting stronger no matter how long you play then you might like this game, otherwise I really wouldn't reccomend it.

												I gave up on this game a long time ago but figured I review it since they keep updating things. The story is fine and you might enjoy it once through. PVP and even most PVE is where it all falls apart.This is most definitely a pay to win game unless you are willing to put insane hours into grinding. I have over 1,000 hours and my main toon would still get demolished in the blink of an eye.Loved it for the D&D part but that wasn't enough to keep me going.Devs only seem to care about you if you line their pocket books.

												This game was actually fun for a while. But the developers are just nerfaholics and cannot stop. It doesn't matter which class you pick, they just do not and will not quit. After a year you'd have thought they'd be ok with things, but they're still attempting ""balance"" fixes... and not the small kinds. Complete redesigns with no real way to change the entire focus of what your character was. Don't count on playing for long, regardless of what you pick they'll destroy it eventually. Its just not worth anyones time to play like that. I wouldn't bother. These guys do not know what they want and keep changing their minds repeatedly. There's no reason to play a game like that. And that doesn't even count how far away from actual D&D the gameplay is getting after a year. It was pretty close early on, now its nothing even remotely close.

												I had been playing for some while and the micro purchases were just too tempting. Today I decided to purchase a bit of 'zen' so I could turn it into another in-game currency to buy a companion. They were very happy to take my money, but because the transaction was made via my Steam Wallet - they have limited my use of the funds and suspended my ability to exchange currencies for an indeterminate amount of time. No phone support, you can only submit a ticket which also, MAY be replied to within an indeterminate amount of time.Exceptionally efficient in their ability to shut down a potential customer in the long run.

												I made a purchase on Neverwinter on the undersatnding that I would receive a ""First Time Buyer's Pack"" The text on screen says (accessed by presing Alt then ""Y"" [Zen Market]) ""You will receive this item through in-game mail after transfering at least 500 Zen to your account"" (I transfered 1000 Yen through steam wallet) Then when I make an in game ticket the company says it does not apply to Steam transactions. Which they never told me in the first place. Then they tell me if I want a refund go to Steam. To be honset I think this company is deliberately scammig Steam users.			"

												NEVERWINTERS FIRST YEAR!!   PVE = good PVP = good. -I played this game when it first came out.   it was very promising, there was little hacking, pay to win wasnt so brutally overpowered, and balancing was getting better by the patch.  NEVEWINTERS SECOND YEAR!!   PVE = Messed up Horribly.   PVP= Messed up worse.  -Suddenly the game became all about how much money u could spend.   a Free to play charecter seems almsot impossible to reach max level without spending money.   -they have VIP status to make leveling reasonable.   -Alot of game function moved Clientside,  this allows for hackers,  and there is alot of them.  -Mass untested Code allowed for exploits to ruin the ingame economy and gameplay both pvp and pve. (example: putting a negative bid at auction house would cause the auction house to give you free money ) -PVP Rankin doesnt work right.  hacked charecter's seen every few pvp matches.  all charecter data is held clientside for easy manipulation.-many more hacks then just low gear score players with maxed stats and ability scores.   there are auto dodger hacks.   autoattack hacks,  hacks to to refine gear and enchanments.   All for alot less then the cost of paying to level ur charecter or buy the best gear.This game should be gasping for its last breath.   can cost you hundreds of dollars for a single godly item.   Then it cant kill a hacker then spent 20 bucks for the hacked code to inject into his client. "

												First of all I checked that I would not  recomend this game but in all honesty it really depends on what you exspect.  The game is free and you can play for hours and hours.  The money system in the game in Gold,Silver and Copper.  Now you also have a huge bunch of items which you earn and can spend for game items.  I won't go into them all because there are just too many to list.  The real money is in Astral Diamonds which you can earn in the game.  This is where my problem lays it cost 700,000 just to upgrade a companion from a level 25 to a level 30 and you still have to level one at a time until you reach level 30 with the companion.  I can only imagine what it then cost to upgrade from level 30 to 35.  I have been playing for appox. 2 months pretty much evey day and have only been able to accumeulate roughly 125,000 Astral Diamonds so you see the problem.  My chacter is a level 60 and a level 25 companion is not really that much help on quests.  Now for the real kicker, you can purchase Astral Diamonds for real money out of your Steam Wallet and trust me you can spend hundreds of dollars.  I paid $10 for my compaion thinking I could level her up to my level, nope they hide these things from the customer.  When I purchased her I had no idea it would cost so much to level her up.The whole game is built around getting the player to spend real money.  I can purchase a pack for DLC and it would cost me $59.99 in real money, included in this pack would be 600,000 Astral Diamonds so I could take them and add them to what I have and level up my companion to level 30 but what would be the point.Now the other big item you can use as money is a thing called Zen if you want to purchse Zen in the game 1 Zen cost roughly 365 Astral Diamonds and I need 125 Zen to purchase a key to unlock a box that the game puts in your inventory at like level 9 or so.  Do the math to see how many Astral Diamonds it would take to purchase 125 Zen so I could obtain a key to open the box.  Supposedly the box contains a vauable item and it gives you a list of what you might get.  I've had this box in my inventory for the whole game because I can't get justify spending all my Astral Diamonds to buy 125 Zen.Now at level 20 you can purchase a mount for roughly 5 gold game money.  This allows you to move around faster and hitting key pad number 6 or 7 puts you on the mount and takes you off the mount it just places it in you inventory.  You have a choise of what type of horse you would like, I won't go into all the choises.  Then comes the big kicker, if you want to go faster you have to upgrade to a 2 or 3 and again it will cost you more Astral Diamonds than you could earn in 6 months of playing. You say well why would I have to go faster, I'll tell you.  Some of the game is a fight called PVP, player verses player.  You can put yourself in a que to join a group of 4 other player and you fight with 5 other player in a kind of arena with 3 power points that change from Blue to Red depends on the team your on.  I'm not sure how it works but I'm allways on the blue team. I'm told that everyone has the same color that shows for them when they play so I don't really know how anyone would know. When I play the control points are blue and the team I'm on is blue. Now when your attacked while riding a horse your knocked off then attacked in the reg. way.  If you had an upgrade it would be more difficult for an opponant to knock you off the horse plus going faster helps you get away quicker.  The 3 power points I mentioned change hands in the game often and your team gets points for capturing them.  I think the first player to the power point gets the points and you also receive points by killing opponents.  So if your rushing to a power point to capture it and your not fast one of your team mates will get there first if they have a special mount or have purchased an upgrade.  Now you can buy game packs like the one I mentioned earlier for $59.00 and you get a unicorn which I assume is faster and better.  You can always tell who has spent real money in the game by what type of mount they are on, some have bears some have black panters etc etc etc.  The more money they spend the tougher they are. Armor has to be enchanted and it cost tons of Astral Diamonds to buy the enchantments.  When I started this review the enchantments were 3 times less exspensive now 7/9/2014 the enchantments will cost you 3 times what they use to.  That means that all the heavy hitters in the game that leveled out all 12 itmes in there gear when things were cheap will have a huge advantage. In combat in the PVP they always win.  I could go on but I think you have the idea spend money become a better player and have a bit more fun.  Don't spend money and you can have fun and reach the highest level which is 60 but if you play matches and go up against a level 60 with special armor, weapons and mounts you will loose.  It has nothing to do with ability.If the Developers of this game would have just sold it for $40 or $50 and let you earn all the special stuff it would have been a great game and tons of variety and fun for all.  I now someone from Neverwinter will read this and send me a nasty comment telling me I'm unfair but everything I've listed it true in my opinion.  Have I had fun sure but it would be more fun if I could afford all the extras.One big thing I forgot to mention is that on the Neverwinter log on screen there is a place to do surveys and you go to a spot called Peanutlabs and there is a list of surveys you can do. Each one tells you how much Zen you will receive for you game Neverwinter if you do the survey.  DON'T DO IT THEY DON'T PAY.  The people at Neverwinter don't care if you complain to them they send you to Peanutlabs you can look at the surveys you took each has a number and check the box ""didn't receive my Zen for doing the survey"" and all they do is send you an E-mail saying sometimes surveys can't be verified..What a load of crap.  SO DON'T BE FOOLED.			"

												Been playing since beta. It was good in terms of the core mechanics, and the actual way the gameplay flows. But then I hit endgame, and bam. Your hopes are quickly shattered. The lack of separate balancing in PvP and PvE makes it a nightmare, with flavour of the month classes dominating either one or both. Most recently in Mod 5, the TR class was overwhelmingly powerful, likewise with the CW class. However most classes were still able to get aroud it via skill and experience. And then Mod 6 came. Despite constant feedback from the players telling them that it wasn't ready for actual release from the preview forums, and an absolute litany of bugs for almost every single class, it was still released. And today, today we the players are left to deal with the crap left behind. From critical hits doing less damage then a regular attack in PvP, to the weakest enemies in Tier 2 dungeons being capable of 1 shotting tanks, to the absolutely ridiculous power levels of classes which we repeatedly said were too powerful. Imagine fighting a boss in any other game which was capable of becoming immune to your attacks and attempts to control it, while also being capable of killing anything in but a few hits while in that state. That's what a TR has become.Imagine any game where the devs would claim balance but make one class the best at tanking, controlling, and DPS, all while other classes are left in the dirt dealing practically no damage and gutted due to bugs which have existed since its release. Does that sound balanced? If it does to you, you'll love this game. If not, then the best advice I can give you is to go play some other mmorpg, that's certainly what I plan to do.Have fun and good luck no matter what you do.P.S. This is just about the gameplay, don't even get me started on stuff like the ridiculous Refinement Point system.			"

												Ok so to start things off i have been here almost since the beginning of neverwinter and spent almost 1 thousand hours playing. So I think it's safe to say i have a good foundation for my opinion. The game for the first few zones is fun and then on after you can start to feel a repetitive scheme. After reaching level 60 the grind really begins.   I stopped playing neverwinter about when the maze engine released so a lot probably has changed since then but nonetheless, It became a struggle for me to continue any longer, playing a game in which a character who was level 1 had gear and items far superior to mine, when the grind was to bothersome and tiring, i have lived through it and experienced it all. I have about 3 level 60 characters and two level 70's or something like that (it's been a long time) somehow i managed to play for so long to achieve that much. But when it comes to enjoying the game, I could no longer do it. I couldnt say i enjoyed it. At the time it felt so 'flawed'. Everyone always looked like they were one step ahead of me, why? Probably because the only money i bothered to spend on the game was just enough to buy the dusk unicorn mount and that is about it, yet everyone else decided to spend their money buying things and exchanging this for that, the AD currency could do a lot of things if you have enough of it, even get gear beyond your level if your level 10 or on par with the others around you. But for me the p2w aspect hurt the most when I made the choice to play pvp.  I played so hard and spent so much time doing things legit and without the help of money, yet when hardworking players like me that upgraded their gear increased their stats, and had the willpower to say ""I did it"" and feel satisified only to get completely obliterated by some bragging, cocky and overconfident rich kid who boasts about how much money he spends on the game on a daily basis is just beyond me. Believe me, if you plan on playing this game as a newcomer go right ahead you may just enjoy the first few or so hours of the game or maybe you might enjoy the entire game, but dont stray to far from what's possible you can earn every piece of equipment if you work hard enough, but if you want to♥♥♥♥♥♥on every hardworking, time sinks dreams, than spend all the money you want, it will get you everthing you want 100 times faster and you'll leave everyone eating your dust. That is what drove me away from this game, that is what i left for, to stop wasting time and doing things i could no longer accomplish because i was so far behind, it would take a year to catch up to the p2w players. Because when you purchase something from that market you will very likely possess an advantage over the average player, even if it is a mount like the one i purchased.			"

												NEVER-RICH-ENOUGH. In Perfect World's eyes, unless you are a direct descendent of the Neverwinter Crown or a high noble of the Jewel of the North, your experience will be limited to that of the slums or sewers. It is as if Lord Nasher said screw the Lords' Alliance, we are only accepting billionaires.Seriously though, every interaction in the game eventually comes down to Zenny. Astral Diamonds are a commodity in this game, and gold buys you absolutely nothing of value. They put that currency in there for aesthetics only. However, if you are a sucker for mobile cash grab games, and don't mind pouring $100/month into those, then by all means do yourself a favour and switch to this game. You will certainly have more fun.Yes, you can have fun playing this game when there isn't a microtransaction sneaking around every corner. No amount of Search or Listen training will prepare you for that garbage. Hopefully one day Perfect World will drop the license for Neverwinter and allow a new developer to take it up and maybe bring us what we all deserve, a Neverwinter Nights 3. We can only pray to the gods for a miracle, hopefully within 10 years best case scenario.			"

												Pros:- It's a stupid fun game- fighting is fluid- Despite all the rage over the market, you can go without buying thingsCons:- DLC is too gorram expensive, what the hell is up with that? 200 bucks for a gaggle of digital crap? PASS- Forced Five player dungeons...trust me, play with friends because you will never get these done otherwise and there is at least one in every area. Other thoughts:character slotting is very limited but I got arround that with multiple accounts...yes, I have no life, wanna fight about it? :). Some of the DLC is entirely to expensive so in the end you have to ask yourself a few questions that I've found helpful when I get the itch (btw 50 hours, 4 accounts, and not a penny dropped on this game)Q1: Do I really need this item and why?Q2: how will this help me?if the answer to either of these questions is ""cuz it's shiney!"" chances are you DO NOT NEED IT. but if you want to spend your money because you genuinely like the game then by all means do so but as with anything do so in moderation. Trust me I'd love to run around fearune with all the badest gear and mounts. I not only love DnD but I really enjoy my time in this game. 9.5/10 "

												The longer the game's life goes on and the more Module's they add onto it, the more it's clear that they're just trying to get money at this point.I don't want to pay $75 dollars just to play a single race, every class is broken in one area or another, the game has gone from a little grindy to exponentially more grindy, the level cap increase caused more problems for me than it did help, the queue system is still when it's probably one of the if not the number one complaint I see in and out of the game, the PvP is very dull and you will almost always lose to someone who paid to win, packing the most ridiculous enchantments and gear in the game, there's a problem with bots that seems to be increasing from what I've heard, more often than not a Guild will die just a few months after it is made because Guilds serve next to no purpose except for getting into Gauntlgrym and just doing everything on your own anyway.

												I don't recommend this game for anyone. I played about 900 hours of this ""thing"" from the open beta(soft launch in March 2013) to the release of Module 2.Unfortunately the clowns in Cryptic and Perfect World are turning the game even more P2W with every patch. New reskinned mounts became companions and reskinned companions became mounts that cost outrageous amounts of Zen. PVP is dominated by bots, 110% mounts and players that have bought his gear with money, like the Tenebrous enchantments. Bots are dominating the market and the developers do nothing to punish this behavior. Every new patch introduce new bugs and exploits and old bugs and exploits still haunt the player community from the soft-launch in March 2013.The game has 6 classes now but you need only 3 to do the end-game content, a Divine Cleric, a Trickster Rogue and 3 Control Wizards, oh wait, the game has no end-game content too! Boring and repetitive dailies and ""epic"" dungeons full of glitches and exploits are the only thing to do after max level. And before I forget, the community are one of the worst that I have ever seen, fanboys and dumb kidos everywhere, defending the need of profit for the company that are milking them.Stay away from this thing.*For the ones that live on Gabe's Harem only, look here:http://social.xfire.com/profile/blackdragonbirdAnd learn to read, I already stated that the games was soft launched in March 2013.

												There are reasons why I think this game isn't worth playing anymore..Before all the strongholds, and the underdark, neverwinter really cared about the gameplay and the community. However, the recent updates have been really really bad.My first reason for this game not being recommended is that the game is really time consuming and evolves a lot of grinding at levels 60-70. Before the stronghold update, traps did not give you injuries. Now. Every trap gives you an injury UNLESS you are a VIP, which proves this game is no longer focused on the community, but more on their income. Stronghold armour relies on stronghold boxes, which in order to open require a strongbox key, which is also on their market, and also proves they just want more income.There are so many campaigns to do after level 70 that this game gets boring as you are constantly repeating missions. PVP is still broken with bots, at level 10-50, at level 60-70 if you haven't got a high Gs you will not stand a chance. Before strongholds, health and power were all balanced and the level cap was 60. Now health can go up too 160K and the level cap is now 70. Level 60-70 is possibly the most boring part of neverwinter. The only good part about neverwinter is the story, which is level 1-60. After that, it's all grinding and repeated quests and dailies.Personally, I don't recommend neverwinter. At all.			"

												Oh Jeez, where do i start...? Well, first the things i liked:- The combat is great. I like the way classes feel and play... even though it's 4th edition D&D.- Graphics are ok and atmospheric, sound and music fit.- Character developement is a bit deeper than usual (in terms of Skills and attributes, which are on autorail in most mmorpgs).- A crafting-system which does not require you to stand at a work-bench and wait while your avatar creates one low-tier-item after another until next tier is unlocked. All in all you can have fun in PvE... until you hit levelmax and enter the  addon-campaigns like temple of elemental evil.At that point you will meet a barrage of Paywalls and daily-grinds. Seriously! You're expected to do daily-missions for about a week until ONE Story-mission is unlocked or a Progression-bar is filled. Then rince and repeat. And the High-End-Mobs expect you to have at 4k-gear. My Trickster-Rouge has about 3.5k-gear after a long grind and investing a bit of money and i still keep getting overwhelmed when i try to go solo... and sadly this extends to foundry as well.    I mean, it's a bad sign if you do a group-dungeon for your Level, but doing less damage with your DD-Rouge than a Tank with 4k-gear. Seriously f*** that sh**!!!!!Oh, and PvP? Forget it! Even if everyone is phased to a common level, player with high-tier-equipment will destroy you. Neverwinter whas a nice F2P game when it launched... but right now, it's a freemium. Can you overcome this Wall without paying a dime? Sure, but that would be masochistic. Oh, and to those guys who say ""nah, it's fine. You just have to invest a bit more time and grind"": NO! That's not a sign of quality, that's Stockholm-Syndrome			"

												I only play PVE so if you're looking to get a review about PVP look more.So I've played this game for quite a bit and I think its amazing. I'm currently have 4 60's : GWF, HR, CW, GFMy GWF is 18k GSPros:-Combat is fast and fun, if you're not paying attention in those end game dungeons you might find yourself dead.-I always have a goal, wether it be getting new gear or my campaigns.-The community is actually really friendly, I've had some really great experiences my self.-You can earn everything in game for free. EVERYTHING. Yes it might take some time, but whats the point of playing a game if you dont want to earn some things?-Skill matters, what I mean by this is if you practice your class and get good at timing with your abilities etc. You can potentially out damage somone who is higher geared than you, that is if they arent as skilled as you. I like this because I'm lightweight competitive and I always want to be the highest damage dealer on the charts.-Leveling isn't a drag, sure some people want the leveling to be a slow process but the thing is, IT CAN! If you want to take time leveling then do that, pay attention to what NPC's say, read the story. But if you want to zoom to 60 skip everything do the quests as fast as possible and you can get it done extremely fast. I'm an altoholic so this is good for me :)-25 man raids will finally be coming out soon! thats right, 25 man raids!Cons:-Okay there are wallet warriors.. But don't pay attention to them, if you like PVP then I don't reccomend this game for you entirely, pvp can be a mess sometimes.-The end game relies on you to farm. You might have to farm a dungeon 10+ times in a row to get the things you need. BUT THATS NORMAL. I've ran every dungeon in this game probably 50+ times. I love the combat in this game so i never get bored.-Farming the end game currency becomes a chore. But if you're a long term player then don't take it seriously. Play the game to have fun, hell dont even play the game everyday. You can collect an easy 24k of the end game currency a day and if you get that + do a few dungeons you can easy make 50k a day and be rich in 3 months. Otherwise farm hardcore and become a bawss.-No open world. Okay I don't have an excuse here, I really wish this had open world but hey, it doesn't have it, it never will, and if that makes you hate it then dont play.About the classes I've played so far:Great Weapon Fighter: By far my favorite class. They are fast moving high damage dealers. They can also take a punch. I find myself constantly moving around in battle finding the best way to position myself, because in this game there is a thing called Combat Advanatage, which allows you to do more damage to an enemy if you're hitting it from the right spot. The skills on this class may not be your devestating mage skills but they are fun and fluid.Control Wizard: This class is probably one of my least favorites. I'm just terrible with this class. It does high damage but I feel like it moves really slow, I don't like it's dodge move and I really dont like the way it casts spells. Although when I am farming for enchantments I use this class to wipe mobs out really fast :P.Hunter Ranger: This class is actually really fun. Moving around constantly shooting your bow while kiting enemies then when they are low health switch to your duel wielding daggers and go in for the kill. The skills on the hunter ranger are really flexible and allow you to choose to be a high damage ranger, or go more of a supportive role and do damage while boosting the damage of your allies.Gaurdian Fighter: This class is pure tank. This is another class that feels really slow to me. I like to move fast ""sanic"". But this class is starting to become a very popular class in the endgame right now with the addition of new dungeons, and I imagine with 25 man raids coming out this will be a most wanted class. This class is mainly about buffing your allies and tanking though.So this is my review and I hope you can give this game a try at least. Obviously there are alot more Pro/Con's but those are the ones I felt like mentioning. Sure this game isnt perfect, and it could use alot of work. But if you're looking for a new long term MMO then I would reccomend this. With expansions coming out every 3-5 months, and 25 main raids coming I'll be sure to stick around.Also if you ever need some help in game or have any questions you can add me in game Jessi@dubstepghostt "

												Rollbacks? CheckNothing besides grinding to go from level 60 to 70? CheckHeroic encounters meant for melee classes to sit it out and watch the fight? CheckNot enough dps in your group because you have melee classes? CheckGraphical artifacts? CheckConstant problems with NVidia Graph cards? CheckUnfixed Instances for more than a year? CheckLag? CheckMore Lag? Re-checkDid I say Rollbacks already?This used to be my favorite free mmorpg of all time, and I'm in my mid thirties so I've seen loads of them come and pass. This is now the game that I liked that came out with the WORST expansion of all time.I wouldn't play this game if someone paid me to do it in its current state. I spent 940 hours loving this game a year ago, stopped playing because of real life stuff. I tried to love this game for the past 40+ hours and it just isn't happening.			"

												I've had quite a bit of fun with this game. The game feels alive, and brings me a much similar feeling of when I used to play World of Warcraft. The combat and rich D&D story is what keeps it seperate from most WoW clones. Arcgames is a shady mess of a company. Their customer support is abysmal, and the servers feels run by children. When I was really liking this game, I spent $50 on it and unlocked a few goodies. They had a sudden announcement about rolling the servers back because of some auction house exploitation, and suddenly I was without 3 of my 4 characters and out $50. All I was given was a reference to the terms of agreement which basically said ""once you give us your money we aren't liable to give a ♥♥♥♥."" It's a shame that a game with such promise would set itself up for failure. Scamming your fans and ignoring repeated attempts at reason isn't a very good way to run your company. Other developers, take note; and players, and beware.			"

												This game used to be fun and used to be good, now with the recent changes I come back after a 6 month leave and I'm welcomed with complete and utter pay to win. You used to be able to sell things in the AH now that is a thing of the past. Want good gear and not have to pay for it? Not gonna happen here. The best part of this game was running dungeons and now that is basically non existant, the game economy is useless. STAY AWAY AND DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. They are honestly just trying to scrape what little money they can get from this game before it officially dies.			"

												Honestly.. I've been playing this game since mod 2 or something and many things have changed.In fact, i want to be accurate and i've been playing this game since Dread Ring was released.Before even Hunter Ranger,Scourge Warlock and Oathbound Paladin classes were even realeased.For those who have played this game they know the Dread Ring Campaign,they have played this game just before it's release date they know about what times i'm talking about.Back then there was no overflow experience and not 70 level being the maximum level.I remember dungeons were divided in 3 tiers and the highest gear score(which is basically one's player stats)was about 21k and maximum HP about 50k(which back then it was something mad) and i'm talking about full epic equipment with full rank 10 enchantments.Things back then were not that easy but still.After i've realised the servers have been treated poorely by the developers and now the game is evolved into a stealing money machine i've reached into a conclusion.After experiencing the whole game in mod 6 i've grown tired of this,after watching everything change into some sort of artifact hunt and mythic b*llshit,after trancendent vorpal enchantments got out and rank 12 enchantments worthing a hell lot of money i understood that this game has been destroyed.Around 500 hours on Steam and same as many in Arc launcher almost to 1000 hours of gameplay i realised that i will be never be bored to the gameplay of this game.Because it is amazing but as i said before i'm tired of this sick growing development.If you are still reading this, good job.. many would have just ignored that or pass this review just like an old dusty book in a library but if you are the one curious to open and read that old dusty book,you are from now on a really good path because only dusty books hide some secrets and let's say that this review is just one of them.I'm telling that you will love this game but after spending all this time on this game and you reach to an end you'll then realise that it was a waste of time. Because gaming has now lost its own sense and meaning and you will really wonder why haven't you spent all this time somewhere else so in the end you would be satisfied.In all means(and just because i'm a assh*le writing all this huge boring sh*ty review)i'm telling you to play this game and you will have fun.You will come down my path and you'll experience as much as i had but in the end it doesn't even matter.So fellow gamer good luck :)and don't forget it's good to explore new places.

												I`m playing with standalone game (not via steam) since open beta.Game is really fun, mechanics and lots of parts of the game are well-made.It was fun to :- make all of 9 characters- farm with friends new content and became stronger with each update.- to see, after so much time put into your character, how good you became.- help less experienced players and keep your party together in challenges.- etc.And then fire nation attacked (with earth, water and air together). Module 6 (Ele)mental evil.Changes:- added lot of farming areas with no story. Just to justify levels 61-70.- taken quests/maps/dungeons from level 60 to 70, making them unreasonably harder.- with higher levels you gain LESS effect on the same stat value (example, 10% damage reduction on 60 will be 6% on 65). Because of that i was getting WEAKER wih every level up. (I didn`t want to level up, how ridiculus is that.)- They set new line about ""decent"" and ""good"" gear. Now ""awesome"" gear you farmed hours, days, weeks for are ""meh"" or ""bad"" now. However good you were, you are weak now.- New skills? Too bad most of ALL skills are broken now. Wait a month or 2 and maybe they will fix half of them.- PvP became ridiculus. Some healers can fight 4-8 other players in the same time. - As unfriendly as it can get for new players. Even old players are unfriendly to new players. Everyone hate new players until you`ll throw 10x AAA game price into game, and you will get kicked / killed / trashed / massacred / laughed at / danced on.And this are changes only in this module.So, when other games add new content where you can get even stronger than before, this module made youWEAKER and force you to FARM or PAY to be at least as good as before and play OLD content.Why the hell do i have to struggle, or farm, to be able to win in dungeon that i played already over 100 times?Why the check most of my almost best equipment i could get became WEAK in a week?Why would you want to start playing this game if you`ll know that you can become weak with every update?Why would you want to pay for something that will become insignificant? Some of players lost a lot of money because of this module.Just stay away from this game, until you don`t have anything to do with big amounts of money, or hear about some big changes.			"

												Like many PWE games, this game is fun for a time.  End-game is interesting when you first reach it, but you quickly realize that you MUST buy ""zen"" to get the most out of this experience.  The primary barrier being that if you party up with people who have epic mounts, you will get left in the dust without purchasing one yourself.  It IS possible to acquire ""zen"" with the in-game Astral Diamond currency, but it will take you a LONG time to acquire enough AD to buy enough zen to purchase an account-wide epic mount.  Some mounts can be acquired solely with AD however these will be bound to your character, whereas mounts purchased with zen will be account-wide.  While this might not necessarily be much of an issue if, say, epic mounts only cost around $5 worth of zen, it is an issue because they cost more like $25 - $40 worth of zen.   As with all other PWE games I have played, this game has a severe greed problem and pay walls will keep you from getting the most out of it.  Avoid this game.  Take your $40 of epic mount money to a proper MMO.			"

												This game falls into the usual Perfect World crap - poor account handling, massive amounts of pay to play/win traps, and thoroughly broken loading screens. Like Star Trek Online, another MMO♥♥♥♥♥♥out by Perfect World/Cryptic, the game hangs infinitely at the game's own unique loading screen and will never proceed. There isn't a single fix out there for this and you'll know it's a lost cause when you take one click and freeze the whole game leaving you with no choice but to forceclose it. Even then, can this game be truly worth it? There hasn't been a single PC game that's been faithful to D&D. From Neverwinter Nights to Baldur's Gate even, it's strayed as far as it can from the core game. Even Dungeons and Dragon Online was a massive failure and also prone to pay to win/play traps and a noticeable and depressing lack of content. I can see Neverwinter falling into this considering this IS Perfect World and a company that repeatedly fails as fixing their games and instead places all their effort into making most of the content paid for, the repetitive nature of MMORPS are never worth it. Don't even waste your time downloading this. It won't work.			"

Posted: April 1
												I have accumulated thousands of hours playing this game, ever since Beta, about 860 on Steam and the rest, the vast majority, on Arc.  I have eight Level 70 characters, one from each class.  Two of my characters have Item Scores (once known as Gear Scores) that are 4000+, my Great Weapon Fighter, Merek Knightsbridge, and my Scourge Warlock, Tsarra.  I have two characters that have Item Scores of 3500+, my Paladin, Buster Hymon, and my Hunter Ranger, Bo Enero, my other four characters are in the high 2000s.  So, as you can see, I have put tons of frustration and effort (AND MONEY) into this game.The sad, sad thing is that I have invested so much time and energy with very little to show for it, since there is always a new update that makes everything you have accomplished prior, obsolete.  And with each consecutive mod release, I have liked and enjoyed it less and less to the point of HATING it, especially after the ridiculously complicated River District (Cloaked Ascendancy) mod, which, by the way, was released WAY too soon after the Sea of Moving Ice, which required hours upon hours of grinding the same dailies over and over and the same stupid skirmish, Svaardborg, over and over, and the same ridiculously long dungeon, Fangbreaker Island, not to mention the constant grinding for lanolin in the four areas in which you can run what is known as BHEs, or Big Heroic Encounters with other players.  And when I say grind, folks, I mean GRIND.  This has now got to be the very most grindy game I have ever played or ever will play, because, quite simply, nothing is worth wasting hours upon hours of your life to grind and grind and grind and grind and grind just to upgrade a weapon that someone else has already outdone you with by getting some 1 in 1000000 armor or companion-armor drop.The very definition of the word ""game"" includes the word ""fun"" in it somewhere, right?  Fun existed between Levels 1 - 60.  And even the outlandishly absurd grind from 60 - 70, while being a boring grind wasn't half as bad as this game has since become.  I will not ""play"" a ""game"" that is nothing but a chore any longer.People from all over sound like they're dying when they say with obvious boredom and an almost sado-masochistic tone to their voices, stuff like, ""Well, I finally got my dailies done today.  I'll be back to do them all again tomorrow.""  Who, in the name of all that is sacred will allow themselves to be subjected to the greedy whims of this game's devs to be bored out of their minds in doing CHORES to succeed in this game?  It seems there are still quite a few who are under the magical evil spell of this game.  It brings to mind a vision of a bunch of cattle being led to a slaughter, pocketbooks, wallets, and hours upon hours of precious time in hand.Keep in mind that if you have lots of money to throw at the game, many, MANY things become much, MUCH easier, however, the grind remains, at least at some preposterous level.Sadly, my best days in Neverwinter are behind me now.  I may log in from time to time just to relive a few old memories of good times with fellow friends, guildies, and even my wife.  But most days I will play some other game, like Revelation Online or ESO, or just avoid the computer altogether, knowing that I have a $5000 - $10000 account that is utterly worthless to me.  My guild still keeps me as a member because we had a LOT of fun together in the past, but many of them cannot believe that I Ieft; they that are still under the aforementioned spell.  Note that I am not the only person who chose exodus over grinding for eternity for armor and gear that will be obsolete within a month or so.For me, the overly-complicated and NOT-fun River District was the final straw; the end-all of my days in Neverwinter.  Goodbye, ol' friend.			"

												It's a huge cash grab. It's not p2w but it's pretty close, you can play for free and have some fun but you'll never be great for free anymore. They keep taking stuff and nerfing stuff trying to combat bot farmers but here's the thing, those farmers aren't negatively affecting players, the changes that they make to combat the bots do negatively affect the real players. They have made it so much harder for the new players to ever get anything that I'd never recommend this game. If I never played again it'd take a new player 5000 hours and a couple of thousand dollars to attain the things that I've gotten in my thousand hours. It has great things about it and if they made it a subscription game and stopped all the stupid nerfing then it'd probably be awesome. At this point I'd recommend Rift or ESO before this even though they are also heavy cash grabs.. I guess the days of great subscription mmo's are gone in favor of the cash shop..editing because my comment was too long to reply in the comments.demon dog, I have every class at 70 (10 characters - 8 are 70) and complete collections of epics. I know how to play and I can afford things if I did want to buy them.. If you read everything I wrote I explained that new characters can not get these items now without thousands of dollars spent and thousands of hours. Yes you can play the game now and enjoy it for free but you will never be the best without paying, even if you play great they have now make it impossible to earn enough in game to level up items, pets, etc. without spending cash. I am a guild leader and I see new and casual players leaving the game like crazy because they can't grind for 1000 hours after hitting 70. They are making changes that ruin the game for new players and casual player alike. Get your epics, pets, maxed, runes to rank 12, without paying? I don't think so. Perfect example is wards now are only buyable with cash or trade bars which come from chest which you pay cash to open, good luck getting your enhancement slots to rank 12 without spending a fortune right there. Pets take 1 million astral diamonds to just get from purple to orange, they just took out the freebie daily diamonds so now you have to go raiding to get them and salvage anything that you get. getting 3000 at a time good luck with that too. Getting one of the best mounts without cash? you tell me how now. Now that the mounts also add combat stats it actually does make a difference. The foundry? That turned to crap a couple of years ago, does anyone run player made stuff anymore? doubtful as nobody that I know does. The community in general has been declining greatly over the last couple of years. Now random groups are all zerg with maybe even an afk or two. It was not that way before and the changes that they are making are in my opinion for the worse not the better. How many guilds ever see more than 10% of their members online together now?Best of luck to those that want to play it, enjoy it. I think that you can probably play quite a lot before you really notice the issues or before you start spending your cash. I didn't say the game is garbage, it's headin in that direction though, I stand by my review. My review is for new players to know what they are getting into, for the record I have no problem myself attaining anything or in completing and dungeon, I feel the need to point that out as some are taking my review as me whining and that's not what it is..

												One of the best examples of a Pay 2 Win game - Definition of Wallet Warriors. I AM PLAYING FROM MOD 3 !===PVP=== Dont bother going PVP over between 60-70 as would be constantly be 1 shotted by P2W players. Try to pvp between 1-60? not with our system ! which is broken beyond repair and we dont bother to fix it, only to get new items out and get your money ! 4/5 Matches you will find at least 2-3 or even more guys, with transcendent (best enchants in the game) enchants, which will probably makes your life unbereable and most likely 1 shot you ( by most likely i mean 100%). Not to mention the mounts that give bonuses. Run into some dude with 2k Power / Crit on his mount and you're most likely going to lay down dead while he talks nonsense for you being a peasent ( yes this is that kind of game, where P2W players talk nonsene for being too overpowered and by overpowered i mean they put a lot of money in the game and get too many kills). Did i mention premade pvp teams?===PVE=== Pve is pretty good (not really, it's pretty horrible too if you have lag...) Expect from time to time enemies hitting you from far away or 1 shotting you, especially if you are running an epic dungeon when even a cockroach can give you 80k damage or even 1 shot you. PVE over 60-70 is pretty much a bunch of nonsense... Grind you way to the 70 trough hoardes of enemies that are too powerfull for you and can easily kill you. Reach lvl 70? Good now run trough an epic dungeon and i'll let you know yourself this time, what hell means. ===CLASSES=== There are like 9 classes in the game or something like that. want to get really good with both PVP an PVE? Go with Trickster Rogue (TR) which can survive the impossible and deal huge amounts of damage, both to players and monsters. Annoy players in pvp like there's no tomorrow.===GRINDING=== THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT GRINDING !! Grind 1000 of hours only to get that 1 piece of equipment you can buy from the store for 10$. Daily limits, yeah...k...more pointless grinding, come back tomorrow for the same quest which gives you 1 point out of 100 to continue. come back in those 99 days to keep doing the quest until you complete to receive nothing. in general the grinding is pointless and gets boring really really quickly.===PATCHES=== From my experience so far and many hours grinding and playing this game with steam or with ARC launcher i can say that most patches are complete utter trash. A patch is not making items in the store cheaper cryptic... pls.... Sure they sometimes ""try"" to make something good but it just ends horrible. Breaking the game, from nerfing classes to the ground making them unplayable to making classes impossible to kill. They released a new patch? It's full of bugs? Players abusing it to get rich and then get banned ? We'll fix it after 3 months so we lose more and more players ! Jesus christ Cryptic... broken broken and more broken. ===SERVERS=== Not the best but could be worst. Huge amounts of lag. If you dont have a beefy computer dont even bother. Glitchy, broken, and god knows what.===FEEDBACK & COMMUNITY=== Now i'm not so sure about the community on the forums since i dont visit it very often but i sure can tell you a lot about the community ingame. Trolls, P2W, F2P, Flamers... wait... this suddenly sounds like LOL... There are good players in the game that SOMETIMES will help you go trough dungeons, farm, grind, give you items but that's very rare. Most of the time players will laugh at you for being weak and not spending money to get gud, laugh at your expense. Feedback...god almighty... dont get me started. ===PERFORMANCE=== My specs are on my profile, it's public so go take a look. Performance is pretty horrible, hehe, not surprised eh? The game has a wide options in graphics settings and visuals but most of, even if you put them all to low you will only get 10+ fps since the servers are bad or the game bad optimised. 1 or 2 changes to the right settings can give you 7-8+ fps while the rest 1 or 2 fps bonus. The game will look like♥♥♥♥♥♥on low. In average i get 20-30 FPS with my current specs on. Stronghold map, you will acces this map once you have a guild, i currently have around 6-15 fps on that map since it's their biggest map ever made... Make a gigantic map with a bad optimized game, not the brightest idea. On extra low settings you get like 2-3+ fps. Yeah. ===THE COMPANY=== Money grabbing company. Biggest changes you will see is making the game worse, deleting items that you cant find in pve or pvp only on store. They dont listen to feedback and mostly care for money. They fix bugs from time to time only for players not to leave the game completely. Give this game 1-2 years it will die. And that frikin Trickster Rogue is still op, both PVE and PVP, and we've been complaining from like...forever... ===IMPORTANT NOTES=== There are 3 currencies in the game, (4 if you count items, trading) ZEN - GOLD - ASTRAL DIAMONDS (AD)--ZEN = Currency you can get only from putting money in the game or exchanging Astral Diamonds. The value like any real currency floats. It can get bigger or smaller. In this game it only gets bigger which means more AD for 1 piece of ZEN. --GOLD = speaks for itself. COPPER - SILVER - GOLD--ASTRAL DIAMONDS = Astral diamonds you can only get from Dungeons,Events,Skirmishes,etc. There is an auction house which only works with ASTRAL DIAMONDS AND NOT GOLD ! English is not my native language so i'm sorry if i made any mistakes. You the reader will have to play for yourself and see how the game feels for you, if what i said here applies to you or not, if you feel it or not. You just have to play the game and see if you like it. I persoanlly did not like it.			"

												How's ""pay to win"" games fun? it's like using hacks or using gameshark on the older systems to gain advantage in this case you're buying the advantage with the in-app(game) stores. Not that other games without in-game stores can't do the same i supposed they can buy it out of the game if anything. After looking around the shops i realized that most of the items and weapons can easily be obtained with real money. SO NO THANKS!			"

												Due to Steam deleting my review which literally reached the character limit and I did not have it copied, I am going to just give a TLDR about this game.TLDR:I have over 3,000 hours on this game despite it saying 2 hours on Steam, $780 spent.No incentive to farm anything, no end game, not fun (PVE, PVP however is a cluster ♥♥♥♥ now), lots of removed content, broken classes, PVP is broken as hell, not worth it to farm anything, devs do not give a single sht about you, lots of lies from the devs, banned for making too much AD (main currency),  etc.Just no, don't invest your time or money in this game, it's bad.Edit: Since some people are illiterate and cannot read the comments, let me clarify.This game is NOT worth it for newcomers to get into, or old players to come back to, the only reason I kept playing was solely for PVP which I had near max gear. If you're a newcomer, it's going to take you quite a damn while to get near max gear, I gave up on PVE in Mod 5 (about a year and a half ago?) and only kept playing just for PVP. Most PVP players are in full groups with a near maxed/maxed guild (Guild boons, give a crazy amount of stat points) so you're not going to have fun, thus why I continued since it was worth it for me, a player who had near max gear.

												I would not recommend this game at this time if you are just starting out for a RPG MMO. First what WAS good about it:Neverwinter during it's first mod 1-4 was a great game, and as F2P was a excellent product. It's combat system at the time was a bit better than all the other MMO I have played, it wasn't just a stand in one place and hack away type of combat system, you had to watch what the adversary was doing and react. It had enough content to keep even the shortest attention span busy, and had a fairly well rounded grouping and dungeoneering system, with plenty of dungeons etc. As they added new powers and skills and classes they were well tested and fit in a cohesive manner, yes there were a few tweeks needed as they went live but they got on it and it worked. The refining (gem slotting) system was fairly easy and made sense and the professions (crafting) were well balanced (to an extent). The game was always advertised as casual friendly and alt friendly and it was, you could get up and running through the first 20 lvl and tutorials with logical steps, the newbie stages were well thought out and introduced you well to the features. If the class you started wasn't a good fit for you, it was easy to start another and have an alt. it wasn't too expensive to get additional character slots beyond the initial 2 so you could try other characters on with relative ease. The community was friendly, and while it's always had a gold/AD spammer problem (AD in game currency), it was a minor annoyance. You could earn in game currency through in game activities with some effort, and with some patience and hoarding and haggling get about anything you truely needed. Then the changes came....What IS bad about it:About mod 5 they started obsessing more about monitization and content pushs, than bug catching. The classes introduced were unbalanced from the get go and didn't seem cohesive. When they tried to ""balance"" things they went at it with a meat cleaver and only made what was bad even worse, then they had to hack back on something else with the cleaver. Despite a forum with tons and tons of suggestions and pleas, they ignored it all and bulled right on through to the detriment of both the game and the player participation levels. They never have gotten any semblance of balance to PvP and the same classes always dominate, the matching system that was rudimentary at first, but worked was ""improved"" to make it even worse, anyone not BIS in everything need not match up in pvp, you will hate it, it's a gear fest in the worst way and 2 classes are nearly god mode in pvp.Because of the monitization, they made some short term decisions that got people to buy more character slots, and invest in assets for crafting as a means to generate AD to keep up with the ever increasing and complicated refining system and the mod anfter mod gear obsolesence. They took the random dungeon drops (that were the whole reason to dungeon in the first place) away and put them in end chests that either were on timers or needed Zen (Store currency) to purchase keys. Rather than an insured odds of some drop, they nerfed even the chest rewards to items that were'nt salvagable or refinable. The in game ""loot chests"" that you needed another type of key got put on a increased rotation rate, so there was another whole set of chests in a month.Decision after decision, mod after mod they have done more to damage the game and annoy the player base. The mod 6 introduced a guild content push, locking lots of content behind forced groupingand huge material outlay to get to it (oh and of course you can pay money to get past all that material outlay....$100s and $100s of dollars). With that mod alone they effectively killed the ""casual play/alt friendly"" model they always pushed, the BIS stuff was all lokked way, way ebhind that guild content.They are at mod now, and way abck in mod5 when they nerfed all the AD generation they promised to ""fix"" things so those that play get rewarded, they have yet to deliver, they have only added some window dressing fixs that apply to the elite 10% and the rest are left out.They have changed the casual play to  a hit it and quit it model, unless you are the long time elite 10% you got no real reason to play, they advertise hard on the internet to bring in the new player and are trying to get the person that will make a huge money investment to get up to speed, then in 6-7 months, when they tire of spend spend spend, quit. With a new influx of new player behind them, they have did little to nothing to retain the middle ground player, and seems to have gone out of their way to antagonize them.My recommendation:Unless you have wads of cash you like to spend to get to a P2W status, you are going to hate the needlessly added grind and negligable ""if you play you are rewarded"" they never deliver. If you are a ""paper doll"" type of play, like to collect suits and clothes, it has a samll alure, but better plan on investing on baggage space to hold it all (RL money btw) since there is no stable or a wardrobe system inplace. Barring wads of cash, stay away from this one, otherwise within weeks you are going to be logging on to only place set stuff and then off, not really playing. "

												Don't play Neverwinter.Seriously!The game is over three years old and has still vast technical issues from day one and also laggs and framedrops on newer GPUs like GTX970 or GTX 980.Also this game is pay2win. You need additional bag space because they created a strange refinement system with hundreds! of different items while the bag space can cost you over 30 Dollar. You want an epic mount: Buy it. You want the best mount in the game, a legendary one, then spend several hundred dollars on the gamble lockbox machine.Certain key items that you need for your gear progression are locked behind the ingame shop.They will state you can get everything with time but that is a lie because they have somekind salvage system in the game that only exist to restrict your daily income and dungeon runs will net you no profit over that limited forced uppon you through this salvaging system.And even if you catch up, they can make an update to ""rebalance"" the game and litterally delete the progression of several years of work.The game has on PC at best only 20.000 player left from formerly 2 millions. PvP is unplayable because it lacks the playerbase and is otherwise broken because you can buy power if you are in a big guild (which is easier and faster upgradable if you spend money).The Foundry, one of the key features of the game is not playable and isn't updated in over two years.Seriously don't play this game. I played it since the beginning and only recently got rid of their own Steam-esque client because it opened a security hole in my firewall.			"

												This was my first MMORPG that I took seriously. I really enjoy the fact that it is based on D&D, as I play 4e in real life. I was specifically looking for games based on D&D when I came across Neverwinter. Started playing a lot, and found an AMAZING multi-game guild that are now like my extended family. Moved up the ranks in the guild, passed 1000 hours in-game... what can I say? I love this game.However, there are some negatives. Cryptic and Perfect World Entertainment have slowly been removing things from the game that players really used to enjoy, the Gateway being a big one. Before I started playing, apparently Coalescent Wards were in the Trade Bar Store, but now you can only get them with Zen or huge amounts of AD. Little things like that add up, and I know many players who left the game because of it. These changes also fundamentally destroyed parts of the in-game economy (the Zen<->AD trade comes to mind) and it still hasn't balanced itself out.All that said, I still really enjoy the game, and the Winter Festival (on now) is pretty awesome. The new content in Storm King's Thunder is great, though you need to be pretty high Item Level to solo it. I highly recommend joining a guild, and if you find me in-game (Tieran The Blind) I'd be happy to add you to our guild.EDIT JANUARY 2017:Well, they just changed the way the loot system at the end of dungeons works. They claim that there's new, better loot, but the big change is no previewing of chests before you use a key on it. I know this is probably how it works in most games, but it's been like this since the launch of Neverwinter and a LOT of people are angry about it. What really rubs me the wrong way is that PWE and Cryptic know they can do anything they want and most of their players will just suck it up and keep playing. We need to STOP playing for a bit, and send lots of negative feedback. If they see their numbers drop off a cliff, they'll listen.Until this is resolved, I'd say stay away unless you have friends playing.			"

												While I cannot recommed this game, it does have some good qualities. Unfortunately, the bad out weigh that by far. I started the game in beta. Initially, did not like the graphics but got use to it. The lack of dedicated controller setting is also an issue. The game gets many updates/extra content which can be both bad and good.Now on to the bad. They add things fairly regularly. But everytime they do, have to get the better equipment. Making the older stuff useless. They also have the 'gotta have em all' mentality by adding new items and such which means in most cases you either buy extra slots somewhere to keep the old and get the new or something to that effect. Recently, they removed Astral Diamonds(AD') from the leadership crafting. Astral Diamonds are an in game currency. They dropped it because they could not figure out how to stop the bots from being on Neverwinter. Instead of working on the problem, they punish the player. Then they have the 'gold sellers'. These sites get people to break the TOS of Neverwinter. When reporting gold sellers, they say that they cannot let you know the outcome of them looking into it. Asked them what the usual punishment was told they cannot say for same reasons. If they are just account banning those people, doesn't mean crap. They get another throw away email and go back to it. They should be IP banned. The bots and/or the gold sellers ruined the in game economy ages ago. The exchange is maxed at 500AD's for 1 Zen(real cash money to buy these). The game has turned into a grindfest of all grindfests. The game has went cash grab big time.  Look for another MMO that you can actually have fun in.			"

												The most recent expansion (Mod 6 - Elemental Evil) has the misfortune of being the single worst expansion for any game I've ever played.  The level cap was raised, but half of the new zones were recycled versions of previous zones, and there are zero new endgame dungeons, encounters, events, or zones.  All old items are obsolete, of course, and furthermore new tiers were added to every item type to encourage more people to use the cash shop.  There are only three dungeons to play while leveling up, where there used to be a dozen or more.  The new zones don't have traditional questing - just repeatable hourly kill quests you have to do 16 of before advancing to the next hub.  I could go on, but the end result is that this expansion feels like nothing more than a shameless cash grab with no new content.			"

With the current update up to 70 I have quit the game because its now the worst grind I've ever done by a monsterously big margin. Like.. repeating the exact same quests 16 times in an area to then move onto the next to do the EXACT same thing. What a load of♥♥♥♥♥♥ The developers in this expansion should all lose their jobs as this is the ♥♥♥♥♥est thing I've ever seen. And I've seen my own poop.

												At one point, this game was phenomenal, but sadly is no longer. The game took at turn for the worst upon the release of module 4: Tyranny of Dragons. The campaign system was already full of grind and repeating the same daily quests and was not very enjoyable for the most part. The staff decided the perfect solution, allowing one to pay 50 US dollars to completely skip the campaigns (each!) while also making the newest a larger time sink, not even making new zones for the quests. Only small extentions to questing areas and an additional small, single player dungeons. Upon raising the level cap, entire dungeons were removed (though, to be fair, they were added later by popular demand) and released a broken raid fraut with performance and connectivity issues that weren't fixed for weeks. The (relatively) new classes, Scourge Warlock and Oathbound Paladin, are unimaginitive and are, mechanically, variants of other classes. The Drangonborn race is blatantly ""pay to win,"" as you can only obtain it by paying for it. The racial passives are (subjectively) the most useful for all classes and can place bonus attribute points anywhere, unlike all of the other races which have a single bonus placed in locked attribute, and an aditional bonus that can be placed between 2 other attributes, or in the case of humans a single bonus in any attribute. If you are fan of Neverwinter Nights, Neverwinter Nights 2 or D&D in general, you'll be sorely disappointed. Classes lack creativity, many not very true to their classic renditions: Wizard being solely a control class and not having proper casts on spells, fighter being split into 2 seperate classes, ranger being nothing more that a fighter with abilities that have natural-esc names or effects and a warlock being a damage based wizard with some life steal mixed in. And the blatant abuse of classic characters is simply insulting to true D&D fans.			"

												Neverwinter looks and feels obsolete, in one word it’s tedious. What little Neverwinter has going for it is quickly crushed under a colossal load of bugs, asinine design choices, poor level design and the monotony of grinding.Pros:- engaging combat system (until it’s overexposed)- easy to play (I can haz buttonz to click 2)- free to play (no really it is. you can exchange game currency to the currency used in the pay shop, and getting the game currency is surprisingly easy, but does take a lot of grinding and time)Cons:- bad to sometimes broken animations (oh yeah we’re all contortionists)- poor sound (sound check, look it up)- textures vary greatly in quality even at maximum settings (gaze into the abyss of poor textures, also makes the textures gaze into you)- collision (I can clip a boulder but not a tiny torch?)- countless of bugs and server lags (I’m st...stu...stuck)- dull quests (wow another kill and collect quest, and there was much rejoicing)- end game is based around grind, and daily quests (another way of saying “we don’t care” or “we’re not that talented,” pick your poison).- poor level design (running back and forth is so fun)- several descriptions of talents/powers/items/quests in the game are either downright wrong or lacking crucial information (here take this boppermambu it will increase your batamino with something)- very little variation in what monsters can do (the bandit is an ogre in disguise)- Surprisingly bad story in a game based around D&D, one would think they had enough source material to pick from (once upon a time ... forget it, here take 8 dragons to fight for random loot).If you love narration, innovation, creativity and everything D&D stands for, avoid this game like the plague. If you want to laugh, as I did, of the cringe worthy bad design choices and poor executions hop on the wagon, it’s not really moving so it’s easy to catch.                                                                          //----------//If you do give it a try, which I think you should, here are some helpful macros. In the chat type:/gfxsetdefaultfov 90(sets the field of view to 90, in effect you zoom out, default is 55. Changing the numeric value changes the FoV)./bind f “interact”(This will make more sense once you try the game, but every now and then you will have trouble interacting with an object, either because the interact area is odd, or because another player is standing too close, This binds your F key to access only the object)/bind g “interactandloot”(This can be set in the menu, and is the standard interact option, it’s advisable to have it mapped to a key because on rare occasions you’ll need it. G was the key I mapped it to, you can obviously set it to any key)./bind h “gotocharacterselect”(again H was only the key I had it mapped to. Logging out and in is instant in this game if you can navigate through the menus fast enough, since every time you’re hit, the menu will close. This macro skips several menu steps and goes directly to the character select option, you still have to hit ""accept"" before you get hit, or take damage from a poison etc. This is useful when you want to complete a solo dungeon but is in a hurry, or tired of during the same dungeon over and over again, since you can run past all the trash mobs, log out to reset aggro, then in again to finish the boss)./hide(Makes you anonymous, useful to avoid pesky gold spammers, invites etc. But you can’t be invited into a party when this is on, but can still invite people into your own party, join PuG groups, and participate in encounters. You appear offline for friends)/friendsonly(Makes you anonymous for all but those on your friend list)/unhide(Removes the anonymous status, effectively ending both /hide and /friendsonly)There are several other macros that are fun to play around with, and I encourage you to try them out, since the customize options for the interface are limited.

												Really solid for a freebie; cool environments, awesome music and voice acting, and the combat is quick, varied and responsive. It takes a lot of dedication to try out a class to its fullest potential but replaying the leveling portions offers class and racial specific quests. Open instances are populated enough to be fun, but not crowded. Dungeon queuing could be more organized, its blind until you get in. Its got lots of content, and events seem to be coming fast and furious with unique items, mounts etc. The ingame currency to cash conversion rates seem a little steep, but its supply and demand, so I imagine the rates will drop over time.Overall, this is tough to pass up on!  9/10.

												I originally played this game during early beta (through their client) and found it to be a fun F2P MMO. However, there were a few issues with the games balance and I ultimatally stopped playing because of repeatitive endgame.I have recently come back to the game to see that it has drastically changed to the P2W model. Leveling has been nerfed and they request you to buy VIP packages to get to where it was, Astral Dimonds are much harder to obtain than they were before, making obtaining ZEN more arduous to get. Before you could spend about 2 weeks doing dailies and get enough ZEN to buy a mount. Now it would take a week of dailies to get enough ZEN for an Enchanted Key(one of the cheapest priced ZEN items).I would not recommend this game to anyone in its current state.			"

												Great combat system similar to TERA and other new-gen action MMOs and pretty decent looking settings/Gear. You see its true colors the moment you hit a larger city though, the whole pay-to-play kind of mechanic, all sorts of limitations that rely on purchasing things with real cash. An enjoyable game.....for the first 2-3 hours. Differently from what the Reviews they have posted on the store page say, no, the game did not learn from its predecessors. I also agree with other player reviews that stated healing classes arent really needed in groups, only in the really late game. Its pretty sad that this is where the name Neverwinter (A game i had alot of fun with) ended up.But, since it is ""free"", try it out and pass your own judgement.			"

												Neverwinter is an action mmo which requires you to be quick on your feet instead of just standing still in a corner while you mindlessly press your skill buttons, which most mmorpgs tend to be these days.The game features a dodge system where a red ring will appear when the enemy is about to do a powerful attack. If you don't dodge out of the way in time, you'll take a big amount of damage and you're more likely to die after that.Your skills aren't limited to mana. Each of them are on a cooldown timer which require you to plan ahead to make some big and powerful combos.The game currently features 6 different classes, all of which are unique and function in their own specific way. They're all interesting to play and doesn't feel bland.The graphics are really pretty to look at. The environments are very different from area to area and they're always fun and interesting to explore.The main storyline can easily be completed solo or with a few friends. There are a few optional dungeons and skirmishes along the way which require you to have a full party of 5 to be able to complete, if you don't have 4 friends available you'll be able to queue up and find other people who wants to complete the dungeon as well. But you aren't required to complete those dungeons or skirmishes if you want to progress in the main story line.It features one of the best, if not the best, paying options of all f2p mmo games out there.It closely resembles the paying options of Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2. You can chose to pay for items or you can chose to play the game and use the in-game currency called ""Astral Diamonds"" to buy store exclusive items. Most of these store exclusive items will also be available to purchase trough other players, either by directly trading with them or trough the in-game auction house.Note: The only store exclusive items that provide a stat bonus are companions, and they're pretty much worthless once you get to level 60 and start doing epic dungeons. However, you'll be able to get companions by just playing, but they won't be as powerful as their store counter-part.The devs have events about 1-2 times each month. Where you'll be able to get new items exclusive to said event or gain extra Astral Diamonds at a much faster pace than you normally would.They also regularly patch the game, either with bug fixes, balances fixes or new content. On top of that, they have also released new areas pretty often. The game went out of beta less than 6 months ago and they have already released 2 completely new endgame areas, a completely new class and a major overhaul of many of the in-game features.			"

												I've played this game FOR WEEKS BEFORE IT GOT INTO STEAM (that's why my hours are not registered on steam, so don't be so silly as to think my review is based on 12 minutes). Don't play it unless you're willing to spend A LOT OF REAL WORLD MONEY... A LOT! I MEAN IT! Otherwise you would need to play for too many hours to get what I call a decent character (one that doesn't make you fell obviously lagging behind others). Of course most of these hours would be filled with frustration and anger. Everything in the game is made annoyingly limited unless you pay (or play through eternity), including stash space for items, equipment, consumables, companions, mounts, etc...  You can even buy advantages for the PvP area (yes, it IS pay to win on PvP and pay for improvement on PvE). And don't you think the Starter Kit is a big deal, it's only a very small help. Besides, in my opinion, this game tries too hard to keep you playing constantly, there are ""bonus time"" and drops that you can get every few real hours (not gameplay hours), so to make you feel like losing items and oportunities if you're not there all day long, not to mention there are things you will lose if you don't login for a day (like gems that you gain only one each day and must accumulate at least 5 to exchange for some worthy item, meaning you must play for 5 days in a row or lose all you had accumulated).Other problems for me are that it's not an usual D&D RPG. Since it's an action RPG, don't expect a great story, it's OK, but nothing really compelling, and for me, it's actually slightly based on D&D, since character classes are pretty different from traditional D&D.There are good points of course, controls are fine, graphics are fine, you don't move like a slug, setting is big and well done, fights are nice, coop is worthy and sometimes necessary, there is a foundry where users can make their own quests and make them available to everyone else (so you'll never run out of things to do).The game actually got me impressed for the first few hours, but then, I began to fell like being deceited, like I needed to dedicate too much of my time and money to it. Of course you don't need to spend money if you don't want to, you can progress at a different pace and you can leave behind loot or sell very cheap the dozens of treasure boxes you don't have keys to open, but I really don't like this kind of thing, that's why I can't recommend it. For someone like me, it would be necessary to spend about US$ 200 or more to make the game enjoyable.			"

												Was a nice idea, combat is quite fun, there is enough lore, but its getting worse and worse, incompetent decisions by dev team are running the game in the ground, for a new player it would be a nightmare to start playing, bots and exploits running wild, ppl with large stacks of currency gained from exploits ruining the market, PvP is forgotten and only for rich ppl, company is grabbing money wherever they can without providing anything ppl would want to spend money on(no new cosmetic stuff for ages). Bugs take years to fix. Constant grind of daily quests and dungeons for tokens needed for equipment, while the dungeon drops are bad and almost worthless. Overpowered lockbox drops.			"

												The game is fun enough while levelling up, though expect a solo game. Once you get to cap there's barely any content, it's just tons of grinding to improve gear for no real reason. The game's pretty buggy, loads of outstanding issues. Very little polish, and newer content is often just re-used assets from the original areas.It's heavily monetised. PvP is entirely pay to win. The game constantly wants you to pay to bypass grinding.Maybe level up if you enjoy fantasy RPGs, but beyond that I wouldn't recommend it. It's aggressively after your cash and there are far, far better MMOs out there.			"

												All games have to make money, so I expect that some level of purchases will be required to play a F2P MMO at any kind of reasonable level of effectivness. But you are MUCH better off playing one of the superior subscription base MMO at $15 / month for access to everything a game has to offer than playing Neverwinter. This game is for suckers.Neverwinter has one of the most horribly abusive free to to play models I have encountered in an MMO. Basic game features such as upgrading companions would cost -- literally -- hundreds of dollars of purchases to attempt to maintain the aspects of your character at level. Don't even consider trying PVP unless you are willing to spend $100's to upgrade your character. This is in addition to the fact that the game is extremely linear and key features like the Foundary are taken off line for weeks at a time with no explanation or ETA when they will be fixed again. The developers are also willing to remove aspects of the game that players thave invested months of effort and significant amounts of money to force players to spend more money and increase their profitability.I can not recommend this game to anyone.

												i have to correct: its worthwhile until level 60 then all the pay2win aspects come to faceif you want to have a quick mmo blast for maybe 100-200 hours you can have that but there is nothing to do when you reach level 60 except running trough dungeons you already ran trough whilst leveling up but this time in tedious awful HP meatshield mode where everything has way too much HP and the bosses which are the only thing worth killing (if any) in the game spawn so many adds that the HP meatshield adds become the challenge every time and never the boss, then when youre done end up with no loot at all because the roll system is totaly screwed up.All loot drops except from epic t2 mode bosses are just placebo garbage that will never earn you any amount of astral diamonds(ingame currency) to upgrade your pets or enchants which costs hundredthousands of ADIF you have the rare luck to get your hands on an epic t2 boss drop its 99% of the time worth not more than 3000ad because the exploiters break the game and kill bosses with just 1 player which yields them 100% of the loot which then flood the auction house for minimum prices.. ive seen it multiple times and there are no GMs or support to do anything.

												Even though my time say 1.2 hours, I have played this game on XBOX ONE for hundreds of hours. Before Mod 5 this game was amazing for a free to play. The dungeons (That were taken out) Were creative and numerous enough where you didn't get bored. After the installation of future mods, the point of the developers became quite clear. They made a half broken game to keep you from leaving, all so you would spend money to get accepted into epic dungeons, and PVP.I don't really have much else to say, as more recent reviews have pinned this game down as entirely accurate. For new players, they will love it, but as you will discover, once you maxed your character as far as levels go, you will be booted, for not being an elite pay to win player, or your game will crash constantly from Cryptics absolutely terrible servers, and even more horrendous patches, which just add items for you to buy, and don't fix a damn thing.All in all, do not play this game. It is but a mere shadow of what it was when it first came out, and jumped head first off the cliff of greed, and terrible optimization. Don't believe me? Read the other reviews, they are completely accurate.P.S. Don't bother commenting on Cryptics forums, they will delete your well versed complaints, regardless of whether or not they are staight-forwards and critical. Not to mention, if you were like me, and spend $10 dollars for a mount, only to have the discount not go through, again, do not bother emailing them. They will blame you, even if you provide a screenshot as evidence that they ♥♥♥♥ed up.Run away now.			"

												PRO:-Really good visuals -Surprisingly fun combat systems (though clearly imbalanced) -The Foundry which lets you ""create your own quests"" for other players to play (though the editor is heavily limited)CON:Way too many to list for me to go into detail... -_- *sigh*-WAY too much grind in the form of Campaigns (the latest Tyranny of Dragons campaign is by far THE most disgusting culprit), and on that note, there's just too many Dailies in general...-Pay to Win (1% chance to successfully create a weapon/armor enchant, unless you pay $10 to have it guarantee success)-Pandering to rich people (the Dragonborn class can only be acquired by paying for a $100 Pack, Drow also used to be this way, but their Pack required $200...)-None of the quests are engaging in any way, shape or form.  Literally 95% of all quests are ""fetch quests"".-Chinese scam, spam and hack bots a-plenty-Almost 75% of the game revolves around RNG.-So many glitches and gameplay bugs that you'd swear this game was still in Beta... (you know what they say about PWE games...)-Little-to-no quality or polish (again, it's as if this game was created by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ chinese programmers who were paid minimum wage! :O)-The only server you can play on is an International one, so prepare for foreign idiots everywhere, and prepare to be misunderstood by roughly 50% of the playerbase who doesn't actually understand your language. ;)-It's published by PWE.  What'd you expect? :\Seriously, though.  The fact that Wizards of the Coast decided to choose ♥♥♥♥ing PWE, of ALL god-damn MMO companies, to publish and develop their game, is absolutely dissapointing.

												Long time fan of all things forgotten realms here, and I wish I could reccomend this game.  I wish I could say it's good.  I want it to be good.  I have tried multiple times to pick it up and give it another shot, especially now that rage of demons is out and I would have a  chance to play a game alongside Drizzt, the character that sucked me into this universe when I was young.  But the game is just... bad.  Chat innundated with spammers, a world that feels watered down and stripped of the lore that made the games so great, a complete lack of customization for classes... it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of everything that makes Dungeons and Dragons great.  Not to mention the advertisements everywhere for all the pay to win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the ridiculous prices they ask for the most inane things.This isn't dungeons and dragons. This is WoW with a badly done skin of dungeons and dragons thrown overtop of it.  Maybe I'll try it again someday, and maybe it will get better, but I just cannot reccomend this game, at least not to anyone who wants the depth and character that D&D and the Forgotten Realms is so famous for.  If you want to experience that?  Play the old games.  Pick up Baldur's Gate, or better yet, pick up a pencil and print yourself a character sheet and play actual dungeons and dragons.  If my opinion changes, so will this review, but this game has shown me nothing to hold my interest other than one module that is *completely* different for tabletop, but I don't know if I can stomach the rest to get to 60 to experience the different campaigns.

You can check out my full review of Neverwinter Online here[uncrownedreview.blogspot.com]I'd like to say that I don't think Neverwinter Online is inherently pay to win. Sure there are pay to win elements in the game that could easily be stamped out but that's not the most offensive part of this game.Let me tell you a story. Imagine a game called Neverwinter Online. In this fantasy world there was a beta server that a company called Cryptic set up specifically to test for bugs in upcoming patches and updates.A new class called the Hunter Ranger is scheduled to appear in the next update, but something is off about it. Every so often the stars will align and particle effects from a specific ability of the Hunter Ranger will not go away, lagging and crashing instances as particles are spewed out. Very frustrating, but Cryptic knows just what to do! It releases the Hunter Ranger and doesn't warn anyone about the known bugs and glitches with the class! For almost 3 weeks straight, instances are lagging and crashing as the players discover this bug for themselves. Finally, Cryptic decides to go ahead and patch the problem. It was then that the players found out the actual timeline of this bug. It was initially found six months earlier.This, is a true story.			"

												I played this game before it was released on steam, I got well over 150 hours or so.  at the start it's really really fun, playing alone or with a friend. It's not hard to gather items and get your set around mid-tier. I loved to play as Rogue as it was greatest DPS class.Until I got to late game... Even with the hours I spent at it, all of the items required to be at high tier is really really too grindy. I don't mind grinding, heck I've got 6 years of Mabinogi play-experience...that's grindy too! but the grinding in Neverwinter just don't feel rewarding, that's probably the reason why I lacked motivation to play. I loved the character I made however...She has horns, a tail, and an awesome bandana covering her mouth. A sly rogue she is. but sadly, the game after a long time just feels like you're not getting much futher, unless you grind,grind,grind , OR spend a LOT of money in it. I would recommend this game if you are looking for a fun early-game. Lategame, if you play to be super-tier, I hope you have a big wallet, or all the time and patience in the world for the grinding late game.			"

												At first I loved it a lot. It was very entertaining and there was a lot of stuff to do. Many maps and they are interesting. If I stopped playing back then my opinion would be certainly possitive. So what happened that made me change my mind? Well, after 60th level the game begins pay to win. You either buy premium objects or you end up with a character too weak to be able to do anything and constantly dying.So after some time I decided to give you a few examples:- Objects can be enhanced. How do you make them better? You need special objects that can be only bought using Astral Diamonds - and they are so expensive that farming them would get extremely boring.- The higher the enhancement level the lower chance of succeeding. You can make it higher. To get object that allows you, you will have to buy it for real money. Eventually spend several days for a chance to win.- You can get a companion that will help you. But after he reaches level 20 you must upgrade him. The only way to do so is by paying. If you will not upgrade him he won't be leveling up with you and eventually he'll become useless.			"

												I've said it before and I'll say it again: ""Perfect World!! ...cause our idea of a 'perfect world' is your money in our pockets!""Ever since Cryptic got under the Perfect World umbrella, all of thier decent games have become mediocre pay-to-win fests.  Cryptic still does a decent game, don't get me wrong, but the PW/Cryptic combo has no clue how to handle f2p.Just putting my lot in with the reviews.  Just read em!  Decent game ruined by greed, both from within the company and outside of it (botters).Tho, no one has touched on the community for this game.  Simply put?  It is TOXIC.My experience as a returning player goes as follows: Zone chat in the main hub and event areas... you may want to leave off.  It is almost nonstop botting and trash talking.  There is almost no true matchmaking for this game.  High level players are matched with low level players and the high level people almost never give a crap about the lower level people.  Most high levels can solo most of the dungeons in the game, but they are also in a hurry, so they speed run through... One shotting most of what they come across, taking shortcuts the new players don't know about which leaves them to fight entire groups on thier own.  Ask them to slow down?  They tell you (despite the fact that the game allowed you into the dungeon in the first place) that you're too weak for the dungeon and should go back and play the very first dungeon.  And the dungeon rewards?  performance based.  If you don't get high dps #'s, you don't get much reward.  And if you want much of anything in this game, you need those astral diamond rewards cause the auction house is PRICE GOUGED to hell on the stuff you truly need.  But, astral diamonds CAN be purchased via the Zen currency, avilable via Perfect World.  If you want to buy Zen, DO NOT purchase it via Steam!!  Even tho the game Zen store offers this as an option (useful), they DO NOT qualify you for the Zen bonus on purchase, nor do they qualify you for ""1st time buyer"" promos which offer useful stuff for newbs.  If you complain of this, Perfect World customer service will take the standpoint of ""too bad, so sad.  Look at this patch note post we did years ago.  There's a line at the end of a paragraph somewhere in there that tells you that Steam purchases are ineligible for these rewards.""Do you buy game gold from 3rd parties?  If you do, you deserve to be dragged over hot coals.5 out of 10, purely because of how cash shop intense this game is.  If I were to count community, I'd score it even lower.  Play it with friends (it can actually be fun still), play it for free till the grind gets too much, then wipe the character and play again.. or play another game.I do not recommend this game for the average MMO player based on the opinion that the average MMO gamer play MMOs like they were a single player game.  But if you like to socialize and play with friends... maybe.			"

												I used to LOVE Neverwinter, played it for 8+ hours a day for almost a year (I played most of my time not through Steam, if you're wondering why the numbers don't add up. After getting a few characters to max level, I find the game unenjoyable for several reasons. However, let me not be entirely biased to the negative aspects of the game, I shall list some pros too, if I can think of any that is...PROS:+Fun I guess, decent lasting appeal.+Cool animations, mechanics, and cinematics in my opinion.+Many ways to play your character.+Many dungeons, plus community made instances that make end game less dissatisfying, and it welcomes harder or easier instances than what is provided in the actual game.If I can think of more, I'll be sure to mention it.CONS:-Game can be really laggy if you don't have a high-end PC, poor optimization.-Quests, quests, quests.. Daily quests, instance quests, collecting quests, I'm tired of hearing the word quest.-Most of the dungeons provided are WAY too easy and drop absolutely rubbish gear.-Grindfest up to max level, I got bored and took several hiatuses while leveling my first and second characters.-You thought the grindfest was over at max level? Think again! Time to grind for good gear while getting overloaded with gear that's so garbage, it's comparable to Trump's campaign.-The community is honestly toxic. There's a lot of spammers, scammers, beggars, and elitists who look down on everyone else. The Elitists are the worst. I can't count the number of times I had to leave a dungeon because my gear wasn't to their standards. Screw you kids.And the biggest con of all, the one EVERY other review mentions...You ready?Me neither.PAY TO WIN BABY!You like green stuff in your wallet? Don't play this game.If you like this game, say goodbye to that green stuff!This game evolved from a sheer grindfest to who can waste the most money on an online video game. Fits in with the elitists. Allow me to simulate a conversation.1: ""Hey man! I just spent $200 on the game!""2: ""No way dude! I just finished farming for 8 hours and got nothing!""1: ""Man that's unfortunate! Good news for me though, I just spent another $200 and tricked out my first character! I'm so happy!""2: ""You wasted that much on the game?""1: ""Your gear sucks, don't talk to me pleb.""^Neverwinter in a nutshell.Don't play this game, it's terrible now. Cryptic put this game in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in recent months/years by adding an insane paywall to even be able to play with other people, unless you're lucky and wait for a few hours.. or days.. Stick to World of Warcraft, Rift, or something along those lines.			"

												Every time players find a way to have fun with their broken classes or discover a new way to make the game's currency inside the game, comes Cryptic idiotic management and ruins the game with nerfs and badly planned modules that create more problems that they can fix it.It is the kind of game that had everything to be a perfectly good experience, however ask any player (even if they still play the game) their opinions on the way the game is managed and you can be certain you will not hear one good comment. Another thing that you should now, before wasting hours of your time: grinding the free to play route is not an option. You'll pay a lot of money (USD 150+) just to be able to decently play your character in a broken game. When and if you find a way to do that, you should know, nothing good inside the game lasts more than 2-3 months, that is, your money has no value.			"

												The first few levels are fun. Then it starts to get a little repetitive. Then everything starts to take longer and longer and the game starts holding its hand out, coughing, suggesting you might like to spend some cash on just this one little thing. Late game is extremely grindy. I enjoyed it, I guess, but it just became too pay to play for me to continue.			"

												WHile the game has been so far, my recent Zen purchase through Steam has soured that experience.  After reading online I discovered that PWE puts every user who purchases Zen through Steam into a 'probation' where they can't spend their Zen until Steam transfers the money to them.  Supposedly this is to prevent money-laundering and fraud.  Nowhere was this stated during the purchase process.  So after five days or so after I made my purchase when I went to use my Zen, I was locked out!  Call it 'buyer's remorse' if you want, but I contacted PWE support saying I didn't agree with their policy and requested a refund,  They replied saying they can't do refunds of purchases through Steam.  So I tried contacting Steam support but their support page says they can't do refunds of purchases for this game and that they generally don't do refunds for in-game purchases after 2 days.  I tried sending Steam an email anyway explaining the situation.  It's been five days since then and they've yet to contact me.  In the meantime I'm not spending my Zen so a refund can be done, but all this time I keep seeing the in-game Zen-to-AD conversion rate dropping significantly so my Zen purchase 1.5 weeks ago is now worth a lot less.The game itself is great, but I have no desire to support a company that does this to their players and I would not recommend that anyone else does either.  If PWE doesn't trust Steam to to sell on their behalf then they simply shouldn't sell through Steam!  If I had just been warned that PWE would do this and their reason for doing it, I probably would have been fine with it.  But this whole debacle has just soured my experience of this game, and of Steam.			"

												Have been playing quite a bit of this game recently.  Just found out about the Foundry aaaaaaaaand...... it's gone.  That fact almost turned me off of this game if it wasn't the only good D&D game in my opinion.  The Foundry being broken is a pretty big deal though and I most likely will loss interest in simply playing this game as I normally do with MMO's.  The user generated quests got stupid excited only to be majorly let down by the game and by the support team that is supposed to cover the game.  TL;DR:  If you came for Foundry you might as well turn around unless you like boring MMO's			"

												I loved this game and also always went back to it. Pro is that it really is not a 'money grabber' and you could play this game free all along. To buy are general luxuries you don't really need. The game, even though it has been on the market for a very long time, is still full of people always and it never gets boring.  Now the bad part. I like to play solo a lot and that was possible till I got maxed out with 8 chars. I group sometimes but in general solo. Well now with the new expansions of ""Storm King's Thunder"" etc it seems you cannot solo any longer. Suddenly the game is forced grouping and that is way I am saying good bye to this game. Glad Horizon is on the horizon.			"

												Another franchise ruined by cryptic, first STO(star trek online), now D&D's Neverwinter, cryptic has done it again, managed to turn a great franchise into a shamefull, shallow, turn-key, coin-operated money machine.  Having beta'd STO i'm familiar to this nickel and diming by cryptic, and yes it is absolutely PAY to win, not truly play for free, as you can play for free but dont expect to be any good, regardless of your skill with your char, you will be at the mercy of people with PAY items which are substantially better than their non paid counterparts.  The game is a formulaic mmorpg, borrowing genre standards from various games, including some unique features like action style combat(gets boring quickly imho) and the abilitiy to create your own quests, which is the only thing about this game i actually like.  It is too under whelming, an extremely shallow d&d experience, sharing little but images and names of its original, deeper and more complex counterpart, for having sacrificed so much of what a D&D experience is, it is also inexcuseably boring and repetitive.  Cryptic definately didnt push itself to accomplish anything that would be a landmark experience, it feels like its the exact opposite, like a game done for a quick pay cheque.			"

												This game has a number of glaring issues that prevents it from being any fun. Ill list them in no meaningful order (aside from the first one being the worst)1.) Free to play ruins any chance this had at being a well balanced and fair game.  If you dont want to put $10,000 into this game then you will be behind everyone else and cant access quite a lot of things.2.) Limited skill bar. You can only have a total of 3 skills at any time which is fine for an action game, but I want more out of an MMo. Especially a dnd MMO.3.) 20 different currencies. The amount of currencies this game uses is just stupid. I played to level 20 and had like 12 different currencies.4.) Time requirements. To train followers, level professions, cast blessings or even do a few of the quests there is a time requirement. sometimes its 10 minutes, sometimes its 10 hours. (unless of course, you pay real money)5.) you need to be level 15 to use the friends list. Why they would do this in an MMO where playing with friends is huge I have no idea.6.) quests in parties arent completed at the same time. They have to be done for each person.7.) leveling is very slow. Im sure theres a way to make it quicker with real money though8.) Bag space is a BIG issue. You get 2 bags with a total of about 30 slots combined. Wouldnt be much of an issue if they didnt have so many redudant items you need to lug around. You also have no access to a stash or bank that I could find.9.) Redundant items. you have like 6 different ""kits"" for accessing different nodes scattered in dungeons and the world. It should just be one item to access these so youre not using 6 of your iventory spaces. Made worse by a few other gimmics like this.10.)You get a ton of these item chests that drop from mobs that you can only open by paying real money for keys. Its 125 zen for A SINGLE KEY. You can buy 1000 zen for $10. I had 20 of these chests by level 20 which means I would have had to spent $20 ON A FREE TO PLAY GAME to open these things.This game is a blight on the Neverwinter game. Anyone involved in this mess deserves to be fired.... Out of a canon.... into the sun.			"

												This is the first review I am doing for a game. Now to get to my rating it's a fun game for people that are lvl 70. With saying that I am talking about PvP in the game. They have enough AD to buy rank 7 ruins that make the game unfair to new players. They can pretty much almost one shot you.As for the PvE content it's fun to about level 60. There are only 4 dungoens you can run till you hit 70 so not much to do there. From 1 to 60 it's a straight forward quest line to level you pretty fast beleave I hit 60 in about two weeks or three about 1 to 2 hours a day. From 60 to 70 it is a big grind fest and that's hard since you get almost no exp for killing mobs you get your exp from quest. They do have their daily quest that you can do but even with them it took about 5 hours or so just to level from 60 to 61. Classes seem kinda broken they are all OP in their own way and that really kills PvP also but a good thing for PvE since you can solo all the way to 70 if you wanted too. Treats seem to be broken or just do nothing. As a tank I maxed out my CC Res so I would get hit lease but seems like everyone I come across stuns, roots, and whatever to me no problem. Then healers and the rouge classes can dodge almost every stun I can and then I have to play cat and mouse with them and by time I catch them I am already half dead and I can't get any skills off since they keep stunning me. I also maxed out the increse to the CC I do and it still does nothing for me. It just feels like stats are broken in this game and the only thing that matters are the ruins you put into your armor.Over all it's not the worse MMORPG I've played but it's not the best. I would rather stick with the real Dungoens and Dragons MMORPG for a free to play game. As for PvP I thought SWTOR was the worse but I was wrong. I give it a 4.5/10 And the stronghold like someone else said you need to be on a real active guild unless you can't even enjoy that.			"

												Dungeons & Dragons: Neverwinter is based on the AD&D 4.0 Core Ruleset, and I think that it's done rather well. The graphics, sounds, music, and locations are well developed & quite immersive too. Cryptic Studios made an amazing free-to-play (F2P) game, and you don't have to spend any real world money to level from 1-60; The game is not restrictive in anyway whatsoever.The character models are well detailed, and the combat movement are very engaging - albeit they could be more fluid. Combat itself is great to play, and I love that there are no auto-attack moves/spells; Everything must be done by the player in real time. In this case with regards to combat and action, you [the player] stay involved, focused, and must be have situational awareness -- something that I like very much.To me the only downsides to this game are the ridiculously over-priced items in the Zen Market, and the difficulty in acquiring Astral Diamonds. For the latter it may not be a problem for the very active player, but casual players are at a disadvantage IMO. I also personally feel that many of the zones are very linear, and closed-in - leaving no open world exploring in what I'd like in an MMORPG.Overall the game is a must-have to play for those that enjoy Fantasy RPG's. There's very little to be disappointed with here. I highly recommend this game, especially if you're looking for something F2P.			"

Before trying to argue with me note that this game is heavily p2w and you can't deny it.The problem with this game is that it has very annoying progress system. Either you have to put your life in to it (be a no lifer) or spend dozens of $. So dicide if you wanna play or not. It's really sad that it follows the line of Forgotten Realms. As you know the story, content and everything else is great but when you reach lvl 70 with any of your characters you'll face the sad truth where you'll understand that you've just screwed. You'll have to obtain some equipement sets to be useful in dungeon runs(or noone will inv you to any parties) and you won't get them free. You'll have to work your♥♥♥♥♥for it or pay and even you finally reach after some months the set will have significat stat changes and no longer will be useful. The pvp is the part that i don't even want to talk about. It's straight p2w. You'll get one hit by a kid who has 4 mythic artifacts. Besides that i have personal other problems with it's graphics. I run the game on lowest graphics settings and even like that fps doesn't get higher than 6 in battles and max i get is 25 when notmoving and doing nothing+no moving objects on screen. As a player who has 500+ hours gameplay i won't recommend it to newcomers or any other player.			"

												1st impressions of the dungeon experience in this game are very poor. I reached level 12 and got in the dungeon que after a few moments however thats where the problems began. I was shoved into a dungeon with two other players both of whom were lvl 70 synched to my lvl. because of the lvl discrepancy I was only able to actually attack one monster the whole time and the higher lvls not only left me behind but they killed the boss in two hits flat. This was the worst experience I have ever had in a game that offers dungeons especially since you get a treasure key in this game where you can only open ONE dungeon chest per day......this system is really not designed with balance or gameplay in mind, just money. If you want a dungeon experience thats fun and satisfying where you actually get to do something and contribute to the win, then look elsewhere.			"

												(THIS WAS REVIEWED IN OCT 2014, OBVIOUSLY THE GAMES CHANGED)The endgame is very limited and the games requirements to getting its own advantages to making it easier for you (horses, enchantments, armor, etc.) are overly exaggerated to the point where either playing or paying is a loss.The questing to get to LVL 60 can be done in under 6-10 hours, containing underdeveloped areas strictly for PVE and some dungeons which have balancing issues and require an amount of specific classes to complete.The classes you start with contain problems and balancing and have a distinct difference which determines how useless or how useful you are. Some people wouldn't want a guardian in their dungeon run because of the tanking being useless to a boss enemy that will just overwhelm you with damage and aggro imediately, but would want a guardian for PVP because of the defense it has, making the person who intialy chose that class rather regretful. The mages do a lot of DPS damage which makes them a favorable class. There are anomalies in this game that are aggrevating to see. PVE mini bosses sometimes dropped themed armor pieces that have better stats by a little but look very cool to edit, but sometimes you can get a guardians armor as a mage and this armor cannot be sold, traded, only worn and destroyed. But... you can't wear it either... so yea. The currency is limited also, where as after lvl 60, astral diamonds would become your main currency where as the coins would just be petty money to buy potions.The end game is very small and limited and will only have you playing for about one or two weeks before realizing what you're doing everyday is farming for goals like higher gear-rank, enchantments, wealth, mounts, armor, campaigns, which honestly don't open anymore of the game to you after thats completed.

												Well I  was playing the game since Beta and I was hooked on story and areas where ok ish...When beta was over I took a break for few months and came back and  lvled those 10 lvls to join the guild. The guild I was in was amaizng, they did everything end helped everyone and also  were very social. But things began to change when new mod arived with introduction of paladin. You see now if you where not a guardian or paladin good luck getting in to a dungeon. Every time I tried to play with random ppl as soon as they saw that I dont have a good item lvl they abandone the dungeon run. As for the guild itself it forged small circles of friends who would only brind individual ppl inside that circle of friends good luck if you are not in it :P  Now as for the game itself: the new lvling areas are f....ing stupid just hourlys do 50 hourls which include kill 10 things in 3 areas just to get 1 item that i need. All of my ad and gold went to  potions in order to keep me alive.All of the dungeosn were just upscaled in temrs of making a bit more powerfull mobs and most of them removed and never broguht back. You can no longer get ad for your T1/T2 items (so as you can see AD become soo harder to get now, you would have to manipulate the market and compite with prices, and do a loot of Heralods...)Finall note newest patch favoured paladins and  being in a good guild  is requirement, as everyone in the pug expects from you to get like amazing item lvl over a night...  I dont complain that I wasted 300h on it, nope I had fun until they became lazy with newest mod and only recycled all of it and favoured a loot ppl who buy items with real cash (they always did but now they made it absured) For the castle thingy or keep or how ever they call it, I did not bother playing it, the beta testing is in weird period it favoures NA players.. (you can only play at cerain hour).Like usually I will come back after few months or a year two see what happened to the game.FOR LAZY PPL: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU DONT HAVE A LOOT OF TIME AND ARE NOT IN THE GOOD GUILD AND ARENT WILLING TO SPEND REAL  MONEY ON IT!

												I was a big fan of the Neverwinter series. Hearing about a NWN mmo worried me a bit. And with good reason, it's everything i feared. Never turn a great series into an MMO. The same thing happened with the LoK series, it's like seeing your childhood hero prostituting himself/herself for attention.			"

												Tried this game out after looking for a decent MMO to play with my friends and was enjoying it up until we got to the first dungeon and realized at the end of it that we had to buy a key to open a chest to get loot at the end of the dungeon. This is a new low for F2P games, even EA doesn't make you pay to get the loot you earned.			"

												As long as you aren't looking to play ""seriously"" then it's pretty fun.If you want to put some effort into it and progress your character as far as you can go then you will have to put some money down.There are other MMO's on the market that will cost you far less. It's basically your typical cash grab free to play game.There is no middle ground, you can either play for fun and accept your character will always be behind or you can start putting money down to stay competitive. I can't recommend it because of the shift towards pay to win. It's a shame, this game had so much potential when it launched and now, this.			"

												 TL;DR Invest your time in something else. The core gameplay is great, it's fun and I legitimately enjoy it. This game has great potential, but the developer support for this game is borderline insulting. The ranger class was meant to be in the BETA, but it wasn't until 5 months after the game's official launch date that the Ranger class was finally added. It was at least 2 months before classes got a 2nd paragon path, and as of mod 6, the most recent mod as of this review, 11 dungeons have been REMOVED leaving only 3 dungeons between lvl 20 and 69, and in my relatively short play time I found at least 2 skills that were utterly broken (They had no effect what so ever). The vast majority of end game content is hourly quests, or grinding out ""Heroic Events"". They did add ""Campaigns"" which can take weeks to complete, but only provide a day or 2 worth of content at most. How it works is you complete a quest chain, and then start the first part of the campaign... and then wait... for 20 hours. Then you repeat this 2 more times to move on to the next stage, where you do a questline, and then wait for another 60 hours, and repeat. You also need an item which you can only get from daily quests to start each part of the campaign. "

												I dont mind spending money in a F2P if the game is good and the core mechanics of this game are great. Combat is fun, dungeons are fun, quests are ok. But it requires you to spend a ton of cash to be very successful. To many things that are necessary to play cannot be obtained reasonabley outside of the cash shop. It sucks mellineals complained the sub model out of existense and cursed us all with the microtransaction monstrosities because they dont want to pay for things. 99% of what makes this game♥♥♥♥♥♥ could be eliminated by perfect world if they just offered a sub. I hate SWOTOR too, but thats the best F2P model and its still more or less♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I'm really loving this game so far.  I've played quite a bit through three different classes, Great Weapon Fighter, Hunter Ranger, and Control Wizard.  I started only a few weeks ago but I'm thoroughly addicted and the paid aspects don't seem too bad, despite the other comments.Pros:Great dungeon designExcellent lore (DnD-verse, coincides with the actual tabletop PNP game)Satisfying hits on the classes I've played, really feels like you are doing cool stuff at even a low levelFun eventsReally complex and awesome guild system (Strongholds really feel like a base, and the map is incredibly large)Good variety of enemiesSolid voice actingInteresting quests, I actually read all the quest details in this game and it feels like there is a reason beyond ""kill 50 orcs""Cons:Lots of bots in PVP dominationLuck based refinements are really annoying and can add up in cost pretty quickApparently the end game can become really P2W in PVPSmall guilds (10 players or fewer) take a lonnnngggg time to upgrade strongholdsSomewhat annoying Zone chatMixed:Crafting system (I actually like this aspect of the game and find it like a game within the game, but it can take quite a long time to craft and level up your professions)Prayers over-level characters (I wanted to experience the content at a good pace, but prayers and dailies seem to level you so much you end up 5-10 levels higher than you should be for an area)GRIND (You NEED to like the grind to enjoy this game without paying.  Luckily me and my play group do)I am having an excellent time, and I don't mind dropping a few bucks here and there for the game.  Definitely give it a try!EDIT REGARDING ZEN FROM STEAM:Stupidly, the game doesn't like you purchasing Zen (in-game pay currency) from Steam.  IF YOU PURCHASE ZEN FROM THE STEAM WALLET INTERFACE YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO CLAIM THE FIRST-TIME BUYERS GUIDE, ALL ITEMS YOU PURCHASE WILL BE ACCOUNT BOUND, AND THE ZEN-ASTRAL DIAMOND EXCHANGE WILL NOT WORK (selling zen for AD, that is).I recommend using their Arc client.  You can find it on the neverwinter site.  This is really stupid and absolutely deserves to be fixed.			"

												Do not waste your time with this dying game. I have not seen this level of incompetence by a development team since the craptastic closed betas, and releases, of Vanguard and Age of Conan. Almost every decision, and change to the game, they have made since June has caused an ever decreasing population of actual players. The developers lie about the reason for making changes. The biggest, and most abused lie they spread, is that the changes are meant to stop bots and black market trade of Astral diamonds--every chnage they have made has only given more reason for players to make purchases from the black market and has done nothing to stop the infestation of bots.

												This game had a few good things to it but the game gets very unbalanced at certain parts. When it's near endgame the quests become too repetitive and boring which started killing the expierence for me. Then when I decide to try out pvp it was EXTREMELY unbalanced. Even at low level pvp it was unfair. People had OP gear and to a casual person like me, I didn't stand a chance. Though with all of that what ruined this game was that it was p2w. You can't get OP without spending a single penny on this game. Even though in the beginning was great it went downhill the more I played. I would not recommend anyone to play this game unless you are a rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who doesn't care about what they spend their money on.			"

												So, I have only been playing a few hours and it has already had a critical crash twice.  Both times right in the middle of a battle.  First time, I logged back in and my character was dead.  Second time...well that is the time I decided to never play again.  In all seriousness, the two crashes just pushed me over the edge.  I hate the free-to-play ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  They say it is free, but in reality, you have to pay to get anything good.  Example...when first creating my character, I had the option to add new character races, which were pretty interesting, and I wanted to try them.  Shortly after, I found out I was going to have to spend upwards of $50 (USD)...for EACH.  The stuff people were saying about needing to spend $10k to get the good stuff...they likely are not exaggerating.  No matter.  I prefer Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, and Sword Coast Legends gameplay to this.  In case any developers are listening--make more games like those.  I actually spend money on those games.			"

However with the recent updates thi game became 100% sh*t and just a scam to try to get mony from you. Plus most all the players have stoped playing. Would i recomend this game now... hell no.

												This game is fun for the first few areas you go to, but I think you'll find it hard-pressed to keep playing once you approach the midpoint of the area-based progression. Too often did I find myself simply going from area to area doing what seemed to be the same quests. That's not to mention that this game becomes a bit pay-2-win at around the point I'd previously stated, and PerfectWorld doesn't do a very good job maintaining it.extra note:This isn't really a criticism, but: if you're looking for a game that's pretty and generally not harsh on the eyes- you probably won't like this game.

												Where to start? This is a fun game. A bit repetitive, but fun.The good : controls are good and customizable, spells are interesting (or attacks), lore is good and worth a read and of course the D&D locations. Plenty to do and it's pretty fun to do. i.e. a lot of events and some dynamic events.The bad : WORST SERVERS EVER. Seriously. You WILL get disconnected. A LOT. No matter your internet. Graphics are passable, but not a TON of variety in gear. Currency system is friggin NUTS. There are SO MANY currencies and they are hard to keep track of. Not fun trying to find out what merchant takes what. Also, doing events FOR those currencies don't always reward you everything you need to actually BUY something. I.e. you'll kill dragons and get coins for it, but to get an item you need the coins, some super rare scrolls AND an UBER rare item to go with it all and you'll have NO IDEA where they drop without google. Storage space is non-existant UNLESS you buy it with real money. This game WILL nickle and dime you. Free is a relative term. Sure you can play, but if you want to be certain races, or get some of the cooler things, you must pay. Lastly, this game is SUPER grindy. All in all, i'll play it, but i cannot in good conscience recommend it.			"

												Neverwinter was once an Amazing game! Unfortunatly, module 5 brought many unwelcome changes. I have played since Module 3, (through Arc) and thouroly enjoyed it. Most of the positive reviews are prior to Module 5, so do not be fooled. Before Module 5, dungeons dropped loot to sell in the Auction House. The gap between moderate and well geared players was there, but not too prominent. The P2W factor was there, but it was rather controlled. Now... Dungeons drop currency used to buy BOP gear. Many dungeons were just completely removed from the game. Many maps are recycled. Seriouslt, 1 map is the same as another map, just upside down... Many mini dungeons are identicle top module 3 mini dungeons (with different monsters..). The new Strongholds expansion has completly destroyed the smaller guilds, as people left to join bigger guilds that could offer better Stats/boons (since when should a guild affiliation grant stat bonuses?!). The new higher level enchantments are extremely difficult and time consuming to grind for unless you pay money to buy supplies to refine them faster. The new VIP Program gives extra HP to member who pay for monthly VIP status. There are new artifact weapons every 2-4 months so the gear you do grind for is obsolete too quickly. When you refine your old artifact gear into the new sets, they only salvage about 75% of the original refinement points. Every time you buy something new in this game, it is nerfed (google teneborous enchantment). The PVP matchmaking is a disaster. I am constantly matched up against premade BIS players from the largest PVP guilds with the best boons. Solo queing into PVP will result in failure 9/10 times, as it COMPLETELY IGNORES differences in gear. This means a new lvl 70nplayer will be ""thrown to the wolves"" if he/she tries to pvp. I highly reccomend you stay clear of this game untill these huge issues are fixed. Definately save your money. Lvls 1-60 are decietfully fun and easy. Lvl 61 hits like a bus. The grind to lvl 70 takes forever. Please do not be fooled. Read the official neverwinter forums if you have any doubts.			"

												Neverwinter is visually stimulating, and has some unique mechanics, if poorly implemented. I got my rogue to 60 and ran out of content in the first week. I've visited the game here and there over time, but the game feels like a hollow shell to me. Theres almost no character specialization, which is why I love D&D, and the quest creations (one of the big draws during beta) was little more than a sham.A while back, they announced plans to stabalize the in-game economy, but I honestly don't care enough to come back.This game is VERY watered down. Pros- Visually pretty- Fluid combat- D&D franchise- Mostly free (I regret buying my way into the beta)- Elf Women- Kill a dragon with knives.Cons- Virtually no character specialization (theres a talent tree, but its the blandest thing Ive ever seen.)- Dragonborn characters cost $75 USD (what? who drops that kind of money on DLC???)- Spam. Lots of it.- Kill ten rats. - Kill 10 Orcs.- Kill 10 Ogrest.- Kill 10 Zombies.- Kill 10 goblins- Pay 3 PVP matches.- Login To worship your diety for gems.- Login to send out crafters.- Login to worhship your diety for gems.- Do I actually care about crafting?- Login to worship... eh who cares anymore?- Uninstall.

												I have to say that I have never been more frustrated with a game company in my life. I wanted to play neverwinter and champions online again after a long break. I came back to find my account was hacked and all my characters and money was gone from both games. I was still able to login to the game and my arc account without issue. I submitted a ticket and subscribed to champions online to get started. No sooner did I pay for my subscription than my account was listed as banned and I was emailed for verification details. It has been 4 days since is sent the details and I havent been able to play either game. I recieved an email 3 days ago saying that my ticket has been escalated, but have heard nothing since then. I cannot believe the incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ support and response time, but also that they would lock me out of my account after I subscribed. I highly doubt I would get reimbersed for this time even if I still wanted to play (which I dont at this point).To put this in perspective, I thought I had cancelled my 6-month autorenew for WoW and I noticed I was charged for another 6 months the other day. Less than 24 hours after submitting my ticket I had a full reimbursement without any additional fuss.			"

												Neverwinter is a good game, yes, I'm not recommending it and I certainly won't play it ever again, but I want you to know right off the bat that it's not a ""bad"" game and you may even like it. I didn't.At first the ""move with AWSD, click to swing the sword, etc"" thing seems pretty fun and original, but it gets dull quickly, specially considering that you only have 4 powers that you can use anytime. The game aims to have a combat system similar to non-MMO RPG's but fails utterly. The PVP system is absurd and boring: Rogues defeat any other class with almost no effort, they negate damage, avoid attacks, backstab for ridiculous damage and seem almost invulnerable at times. But PVP seems to be the weak spor for many MMORPG's nowadays so it's not a very damaging characteristic that PVP is completely broken and unplayable.I personally found the game to have too much payed content (races, mounts, etc). Again, many RPG's nowadays have the exact same problem so it's not really damaging for the game to block a lot of content from free players, but it's something you should consider before downloading the game, if you download the game at all, I mean.Next thing, the quests: they are boring and unoriginal (even the user created ones), go here, kill that, pick that. The loot is mediocre and it certainly doesn't help that most armor and weapons look exactly the same (I mean EXACTLY the same, every other player with the same class and level as you will have the same armor and the same weapons). A feeling of ""Why the hell am I doing this?"" hits you constantly while you play, to the point that you may find yourself not wanting to play anymore and deleting the game some days later (what happened to me). Why would I stick around in a game that feels like a chore instead of a fun activity? or the most important question: why would I stick around in a game if I have no fun while playing it?There are definitely other F2P MMORPG's that are way better than Neverwinter out there, many, many MMORPG's. But if you really want to play it, don't let this review stop you, you may even like it.			"

												A fun game to play for the most part... if you have either 2 or 4 friends that play it with you. The dundeon queue used to allow anywhere from 1-5 players to tackle a dungeon. I solo'd a few once lvl'd up enough. Now you have to have either 3 or 5. Dungeoning was what made the game fun. That and a pretty lackluster loot system and regular game crashes and server disconnects make me not really care much for this game anymore. Not worth playing free, let alone spending any money on. There are much better choices out there.			"

												This game is a cash grab and some of the dungeons have platforming which fails miserably as some races cannot do it and people have to wait for some miracle to happen. Doing the same dailies everyday gets old quick after the first week and most dungeons are not worth doing. Pvp is only for braggin rights and not much else to do after your pvp gear is maxed. You will get bored. My guild leader was playing bdo in between times when he couldnt find anything for us as a guild to do. We ended up just venturing to other games and becoming a community just to keep in touch on the same ts. I love dungeons and dragons lore and the books. Even the table top games but this is not the way to make a dungeons and dragons mmorpg. The world is so small and even with Drizzt thrown in with some cut scenes cant save it. Dont bother with this game. You will get bored after your first playthrough of the content in 1-2 months of reaching 70. And find maxing out your pve gear score is not worth it. The grind time or even your hard earned money will feel like a complete waste.			"

												I get that F2P is going to involve microtransactions [and have enjoyed several games that have had them; TSW, CO, etc.], but this game takes it to an extreme that makes the game itself not very fun but, on the bright side, it will let you know if you are really bad at math by continuing to play]. It became quickly boring when I found out that my companions would hit a rank cap very early on that would require roughly $10 [there is a 2nd MT to get that companion to the next level of rank, no idea how much that is]. You have slots for 19 companions, BTW. Or you can buy the companions for about $20 each. Keep in mind, this is only ONE way to spend cash in this game. Also, the lockboxes are a ""rare"" drop [I have about 100 of them across 4 toons, none of which have hit 30], however, the only way to open them is to buy the keys... which cost about $1 each. It is impossible to get a key to drop as loot in the game.I know they need to make their money, but I would prefer a game that is not sticking me for cash at every corner in order to advance. I would rather just pay a monthly fee. Then, if the game is good, I will stay and continue to pay.			"

												From Thumbs Up to Thumbs Down.I used to like and enjoy this game, but it's gone to crap now.  It has turned into a P2W grind-fest.  The only way you're doing a majority of the end-game content is via buying the upgrade and refining materials and so on.  And if you don't, you'll die.Blatant and garbage.

												Despite being a D&D Forgotten Realms license this is actually a trick to get fans to download it, you download the game and it's barely D&D at all, if you're a fan of other games in Neverwinter the city itself looks cool but even the plot is bad for the setting. Even if you take the setting and plot issues out of the equation and look at it on its own the game mechanics aren't great, action combat has been done much better in other games that didn't try to ruin a pre-existing license.+ Cool to walk around Neverwinter city in an MMO+ Flashy graphics- Setting/license and gameplay disconnect- Continuity issues with the setting- Stupid things hidden behind paywall- Lame plot that doesn't hook you in enoughIf you want a good D&D MMO, just try DDO because even with all its faults it's still better and needs more players anyway.

												I had a difficult time figuring out whether i would give this a thumbs up or down. After much thought, I decided on a thumbs down. If you are the type of gamer that is willing to put hundreds of hours into one toon and still not get your toon super geared out, then this game will work very well for you.If you the type that likes to get there relatively quick, then this might not be the game for you, and if you are an altaholic, then this game most definitely is not for you. Don't even bother.This game started out very well. Very strong, and had plenty of potential. The graphics were and always have been kind of dated, but the gameplay for a while made up for that. And the storyline, if you chose to read everything, was very compelling. The biggest problem really goes into what I explained first. This game kind of caters to a particular niche. For the hardcore grinders. Thats about it. They have not been able to find a happy medium to draw a generic crowd. That's about really it, and that is enough for me not to recomend this in general.

It's fun even if you play it as a single-player action game.I rate this game 3 out of 5 paywalled races.			"

												Used to love this game, the gameplay was fun and the story immersive. Then came Mod 6. I was so exicted, there was new story, new questlines, new level cap. It was going to be amazing. Then it turned out to be just a bunch of daily quests. No new storyline quests, just something that said ""Hey, go to the drowned shore, etc. and play the same quests OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

												I have logged around 470 hours on this game with a GWF. While this is not alot of time compared to some of the players, I feel my review will hit home with people who have families and an actual career. Let me start off by pointing out the good things about this game:- I actually liked the community. Most players I came across were more than willing to help you get started and impart their knowledge about the game- Graphics were nice for an MMORPG. Some of the areas in the world even reminded me of the graphics of some of the elven locations in WoW- It truly is Free-to-Play provided you aim for PvE. More on this as a con as wellNegatives:- O.M.G. The grind is ridiculous. Whatever the developer's lose by making this game free, they gain more than that back by frustrating players into spending in-game currency to obtain. This is after they bait new players by making the lvl 1-60 leveling a breeze. It took me all of 2 weeks (about 2-3 hours a day) of getting to 60. It took me another 2 weeks to get to 70. By then, I was hooked and wanted fast results. Sneaky by the dev's.- Linked to the point above, this is not a game you will enjoy if you have a family and career that you are passionate about. A game like this literally demands 1000's of hours to get to the top- The NW world is ridiculously small. There are less than 20 locations that you can visit to do quests in.- Grinding astral diamonds is not easy. Again, it is a grind-fest. I understand that games like this require grinding, but the amount of time it took me to grind enough AD to afford a decent mount in Mod 9 was just baffling.Overall, I do not want to write too much but in my personal opinion, this game is only for MMORPG fans who have gone broke and have no job or life.

												Simply P2W with the recent changes. If you want your character to be competitive in PvE or especially PvP, you MUST pay largeish sums of real money.

												Used to love this game. Still do. But it is quickly turning into a pay to win. They are quickly limiting you to how much astrol diamonds, the main currency in the game, you can earn and eliminating ways to earn it. I was quick to delete it off of that basis alone. Then, to add insult to injury, you can not transfer your character from the Xbox to PC in viseversa . they claim its because the worlds are different, but its easy to see that its so you have to pay for more currency to rebuild the loss. Their customer service is crap. Very rude, down to the trouble shooting page its self. I will not return unless this game is fixed.			"

												NOTE: I have been playing this game for some years now. And am judging based off my own opinion and experiences.As said above, I have been playing since nearly the start of this game, with little to no complaints. Though Neverwinter is now long past any similarity to what it used to be, it can still be an enjoyable game with lots of story and lore. Though the community takes a little to get used to, and work with. For the content they have added and thus also taken away, I would say that I could not agree with a lot of their actions on this as it has taken away a lot of the casual play and enjoyment away from what the game once had. Though it is free to play, it does have heavy pay to play elements to it as well, which is highly evident in PvP. The new class changeups have also played against what used to be an accepted balanced system. The new mod to be released will add in Strongholds for individual guilds to take and/or fight over in PvP battles. This will indeed give a new reason to be a part of a good and trusted guild, which many can be found here.I will say that if you have friends or plan to make some Neverwinter can be a good place for that. Personally, I have made many online friends here who I still know a couple of years down the road. I give Neverwinter, my old home away from home, a thumbs up as it is a good game to play for free to play.			"

												I've played this game for about 20 hours now. I leveled a Half-Elf ranger from level 1-40, and I can't say I recommend this game right now. In a lot of ways, NW falls short of the WoW watermark, and that's a shame, because I was hoping it would be a good successor to DDO and WoW as an MMO great. Let me say that on my SLI GTX 760s I did not experience any stutter. The game didn't even access more than 30% of these cards during play, which makes me think this could be played on a tablet if someone wanted to. Which is good if you don't have a system with great specs. Secondly, the game's visuals are only okay by 2010-2011 standards. This was released in 2013, and in 2016, it looks bad. Graphics are very flat with no shadows, no specular highlights, and no volumetric fog at all. Player meshes look like they were designed for cell phone support. Overall, visually, this is the worst MMO I've played in a great while.But that wouldn't be a reason that I wouldn't recommend it, that comes in with the gameplay, and its annoyances start to become more apparent the longer you play and come into your class. As a ranger specializing in archery, I progressed through the game, but found myself fighting with the mechanics of the game more than the monsters. Either a mob would path behind a wall and I'd lose my shot on them, or the skill that I chose to control aggro of mobs just wasn't all that good. One of the rooting shots in the Hunter tree roots for about 1 second, even on rank 3/4...(You don't gain access to the 4th tier of abilities until level 70).But the main reason why I won't be playing this too much longer is because of the game's broken companion AI. It's terrible. You can't set your pet to aggressive, passive, or neutral. And that makes it impossible to use the companion as a tank. On average, my companion was able to pull aggro on 2/5 of every mob set I went into. That's simply not good enough. You can't even tell the pet to attack before you shoot your bow, so you have basically no control over aggro whatsoever. With my reduced threat perk maxed, I always wound up with enemies charging at me, and running out of stamina too quickly.There were times when I would trigger combat intentionally, wait for the companion to charge in and get some hits, then I would retreat to max bow range only to have the companion disengage for no reason and come running to me. I don't get it. This would happen in crypt-sized dungeons as well as outdoor maps.In addition, around level 40, the game starts setting you up with obvious AMBUSH chokepoints on the map, which antagonize your abilities to no end. Hunter/Archer skills are about keeping an enemy at range, and when you have to walk onto a trigger point where 10 enemies pop in surrounding you on all sides at point blank range, it makes everything in your action bar kind of pointless.Bottom line, if you're going to do this, don't play a ranged class unless you have a friend dedicated to going through the quests with you. It's pointless, and I just wasted 20 hours figuring that out. Until they fix these issues, I can't recommend Neverwinter.			"

												This review is currently in progress and should only be taken as a first impression of the game.Graphics: 7Gritty and decently realistic, but textures are unusually low quality and character models are a bit chunky.Sound: 7Average sound, not bad, not good.  Has decent voice overs.Gameplay: 5Combat similair to Tera online except you can't move while attacking, only dodge moves.  It suffers the same problem as Tera online that it's just hiding the targeting from you, but still auto targets whichever monster is closest to your cursor when you attack.  This is extremly obvious on a ranger where the split arrow move is very difficult to aim as you can't aim between enemies to hit them both, when you right click your camera auto targets one of the enemies making the attack less accurate.Like every other MMO, it follows the questing format that we've all grown bored of.Impression: 3As an MMO it doesn't break any new ground that hasn't already been broken by Tera online.  The graphics are lower than some newer MMO's, the combat is slower, and the quests are still boring.  The game makes a vague attempt to play to neverwinter lore, but then falls appart with pre-made canned characters removing the ability to apply dungeons and dragons like upgrades.  If you were hoping to roll your own character, play Dungeons and Dragons online instead which does a much better job of letting you roll play your own character.Value: ?Unknown, haven't played long enough.Summary (In progress):I see no reason for this game to exist, the same formula has been used countless times before.  If your in this for the social aspect, play the game the rest of your friends are playing.  If your looking for D&D style roll playing, play D&D Online.  If your looking for active combat, play Tera online or Vindictus.			"

It was all right, but the gameplay was just the same every time. They try to push DLC in your face or buying zen so you can get cheap ingame stuff that will probably just get weak with the next update. I don't like to pay for ingame items in MMOs TBH, so that just annoyed me. Plus 10 bucks for a character slot? No thanks. And the prices for the DLC. Christ almighty. Then again it IS Wizards of the Coast, I mean just look at the prices for they're D&D books and statues. Anyway it's not a terrible game, I just found it dull after a while. Plus as of this writing dungeons are broken and have been broken since I started playing and it doesn't seem like there will be a fix anytime soon.

												I don't recommend this game for Free-to-Play players that likes pvp. PVP is pay-to-win. IF you have a large wallet and buy zen to exchange them for millions of astral diamonds you can win here but if you don't, you'll spend years to get the rank 12 enchantments which are by the way the way to win PVP.If you like PVE that has story this is the game you're looking for .

												Keep in mind that this game uses a 3rd party DRM which really sucks. Also there is no interegeration with Steam at all, no traiding cards, no achievements, nothing. Also it's pretty buggy and feels like a beta to me. Not close to being finnished. If you want a game like WoW, but free, try Rift. If I remember it right, it's a lot better than this and not as P2W as this is. You pretty much need to pay for everything, including companions and mounts if you don't want to spend half your lifetime trying to get them.Personally, this game gets 4/10, kinda fun, but way too buggy and P2W, sadly.

ALmost totally pointless to try for the endgame. As for anything else though I got my enjoyment out of it for being free.Would I recommend it? If I could go back to the beta I would tell myself to stay the hell away and just goto the local Library and find real people to play REAL D&D. would have been more enjoyable			"

												just put it this way, the game is F2P, its an RPG, lots of folks play, you can still quest and do dungeons even without the super rare legendary ""ive been playing a lot longer than you"" gear. could the game use some more work, yeah, but the way it is, the game is still decent. IMO, they should focus on improving the game overall rather than keep releasing new modules. or at least focus on game mechanics, etc for next two major updates, then go back to releasing modules. i may not have a lot of time invested in the game to voice my opinion about the game overall, but i like RPG's and while im not a hardcore player, im sure somebody would value this opinion/review.

												Although all the cons, I'm still recommending this game. It is simply fun. If you do not have high expectations, just wish to spend some time it is your game.Pros: - Well it is fun. The quests are narrated, and have real stories. Also you can find lots of lore objects to know more about the world.- Looks nice.- Almost all of the tools / interfaces are reachable from Browser.- Have a minigame with dice-rolling, from browser, if you have 5-10 mins during the day. The minigame can yield in useful items. (I have not told it will be quick, as the Tier6 dungeons are really hard - like collect 18 shield from 8 dice...)- Have some connections with the original Neverwinter games.Cons:- It is not D&D.- Still bugging after almost 1 year, eg: many times the daily quests cannot be completed.- Lagging, in dungeons the latency usually fine, but around peak hours it is (or at least feels like) more than a second, and with the dodging system, it is sometimes lethal.- Graphics of the game is nice, but clattering. It would really need some optimalization- The PvE part is fun, till lv 55 and after it became hard, and turning to a pay to win game.- The PVP part is still under development, some pvp is available, but the single map became boring after a while.- Items has variety of looks, although the same item looks the same on all of the races. At least as dwarf, I have not seen any difference from sun elf, or from humans.- To gather the ""real"" money, the astral diamond is really slow, and painful. (daily quest gives 3k - x4 as there are 4 quests, with 1-1 hour to complete-, while 300k is needed for the simplest upgrade - horse, companion, ...).- It may be annoys you, but the game constantly downloading in the background.Actually the Zen / AD system (astral diamond) is confusing to be bad or good. It is the same as all Perfect World games.- You can buy Zen. It is an universal curency within PW games. If you transfer it to NW, it can be traded for AD in the exchange, or use it to buy items directly from Zen market. As the game is free to play and the servers has to be maintened, this will generate the income they are loosing with removing the monthly fee.- It is mentioned that everything can be collected just with play without pay. Right. To collect 1 purple artisan resource, you need 4 blue, 1 blue is 4 green, 1 green is 4 white(lv3), 1 white (lv3) is 4 white (lv2), 1 white (lv2) is 4 white (lv1), each trainings are 18 hours (offline time also counts). It is 1365 cycle x 18 hours, which is ~1000 days. At lv 60, you possibly have 5-6 slots opened already, so it is ~200 days.  And you will need 9 as you have a total 9 slots for professions. Or you can buy profession pack with a chance of green/blue/purple resource for Zen or for AD from AH (green 250k, blue 1mill, purple 4 mill AD).- Also myths on the internet are saying, with proper trading you can gather 300k AD / day, and there are several guides available on the internet how, but for it you have to be professional stock handler (Zen / AD exchange), or tradesman constantly monitoring the offers and needs on the AH.

												I've changed this review several times. The game gets good, the game gets bad, and then it gets mediocre again.But this time they can't bring me back, and I know for a fact that they have lost many other loyal fans.With the addition of Module 6, Elemental Evil, came the realization that the developers behind this game care nothing for it, and only care to fill Cryptic's wallets.They do not develop the game. They develop a business, and a shoddy one at that.With this most recent module came a level cap increase. This increase was very poorly integrated, both from a chronological standpoint as well as a financial standpoint. It was released only a few months after the ""Rise of Tiamat"" campaign, which introduced the game's first set of Legendary ""Artifact"" weapons and armor. These were made obsolete by the raise in level cap. Also integrated were several new maps, which proved equally as useless and buggy. They were essentially re-lit versions of maps from old campaigns. Mind you, Module 6 was postponed a whole month from it's original date; for what? Exceedingly subpar, untested content.For several months now, the developers have been growing increasingly greedy; discovering all the ways they can obtain peoples' money. Mounts, bags, respecs, rerolls, race changes, companions, a number of sneaky maneuvers that get you to believe ""Oh, it's just a few dollars here and there, for convenience."" They aren't convenient. They are Cryptic's. Whatever you purchase with your money is still THEIRS. They can change the parameters of what you've puchased at any time. That is to say, they can remove items from packs, change them from being bound to account to being bind on equip or bind on pickup, and not even change the item's description in doing so. And you can do nothing about it.They fired their old dev after Mod 6's release, hired a new one, and he immediately promised to ""fix the game."" He hardly acknowledged many of the most prominant complaints, and in his first hotpatch made the purchasable bags ""Bind on Equip"" from ""Bound to Account.""A community moderator from their forums gave me an interesting quote to work with:""This has been said repeatedly, ad infinitum and ad nauseam: Read and abide by the Rules of Conduct. Then you won't have to worry about being moderated--and no, you don't get to interpret them to your liking.This isn't your soapbox. This isn't your crap can. You are, in a manner of speaking, in Cryptic's house. The rules of Conduct are the house rules. You wouldn't go into someone else's house and talk a bunch of crud about their house and how they run it, and not expect to be abruptly shown the door, no? Then don't expect to be able to do it here.There is a way to go about showing concern and dissatisfaction besides being insulting, condescending, rude, or demeaning. We don't expect everything to be sunshine and rainbows but there is a constructive and civilized way to go about it.""-lewstelamon01, Community ModeratorThis quote pretty much shows you how much of a catch-22 their customer support is. There are constructive ways of going about it, but what is ""constructive"" is purely based on their judgement alone. I have seen many a support thread shut down, by this moderator and others, because it was ""unconstructive.""They weed through, delete the flack, and make sure to remove anything remotely within the parameters of their ""Moderator handbook"" so that the forums look clean and pretty to any new onlooker that might be seaching for an opinion on the game.Hopelessly corrupt and nearing a fatal blow, is how I would describe Neverwinter Online. Don't let them see a penny of your money unless you want it to slip into the abyss.			"

												I first picked this game up when it was released. My initial impression was good. A Free to Play that seemed to allow players to advance without spending real money, albeit  a bit slower than paying players, is acceptable. The combat system is not quite what I was expecting from a D&D title (cooldown based abilities all around), but it is still a LOT of fun. Very easy, quick controls that respond well, as long as the server is not lagging (which, unfortunately, happens a LOT). But I still played it, and had a lot of fun doing so. I spent a little money on it, just so I could open some of those lockboxes, and I did manage to get an epic sword and cloak out of them. This was a couple of years ago, though, before the changes that recently hit. Since then, they have taken this game from a Free-to-Play to an all out money grab. It has gone from Free-to-Play, to Pay-to-Win. -AD rewards have been nerfed. No way to acquire the currency needed to buy things from the auction house unless you buy something from the Zen market first. -The zone dungeons are broken (literally removed from the game, for reasons I will speculate on later). -We now have at least 3 types of those infernal, blasted, annoying, inventory-slot-robbing lockboxes that can only be opened with a key that can only be acquired through the Zen market. I have only seen 3 types; there are likely more, and they drop CONSTANTLY. You WILL get them, even when you don't want them. There are constant system messages pasting across the screen, stating things like,""So-and-so just got an epic whats-it-ma-thingy-with-flames-flying-from-its-rump from a Rusted, drops-all-the-time, yet somehow still shows EPIC rarity lockbox of money grabbing."" -Loot drops, which were never all that great, are now an abysmal joke. I consistently see the same 2 or 3 pieces of armor dropping in every single zone.-Quest rewards are a waste, if not an outright insult. Remember when I said the dungeons were removed? Yeah, those used to be the only source of decent gear in the game that didn't require you to open your wallet. They're gone now, but the devs left the quest links and markers in place. I saw all these changes, and I decided to conduct an experiment. I bought $50.00 worth of Zen and bought as many keys as I could. I think I ended up with thirty of them, making each one cost about $1.60. I had some Zen left over, but not enough to buy anything without coughing up more real money (seriously, do ALL of these games have pricing schemes that make it impossible to take your ""currency"" balance to zero?). Anyway, I opened 30 of those damnable lock boxes, and got CRAP. A handful of epic enchantments. A couple of blue craftsmen. Oh, and a 5th character slot for buying stuff on the Zen market. 50 bucks got me NOTHING worth mentioning. No epic gear, like it was in the early days. No new mounts. Just a bunch of enchantments, runestones, and a modest amount of astral diamonds. Pathetic. I could go on, but I won't. I'll just say that this game was, when it launched, much less greedy. Players who spent a few bucks would be rewarded with epic gear that levelled with their character, or a cool mount. Not any more. Neverwinter is now such an obvious wallet leech that the very first screen it gives you upon logging in is the Zen market. Draw your own conclusions from that.  "

												Stay far away from this game, if you're new to it. Your wallet (and sanity) will thank me later.Many MMORPGs fail to consider their new blood, but this is easily one of the most egregious offenders you can find on Steam as a whole. It's a blight on gaming in general, an abject lesson in taking a once-great title and driving it straight into the ground over money. There's no balance of time versus money. You will pay up on this one, or you won't be competitive.The PvE content is only truly fun up till 60 (when they introduce the horrible Mod 6 content -- and it just gets worse from there on in terms of agonisingly boring grinding), and PvP is for masochists only. Mobs will regularly one or two shot you in epic dungeons, and established players are invincible in the battlegrounds... assuming you can find a PvP match at all, with the game's lengthy queues. This developer has chased their players away, and for good reason.			"

												I played this game years ago with a friend. I never liked the combat system, due to the way animations freeze your character in place, making the combat actually feel much less smooth than 'non-action' MMOs like WoW or similar. But playing with a friend it might have been fun enough, except it was so repetitive. We got to like the second area or something and the whole place was just groups of the same 5 orcs over and over, with the occasional ogre. Every quest was just some variation on ""fight/kill the orcs"". It was one of the most astonishingly boring and grindy experiences I have had in an MMO, and we both quit in frustration. It's got to be pretty bad if playing with a friend can't save it.By all accounts the game is even worse now than it was back then, so I would definitely stay steer clear.			"

												I actually liked this game for a while but eventually it got really old fast. Same old quests where you kill this amount of mobs and find a certain amount of these, but thats not the worst part in it. I hated the end game♥♥♥♥♥♥where you had to only do one quest a day. It actually makes you wait 24 hours before you can do another. With the sheer amount of end game content itsw not worth it. I figured out that it would take more than a year to actually beat it, and by then they would have already come out with even more end game content for you to wait on. Then again you could spendd hundreds of dollars just so that you can beat it. Yeah this game is a p2w, dont believe anyone that says its not. You have to pay for everything, mounts, gear, in game money, and even for your own guild you have to pay. I spent only 5 dollars in it and that was to get some in game cash and I didnt get♥♥♥♥♥♥for it, all I got was a common mount that anyone else could get. For people playing it now I would suggest leaving now before the devs make it any worse than it is.			"

												After playing my heart out of Neverwinter Nights 2 in my teen years, I came upon this game with nostalgia induced passion. Only to realize this is the age of Pay-to-Win gaming. A factor I found that hurt the core of the games that utilized this. Neverwinter Nights 2 may have been an old game, and I still play it now, but I cannot bring myself to hit the ""thumbs up"" on this game. I have never liked an RPG based game that did not enforce actual Roleplaying, utilized Pay-to-Win gaming, and whose active community was unwelcoming.I don't mean to say this is a bad game, it's got a few great features, such as:- Graphical abilities- Great Camera Angling- The ability to actually jump.- Utilizes D&D 4.0 guidelines- Interesting progression rates- Great HUD- Free to playBut here were the exact areas I felt hurt the actual gameplay:- Pay-to-Win- Non-enforced RolePlay in a RolePlaying Game & Server (players talking OOC all the time)- Unwelcoming community- Leveling up granted no satisfaction in creating your character- In-ability to crossclassThough personally I would rather play D&D 3.5			"

												Used to be fun.  Ignore my hrs recorded here on Steam as I usually play via ARC and only use this to play the game when ARC is going crazy and won't let me log in. It used to have a free to play model and in some ways, it still is.  However, they  (as of this writing) have sneakily reinserted a subscription perk called a VIP program that makes it pay to win as the perks listed definitely brings a major advantage against most non-subs.  Also, as of this writing, there's some tomfoolery going on during high level dungeons crawls on pugs that gets you kicked out via teammates that want the loot for themselves or for their friends that weren't even in the group.  I started playing around February of 2015 and got almost all of my toons of every class and race not hidden behind a pay wall to max level, but the grind for gear on dungeons for the newly max level character almost stops due to other players kicking you out of the group for the abovementioned reason in regards to loot.   After experiencing it more than once soured my overall experience of the game.     Pros: fun levelling, impressive graphics, some of the quests are downright hilarious in terms of story/spoken dialogue.Cons: See my rant above.Conclusion:  If you can stand the cons, then you'll enjoy the game.   It could have been a WOW killer... unfortunately, that potential got wasted.			"

Very action oriented, no tab-targeting, no 3-bars of twelve buttons to keybind/naga map, etc..The game is NOT P2win, cash shop is just faster mounts, better companions, and the traditional stuff like more bag slots.  Yeah, the stuff is expensive but you don't have to unlock every race, unlock every mount (you can only ride one at a time) to have fun, and get every companion.  You can still play 9 of the 12 races for free.I don't think I put money into this game until playing it for 50-hours.  And I've paid $50+ dollars for MANY games that I've played less than 10-hours.

												While Neverwinter isn't quite pay to win, it wouln't be a stretch to call it pay-to-enjoy. The monitization strategy PW chose for the game is to place all sorts of artifical obstiicles and inconveniences in the game, which can of course be trivially overcome if you just spend money, and they choose to remind you of that with the hard sell at every possible turn.Customer service is terrible, even for paying customers, with support tickets taking days to be resolved, Long standing bugs and balance issues abound, with developers not even paying lip service to addressing them.All in all, these factors combine to turn what could otherwise be an amazing expreience into an absolute slum of a MMO.

Also Cryptic don't seem very intrested in fixing the game and they prefer releasing modules on top of modules that pretty much boil down to the same thing: grind resources to unlock passive abilities for your character.In conclusion, ♥♥♥♥ Cryptic and ♥♥♥♥ this game.

Its a hidden pay to play and a quite expensive pay to play too. For this reason, I am not even going to bother. By the way, I am a huge Neverwinter fan but this game has spoiled the franchise for me.			"

												Having played it on and off since the Beta I have had a lot of fun. But at times it can be really frustrating, lots of pros but also a lot of cons. If the powers that be actually cared about the player base it would be so much better.Cryptic and Perfect World Entertainment have slowly been removing things from the game that players really enjoyed, the Gateway being a big one for me.All that said, I still really enjoy the game, and the Winter Festival which is on right now is quite fun!

												I have hundreds of hours into playing this game.  I have enjoyed playing it greatly.  It is so far my all time favorite MMO.  No fluff no hype....it is FUN!As far as those who gripe about the ""Pay to Win"" minomer, no game this good is without cost to make and continue improving.  The game offers variety and challenge.  There is always something new to explore.  On any Free to Play game, a customer would have to get something for their money or who would ever pay at all?  With that said, I can recommend you try it for free see what it is about then decide. I can also recommend you do some reading about the class types and how to build a strong player character. There's alot of variety possible.  Taking on the challenge of this game and building a strong character is very rewarding.9.6/10 for me.			"

												This game should be somewhat interesting to DnD fans - if you don't count yourself one, I would warn you to stay away from this game.Leveling your first character from lvl 1 to lvl 60 is kinda fun - exploring Neverwinter and it's surroundings, visiting Underdark, dealing with Spellplague, bla-bla-bla - only if you don't mind underpopulated locations. Seriously, expect to see some really large zones that have only ""kill 10 mobs"" quest.Everything changes drastically when you're hitting lvl 60 - after that it's just one big grind fest.You get some new zones to grind daily quests, which reward with providing access to new daily quests, which reward you with some gear that allows you grind these daily quests more efficiently. Endgame content is a myth - 2 PvP arenas and, like, 4-5 dungeons designed for 5 ppl max.'Elemental Evil' addon should've patched things up - players got tired of daily quests, everyone wanted to see some new epic content, etc.So developers really listened to the community - now you have one raid instance, that's designed for level 70 characters. But, yeah, it's available only after you've spent several dozen hours - you get it - on your most favorite daily quests.Not to mention that reaching lvl 70 is a one big DAILY QUEST GRIND from lvl 60.Yeah, and to add an insult to injury - this game features something like 200 or 250 different currency types, so I guess we can label the game as new-player-friendly.

												oh you found a good way to get gear? BAM *content deleted in new mod*wow, you reached the endgame? BAM *your gear is thrash with the new mod, buy new ones or grind hundreds of hours*I used to love this game, they always added new content and made things interesting even for those who play this game f2p. Now they dont care about anything but money, they said they will add content then they deleted the old dungeons without adding any.  While im typing this atm, new que system that they added and never worked properly (try to que for pvp and get 15 mins ban or join a game that is already lost and near to ending) is crushed and whoever tries to que gets stuck untill they do something about it (usually they dont do anything so good luck with that), 2 years ago when i started playing this game, it was the best mmorpg that i ever played that i can't even enjoy any other anymore. Now its full of bots and spammers. It used to be so crowded that what you type in the ''looking for group'' chat  couldn't be seen and you had to spam it and put something like ///---- ((((( to make it noticeable. Now you have to play the game at spesific times to find people to group and wait in pvp ques for 5-7 mins (just to see same people who are doing pvp anymore with this unbalanced pvp system).  The lag in the game is something so normal for those who play is incredible,  game is rubber banding, you lose connection randomly, IWD is absolutely unplayable.  A disgustingly greedy company is sucking all the fun out of this game, and i feel sorry for those who still feed them with their money. At this rate this game won't see 2017, Whenever something is bugged, patched (there is no good patches anymore) and changed, people quit the game.			"

												Okay. This is a pretty standard copy/paste mmorpg. I initially played when it first came out, I only played a few hours, got sick of it's genericness and stopped. Came back figuring I was a bit too harsh to quit so early in the game (I wasn't) and here we go.Dated Graphics with low poly models. But the game is an unoptimised waste of system resources. If your system is fine with it, like mine was until I entered town the reason is -> you'll find that whenever other players are around you your start to actually download data that you should already have on your system in order to see those players, such as models and textures. Basically - the game only installs monster models and npc data on your system to keep the download short. After that whenever you walk around the game world and see players wearing gear you don't have, the game downloads it automatically whilst you play. So you'll be stuttering like a mother♥♥♥♥ing slovenian on a computato for a good hour.Music isn't memorable, few hours after playing you could seriously wander if it had any music at all. Gameplay, rather bland and grindy, just spamming left click.Animations, clunky, enemies like to glide along faster than their animations.Tutorial/Introduction - Unimaginative garbage. You wash up on shore with no gear, then loot boxes to get newb gear, talking to people along the beach. Literally the exact same introduction as path of exile and age of conan. Then you talk to some people at a camp and get a quest (am I playing path of exile?) then you go and kill some undead (okay, what the ♥♥♥♥, this IS path of exile) Pretty standard Press ""button"" to interact on objects, interact on more objects, talk to people - by interacting on them with button. After that you fight more undead, because hey, they didn't use the same model and monsters enough in the lame♥♥♥♥♥introduction that now they're sending you to a crypt with totally unrelated undead who just happen to be there. Then you go to some slums, because trouble starts at home and fight some guys. Time to go to the sewers and fight the rat men and solve incredibly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥puzzles! This turned from a review to a splurge of hate, so I'm stopping it here. This is a generic piece of♥♥♥♥♥ I literally feel like I've been ripped off and I didn't spend any money, just time. Time I could've spent playing a better game.Oh did I mention that a majority of the game is instanced based, y'know dungeons. You don't even get to see other people in your quests, it's like playing a single player game with random people standing around blocking NPCs. (Oh yea, if there are too many people around an npc, good luck interacting with them, you'll be bringing up player menus with the same button!)			"

												This game is really fun. It has pretty much all the things you'd want from an MMO, with the added advantage of really neat animations and a more actiony gameplay. The fact it's set in forgotten realms, with stories and dialogue at some parts written by RA Salvatore himself, is icing on the cake.The game is very grindy, but it's a good kind of grind, with a point to it. You work towards boons (permenant buffs) in every campaign that contribute well to the power of your character. The best part is on your first character it doesn't really feel too grindy at all. Subsequent characters kinda get a *grooooan* but at the same time, you're still working towards something. I really like the grindy aspect, personally. This is not a game you will play for a few weeks then sit in town crying that you have nothing to do. This is an MMO with a real investment :)I have played every MMO since 98 and this is the first one to hold my interest for this long in a while.There is a LOT of false info out there going ""wah wah wah pay to win wah wah."" I will tell you there is legitimately NOTHING in the cash shop that will make you better than anyone else, and very, VERY few items you cannot just buy with in game currency. The cash shop in game is, at best, ""Pay to hurry up."" As it will allow you to become more powerful, FASTER, but nothing anyone else cannot obtain through time and effort (the only meaningful way :D )			"

												This game, like all the others from Cryptic, is a pay to win and pay to play game.There are curently 5 classes to pick from.The PVP needs to be renamed play the thief or die, as the thief uses stealth, they can kill you while they are hiding,  and you can not do anything to stop them.  I do not ever see a thief in the real game, so the players just make one soley for pvp.The classses are not like the D&D game system at all.  The cleric can not turn undead, all they do is heal, they can not do any damage and use a magic missle type attack.  The ranger class is very weak, you should only use the basic powers you start with as higher level powers actually do less damage then these as you level up.  The wizard controls people and can ""freeze"" enemies which does not work all that well since anything bigger then a minion is immune.  The other 2 are fighters, one tank and one high dps warrior.Everything takes astral diamonds, or real money called zen, everything.  You pick up an item and need to identify it, it costs a scroll you pay for with astral diamonds.You want good equipment, a mount, a companion it all comes out of the astral diamonds.Guess what, they are hard to earn!!!At the beginning levels you can do 1 skirmish for 1000 astral diamonds and if you do it during the hour of the day that features skirmishes you get an extra 1000 for a total of 2000 for that 15 minutes, assuming that there are enough people on at your level and on your map to get into the queue.  You can also do dungeons daily to get 3000 astral diamonds but some of them take 90 minutes or longer depending on who you have on your team.Guess what, you want that good gear, it will run you 300000 or more astral diamonds, per piece, you do the math here.Of course you can always swipe your credit card and get 1 million or more astral diamonds, I mean they even have an option for you to spend $200 real dollars all at one time to make it easy for you to play their game.I did pick yes to recommend this game.It is fun to play, to try out the 5 classes and run some missions.You will get to your own point of saying, that is enough.  After your 3rd time in a row of being killed by someone who spent $200 for their pvp gear or maybe after spending more astral diamonds on identify scrolls running through a dungeon then you actually make. That point will be up to you.So hop in here, please, so that I do not have to wait 30 minutes in each queue to play something.  :)___________________________________________________________________________________Okay this is edited after module 3 came out, the icewind dale.  At this time I have put in another 50 or so hours trying out the changes to the new hunter paragon path and the new module.  When I first looked at this game I read the first review on the forum.  It had a guy who had spent over 900 hours on the game and did not recommend it.  I thought that was kind of stupid, who would spend that long on a game and not recommend it.  SO HERE I AM RAISING MY HAND AS WELL. I am changing my game recommendation from yes to try it out to NO just stay far far far far away.The price of 1 piece of real Zen, real money is now maxed out again at 500 astral diamonds.  Pay attention, you will earn 1000 astral diamonds for every 15 minute skirmish you run.  So that means if you spend 15 minutes playing a skirmish match and trade in your astral diamonds you will get 2 real zen.  Now take a look at the Zen store, you want that nice cheetah mount, it will run you 3, 500 Zen.There are players in the game who have multiple accounts, multiple meaning up to 50, who just run bots on all of them to farm astral diamonds.  I now see why they do that.There really is no fun way to get astral diamonds.  You can rerun the same skirmishes daily, assuming it is the skirmishes hour and make 1,000 astral diamonds per one, remember the longer ones will take you 15 minutes each or longer.  You can do the daily dungeons for 3000 astral diamonds, remember they will take you up to 90 minutes to do that.Okay so the new area, whoa what a bummer.  First you need to be level 60, current game max.Then you need to have epic level gear so that your gear score is over 10000.Then you need to have level 3 boons unlocked from either one of the grinding campaigns at the end.So basically, only those players who have done everything they possibly can and are still playing.Then there is the new PVP part, since the game was so unbalanced to start with, they now will reward those players with even more power after spending $300 real dollars or more on PVP gear.At the time I am writing this I have 4, yes 4, different lock boxes sets stacking up in my inventory.These are boxes where you have a very tiny chance to get good gear, or a new mount or a companion and they all take Zen, real money, keys to open.So I have tried every single class, both paragon paths for each, I have beat the game, max level on all of them.  I have written a ton of helpful hints for new players and now done a review twice.  I wish I had all that play time back now!!!!It just gets worse and worse as Cryptic nickel and dimes you to death at the end.			"

												First looks suggest this game simply uses the name Neverwinter, and isn't anything to do with the previous two RPG releases.  Shame that, it could have gone a long way.  This, taken as is, is a fiddly bit of nothingness that doesn't hook any interest with me I'm afraid.  It seems amateurish and aimed at an audience that probably won't remember the originals, as I can't imagine anyone old enough to have broken their teeth over ther last 20 years on the two fine games would have any interest in this at all, other than curiosity followed swiftly by huge disappointment.

												Grinding and LVL up the hero is a lot of fun but there is nothing more at the end ....the first time i played neverwinter  till lvl 60 ... and stoped playing because pvp was realy unbalanced and only 2 maps availabel 1.  5 vs 5 pvp map and one 10 vs 10. Getting new items means repeat waht you have done 100 x times before and maybe you get something usefull. Also after the new update to lvl 70 makes the game not better .... only thing is now i lvl up to 70 and with lvl 70 i need to repeat all the dungeons i have done before with lvl 60 100 times. Grinding and lvling is a lot of fun right, but if you have reached lvl 70, pvp is unbalanced and not a lot of fun and repeat allways the same dungeon to get new items  also not a lot of fun ... and game is too much ristriced for non paying players  ....Good:LVL UPBuild up your char.Bad:-Nothing new -Repeat same quest and dungeons to get new items -pay for comfort (inventory bags, char reset, charaktar slots, items )-bad pvp system also after stronghod update (attack someone with 5 ppl and he does not get down is much frustrating)			"

												*Warning, this could happen to you at anytime, better to invest your money in games handled by a competent company*I will have nothing to do with any thing attached to perfectworld from here and in the future. I've played this as well as other games from this company, I have money invested that I will never get back. Something has gone wrong with their code authentication service. I've checked forums and it seems I'm not the only one to have this problem so FYI this is not an isolated issue and it could happen to you as well at anytime.After any fresh install when you try to login to any of their games it asks for a one time code that is supposed to be sent to your registered e-mail. I do not receive any codes ever. Spent way too much time with support getting me to do all kinds of runaround ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, changing e-mails, reset password etc. etc... There is no problem on my end, I have even done a full HD reformat and reinstall of windows and the problem remains. They simply won't bother to fix their broken code system and you are completely unable to access any of their games without it. Enjoy what money I have spent in the past on your games PW, I will avoid anything you handle in the future like the plague!** I forgot to add that when trying to solve this issue myself surfing forums etc. I also found out that this issue has been in existence since the freaking beta!! All this time has passed and still they have yet to fix it. This company gives no ♥♥♥♥s about their customers whatsoever.**			"

												I used to adore this game. It says on Steam that I only have about 70 hours played, but that's because I used to play it on the Cryptic launcher instead of Steam. I've played a lot more than that.But lately, they've stopped producing content for people who can't or won't pay for things. I'm all for having items and even certain questlines be pay to play, but whole classes and races? The new and ridiculous ""events"" are annoying and useless. They get in the way of actual gameplay! I'm trying to kill this boss, and a ""you just got a -insert stupid name for item necessary for event-! Here's a large popup box and a new quest!"" And suddenly I have to rush to click out before the boss smashes my unresponsive avatar into a pulp.The game is super unbalanced, too. Want a tip for how to breeze through early levels? Pick Hunter or Cleric, the two most OP classes. Mage is also pretty good- the ability to eliminate your enemies ability to move or attack is pretty OP. Less awesome damage, though. The game is never hard unless you go somewhere above your level. The monsters are nerfed to hell and back.There's also no variety. I used to love the dungeon crawls, but after the first thirty or so, their novelty wore off. And they are no longer worth the cliche grinding of ""kill 20 imps"" to get to. Every world, every quest, every single thing is exactly the same throughout the entire game! ""Walk through absently designed dungeon. Interact with switches. Kill monsters. Kill boss. Done.""This game hints at awesome customization with the character creation and the class/race quests and objects you can get to open more parts of the game. But none of these are expanded on in any useful way. They're token efforts to make players feel better. The only one I came across that had any kind of interesting class/race quest was Scourge Warlock! For all I know, Dragonborn or Moon Elf might have it better. But I wouldn't know, because they're behind a paywall!Honestly, the cashgrab aspect is probably losing them more money than they're making. If players are leaving because the game sucks without money being added in, make it a pay to play and move on. Plenty of games make plenty of money on that system. But if you don't have players to buy things, no one buys things. I would happily buy some of the beautiful companions and mounts and costumes if I had the money available. I would gladly buy the weapons and other cool things. But I refuse to be fleeced for the ability to play all of the actual game parts of the game! A free to play game should have the ability to buy extras. Not the ability to buy mroe of the game.			"

												Game is an insult to The Forgotten Realms franchise and a slap in the face to it's creator Ed Greenwood, if your expecting an Advanced Dungeons & Dragons experience you'd have a better chance at Dungeons & Dragons Online.~ Numerous issues listed below:- Performs substandard no matter what build your desktop is (and I'm running off a i7 Quad Core @ 4.4Ghz and two SLi'd GTX 780s with 16gb DDR Corsair Veng Ram and this game runs like a slug)- Game is overpopulated with gold spammers and the community devs do nothing to address the issue at hand- Game is Pay to Win - cannot access better companions unless you pay an absurd amount of money basic blue quality one is 29.99$ USD- Combat is Clunky at best more like Two Worlds when it was first launched; complete inbalances with classes- Contradictions involving Lore if you've read any of the Lore Books or The Forgotten Realms Campaign Booklet- Magic System is mediocre heavily favors melee characters over spellcasters (not unforeseen as most MMO companies seem to have some unrestrained hatred towards anything that doesnt swing a giant metal stick); game contains 4% of the spells in PhB, devs add their own versions of spells which contradict pre-existing spells.- Alignment System forces you to play Good/Lawful or Neutral no option or flexibility to be Chaotic or Lawful Evil or Neutral Evil (completely biased against anyone who wants to play the greedy backstabbing merc or someone who wants to dabble in Necromancy)- Servers latency is worse than a 64k Dial Up Modem, constant disconnects.- Uses the Awesimium Process which is considered spyware to monitor your computer (possibility it's recording http sites you are visiting so it can spam your registered email with junk mail later)- Character Proportions completely wrong; Tiefling look like full Daemons unlike what they look in AD&D of a mix of human and Daemon depending on the Generation the Tiefling is.- Limited Imagination of the Dev Team and ""Imperfect World"" as me and my friends call them.- Little to no Customer Support; never address the issue with all of their games it has taken 1 year 3 months for them to get the mailing system somewat function again in STO; many quest markers have issues such as bugging or not working properlyAll In All horrible game to play not worth the time or effort invested.((I dont play through Steam I played through their PW client))			"

												To bad the studio is super shady. Could have been a decent game. Of course, I'll always hate them deep down because it wasn't neverwinter nights 3, and instead, a cash grab MMO.  It started from before the game released, with their limited collectors edition. Something which they still continue to sell today, I believe. So much for limited. But not only that, they advertised custom gear that wasn't actually in the pack. Later on they changed the advertisement, but you can still find it with a search. Just one of the many sketchy business practices of this company. Oh, and if you get hacked, good luck. This game has plenty of it, and everything you own can be instantly liquadated and sold, due to the way gems, and money work in this game. Cryptic won't even care, and they don't even have an option to report such things.			"

												This game has the absolute worst customer service I have ever encountered. During a break, my account was hacked and millions of AD worth of items were stolen. When I contacted customer service I was asked for some account information which I gave, and finally, after a week and a half and one single response from Perfect World per day (regardless of how quickly I responded to their emails), was told they could not restore my account. I was upset and asked for a refund on a Zen purchase I had made during the time of the ticket being open. This request was also declined. At this point I am absolutely furious. I was a VIP subscriber and had spent a generous amount of money on Zen in the last few years. Do not make the same mistakes I have, do not give Perfect World your money, they will completely disappoint and disregard you.			"

												This game was pretty good when I first played it. But I guess there was something I was overlooking when I first played it as well that basically is the worst thing ever.This game is a cash grab. Just look at the price of the DLCs and that says enough. See all those people running around on cool mounts? Gotta buy em, otherwise your stuck with a plain Jane horse. Companions? Money. Crafting? Money, Items? Money. Dungeons? Money. Money Money Money. Everything in this game has a price tag and while the in game prices aren't too bad, that's where they hook you.♥♥♥♥♥♥is cheap and odds are you'll get ""Something"" of use out of each random bag you buy meaning you'll keep spending gobs of money. Really though it's not a problem if you're not stupid.I spent upwards of $45 on the game with in game purchases and played the game for about 4 months, so I'd say I got my  money's worth out of the game. It was interesting for sure, but endgame content was non-existent at the time.The quest immersion is great, with actual things happening in the quests, plus the toolset to build your own quests makes this game pretty good.Classes are bland and generic, but then, what do you expect from Dungeons and Dragons. They've never really been the most creative when it came class variety or uniqueness. Likewise with the race selections. Class mechanics are fun and interesting but lose their flair quickly.Dungeons are brutal in length and boast a pretty hogwash set of mechanics for any fight. Just pick one boss from any level dungeon and they either suck to fight against because the mechanics are annoying, or the mechanics are so bad that the boss is broken or too easy.Leveling up from min to max takes almost a month of casual play to attain, less if you're hardcore, so that's not bad.Save your money when playing this game as it doesn't offer much once you hit max level and most of the things they offer for you to buy are cosmetic in nature or offer only slight boosts to your character. You can pretty much skip over this game and not miss out on anything.			"

												Curiously, I actually enjoy this game. The game itself is a strong MMO, if a bit outdated on the graphics end. My reasons for giving a bad review is the 'free to play' claim. While I have no real issue with a game that allows players to purchase the best gear, this should be a shortcut - nothing more. It is technically true that players CAN access the paid content by trading in-game currency for ZEN (the real money currency), the amount of time to get even a small quantity is highly limiting. But this isn't the major problem. The major problem I have is that it seems like everything in the game is locked behind that pay-wall; need more bags? Zen. A mount upgrade? Zen. Bank slots? Zen. Character slots? Zen. Re-spec? Zen. Access to the [current] best-in-slot gear? Zen. Better companions? Zen. Upgrade companions? Zen (or an astronomical anount of ingame currency). And the prices are, quite frankly, offensive: 16 bank slots on a single character? That'll run you about $6. That's more than a character slot. Some mounts are $40. The lowest rank bag? $6. Whoever priced this stuff needs to lose his job - and everyone who actually paid these prices is only enabling this mess. I want to see the game succeed, because I enjoy playing it. But that isn't going to happen if everyone actually pays their exorbant prices. Finally, I was forced to post this here because the developers refuse to allow posts about thier 'pay to win' pricing at all in their forums. They know it's an issue, and their response is to be adversarial - they clearly don't treat their customers with respect and think of them as little more than piggy banks.			"

												In my opinion, game was good before the introduction of Module 6. A lot of the beloved dungeons were simply removed, quest lines are broken and dungeoneering, for one, became impossibly hard. Life-stealing and healing have been nerfed to the ground, which basically made this game extremely hard to play.That's how I quitted this game.			"

												i've got so much time and money into this game but i agree with everyone else at this time. Greedy Greedy Greedy. there is just so many stupid decisions being made by the dev's and they don't listen to the player, they just look at where all the money is. there's no more clear endgame. the refining system is just WAY too expensive.  and all gear that i have has been rendered obsolete each new Mod they add. half the games dungeons have been taken away because they are broken??? they keep adding more Crap yet don't fix the present game. they claim their fixes are to fix all the bots yet every chat system is filled with bots selling in game currency. this game and it's dev's are so Full of it!!!! it disgusts me if this is where the gaming world going too and i think we should ban togther and not allow this kind of filth and greed destroy our gaming world.i look at so many other reviews of people with hundreds of hours logged all saying the same thing. it used to be great, something i didn't mind putting my time and money into. but now.....it's♥♥♥♥♥♥!!!screw you cryptic, i hope all your games die and you find yourselves in a 3rd world country begging for food!!!

												I started writing a detailed review and just couldn't be botheredIt's a great MMO until you reach level 70 and then you'll realize that this game has no End Game content, No armor set variations, little to no character skill variation, a beyond imbalanced pvp system with a whole 2 types of pvp game and a complete lack of anything to do or work towards.The Strongholds mod was supposed to breath new life into the game but what it ended up doing was giving people a place to go stand around that wasn't the main city.Imagine watching Rocky for the first time except in the final fight Rocky knocks Apollo out with the first punch and we all just sit there for the last 20 minutes watching Rocky wander around the ring looking for something to doThats how this game made me feel. Pretty good at the start and the middle then flopped on it's face when it came to the end.			"

												They ruined the Dungeons and Dragons franchise when they made a F2P P2W MMO, the game itself is fun untill you come across the glaring gear disparity between those who pay and those who don't.The ability to make up quests and stuff like that gives this game a ton of content much like the earlier Neverwinter games, the pvp is entertaining - hardly balanced but that's neither here nor there, it's still fun but again is ruined by this P2W model. It really is a shame as this game is actually quite playable in terms of functionality controls and having an interesting environment not to mentions the ♥♥♥♥♥on of lore they can draw from.This games worth a playthrough if you're really bored with other MMOs but by no means worth sticking around with the P2W attitude to end game.If they had offered Neverwinter as a once off payment of about $80 with none of the P2W options ingame this would have been great. They even could have charged again for expansions.P2W is honestly the worst thing i've ever seen in online gaming, it completely defeats the purpose of gaming in a competitive environment and Neverwinter 100% subscribes to this model.

Posted: April 17, 2015
												I started playing this game out of boredom and found quite a few hours to do the starting quests, up to level 60.Since I am no classic MMORPG player, my review is mainly based on my experiences in that game without direct comparison to any of the other billion MMORPGs out there.Lets start with variety:You have to choose a certain race and role on the beginning. Each role has it's own abilities. Depending on what skills you use later on, you can fulfill multiple purposes in each role.The game is quite interesting on start and it's fun to try out new abilities as you level up and get your first horse or companion. At least on start you get the impression of following some sort of storyline, doing several different things. After a while it gets very repetitive since quests quickly change to a pure seek and destroy.Finishing the first ""plot"", you will be sent to the capital city to a certain officer that offers new quests which allow you to visit other places.Most places are fairly nice to look at (depending on your settings) and the level design is pretty interesting in several cases. You get to fight a variety of enemies, a few of which have specilized abilities as you progress into higher levels.Second point would be fighting and the skilling tree:Fighting requires some concentration as strong enemie's attacks are displayed on the ground as a warning. These warnings and some slow mob's attacks are supposed to be dodged by running away or staying out of range.The skill tree offers a variety of different spells and abilities. These are divided into:-""daily powers"", which supposed to be strong spells and need action points to be filled up, likely through fighting.-""free powers"", which are started using the left and right mouse button and can be seen as a variety of basic attacking techniques.-(red powers?) ...are what you would call a spell. Cooldowns, damage values and/or custom effects.In addition, you get a variety of so-called ""talents"" that start with basic ones and advance into specialized talents that would power certains aspects of your normal abilities.Experimenting with these to find your own playstyle is interesting.So much for the major gameplay. Now off to the (many) points why I wouldn't recommend playing this game at it's current stage:My main point would be the lack of originality and heartblood.Everything you get to do has already been there many many times in countless other MMORPGs. After a nice start, the game quickly breaks down into loveless quest design and the further you go, the more confused you get.A constant flood of items without any sort of explanation about the point to it fills the inventory. Every time you figured out what to do with one of those strange new coins you found, the game is telling you to collect another 2 kinds of coins. The sheer amount of different ""currencies"" is nuts, while the majority of these will be outdated by the time you figured out what they are for.Huge areas with different questing points of any kind of importance spread all over make it very hard if not impossible to orientate on which plot you are actually working right now and where you may want to get something special from.The progress after the first levels is very quickly nullified and the game wants you to spend many hours on tiny steps forward. If you want to use the things you find, you are supposed to collect immense amounts of points in certain ""currencies"" the further your level progresses. The game very quickly yells at you ""BUY OUR STUFF OR YOU WON'T GET ANYWHERE"".It may be free to play, but it's very close to ""pay to progress"".As soon as you get to fight in a group, you quickly lose track of what's going on. Insane amounts of special effects from the players, their companions and the minions often make it a lag fest where you see nothing anymore and steer on your cooldowns to use the next spell on the ""blazing-green-red-white-yellow-blue"" part of your screen where you saw a dragon a few minutes ago, hoping he's still there.Going over to the serverside:Terrible server performance and countless bugs make playing a mess quite often. Constantly brought out new content keeps flooding the already messed up system. Reported bugs do not seem to be worked on in time - if at all.Since the content of this game is too huge to break down most things, I tried to keep it at a minimum. There are many more things I didn't like about this game. Unless there are major changes (keyword is major), I cannot recommend playing this game.			"

												I have a ton of hours into Neverwinter despite what Steam says, is this a fun game yes somewhat easy to understand interesting and fun once you get past the first hour of learning the basics. You can earn everything ingame that you can purchase through the cash shop just takes time. The reason for me not being able to recommend this game however is if you do choose to play it and at some point spend real money on items from the cash shop and have an issue with them once you support a ticket there's no response and you get ignored. Until their support system can remove heads from butts and actually take care of people who spend real money through the cash shop and resolve issues of us not recieveing all of our items correctly from packs or at all I can't feel as though I can recommend this to others for fear they'll eventually run into the same problems a bunch of us are having !

The game doesn't appear to be very deep regarding NwN/D&D lore, so if that's what you're looking for I'd think purchasing a copy of Neverwinter Nights or Neverwinter Nights 2 a good idea and seeking out a player run persistent server. If you're looking for a game with a good combat engine, and some pretty fun multiplayer (with friends) then i can see this game being a good fit, especially considering The Foundry and the idea of playing player made content (which i have yet to experience but read its quite good). On the other hand it does seem to be buggy and laggy in high populated areas, and if you're into MMO PvP, stay away.  Just looking at whats in the in-game-store, its quite obvious this game is pay to win.There is also some weird issue with censorship on the Perfect World forums (Chinese policed internet?).All in all, id only recommend if you have some friends to group with, and are not looking for anything to deep or involving.

												I wouldn't mind paying for the dragonborn race if the price was actually reasonable. However, these greedy scumbags want $75 for it. Because of this, I didn't even make it past the character creation screen.Here's my advice: Fill out a character sheet and play actual D&D on Tabletop Simulator, Skype, Steam chat, or real life. I don't care just as long as you're playing actual D&D and not this garbage.			"

												For a free rpg, this game has it all. It takes forever to load up at first, between the orginal download and the patches. However from then on it's smooth sailing, not to easy, but not too difficult. I would prefer more control options, like clicking to walk, or an ability to somehow prevent people from stealing my kills. Currently, this is my second favorite rpg.			"

													Lost in translation between an MMO and the pen and paper source material, Cryptic studios has birthed a tepid monstrosity of classic dungeons and dragons.  In lieu of a glorious celebration of problem solving, fierce combat, and character interactions, we're given a series of adventures so generic that it brings up comparisons to decades prior.  Game mechanics similarly suffer a compromise between core dungeons and dragons concepts from fourth edition, and traditional MMO fair.  While it isn't necessarily terrible, especially for a free game, it doesn't warrant our attention either, and I'm stuck wondering who it appeals to.  	Forgotten Realms beckons adventures to sally forth to the wonderful locales such as Neverwinter, Icewind Dale, and other notable cities to defeat the evil Lich Queen Valindra as she does what all evil characters do; bring about death and destruction.  Story wise, it's so by the numbers that about an hour into it I was just clicking to get my quests.  The game throws so many tropes at you that it defies belief; a person you just met dying while trying to ingratiate himself to you, a fetch quest belaying the importance of resources to soldiers, and so forth.  There was even a quest to save three privates from becoming zombies, and after it was finished I wasn't allowed to save any more, dredging up memories of the infamous dickwolves strip of penny arcade.  These things aren't necessarily bad, as tropes can be used very effectively, but these are just sloppy.  	Continuing in much the same fashion, we're told that opportunists are wreaking havok on the land of Neverwinter, and we're tasked with helping out.  Only, I really didn't want to, because most of the people we're saving are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  I understand that conceptually, a MMO demands effort on the behalf of a player to reach rewards like enough money to buy weapons and armor.  When a city is in direct peril, and the fate of shopkeepers ultimately depends on me killing five zombies or collecting three leafs, fleecing me an arm and a leg to get a shield that will increase my odds of survival, or treating me like an a-hole isn't really motivation enough to get on my high horse to defeat the arch bad guy, or save the crown jewel from Nashkel, or even delivering a message to Sargent Whatshisname.  	Clearly, it doesn't take any chances on bucking the formula with the narrative, and largely it plays it safe with the game play as well.  After playing for a couple of hours, I can see that the team took ques from fourth edition, but the concepts don't really apply to an MMO.  Having encounters, daily's, and at wills stressed cooperation with your team and planning for the next encounter in the pen and paper version.  Here it means waiting a bit to mash e or q.  A cheap cop out for an MMO, timing is only a small part of it.  Your life is now preposterously high to compensate for a lack of a traditional AC system.  There aren't many choices to customize your character beyond putting points in different powers to level them up.  Purchasable/findable kits allow players to bypass certain skill blocks like thievery or dungeoneering, and all for the sake of looting, nothing more.  Essentially, it negates the importance of player choice, and emphasizes purchase power.	Perfectly exemplifying the translation from pen and paper to MMO would be the previous Dungeons and Dragons Online.  Where it succeeds, and likewise Neverwinter fails, is letting the player define their character in so many ways.  Not just in play style or character creation, but also letting the character choose how they interact with the NPC's, solve quests, and align themselves with the different factions.  The questing itself was extremely varied, and conjured amazing stories, like a drinking contest with beholders, or a carnival of the undead.  It was an amazing triumph that empowered the player to adventure and discover, not just run between quest giver and questing zone.  Here, there is very little the player has an affect on, which makes it feel soulless.  	I've spent little time with Neverwinter, so I can only hope that it improves beyond the initial image it conveys.  Reading more about the game though, I'm struck with my impression of tedium and depression.  We've all been “the chosen one” who can destroy the great evil and bring peace to the land, but rarely are we impressed enough to continue that adventure to its climax.  Neverwinter is an adventure for a different kind of player, and sadly it isn't the one Dungeons and Dragons traditionally appeals to.  If you're looking for an MMO fix, you can do far worse, and it isn't necessarily a terrible game in its own right.  It is uninspired, and in a market with far better choices, I can't justify spending any more time in the Forgotten Realms.			"

												This game is not terrible, but it's not very good either. I love Cryptic games, especially the engine in which these games run. Both Champions Online and Star Trek Online are controller compatible. Why was that feature removed from Neverwinter I'll never understand. But let's ignore that for a second, I'm not a D&D fan so the lack of accurate lore other people complain about doesn't affect this review, I'm going to base it off gameplay, fun factor and economy.Let's start with gampley, this is a hybrid action MMO. You can move around and even avoid some attacks by moving but when you attack you're locked in place. Once you get used to that then the gameplay shouldn't be a problem. Except when we go and look at your efficiency in battle. Your level ups grant you attribute points to make the build that best fit your style, OK that's normal. But then we have gear and that's when things get out of control. You have a variety of ways to get the right gear for your build:1. Be on an efficient and active Guild willing to baby sit you while you farm it (good luck with that )2. Farm the currency you need to convert into gear. (I'll talk about the economy in a bit)3. Buy the currency to get the top gear (better known as Pay 2 Win)Which brings us to the economyAstral Diamonds is the top currency. You use it for almost EVERYTHING and you have a daily cap (to refine it) of 24,000 (if I'm not mistaken) Want to level up your mount? OK that's a couple of million astrals per level. Want to level your companion, Another couple of million of astrals. Plenty of things you want to buy you need astrals for, and even to transmute some gear. The entire auction house uses astrals as currency, so that armor that some dude was lucky enough to land on a dungeon run, well you may have to pay close to a million 'cause people aren't selling things for cheap. So that's farming Astral Events (skirmish) which take anything from 5-30 minutes (depending on the team and your level) for 1,000AD each run, Doing daily missions (which can take a very long time as some involve running the same instance multiple times in a row to complete and pretty sure the best one pays only 8,000 AD and that's unlocked at lvl 60) So basically you'll spent most of the day, every day trying to hit the refinement cap so you can get enough astrals to buy ONE piece of gear you want. Yes you can sell your stuff for astrals and those are already refined, but that means you'll have to spend hours farming good enough stuff to sell and hope to god someone has the ""money"" to buy it. Even worse if you want to level your companions, it's just not humanly possible and that's where the game falls apart. It's filled with these gold farmer things, you'll get bombarded through mail about them. It's gotten to the point where they not only have become the only viable option to play this game but that they have gone out of their way to destroy the exchange.You may be asking, what is the exchange? well Perfect World games use a virtual currency known as zen that you can only (mostly as you can do surveys and crap) obtain with real money to buy extra content on their individual stores. The exchange was created so that people with less income, but more free time, could play for astrals so that those with jobs (aka more money and less time to play) could still progress at the same rate by buying those astrals from players. That's a meta game on its own as you can play the market, buy when low and sell when high. The fluctuation usually caused by sales which PW was very keen in having them weekly. That way people would always want zen don't they? That's a bit troublesome but understandable, it is a business. But the problem in this situation is that most players don't like to think, thinking is forbidden in neverwinter, you can't be rational. Players are impulsive, which makes the job of gold farmers a hell of a lot easier. they managed to break the exchange hitting the cap of the most useful currency. What I mean by that is, 1 zen which is the equivalent of 1 cent, can get you (at the moment of this review) 500 astrals. So let's say you want to throw $20 worth of zen at the exchange, you come out with 10 million astrals. So all that effort farming that currency shows nothing for it. It is the currency that gets the game going but ultimately, the players have lowered its value to a point of no return. PW isn't doing its job protecting the game from farmers either, but again I understand it, ultimately they get a piece of the pie. A reduced piece if they throw some numbers, the ones getting the big bucks are the Gold Farming sites/services.How much do you need good armor? A LOT. Level basically means nothing, it's pretty much all in the gear, that's what make you a badass. I can't recommend this game, even with the Foundry which is a really good but gimped system that let's you create your own adventures. (gimped part, you can't have access to all the armor assets when creating NPCs) It's been over a year since I started playing and never felt like uninstalling the game, until now.			"

												Recommending this game would be the same as recommending an addictive drug for me.I have spent 1019 hours of my life on this game. Please do not ask me why.  The only great thing about this game is the friendly community. I could have as well spent that time on msn or facebook, chatting with friends. I have seen a 65% of the game content in those hours I have played. But for higher level dungeons, you will need greater enchantments which mean lots of money (appx 160 dollars)oh btw, lets not forget my friends that got banned randomly and gold spammers that never get banned.and your characters that you spent hours suddenly get nefred(nuked) and they dont even show the courtesy of giving you a respec chance unless you buy one for real money.zen market is a nice idea. but of of course, İF you can find anyone willing to sell zen. ever. I have seen the market devoid of any zen for months.so if you don't want to pay a crabby company for doing a sheety job, just hang out on facebook and make some new friends there. do not go and download this game. only play it if you are willing to pay it, or you never see the 100% of the game content.

												I really wanted to like this game and put in some time to give the game a chance.  Much like other reviews have stated, you are slapped in the face with so many pay walls.  So, I gave in, bought some Zen and did so because there was a bonus program.  My purchase met the requirements for the bonus.  Or so I thought.  Because I made my purchase on Steam, I was not eligable for the bonus.  However, this was not stated anywhere in game, nor was I warned during the purchase.  I found this out after using their ticket system and experienceing their poor customer service.So, my reasons for not recommending this are:- Too many pay walls.- Bait and switch on the Zen purchases via Steam.- Poor customer service.- Builds are very limited.- Not all that challenging and somewhat boring.

												The free-to-play model is done fairly badly here as there are too many quality-of-life items that are locked behind a paywall. The game play is hindered by being tied to a console-model which limits how many abilities you have access to. It's not at all apparent what the different choices you're asked to make at level 10+ and 20+ really mean and since it costs money to re-spec, you can't afford to keep trying different specs to learn what the different choices mean.

They respect NOTHING about you and could care less about you even AFTER you have paid them money to play their ""FTP"" game.  WARNING: Buy absolutely NOTHING for this game through Steam.  They will lock down your account and severely limit your ability to do ANYTHING in game JUST BECAUSE YOU BOUGHT SOMETHING THROUGH STEAM.  I am not kidding.

												I played until level 40-ish and I can say that this game is extremely Pay 2 Win. At higher level it is almost impossible to get any decent gear (without investig a ton of time or money). Professios require quite a lot of time (which people with a life don't have). It keeps the player tied to the game.Missions are repetitieve and lack any originality. And soon after the level 30 even weak mobs will be able kill you.PvP is poorly balanced and you will most likely get matched with some overpowered players, who paid for their gear.Overall the game requires a lot of time from the player, oferring very little in exchange. Unless you have a lot of money to spare for this game, you will unlikely enjoy this game.			"

												It's hard to not recommend a game when you supported it through closed beta. It's fun for awhile but, IMO, the trick to making money in a F2P model is to not constantly force it in the player's face. I wouldn't say it's pay-to-win, and you could enjoy the game without spending a dime if you are ok with three big negatives. 1.) It's not D&D; 2.) It's nowhere close to being an expansion of the Forgotten Realms games; 3.) You will constantly be reminded that you can spend real money. That said, I did enjoy the dungeon-building. (I didn't build one, but I enjoyed playing others' campaigns.) It's worth playing around with for awhile but the revenue model takes away from a lot of the fun.*** EDITI agree with Random Gamer in that Neverwinter is not P2W. This is a case where I really wish that Steam offered a continuum rather than a binary Yes/No range of recommendation options. Of my three complaints, the only one that drove the thumbs-down was the amount of in-game promotion of, even if not necessarily the case, what appeared to be ""driving one to a cash shop"".That said, I admit that this sentiment is based on my experiences immediately into launch. Developers adapt and adopt different strategies for generating the income that they justifiably need and deserve; therefore, my complaint may not be as valid as it was at game launch.A good example of a game that, imo, started out with an excellent model for generating income is GW2. ANet's philosophy was that people would spend if they enjoyed the game....that advertising should be bottom priority way below content. Of course, in that case, one purchases the game...but that isn't going to pay for their ambition to evolve a living world (i.e., monthly new content). While there is a bit more in-game advertising than I think ANet originally planned, I think that their model has been successful in that a rather solid and loyal playerbase continues to puchase novelties and skins that do little, if anything at all, to make the player ""better"".I plan to spend a bit more time in NeverWinter. As said in the OP, I do recommend trying out the game. It's just a pet-peeve of mine (automatic deal-breaker) to have immersion interrupted by marketing. I prefer it when the game promotes services, perks, pets, etc. via the log-in screen, the game's website, and/or e-mail newsletters. Of course, this is also coming from someone who prefers having subscriptions as an option (e.g., EQ2's model).			"

												You definetly should not try this game if you hate pay to win games.I've played this game,before release,before it came to steam.It was the best game of my life,until I hit max level,thats where you are pressured to spend real money.PvP to the best of my knowledge,end game wise:HAS ALWAYS BEEN F***ING PAY TO WIN.To the best of my knowledge the best way to get maximum satisfaction from this game is to DELAY YOUR LEVELING PROGRESS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.Don't do the questing areas,focus on daily quests for PvP and Foundry.When I was playing this,the leveling areas where both a grind fest and a runing simulator,I dare compare it to ESO(from what I saw on twitch and youtube),but this did not have a way point sistem when I played it.Story wise and time consuming wise,foundry quests are better,and can be replayed anytime(at least that was the case before I quit this pay to win bear trap),compared to the stuff done by PWE and Cryptic.The dungeon quees at low levels were decent in my day,I hope they did not tighten the pay wall since I left to make low level pve pay to win as well.This is the kind of game that I recomend you should play when you're favorite mmo/moba is on maintenance for a whole day.The pay to win aspects were so strong that I had to quit the game,end game pvp is a farse desingend to eat up your whole wallet.The combat of this game is absolutely the best I have exeprienced and it made me want to do pvp in mmo's,that's how good the combat is,it turned me away from being pve focused to a balanced mmo player(I now like both pvp and pve in mmo's,before this I hated pvp because all of the mmo's I played were tab based and seemed both dull and complicated,I was a proper scrub,until Neverwinter my first action combat based mmo),but they took it to far.Everything other people say in their reviews about the economy sistem is true,it has been so since release.To conclude this review,I recomend it for players who have friends to play with in pvp and foundries.I also recomend this for people who are new to mmo's because this game offers you the best and worst of the mmo genre,giving players awareness on what to look out for in their next mmo,market wise.Avoid this if you are a SOLO,EXPERIENCED MMO PLAYER,you might quit this game before you get your first purple item,I sure as hell did.

												A disclaimer - it's a game set in Forgotten Realms universe, but don't expect DnD-like gameplay. Now what should I say about this game...Neverwinter is a MMORPG, and a really good one. I was somewhat off for the first few hours, but the game gets better and better with every hour you spend in it. A disclaimer #2 - if you don't like timegate mechanic and grinding dailies don't read further.Let's start with some pros:+ Setting - I'm definitely a FR lover. You should know that Salvatore helped with writing some of the quests in the game. You will also meet some amazing characters like Bruenor Battlehamer, Drizzt Do'Urden or Minsc&Boo. + Music - wether you're in the heart of Neverwinter, traverse the Underdark or purge the Dread Ring of the undead you'll always be accompanied by really nice tunes. It's an MMO so obviously music does not play THAT BIG of a role, but the tracks playing at the background do not disturb you.+ Character development(bright part) - it's really well made. While power upgrading does not matter much, traits and boons can passively make your character stronger in different ways(for example make your trap also deal damage over time, and even stronger against immune targets)+ Combat - you're basically on the move all the time, combat is dynamic, there is a lot of dodging, blocking and watching out for enemy attacks+ Endgame - that is just my opinion but endgame is great. Dungeons are challenging(unless you get boosted by that 3k+ player), long, bossfights are fun. There is always something to do due to campaigns which not only give great rewards but boost your character stats via boons. Also progress is slow paced but significant enough to see the difference between those two items, 30-40 item levels or that one tier of your artifact. Cons- Hard to earn currency - getting AD as a fresh player is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Enough said. - AD to Zen converting ratio - Zen is that ""real money"" currency of NW. And while gathering AD to exchange for Vip(1k Zen - 500k AD) is not that big of an issue, trying to get AD to buy Zen while also managing your characters equipment is. Artifact here, refinement stones there, goodbye 120k AD here. - Outdated graphics - we're in 2017, yet graphics sometimes feel like a 2012 game. It doesn't look bad, it had actually aged quite well, but I think devs should consider making some upgrades here and there. - Character development (sad part) - boons from campaigns are a double edged sword. They greatly increase character capabilities, but good luck getting most of them. Some of them are after huge timegates(ToD, Dread Ring, Underdark) and others are just annoying to start with(Icewind Dale, ♥♥♥♥ you).My final mark would be somewhere around 7 or 8 out of 10. It's definitely a game worth at least trying out.			"

												(This review deals exclusively with Neverwinter's Dungeon Creator and its community)I sunk dozens of hours (all before Neverwinter was on Steam) into the one redeeming quality of this game: the level editor. It's one of the best I've ever seen and writing, planning, and creating dungeons and quests is an awesome game in itself. I can't say enough in its praise. However, even this element of the game is ruined by the toxic community. Creators band together in level-making mafias to promote and upvote each others' dungeons (without letting on that they all in it together), and God forbid you ever give less than a 4/5 to one their quests--they will downvote your creations in retaliation.That this game's playerbase can take something wonderful like the dungeon creator and infuse with all the nastiness and spite of hardcore PvP left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I've never touched the game again.

												Neverwinter is free-to-play, and we’ll get a bit more into pay-to-win, pay-for-convenience elements later.  The important thing here is players can get right into the game and begin playing without friction.Neverwinter boasts one of the best combat systems in any MMORPG on the market today.  It’s not the bogged down tab-target “sit-and-watch, hit 1 2 3” that the genre grew up with, nor has the pendulum swung all the way toward the oft touted “action-MMORPG”Every class in Neverwinter can solo quite easily, and because the combat is probably the game’s greatest strength, there’s no shortage of fun for those electing solitary confinement.

												Don't expect to play this game very long without spending money.  They try to nickle and dime you to death.  You'll have to spend money to be able to run most level 60 dungeons, and you'll need to buy a mount or you'll spend hours running around questing at higher levels.  If you make a mistake with loot in game after 2 days you'll be told it's against their policy to correct and they will do nothing.  Same issue if you have interface glitches or latency issues and accidentlaly spend AD (money).  Also, once you level one character everything else is repeated, over and over.			"

												I would recommend this game to anyone who has played or liked playing Guild wars or the old school Neverwinter Nights. Although it's free to play its kind of rigged to make you spend your money to buy things to make your character stronger than others. I'm a hardcore DnD fan and love getting my hands on anything that has to do with lvling up a character you create and venturing off in caves and fighting dragons.			"

												For a free to play game this is suprisingly fun. the people online are usually quite co-operative and the actual gameplay feels rather fluent and polished. despite slight lag in plaves and DLC needed to be brought for a full experience this game is definetly worth a look at, even if it is no ESO.

												It looks a lovely game but beware the firm's tech support. I've just tried to play a new character, but their server failed mid-game. I'm told to report the error, but their website actively stops you from doing so due to abysmally poor design (demanding I select catergory, yet I had already done so). Going to contact them directly about this additional error, I'm told 'Your question hasn't been submitted'.So far I've played 15 minutes, but spent 30 trying to report a server failure to them, and having to navigate their pathetic website.In summation: enjoy the beautiful cinematics of Neverwinter, but be extremely cautious about giving this firm any money, as I doubt you'll be able to contact them if something inevitably goes wrong.

												Always on the lookout for a great F2P game, and this one sure stands up. Yeah there are the WoW-geeks and stat-trads that like to gear score themselves out of any fun in MMRPG universe, but there is something for everyone here - especially D&D fans. Take the time to explore and appreciate the level designs, you will not regret it. Itis regularly updated for content and has its share of seasonal events and goodies. There is relatively little frustration with levelling (not really sure why power-levelling scabs / Astral gem / gold farming hax even bother, but even the laziest of lazy like to play games too I suppose). Levels can mostly be done solo or with a companion, but in the tradition of D&D, try to form a party or get your friends to play with you - way more fun! Overall very fun, gorgeous graphics and within the spirit of the venerable game.			"

												I like this game. I read a lot of bad reviews about it being pay to win, and maybe it is at higher levels or in PVP, but for a really smooth and enjoyable MMO leveling experience, this game really shines. Some are complaining about the dated graphics, but the animations are great and it runs smoothly on my laptop. It has user created quests, too! Fun.			"

												36 hours into it and I still haven't unlocked chat, trade, or other features fundamental to an mmorpg. I like the concept and gameplay, but seeing all these other players around me and not being able to interact with them is a serious damper to the gameplay. I can make a party but can't talk to people who might want to join a party with me. Their efforts to stop spambots is so intense it is also stopping people from playing the game.			"

												Initially, I felt actually happy and grateful for the chance to play a nice, decent MMORPG for free. But I've been around the gaming block long enough to see a variety of games and refine my idea of 'fun'. So, this review will particularly make sense to you if we happen to share a similar concept of FUN, applied to MMORPGS in particular. What makes a MMORPG *fun* then? To me, it would be:- An interesting storyline- A good level of customization and a reasonable amount of freedom- Some variety in the gameplay- A good implementation for social features (or at least a good excuse to socialize, because if I had to solo the whole content I'd just go for a single player) - Some PvP aspect (because again, the whole point of being online is to either cooperate with other players or kill em all, or both, basically)- A nice, detailed graphic look (but that's just personal)Thus said, I can't really expect to have it all, especially in a free-to-play title. But let's say that, for fun's sake, I'd be just happy to find at least 3-4 of these features in a mmorpg.How does Neverwinter score then, in the fun board?PROS+ beautiful visuals+ adult/mature aesthetics (no manga fluff nor japcutesy of any sort - counts as a plus to me, lol)+ UI done right: intelligible, intuitive, and graphically pleasant+ fluid combat style+ fluid mouse controls (I did appreciate the 3rd person view paired with the free mouse-look: that should be a standard for any game featuring some PVP)+ voice acting over walls of text, with the option to keep listening to the babble while you're doing something else in-game+ some variety for events here and there (raids, skirmishes, pvp)+ PVP indeed: tricky one, say a mixed bag. Altho it's maybe one of the aspects i enjoyed more about the Neverwinter experience, it's got many issues that never got resolved - like dumb matchmaking, overpowered pay-to-win dynamics, and the very repetitive nature of it (ONE small MAP ONLY for arena and one for RvR - which isn't even technically RvR -see cons)+ the foundry (always nice to look at someone else's creations)+ dungeons and+ dragons+ it's free to play..but well, pretty much, that's it. The whole thing kept me entertained for a total amount of ~1k hours or so, but in all truth, at least 1/3 of that time was me praying (literally) and hoping to see something harder-better-faster-stronger that sadly, though, simply isn't there.CONS- meh storyline (around the 3rd time you get 'the talk' from sgt. Knox, you've stopped caring already)- absolutely useless loot (after hours of quests, all you're left with to fill your baby backpack is a pile of worthless junk and a bunch of pennies - drops which would be actually useful for your class are so rare that you'd be tempted to just hit the shops.. but dem prices!)- way too many currencies, REALLY. I personally lost count of the various local insignia, the sigils, the seals, the ardent, celestial and whatnot coins. Glory? Zen? Black Ice? It's simply overwhelming, and it's probably there to prove your patience and push you to the shops- a shamelessly overpriced Action House and an even worse real-money shop: prices are simply unrealistic. 40$ only on a fancy mount, knowing you have to pay almost as much on bits and bobs like armor pieces or refining material you can't just do without if you wanna enjoy late game at least a little bit. Or even just to reroll abilities and skill points!- ridiculous prices usually lead to one main thing: GRINDFEST. Expect hours (or DAYS, or WEEKS) of joyless plodding through dungeons and minor uninteresting events just to farm enough Astral Diamonds to buy.. a key. - quests and dungeons get boring and repetitive after a while. Let alone the random seasonal events, which appear for a small few days window and induce players to direct the grindfest focus on those, for a slim chance to get mmm, a new pet?- the rigidity of the events calendar. That's even against the basic notion of free-will. You'll get something like a 45' span to do -say- skirmishes, and if you do them in that time-frame you'll get some bonus. Point is that, given the desperate amount of grind, everyone would rather do these activities when it's bonus time - therefore, outside of that time-frame, good luck queueing for dungeons or whatever else. - no real reason to socialize, apart from dungeons: the game is not open world, so you can't just put a group together for some good ol' free roaming. You've got your tiny shiny path to follow - alone. But even skirmishes and dungeons are not the ideal place to make friends: at the end of the day, everyone worries about themselves and the loot, which is a bit sad indeed.- no open world, just instances - I find them a bit limiting and claustrophobic.- crafting? forget about it. just read: GRINDFEST.- PVP, as I said earlier, is something that i really enjoyed in the game, but it's got its problems. You get the chance to take part in a sort of fake-open-world arena later in the game, but no one really plays it and it's not even a proper arena either: you'll just hang out in that specific area, maybe to do some fetch-quest, and will randomly bump into some other player from a different 'faction' who's there doing his own thing. To kill or not to kill? You might as well just ignore each other and finish your own silly quests in peace.- RvR which is not really RvR (my heart still goes to DAOC), it's called 'Gauntlgrym PVP'. Basically a capture-the-flag zergfest where you'll run around a lot, and if the numbers are on your side, you'll simply overwhelm the enemy faction. BUT, prior to getting into one of these matches, in order to be eligible for the queue, you'll have to take part in a series of hectic fetch-quests.TL;DRGive it a go if this is your first MMORPG maybe, just to see what's what. But if you're a more experienced player, looking for something new&challenging, you might get bored soon.			"

												I don't know if i can say it's worth any real money to put into it. It is a breath of fresh air in game mechanics for MMORPG's but I dont know if it's enough to gain all the time you need to invest to get anything done. The crafting system is the most annoying system I have ever come across in an MMORPG. I found myself just ignoring or avoiding it all cost. Unless your a true fan of MMORPG's or roleplaying fan don't bother. But if you do like to role play it has a good system for getting you and others into your toon.			"

												After playing this game for 17 hours or so and reaching level 22 on a Human Great Weapon Fighter class I say that this game is pretty good for a free to play MMO. I am pleasantly surprised how Perfect World Entertainment did with the D&D game.Aside from the questing and lore in the game (there is lots of D&D lore) the Enchanting and upgrading enchanting is done nicely and there is lots of Enchanted Chest drops.The queue system for daily's and groups is nice to see. I hate when a new MMO is released without the basic options to make playing fun.The ""Foundry"" (opens up to you at level 15) lets you create user based content and quests. There is plenty of daily quests to do and Dungeon Delves where you get some nice piece of loot when the time comes up for these options.Down Side I don't like is that to open the enchanted lock box's you need an enchanted key and that can only be bought on the market place and you need to use Zen to buy on the in game store.

												The game is actually good. I spent more than 4000 hours on it since its release. However, Neverwinter is not only p2w but also operated by a chinese company, which is really awful. This game may be free to play but in fact, it is by far more expensive than any other game in the market. You absolutely cannot get BIS without money or exploits. I played since beta, spent a decent amount of money, and I am still far from being BIS. At the current state, I will never reach BIS because I can't generate enough in-game currency by legal means. The game is also extremely grindy. You have to grind forever make even the smallest changes to your character which makes it really hard for new players to actually become competitive. By the way, if you decide to pay to win through the in-game store, be aware that it may cost thousands of dollars to get decent.The company behind the game is also infamous for its bait-n-switch practices. They promise things on the forums, then break their promises a couple of months later without any consideration for their player base. Please understand this. You do not have active GM's online, bugs rarely get fixed, and there is no transparency in how the devs do business. One of the game's main feature which is the ""Foundry"" gets disabled all the time, and it is currently unavailable to players. It has been down for nearly two months and devs do not even bother to explain why or when they plan to get it back on. In other words, bad customer service, bad dev team, bad business model, and lazy and rushed content,Players have absolutely no voice and censorship is extremely common in the forums. I have posted many times in response to the issues that negatively affect the game just to get my posts removed. The forum moderators lack preparation and it is not uncommon for some staff members to indirectly insult and mock players in response to their lack of satisfaction with the game. I loved Neverwinter since its pre-release. It is a game full of potential with amazing mechanics and possiblities of infinite content through the Foundry. I still play the game but I do not advise anyone to spend money in it. The money you spend is a waste as the economy is volatile and extremely unstable. If you are looking for a game to play for a while that will be fun and rewarding, then NW is not for you. However, if you are looking to just waste time playing a D&D themed game, then go ahead.			"

												Neverwinter is an extremly fun MMO, and I suggest you should try it out too. It's a really well made F2P MMO. But the reason why I'm telling you to try it, but not recomending it is because there isn't much to do after you hit lvl 60, The pvp is unbalanced, and The zen trade is also unfair. I'm trying to keep every thing brief. The good:One thing they did really well and is the reason why you should at least give it a try is a the combat. It's really fast paced, which is something that other mmo's should have. And also instead of spending Money you can use Astral Diamonds to get zen. The classes are good, but nothing note worthy. The pvp is unbalanced, because of some classes are too OP. But it's fun and isn't much of a problem most of the times. And my favorite part the Naming system. It's really hard to name your character when almost every name you can think of is taken. Well NW is the first game I played that doesn't restrict any name, even if another player has that name. but you must have a diffrent handle(you're Arc username). No names are restricted so feel free to name your self what ever. The Bad:You hit lvl 60 and now can fight valrinda, get missions from the king himself, and start IceWind Dale. at first this might add some extra hours(or in my case weeks) of stuff to do, and then it get's repeative. Hoping to get to IceWind Dale...You might quit before or after this point so I don't have to explain it anyway.  I'm a Tricker Rogue and the most annoying things in PvP is Great Weapon fighters and Control Wizards. The GWF will most likley charge at you and spam attacks that knock you down. Once you're on the groud you're crying to your avatar to get up because you just now noticed you're getting jumped by any thing not on your team and can't do any thing about it. Same Goes for the Control Wizards. They will either push you back, or use the force that will hold you down and put you to the mercy of any thing in the vicinity. Other people say my class is kind of OP, but if you know the attacks Tricker Rogues do, you should be fine. And finally the Conversion from Astrail Diamonds to Zen. Zen is what you get for spending money, and it's really tempting to get a bigger inventory, more character slots or to rebuilt your Skill points because you ♥♥♥♥ed up the first time. Any way it's around 500Ad to get you a single zen coin. And items on the Zen Market is about 100-10,000. So basicly it will take you years to get what you want from the zen Market.I'll give this game an 7.9/10 and an award for best MMO naming system of all time. It's a really fun game you should play it, but don't expect it to last forever.			"

												Ahh Neverwinter the Dungeons and Dragons game thats just..well...NOT.I have played D&D since the 80s and I must say this is a good action based mmo. The thing its NOT is Dungeons and Dragons. I don't see how they can even use their name as this is about as far from D&D as a game could get.The game has the 4th edition character classes but its insane how they have taken these classes and totally botched them up.  You do THOUSANDS of points of damage, you have THOUSANDS of hit points, just about everything about this game is WRONG from a D&D standpoint. Each class only has 1 weapon they can use, 1 type of armor. Priests cannot melee the list goes on and on. This is NOT D&D, not even close.Now that I've got that out of the way, I'll describe what the game IS.This is an action based instanced MMO. You have several game hubs or cities scattered around the map.You must teleport to these zones, you cannot travel there any other way so there is no exploration or sense of the world being a real physical place to travel in. You just port to whatever zone you want to go to. There is alot to do in this game and you wont be bored easily as you level up there is always something to do, progression is good right up to the end-game.Character class trees are varied and there are 3 paths to take with each character class letting you mold your character into the type that suits your playstyle in your class.Dungeons are good for the most part, smallish in size not taking too long to run through 30 to 45 mins is the normal timeframe for the group dungeons, much less for the solo ones. You can hire companions to come with you in your journeys, healers, tanks, damage dealers, mages all types of creatures. These companions are helpful but a bit weak at later levels. You can equip them as well to help them perform better, and each one provides bonuses for your character as well. Healers provide a heal or regeneration bonus, tanks increase your armor..this sort of thing. There are alot of daily activities for gaining specific loot and gear sets that you can grind for.There are a few campaigns in the game that require doing the same thing over and over many many MANY times.These are not required but do provide some descent gear and rewards in the end. They seem to add 1 campaign every major update with 5 in-game as of this writing if you include the pvp campaign. PVP is done as you level up and has some of the best gear in the game as rewards for your efforts. Most of the pvp is done on 1 map or arena and gets old quick. The end game pvp is a little more varied with a huge area where you are pitted against another team to accomplish goals.This goes through stages with a dungeon run at the end. Winners get the best dungeon, the losers get a lesser dungeon to run through.With the Icewind Dale campaign there is a small open pvp section of an area where you can fight the opposing faction.All in all Neverwinter is a fun game, its NOT D&D but if you take that out of the equation it is an enjoyable experience with lots of stuff to do. Many will claim this is a pay to win game. I haven't spent a dime on the game since its release and have had a good time playing. Paying will get you things faster, better mounts, better companions, and better gear if you buy the lockboxes. I just ignore all this stuff and have done ok just playing the game for free. The final word. Just try it, take it for what it is and don't get caught up in the lie that its a D&D game.It IS fun, and its FREE, you have nothing to lose!  "

												Hello,So I looked at this game and got curious, read through forums and so on to find that the game was well received. So as I like to play MMORPGs, I thought giving it a try. As you can see my game time on Steam for this is low but the time I've spent on the game was me trying to adjust the graphics settings and fight the game to make it properly running. Constant crashes, settings not remember or not even taking effect. After few hours and plenty of tries I finally give up.I have a between middle and high-end gaming machine. I've been running a lot heavier games without issues on max settings and max resolution but this one gave me Hell I've never seen before. I hope the DEVs fix all the issues but I've never had this happen to me before.Definitely can't recommend the game due to bugs.			"

												For being HEINOUSLY repetative and grindy, as well as rediculous price-scaling in Astral Diamons to Zen? This game keeps sucking me back in. The development cycle is relatively fast-paced, the PayWall is not THAT bad. The inclusion of a browser-based mini-game is innovative and fun. But for all the treasures you find, I find that the zone events tend to keep you in a sense of urgency- that COMPLETELY removes you from the story and mission path of that zone. Keep trying, PWI.

												Neverwinter might have been a interesting light MMO but greed has destroyed the game.The current policy in the game is to maximize profits at the exclusion of everything else. To that end nearly all development time is devoted to make more sellable items. The many bugs in the game, even the game breaking ones like dungeon chests always giving the same loot, go unaddressed for a long time. Exploits have destroyed the economy and using them has gone unpunished meaning that especially as new player you will be faced with prices you won't be able to pay even for simple items.But as that means that some people might buy Zen for real money this was not addressed by Cryptic at all.The prices of all items you can buy with real money are just laughable. $70 for a badly made race (they do not even have helmet textures) or $50 for skipping content (which is mind numbingly boring like all campaigns cryptic does but give permanent bonuses). To hide the true cost items can only rarely be bought separatly and are instead bundled together with lots of useless stuff. Cryptic is also not above using fake sales like selling the Dragonborn pack for $75 for a limited time instead of $100, but after the ""sale"" ends they change the normal price to $75.To keep players in line the official forums are patrolled heavily by mods and any mentioning of problems in the game will get the post deleted and you might also get banned. This includes warnings others about mislabeled ""Bind on Equip"" items which are instead ""Bind on Pickup"" (the current bug that shall not be named).And finally Steam users are constantly harrased in the game as Cryptic wants to push their ARC launcher instead of steam. That means when you buy something through steam you are on probation for several weeks and face severe restrictions until Cryptic verifies that your money is good. And redeeming keys is only possible with the ARC launcher and not through a website.Stay away from the game, the greedy practices of Cryptic and the neglect of actual issues is sucking all potential fun out of it.

												Firstly, I must state that I haven't paid any money for this game so I can't comment on pay-to-win problems.- Anyway, this game had a good atmosphere and a well written story. It wasn't surprising, considering it was based on Forgotten Realms.- But it also had -still has- a very active combat system, unless like a lot of MMOs with static ones.- Leveling up was pretty fun, too. ""Not grinding"" was the main reason for this, you always changed maps and quests and moved forward. It was very fun.These three properties made Neverwinter special in my opinion. But Elemental Evil changed two of these for the worse, much worse.Compared to the first 60 levels, it's story is really poorly written. It's like they didn't even bother to delve into massive sea of lore that is Forgotten Realms, but instead they made bad guys suddenly just pop up and attack us. That's it, there's nothing more to than that (except for an old friend, well technically two). No satisfying explanation, diologue or anything, they just attack and we just kill.Also, I was very confused and upset to see Neverwinter using the grinding system, especially in a game that was never meant to be that way. Using the same old maps, and very boring, not diverse quest types made it worse.Two of the most important things that made Neverwinter different from other MMOs were anti-grinding and story. And they somehow managed to ruin this.			"

												I have mixed Feelings about this game doesn't really say it stayed in the lines of the D&D genre it kind of feeling like they makes things up to really over powered rougue and the really underpowered heavy weapons fighters i would suggest for people that are just starting out then you should play this but expect it to try and stuck money out of you like a sparkly money vampire.PRO: It's free fun to play with friends and seems mostly bug free and the min system Requirements is pretty good Cons: Gets old quickly as you quickly see that it is not as good as other D&D type games and  it will do almost anything to try and get you to buy Zen and even if you do the price of stuff you would buy is very high.Note:i still play this game because i like to play with friends and the system Requirements or DDO is high for them			"

												When you first start playing Neverwinter you're kind of taken aback at the vast world and deep storyline in front of you. You roll a few different character classes like you would in any MMO just to play around. It is at this point that you finally see Neverwinter's greatest flaw. Redundency. Every class feels like it plays exactly the same. Every dungeon run, even with different people plays exactly the same. In order to get any of the currency you need for trading on the auction house, or if you want to trade for paid currency, you have to play the same redundent dailys over and over again. Most MMOs don't really start to feel redundent until late game but Neverwinter seems to accomplish that after level ten. I really really wanted to like it, as I said before the story was quite good, and the character created quests seemed interesting but Neverwinter just gets bogged down by it's own redundency. If you want to play it with one charcter and stick to that one character all the way till max level just to experience the story that could be an okay experience. Venturing beyond that and trying to play the game as an MMO instead of a single player game and the ""magic"" of game starts to truly fall apart.			"

												This would be a very nice game if it wasn't full of bugs, most of them very frustrating. Example: you finish a dungeon or skirmish and you can't get the reward chest because you are still in combat with some glitching add that you just can't see. I played a lot of MMORPGs and RPGs and had my share of bugs with each of them, but when it occurs as often as in Neverwinter, it makes you feel sorry about all the time wasted playing the game. I never met a game so bugged as this one and I understand this problem has been going on for years now. I never got an answer to the issues I made notices for from no GM, even after weeks after I posted them.Conclusion? Although I understand it's a free-to-play game, the developer shows no respect to players however, therefore maybe they shouldn't be in the business after all.Too bad, this game could really have potential.

												I wish I could post a neutral review of this game.  It was very fun to start, all the way until level cap.  At which point, the pay to win started to show itself.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to have adequate gear to do ANYTHING but dailies (yawn) when you initially hit level cap.  I spent $100 on zen, converted it to ED, bought all the best gear I could on the AH at level cap.  And I still had a GS of only 12K.  That is completely unacceptable.  Not to mention how long it would have taken had I simply played enough to get that gear. Fun until level cap, then worst game ever.  Then prepare to cry when every group you join for dungeons falls apart by the first group of mobs.  Every group of pvp has some twinked out rogues who have perma invisibilty and attack and then run off like pansies.  Only to do this repeatedly until you are murdered, without even touching them.

												Pros: The combat in the game is really fun, its not your tipical click and wait MMO. It feels more like an action adventure game, where position and dodging is key to survive.Cons: A) BUUUUUUGSSSSSSS: The game was launched as a full game on june 2013, so you´ll think the game is in a playable state, yet the VERY FIRST DUNGEON in the game was bugged and to my knowledge to this day its still bugged and it cant be completed and the fourt dungeon you can access was also bugged and couldnt be completed. I understand that MMO may have bugs and glitches after release, but after a year, having your VERY FIRST DUNGEON IN THE GAME BUGGED IS UNACCEPTABLE....also crashes, falling through the map, dungeon bosses who wont drop any loot, etcB) The time you spend leveling from 1 to 60 is the most repetitive process i have ever seen in an mmo. You start in a city, you get a quest to teleport to a certain area, you go there, accept a bunch of quest that involve either killing X amount of enemies or gather X amount of materials, you complete them and then you get 1 more quest that asks you to go to a unique instance and fight a mini boss, you go back to the quest giver who tells you to go to a different quest giver in a different part of the area, once you get there is the same thing...5 to 7 quest and then a miniboss, you do this 3 times before you are sent back to the city to go to a different area....AND THIS HAPPENS IN EVERY AREA, 5-7 quest, mini boss, do this 3 times and you are done with that areaC) Even though you can be a f2p without a problem, from lvl 1 to 60, everything in the game is hiden behind a paywall. Like any other MMO by perfect world enterteinment, the game has 3 different kinds of currency1)Bronze, silver and gold coins: Classic mmo currency, that is basically useless, since the things you can buy with it are limited to potions, 1 single mount (a horse that comes in 6 differnet colors) and very low lvl gear.2)Astral diamonds: Unique currency in the game that can be obtained by doing daily quest or by doing certain profession tasks. This is the most usefull currency in the game and so the hardest to get. You can use it to buy high lvl gear (you can pretty much avoid the dungeon grinding for gear at lvl 60 and buy a whole set of gear using diamonds) The auction house items can ONLY be bought with astral diamonds, unique mounts, cosmetics, basically everything that you cant buy with the previous currency must be bought with astral diamonds, especially the most important item in the game...the scroll of identification, that are used to idenfity gear so you can see the stats and wear it and since enemies have a higher chance of dropping gear than scrolls you are going to end up with a bag full of green or blue items that you cant wear because you dont have scrolls.3) Zen: The universal currency of everysingle perfect world entertainment game, can only be bought with real-life money and you can use it to buy more astral daimonds or other items like keys used to open lockboxes or the most basic feature of every mmo out there...resseting your character stats in case you made a mistake, yep, you can only ""respec"" your character if you pay real money...thankfully there is an in-game feature that allows real players to offer zen for astral diamonds, so you can grind astral diamonds and buy zen without spending any money...but since the people who buy zen are the ones who put a price, the amount of diamonds needed for a decent amount of zen is astronomical.Now you may think thats not a big deal since that doesnt necessary means the game is pay to win....well think again, you can actually see videos online of people soloing dungeons in the game because they bought high-level gear or special items like scrolls that allow you to resurrect the moment you are killed so the bosses health wont reset.

												The game looks nice, the combat is very fun and engaging.  It's definitely a different take on MMO combat compared to other games I've played.  The character builds seem to have variety and depth, but I can't say for certain as I'm not max level.Unfortunately, that's where the good stops.The game is garbage.  You get nickel and dimed every two minutes.  If you want to succeed in the game you have to participate in the worst MMO activity ever invented - dailies.  Alternatively, cash shop.Beyond that, the rest of the game sucks as well.  It's extremely linear.  It is not open world.  There are ? and !'s above people's heads.  The group combat is faceroll.  Literally.  Play a healer, go to dungeon, roll face on keyboard.  Bet no one dies and nobody even notices that you didn't do anything.  The quests are boring and your actions do not affect the world in anyway.  There is no PvP outside of instances as far as I can tell.  The game is literally 95% PvE, even moreso than WoW.The game would be far better if it was subscription base not f2p.  Unfortunately, beyond the combat mechanics, the rest of the game sucks so I wouldn't subscribe anyways.			"

												Great at start - disappointing in the end. It was awesome until I hit lvl 60, gear reset is so brutal that I cant kill mobs on lvl 60 quests...Im lvl 63 now. Dafuq? Devs are forcing people to spend money on higher lvl to progress properly...since you lack of diamonds which would take you like forever to farm. From lvl 60 to 70 you grind repeatable dailys...over and over and over again. This is a mess since I thought I found my new favorite MMORPG since the leveling was so fun! The spells look great and the movement + combat is awesome.Im really disappointed.... Elemental Evil should be reworked in my opinion and offer a real questline, no repeatable dailys.			"

												I loved the style of the game, I loved how there isn't a mana pool, I've only played one class which was the mage and I didn't reach end-game but I played a decent amount of the content, it's all very standard of an mmorpg and pretty nice stuff, interface can be a little confusing at the start (for example it took me a while to find out how to queue up for dungeons and stuff) but unfortunately as other people have said it is definitely pay2win and they constantly try to encourage you to buy things with real money by making every single mob have a pretty high chance of dropping these boxes, which they tease you with by showing you the epic loot inside, and they can only be unlocked with keys that as far as I'm aware can only be bought with an ingame currency called Zen which you can either buy or buy from other players with other ingame currency called Astral Diamonds which you can only get a certain amount of each day, I suppose this in essence stops ""gold farming"" situations however the economy is so skewed that grinding for the Zen Market items is unrealistic so you're practically forced into spending money, similarly to the boxes you're constantly given discount coupons which once again tempt you into spending money, you can't do anything else with them and dropping them brings up a warning like you're about to throw away the offer of a lifetime. The profession system from what I saw of it seemed intriguing although I never got into it deep enough to discover it's practicality, the unique thing about it is you're not locked into one or two professions but can train all of them to max level, however you're restricted, to level a profession you have to do ""tasks"" tasks are simple; have the required items, wait a set amount of time, receive reward, you can start the tasks anywhere and continue doing other stuff, however, at the start you're only allowed 1 task slot and professions seem to level painfully slow, additional slots can be unlocked once certain requirements are met but these requirements are clearly end-game level stuff and realistically it's still probably more beneficial to level up 1 profession first which will unlock you additional task slots, the game seems very grind intensive which I suppose can be expected in this day and age and I've heard some stories about the developers and tech support not being particularly caring towards their community, because of this and the fact that I feel they're just out to get your money I can't recommend this game completely, consider this a half recommendation, I suggest you download it and play it with a couple friends but don't invest too much of your time in it and don't invest any of your money in it, basically play it to check it out, especially if you've played other Neverwinter games because I felt like the combat mechanics were quite satisfying to start off with although the novelty wore off and the graphics are nice, a bit WoW-esque but I like that style.

												First of all this game existed for more then year before it came to steam so arguments about not playing long enough that so many people are saying to everyone that don't recommend this game are not valid.This game allow selling endgame gear on real money auction house. Everything on Auction house is payed by Astral diamonds and Astral diamonds are farmed endlesly or bought by Zen and Zen are bought by real money....Does this selling endgame gear for real money reminds you something? I am sure it does..You want to be good in PVP or PVE? Go to Auction house and buy what you need or become mindless farming zombie...or stick to basic gear without any hight upgrades like runes +9 and accept that you will never be good as those that who pay.This is how this game works in short.

												My main complaint with this game is how simple the combat is. You have an 3 abilities on cooldowns bound to Q,E,R,  two ""daily"" abilities which you can use after attacking enough enemies, an artifact which may or may not be combat related and has a long cooldown, and then two normal attacks you use whenever by clicking left or right mouse. I'm not asking for something like WoW where abilities cloud up the bottom of your screen, but having access to 7 or 8 skills at a time gets real samey, and no encounter really differentiates itself as a result. There's a pattern to every fight I'm in, and it is Q, R, right mouse, then left mouse until I can use Q or R again, using a daily if there's a particularly tough enemy, and E if I need to heal me or my companion. I could spice things up and use R first instead of Q, but that ultimately doesn't change anything. At first this game sucked me in, and I loved the world, the music, the questing, all of it, but the combat was  too dull for me to continue playing (at least without friends, but practically every game is fun with friends.)

												This was the game that finally convinced me to close my account across all of Perfect World Entertainment's games. Firstly,  as a compulsive RPG hoarder, you start of with a very spartan amount of storage space for the many items you'll pick up and sell along the way. Half of the time I was playing, it was staring at the screen when it was telling me that my inventory was full. You'll get another bag at later levels, but it only provides around 12 spaces of inventory. I thought, ""Hey, that's no problem. Maybe I can start crafting my own bags!"" Nope. You get what you get, unless you want to pay real money. It also has some very imbalanced-feeling PvP, where you're steamrolling one team and getting destroyed by the next. Nearly everything in the game has its natural progression blocked to a dead stop until you a. find some way to farm the correct currency or b. pay up. I would like to support companies that make good content and give me very good reason to pay for premium features, but when the first thing you see is advertisements for ingame stuff that you would end up paying real money for, and a distractingly shiny ""pay me!"" logo in the interface itself, that's where I have to draw the line.

												My main complaint with this game is how simple the combat is. You have an 3 abilities on cooldowns bound to Q,E,R,  two ""daily"" abilities which you can use after attacking enough enemies, an artifact which may or may not be combat related and has a long cooldown, and then two normal attacks you use whenever by clicking left or right mouse. I'm not asking for something like WoW where abilities cloud up the bottom of your screen, but having access to 7 or 8 skills at a time gets real samey, and no encounter really differentiates itself as a result. There's a pattern to every fight I'm in, and it is Q, R, right mouse, then left mouse until I can use Q or R again, using a daily if there's a particularly tough enemy, and E if I need to heal me or my companion. I could spice things up and use R first instead of Q, but that ultimately doesn't change anything. At first this game sucked me in, and I loved the world, the music, the questing, all of it, but the combat was  too dull for me to continue playing (at least without friends, but practically every game is fun with friends.)

												This was the game that finally convinced me to close my account across all of Perfect World Entertainment's games. Firstly,  as a compulsive RPG hoarder, you start of with a very spartan amount of storage space for the many items you'll pick up and sell along the way. Half of the time I was playing, it was staring at the screen when it was telling me that my inventory was full. You'll get another bag at later levels, but it only provides around 12 spaces of inventory. I thought, ""Hey, that's no problem. Maybe I can start crafting my own bags!"" Nope. You get what you get, unless you want to pay real money. It also has some very imbalanced-feeling PvP, where you're steamrolling one team and getting destroyed by the next. Nearly everything in the game has its natural progression blocked to a dead stop until you a. find some way to farm the correct currency or b. pay up. I would like to support companies that make good content and give me very good reason to pay for premium features, but when the first thing you see is advertisements for ingame stuff that you would end up paying real money for, and a distractingly shiny ""pay me!"" logo in the interface itself, that's where I have to draw the line.

												Purely wouldn't reccomend because of the Account stuff.I Know i have a perfect world account. (Which only lets me log in with the E-mail, not the username)And i have a cryptic one.And it doesn't even seem to be able to tell them apart itself. Yet wont let me log into my cryptic account.Whenever i try to reset the password (Like it suggests) . It /seems/ To be doing it for my perfect world account, Not the cryptic account. Not that it matters as it doesn't work for either. It's just mental. And put me off even trying the game. Because i can't sort it and quite frankly after wasting half an hour trying, just don't care anymore ;-;Probably fine for new users. But i'll never know.Fix your account system guys.Srsly.			"

												As PerfectWorld (PWE) and ARC manage the game, I have very little hope that they have any control whatsoever on the user base and user content.  STO is another PWE game and has one of the most vile disgusting MMO communities in a game designed for ages 13+ that I have seen.  The Game Masters do not address these issues in a timely manner at all.  I wouldn't recommend installing any PWE games until they are bought out by someone that will manage them properly.Rated U: Uninstall			"

												I'll keep this short, since all I really wanted to do is drop off a thumbs down.Pretty  much everything that people say about mod 6 is true. The grindfest for the endgame is already unbearable if you are an old-timer (like me) with 10 characters as profession farms. If you just started the game you will rue the day you hit lvl 65-70, unless you have a few hundred $$ to spare on this game.Prior to endgame the content is actually still fun, (as long as you avoid pvp), especially if you level through foundry quests. Don't get serious with this game until they fix the mess of mod 6 though.Edit: Ever since cryptic changed the AD economy things have gotten a wee bit better, if you are a casual player. The grindfest that is level 68 however still remains, and the refining systems to upgrade your gear is so painfully slow and expensive that you can spend more than half a year on one character's minute upgrades, while you repeat the same dungeons and daily quests, day after day.

												The game started out great, but exploits surfacing every few months makes the game very unfair when it comes to PvP. A new player will have to spend several thousand dollars just to compete, and even then the class-balance and patches are horrible for the most part. If you want to try it for the story and gameplay go ahead, but I suggest you stop playing after you have hit max level because from there on it is all a cash-grab where you either exploit or pay to stay competitive.

												Hello,So I looked at this game and got curious, read through forums and so on to find that the game was well received. So as I like to play MMORPGs, I thought giving it a try. As you can see my game time on Steam for this is low but the time I've spent on the game was me trying to adjust the graphics settings and fight the game to make it properly running. Constant crashes, settings not remember or not even taking effect. After few hours and plenty of tries I finally give up.I have a between middle and high-end gaming machine. I've been running a lot heavier games without issues on max settings and max resolution but this one gave me Hell I've never seen before. I hope the DEVs fix all the issues but I've never had this happen to me before.Definitely can't recommend the game due to bugs.			"

												The game is amazing and accomplishes everything it tried to do to make an MMORPG interactive, story-based and action-based. Although I am not one which enjoys questing, the quests in this game are amazing, and creating a new character to experience the questline again is enjoyable and exciting. One thing I have learnt through experience is that this game is perhaps the opposite of Pay2Win. I did not believe that when I started playing but experience and time in this game are what counts the most. My only reason to stop playing this game was that the end-game storylines and quests are extremely repetitive, and after you own 4 level 60 characters with maxed out epic tier items for PvP and PvE, the game is pretty much done, and you feel that the game is definately over. I reccomend this game to anyone into serious and difficult MMOs, in which you can show your skill in either PvE or PvP. You will be rewarded in either way. I assure at least 200 hours of excellent game-time before any symptoms of boredom towards the game show up. I myself have played over 230 hours of it and finally bored myself over the end-game quests. But don`t take my word for it. Try it yourself. Perhaps you are more of a quester than me.			"

I don't find it difficult to find my friends. It is fun, simple and just truly enjoyable. For those that appreciate the RP, the lore is legendary and being able to add character bio's to your character, that allows others to learn of you, is splendid.

												Incredibly fun MMO with heavy D&D feel (but just the fun parts!). Make your own quests! Auto-grouping while killing huge dargons/L337 baddies! Fun combat and pvp, though they could use a few more pvp maps.Crafting system is pretty fun, time-based and anyone can do anything, you can even craft on your phone while away from PC, but I was very sad when they nerfed the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of leadership, and removed it from mobile.Plus I enjoyed sliding around on my cleric like the dude from Risky Business.9/10 will slide around some more.*Edit* This review was based on the last time I played, maybe 6mos ago. Now, sadly I must agree with many of the other reviewers that this game is no longer worth it. Once upon a time it was fun on a bun, but now its a looooong boring grind unless you're into that pay-to-win thing. Which I am not. So my 9/10 is demoted to 4/10, because its still pretty and the combat is still fun, but the endgame is crap and the grind is too much. RIP Neverwinter, once loved, now shunned.			"

												It's fun if you like endless pve questing, with tons and tons of gear, crafting stuff, etc. (and of course a cash shop).The pvp is totally unbalanced. The problem seems that there is no real efficient tiering to pvp against other players with similiar gear, and the crowd control means perm-stun. Great for pve, fail for pvp.Edit:The pvp is compete nonsense, worst i have ever seen: a breakdown of gaming balance fundamentals. It's about meta game with rediculous chain disables and phase teleportations. There is no cooldown for crowd control and you get perma stun, repeated again and again. You can't let pve ez mode overkill abilities and gear get into pvp, it's unbalanced. Also, to be able to use p2w gear in pvp is the worst fail of all. The pve side of the game is very enjoyable, and i liked the queue'd public dungeons. I wouldn't ever take a game with this cash model seriously, because it has no real goal, except to hustle you to spend more than you should just to get the content (gear). I do believe in spending some money to support f2p games, and even support a subcription fee for a great game, in which case i would expect ALL content, gear and items , which this game and many others wont do.

												My review to Neverwinter -Neverwinter, it is a based on ""Neverwinter Nights"" and ""Dungeons & Dragons"".(No its not part of the series of NN according Wikipedia).Let's start with the gameplay - Neverwinter is not like the other MMORPG games out there like ""World of Warcraft"" etc.it's bit different, we don't have numbers to attack in different ways, we have to press on the mouse,or press Q, E, R and this, to use abilities. (BTW, in NN and NN2 it's like WoW style and NN is not a MMORPG, just rpg).The movment system also different. In case that you don't need to press on the target to attack them only aim and press the ability or on the mouse.Leveling is like the other MMORPGs just do quests, killing enemies and this stuff but the leveling is kinda easy, you get quite enough from quests.Graphics and Physics -Graphics are important part in video games, its can be bad, it can be good.the game shows us what 'Cryptic Studios' can do with their game. graphics are nice, not awesome but nice.Physics are not that good at this game bit silly, like if you push a barrel you can push only that way that it cannot fall only if there something that can do that it will fall somehow.the enemies does not have ragdoll, (It is not so important but just saying).A.I. -Not that smart but decent. the bosses are smart attacking you when you can't attack or you have no ability to attack stronger.Snipers are silly too, like an A.I from a shooter game, when you are behind wall they shoot you, like everybody.the enemies are silly too, like the bosses but not that smart like the bosses.Ok, that is all, this is my review. you do not need to like it you can hate it how much you want this is my opinion, and YES THIS GAME IS PAY 2 WINThe good - Nice Gameplay Nice Graphics Character Customization that can take you at least 20 minutesThe bad -Silly A.IBad PhysicsStory is not that interestingPay to winScores Gameplay - 8.5Graphics - 9.0Physics - 6.0A.I. - 6.5Story- 7.0Final score - 8.5 / 10			"

Posted: February 13, 2014
UPDATE for Module 6 and beyond (as of mod 10):So in my earlier review I criticized this game for being buggy, and its aggressive pay-to-win model. A lot has changed since then, but with microtransactions the game has only gotten worse. Note that the majority of my time in the game has been outside Steam. I have a ~3k item level Devoted Cleric, healer build.Pros:Beautiful music and scenery in most levels. Much of the game has a sort of dice-rolling feel similar to what you'd expect from the tabletop D&D it's based on, especially once you start delving into the finer details of combat mechanics.Free-to-play, though technically only free in that cash payments can be substituted with month-long consecutive time sinks (with daily and weekly caps).Although much of the community remains toxic, there are guilds and groups of people often willing to help out another player. Dungeons (5-player) and epic trials (10-25 players) more and more require teamwork and coordination to win, and cannot be solo'd.The community used to be worse when loot rolls were used for item drops, where votekicking during boss fights was commonplace, but drama-prone loot rolls have been all but replaced with per-player item drops (bound to account to prevent selling it).Cons:The game is extremely and aggressively pay 2 win. If you die, you will have a 15-second timer held in your face, offering to quickly pay real-world money in order to resurrect yourself (using scroll of life). But that's of course optional, and you can ultimately advance through the game without ever buying it. The true nature of this game's pay-to-win mechanic peeks out of hiding at level 60, then appears again at level 70.Once you're at level 70 (read below) your item level - the arbitrary developer-assigned overall assessment of the gear you have - is what determines which dungeons you may enter, and who will be willing to play with you. There are ways to make your character stronger, but increasing the item level is always increasingly expensive because it's biased towards enchantments and armor enhancements instead of gear itself. Potions, buffs, and companion stats (including augments) don't count, and as of mod 6, boons no longer count either.Changes from Module 6:At mod 6, the level cap was increased from 60 to 70. All content as of level 70 was designed to make previous gear obsolete. Additionally, all set bonuses from level-60 gear have been removed to ""balance"" the game and ensure all veteran players must invest in their characters again. Enchantment caps were increased from 10 to 12, and artifact ranks from 100/legendary to 140/mythic. The ""gear score"" stat was removed and replaced with ""item level"", where each item has an arbitrary number listed, independent of its stats. Item level is weighted heavily towards artifacts and enchantments, and less representative of overall strength than of money spent on the game. Max item level is roughly 4200, advanced end-game players sitting between 3000-4000, most players sitting between 2000-2500, barriers to entering dungeons generally around 1600-2000 depending on which one, and around 2600 to have a practical shot at surviving them.Many of the old dungeons end-game players were familiar with, and often used to farm astral diamonds from, have been permanently retired. Castle Never, Lair of the Mad Dragon, Spellplague Caverns, Dread Vault, Throne of Idris, and most of Gantlegrym have been removed. Castle Never was later re-designed to be completely different, with different bosses, shorter, and completely different rewards, while Cryptic has declared the old Castle Never is gone for good. Lair of Lostmauth and Valindra's Tower were converted into Tier 1 dungeons. Aside from re-working Castle Never, no new dungeons were added to compensate for the loss at this time, but a new Fangbreaker Island has been added in mod 10, with extremely strict gear score requirements (3100) and only gear obtained from mod 10 (available for real-world money in Zen store) counts.The need/greed/pass loot roll mechanic still exists, but has been removed from most loot dropped by bosses. Anything picked up from bosses, however, is bound to account on pickup, preventing players from selling items in the auction house as was common in Castle Never prior to mod 6. On the bright side, votekicks are MUCH rarer in dungeons or boss fights, although the anonymous votekick mechanic has not been changed. Instead of dungeon delves, there are daily keys to chests, a mechanic to buy additional keys for astral diamonds, and free extra keys (along with 1 daily lockbox key) provided VIP-subscription players.In order to combat the [s]players using items as a currency[/s] botting, many items once used as currency are now bound on pickup. All enchanted lockbox keys are bound to account. Wards are also bound on pickup, except when purchased from the Zen store for $10 USD each, and have been removed from the trade bar store. The daily astral diamond refining cap has increased to 32k per character, and tasks awarding astral diamonds have been reworked to provide more.What to expect:Level 1-60:You select from (as of writing) 8 premade classes and a handful of races and mixed races (more if you buy premium packs) to build your character, with some customization. Almost every item is tied to 1 specific class, and once you pick that class, you're locked into a fairly pre-determined playstyle. The decisions you make here are crucial.Once your character is created, you spawn in a sort of newbie-void where you're forced along a linear path designed to teach you the basic mechanics for your class, then at level 4 or 5 you're cut loose to grind through quests for experience/gold at your own pace... sort of. From here on, quests are still fairly linear, and areas you visit are level-restricted; you can visit most of them anyway, but with the understanding that enemies in the area will dominate you. As you progress through quests, you are sent to other areasLevel 60:A player can realistically advance up to level 60 within a week or less. The content is linear, sometimes slightly repetitive - kill X monster Y times or run into cave and defeat boss - but takes you to brand new areas roughly every couple levels. Early on, it appears your level is the end-all-be-all of how strong you are. That lasts until level 60.Once you hit level 60, the progress to advance another level becomes exponentially higher. You could spend 3-7 days grinding to level 60, then perhaps a week or two for each level after that until you reach 70. Module 6 increased the level cap from 60 to 70, and introduced the Elemental Evil campaign, which caries very little content. Most other content is off limits until you reach level 70, but you can now pay $50 USD to buy a fresh character at level 70 and skip all this.Level 70:Everything you've done up until this point has revolved around your level. At level 70, you will learn all of that was a facade, like a demo, and the real advancement in the game revolves around your item level. In order to advance your item level, you will need to grind for months at a time, on a daily basis, or spend real-world money on enchantments. Enchantments are complicated to explain, so I'd recommend these below wiki links, but ultimately are designed to be extremely expensive. A single enchantment at rank 12 costs approximately $80 USD on the aftermarket, of which you have about 18 slots. Artifacts are in the same ballpark, for which you have 4 slots. Coalescent wards (available for $10 each in zen store) and Preservation wards ($1 for pack of 10) are designed to act as a paywall, where many enchantments have a 1-5% chance of advancing ranks, where a failed upgrade will discard all the materials used to create the enchantment (much more than the ward). For some, this is 1% each rank from 7 until 12.			"

												Make sure you do not purchase any Zen/packs through the steam store. You can have your account placed on probation waiting for verificiation as Steam does not count as a ""trusted source"". Contacting customer support they are unable to clear up this issue and you cannot spend the Zen you purchase. Use the main webpage for neverwinter if you want to purchase Zen instead of the steam wallet/page.			"

												Graphics look like they're from the late '90s, even on the max settings, and the combat feels antiquated. Why play this when you could shell out a small amount and play a more modern MMO like Black Desert Online, etc, or one with a stronger developer like WoW? The only thing going for this game is that it's F2P to start, but you'll quickly realize you'll have to spend a bit for a reasonable experience. This is basically WoW-lite.			"

												It's difficult for me to classify Neverwinter as an MMO. I feel a much better description would be a dungeon hack-and-slash with some MMO trappings. Character customization is bare bones, even leaving out the fact that certain iconic races are locked away behind the pay wall. You're able to choose your character's sex, race, and class along with his/her origin and patron deity. The latter two are surprisingly limited, given the setting; even in 4th Edition's greatly reduced pantheon, there are a number of gods and goddesses worshipped by the people of Faerun, yet the game only gives you a fraction. Likewise, the origins only cover a handful of locales in the Realms. It quickly becomes apparent that this game was not made for diehard fans of Forgotten Realms.If you're looking for a worthy successor to Neverwinter Nights, you will not find it in this game. The Foundry is a poor substitute for that legendary series' robust world-building and DM tools, with even the most highly regarded player-created dungeons essentially boiling down to the same formulaic hack-and-slash gameplay of the main game. I cannot recommend this game to anyone looking for a meaningful MMO experience. With a friend or two, some fun can be had in  fighting your way through waves of kobolds and orcs so long as you keep your expectations in check.Overall: Pass			"

												I am actually not certain whether to recommend this game or not.  It is entertaining in many ways.  However, I played Neverwinter since the beta and many bugs still exist after approximately one year of release (and several patches--which focused on the zen market most of the time).  The inadequate class balancing makes it frustrating for those who love PVP (only specific classes are worth taking into PVP).  If you have played Dungeons & Dragons PnP style, you will find that this game is not entirely D&D (I believe it is stated in the game description that they used modified 4e rules).

As a former Dungeon Master, I wish I have the time to invest in creating quests in the Foundry.  I would like to recommend this game because it is somewhat enjoyable to play.  However, I just find it hard to recommend at this point because of issues that the developers should have fixed a long time ago (graphics bugs, game launcher crashing every so often, game patching can be buggy to some people, some dungeons are frustrating to run because of bugs, some quests/areas/dungeons become buggy right after patching--sometimes to the point of getting stuck and not be able to proceed or appropriate loot not dropping, highly expensive items in the market, and more).

												TL;DR - if you are into D&D you'll probably try this game anyway, and you should. for a reader there is some satisfaction in running around the areas you read about. this review is more of a personal disappointment of failed expectations strictly from gaming perspective. ---dont' mind the low hour qty i have listed on steam.i was one of the original founder packs supporters and spent nearly a year playing the game, spending about ~600 across different packages and booster packs. early quests are OKAY. they look like at least a little bit of thought was put into them. however, relatively quickly it becomes mindless grind. you can completey not pay any attention and fight and level very easily. on occasion you come across inept objects and maps portions that seem like the authors were still attempting to do something interesting, but then got distracted by the money making and gave up.i came from DDO, and apparently ive been taking it for granted how great the stories were behind the quests and how stimulating it was to solve some of teh puzzles, and traverse the diverse environemnts, including under water. every ""map"" in Neverwinter just feels like a slightly different layout of the same thing. so do, in fact the classes. Fury of the Feywild gets slightly refreshing, but not by much.2 saving graces of the game are PvP which almost feels like FPS with the right type of people, and The Foundry, where people with actual writing talent can create some interesting quests for you to play out side of the main story line. if you do play the game, dont bother with any of the $$ packs. they do not enhance the game play at all. they just serve as shortcut to getting to the next level of boredom so you dont spend more time on your lower level of boredom. I gave this game another shot on steam hoping it would at least allow for some trivial achievements, or collector cards. that does not exist either. worse, the game play appears to have become even more grindy. the stats math appears to have been redone and i was artificially struggling in maps that i usually breezed through. the same effect can be achieved by playing maps ahead of year level number. it doesnt save the game play.

												Strangely enough, the PC based version from years back in the 90's gave you a better experience, closer to your character.  The inability to zoom in close, to either have a 1st-person point of view, or a very close third-person view, breaks the immersion for me in this type of game.  If I wanted the diablo-esk birds-eye-view, I would have played diablo.  I played several characters for a bit to try and give it a decent run, but the inability to get close to my character had me exiting out and uninstalling before too long.  Nice concept on a stellar dinasty of a gameline, but did not deliver.  Seems more of a WoW graphics with  Diablo viewpoint, with random short-term central bazaar style game system.  It's a no from me, sorry.			"

												TL;DR - if you are into D&D you'll probably try this game anyway, and you should. for a reader there is some satisfaction in running around the areas you read about. this review is more of a personal disappointment of failed expectations strictly from gaming perspective. ---dont' mind the low hour qty i have listed on steam.i was one of the original founder packs supporters and spent nearly a year playing the game, spending about ~600 across different packages and booster packs. early quests are OKAY. they look like at least a little bit of thought was put into them. however, relatively quickly it becomes mindless grind. you can completey not pay any attention and fight and level very easily. on occasion you come across inept objects and maps portions that seem like the authors were still attempting to do something interesting, but then got distracted by the money making and gave up.i came from DDO, and apparently ive been taking it for granted how great the stories were behind the quests and how stimulating it was to solve some of teh puzzles, and traverse the diverse environemnts, including under water. every ""map"" in Neverwinter just feels like a slightly different layout of the same thing. so do, in fact the classes. Fury of the Feywild gets slightly refreshing, but not by much.2 saving graces of the game are PvP which almost feels like FPS with the right type of people, and The Foundry, where people with actual writing talent can create some interesting quests for you to play out side of the main story line. if you do play the game, dont bother with any of the $$ packs. they do not enhance the game play at all. they just serve as shortcut to getting to the next level of boredom so you dont spend more time on your lower level of boredom. I gave this game another shot on steam hoping it would at least allow for some trivial achievements, or collector cards. that does not exist either. worse, the game play appears to have become even more grindy. the stats math appears to have been redone and i was artificially struggling in maps that i usually breezed through. the same effect can be achieved by playing maps ahead of year level number. it doesnt save the game play.

												Strangely enough, the PC based version from years back in the 90's gave you a better experience, closer to your character.  The inability to zoom in close, to either have a 1st-person point of view, or a very close third-person view, breaks the immersion for me in this type of game.  If I wanted the diablo-esk birds-eye-view, I would have played diablo.  I played several characters for a bit to try and give it a decent run, but the inability to get close to my character had me exiting out and uninstalling before too long.  Nice concept on a stellar dinasty of a gameline, but did not deliver.  Seems more of a WoW graphics with  Diablo viewpoint, with random short-term central bazaar style game system.  It's a no from me, sorry.			"

												Neverwinter Nights and Neverwinter Nights 2 were beautiful games. This is not a beautiful game. This isn't even a beautiful MMO. Disapointment doesn't even begin to describe my feelings in realizing that there will never be another installment of Neverwinter Nights, and Neverwinter will only exist in the pretend gaming comunities that are modern MMOs. If you want to see a desperate gambit to get money by mutilating the Neverwinter setting then this is the game for you. This game had potential for being good, but a few fundamental mistakes were made. First and foremost, it was designed to be another MMO in an endless sea of MMOs (Thanks Blizzard). Second, the game tried to integrate pay2win and grind2win without ever considering the previous titles did well because they were play2win. Thirdly and lastly, the company tried to push a game that the returning demographic would not only be disinterested in playing, but also be offended that something they loved was turned into something so heckneyed and low quality. The last mistake might not have been so bad, but their only real advertisement was through Wizards of The Coast, a company that caters to users that would share the woes of the returning demographic.TL:DR, Game is bad and Perfect World Entertainment should feel bad.

												Maxed out a character. Gotten decently far pretty quickly due to a friend being obsessed and having every class maxed. decided its pay to win and a huge cash grab. Also gets very old fast. Typical go kill this guy quests and fetch quests. Unfortunately it's also quite different than the board game D&D i know and love. Great graphics and great combat setup I will say one of the best combat systems i've seen in an MMO. I cannot recomend this.			"

												This surprised me, for a f2p its not bad.    Pros: PvE this is where the game shines.  There's different  queues for dungeons and skirmishes (team up with people to defeat an outdoor mini dungeon) for your level range.  There's also the foundry which has thousands of player made content which is always being updated and keeps things fresh.  You can of course create a foundry mission which the community can play and applies to the previous statement.  Cons: The classes have balancing issues in pvp and if people have better gear than  you then you'll get rolled but if you farm enough you can get the same gear but its mildly pay to win.  There's class issues in PvE as well for instance I played a tank (so  called) which would lead you to believe you would tank, hold aggro, and be a damage sponge.  This is not the case.  You spend most of your time  running out of the red spots as a tank, which means you aren't dps'ing, which means you're not generating enough threat to hold aggro.  If you stand  in the red and don't block you take huge damage...as a fully geared tank, and spec'ed full tank (I tried both the tank trees in full defensive gear 51% dmg reduction, 32% parry which is very high, and 15% aoe reduction, a large hp pool, among other things) you take massive damage.Your only hope is to use your aoe taunt which has a long cooldown, and spam your fighters recovery daily which unless you're tactician you wont have up when you  need it so thats the  only viable spec I've found.  The so called cookie cutter spec is to stack attack power and go down the tree  that gives you double attack power if you have full block (which means if you block your dps is lowered based on how much shield you have remaining).  This is great for threat, but you can't take much damage and the healing in  this game is pretty bad imo.  This saddens me as I only had an interest in tanking in NW and they've failed the class.  Tanks aren't taken most of the time end game, people would rather have ranged and cc ( ranger and control wizard) control means no healing and more aoe damage potential.Until they fix the tank class to be able to actually tank I wont be playing the game.  ============================================================I did create a foundry mission which was very time consuming (you can spend as much or as little time as you wish on a foundry mission) as I chose to build my own multi-story building (very limited tools made this a lot harder than  it needed to be, for example, if you could select more than one object to copy / paste, it  would have saved me days of work if not more).The community can rate your foundry mission in a 5 star system if they play it and for the most part the community in the foundry is good.  But since most people don't create foundry missions, they don't appreciate how long it takes to make them.  If you want an example do a search for my foundry mission ""Ghost - behind enemy lines"" and play it.  That foundry took me over 3 weeks to make and I'm out of work so that means every day I was working on it (most of the time was building the last building).Its not all bad though, I went into the foundry  sort of knowing it would take a while and some people would be unappreciative but for the most  part the reviews were friendly and the comments some people had were very  satisfying and thoughtful.  People can donate astral diamonds to you if they wish and a lot of people do so that's nice.  If the community rates it high enough it can be hosted by the devs.   People play your content and enjoy it, that makes you feel like you wrote a novel (which you actually are an author in this case) and people like it, this makes it worth it.

I have checked the specs and I can run it on max settings, I should be running this with ease but it lags so badly in places like Protectors enclave, And god knows why even changing all settings to minimum does nothing not a slight difference, Also the whole pay 2 win is so much Bulls*** you can't farm any thing easily and it would now take forever to get a descent character build, So once a good game that got annihilated, totally sucks.

												Neverwinter for PC is an outstanding MMORPG from what I have experienced. I have not gotten to a maximum level yet, and I'm not a Neverwinter expert, but based off of my 22.9-hour-impression,  I highly reccomend this game for anybody looking for an MMORPG.Pros:-free to play (all levels for everyone, features like being in a party open to everyone, etc) -good graphics-lots of useful video settings-proper third person view (moving the mouse to turn character)-default controls are simple and open to edit-useful guidance to locations for quests (sparkling line, not pointing arrow)-most things in the game do not require real money-slightly automatic aiming, useful if you're a bad aimer or using a gamepadCons:-not compatible with gamepads / console controllers (although it will work if you use your own installed key binding program)-mounts (creatures that you may ride on) must be purchased with the zen currency which is difficult to get unless you buy it with real money-a couple of races require an expansion pack that you must pay real money forIMO (In My Opinion):-better than any MMORPG I've played-very fun			"

												This game is NOT free to play. they bombard you with reasons to purchase content and make it imposable to be competitive in game without spending lots of money. And should you spend money on things like there lock boxes and have a glitch getting the inventory they will give you the runaround for a week and then deny you ever got the item in question. Their tech support is a joke. They first address the problem your having by sending you a wiki copy/paste description of the feature you are having a problem with and then pass you around to multiple techs until you give up.

The combat is more than just click and go, you have the ability to completely dodge an attack and that makes this game require some actual skill which only a few MMORPG's have. It gives a sense of challenge and doesn't empower those who spend money to a point in which a person who doesn't can't compete with them.

												I'd say it's one of the better free to play games out there, but with that being said, there are some faults with it. Since it is a F2P MMO, there is obviosly going to be a microtransactions store. However, I wouldn't exactly say that it is pay to win.With the aiming and casting mechanics, early game is fast paced and fun. The only problem I have with this game is the end-game. After reaching the max level, everything becomes a daily quest. You log in, do the quests, claim your reward, maybe replay your favorite dungeons, and then get off. It becomes tedious and boring after a while.If you're looking for a casual MMO to get into where you don't have to farm for hours on end, give this game a try.			"

												This game makes me so frustrated.  It has pros and cons, and if tended to could be so much better for players and producers. After playing various characters reaching endgame this is my conclusion-->PVE - Amazing tho a bit linear, still has good stories and quests compared to allot of other grinds out there.  I enjoyed many of the zones and contrary to many critics on vioce acting I didn't find it too bad.  Which is hardwork considering it's f2p.  Combat is fun and fast paced (not too easy, not to hard) and allows for some room to make character builds.  And if you have friends to play with and choose not to pay money to climb this game could be very extensive on PvE terms.  The foundry is one of the best aspects of the game.  It doesn't take a computer science degree to understand the fundamentals to allow for campaign creation. (However it does go down quite often which is unfortunate)PVP - *sigh*  This is the most damaging aspect of the game.  It has the potential to be great but anyone who plays who has not sunked 1k real money into will admit - ""Is broken""  Unbalanced and pure p2w.  Literally post upon post will say the same thing without a change.  Unless pvp is fixed the competetive fan base will dwindle like a candle as it is already and continue until gone.   But in overall opinion it is a fair f2p game but has the potential to be one of the best if handled better.			"

												Hands down one of the best free MMOs I have ever played.  The game is not the most gorgeous, but it looks good.  The game is not incredibly complex, but it has an intricate balance.  I really enjoyed my time in the game... and even outside of it.The dynamic of playing the game from a browser with my companions is brilliant.  The fact that I can craft from the same browser is amazing!  If they had an app that did something similar, I'd almost pay a small monthly fee for it.  The companion system by itself is actually pretty awesome.  Someone to hang out with you and support or tank or fill whatever gap you have is pretty awesome.  While some of them could stand to be a little better, they are pretty good overall and the ones at the beginning of the game are very helpful. My favorite part, however, is the user created content.  The ability to run a ""dungeon"" created by another player is amazing.  I've run some good ones and bad ones, but that feature is awesome!  When I say dungeon, it does it a bit of dis-service.  It is more like an entire zone built with encounters, buildings, bosses and loot tables that plays out as a full quest or mission.  Some of them can be done in 10 or 20 minutes, while others may take more than hour.  The difficulty is also variable.The micro-transactions for this game can get pricey, but I didn't worry too much about them.  They have some interesting packs and people who plan to invest a lot of time can easily wait until a sale and get a great deal.  IMO, the game is good enough to at least invest a little bit.			"

												I have been seeing a lot of negative reviews saying the game is pay to win. If you are going to try out the game, know one thing: you will not start to make a good amount of AD, the main currency, until you hit the max level (60). The game's economy is mostly based around the player base and player market. Items that you get from endgame dungeons will either be worth 500 AD or 500,000 AD depending on how badly the buyer wants said item. For instance, I earned a piece of armor a few days ago that sold for 600,000, but today it is worth around 150,000. You may also exchange AD for the premium currency, Zen, which you have the option to pay actually money for. The only thing you can not get in game without paying actually money are the packs which are really not a big deal.      This is my most played game on steam and I personally think it is very underrated. The questing can feel a bit grindy but it is almost fully voice acted. There is also great deal of lore is case you want to get into it. Otherwise the combat is very quick and responsive, the loot and customization is executed very well, and I feel the game should have a much bigger playerbase.			"

												This game is SOOOOOOOO ADDICTING... Ive played so many mmorpgs but i usually end up quiting cuz of the long, boring and endless hours of grinding. However this game is always action packed with the large amount of bosses/dungeons. You level up quickly from following the main quests so it keeps gamers from getting bored of doing the same thing. Dungeons also get SUPER epic when you have a full party of 5 especially when you get later into the game. (level 45+)Graphics are amazing at full HD quality, character customization is awesome (get to choose races, jobs etc), combat system is great (similar to Tera Rising)-- dodge/block system, PVP is fun (kinda like capture the flag or Dominion in League of Legends), overall game can be competitive (mechanically skilled players can outplay other players with op stuff), and much more.I reached the max level 60, and during that experience it was HELLA FUN! And it gets way better cuz once you hit 60, you get bombarded with more crazy quests and you can customize your character even more with the access to boons (another skill tree). Overall I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME! It's just amazing bcuz you can have the same amount of fun by yourself or by grabbing some of your buddies to do the dungeons/quests with.10/10			"

												As someone who has played other D&D games before, but has not played the pen & paper game, Neverwinter felt very accessible. It has the most enjoyable combat out of any MMOs that I have played to date.As a free-to-play game, it has a real money (referred to as Zen) cash shop. While all of the items in the cash shop seem expensive, I never felt like I was required to purchase any of them to enjoy the content that everyone else was playing. As you play, you can earn the in-game currency, Astral Diamonds, and exchange it with other players for the Zen that they have purchased. Depending on what you are looking to purchase, the length of the grind required varies dramatically.As for content, the Foundry and its ""infinite content"" is a nice distraction from the developer made quest line. Some of the quests that players have created are absolutely ridiculous, both in personality and in quality.I highly recommend giving Neverwinter a shot and forming your own decision. It doesn't take that long to reach the level cap, and it's free - what do you have to lose?			"

												Is it the best F2P mmorpg out there? The short answer is no. There are a lot of things that are a problem, and most of these centre around the business model of the devs. That being said it is still entirely possible to enjoy yourself if you are looking for a drop in/drop out online exp. The vast majority of the negative reviews are born out of the gaming communities disgust at having to spend actual money on a game they are playing for free. Let that sentence roll around for a moment. Very simply it boils down to whether or not you are looking for a suitable end game experience. If you have a lot of money to burn then this is the game for you. If, however, you would like everything to be free in this world (I think someone once said some about the price of a lunch...) then this is not for you. If you, like me, are just looking for a casual and beautiful online experience to jump into every now and again, then I would say go for it. After all, it is free.			"

												I've jumped around through several ""Free"" MMORPGs.  Thus far, I've found Neverwinter Online to be the most fun. The combat is reactive and skill can matter as much as the skills you choose. I know that a lot of people have cut the game down for being ""pay to win"", but if you are not out to be the most dominate player in the game with all the best gear (right away anyway) then you will have fun.Pro: LOTS of quests with varied objectives.     *Decent community compared to many games. Get in a guild and you will have a lot of fun.     *Good respawn times for MOBs. Not a lot of waiting around.     *You can play casually OR delve into the depth of the game's crafting system.Cons: *The graphics are standard. Not bad, but mostly not going to impress seasoned players. Some nuances ,such as mounts, look very nice though.      *It can be considered pay to win. If you are one of those who really think ""winning"" is possible in an MMO, then you may not like this one.    *The HUD is weak, but can be customized to your liking.There's a lot more to be said about this game, but the bottom line is that it is fun for casual players who fear getting involved in the time-sink that is typically associated with MMOs			"

												Well this game is great. Has a solid community and you can really enjoy playing even talking with new people but for those of you who complain about them ""wanting money"" well they do but that dosnt stop you from having fun. But its not bad using money to purchase stuff you like if your going to play this game for a while 50$ wont hurt. Theres been many games that ive bought for example ""Cod Ghosts"" i only played like 20 hours on it for 60$ thats a rip off but since i have about 100+ hours here i wouldnt mind shelling out 20$ here and there once in a while. Just make sure you use your money on whats important first and then if you have left over money you can spend it on a video game other than that great game reccomend it to anyone :P			"

												Although PWI/Cryptic have developed a (well earned...) reputation for nickel-and-diming players, Neverwinter is a surprisingly competent and fun action-RPG ""MMO"" (its really more small group focused and never feels like a massive world). The game is heavily instanced and much more fun in groups, much like actual Dungeons and Dragons would be. Don't go in expecting a sequel to Neverwinter Nights and you'll have a much better time. The Forge is fun to mess around in too, and some of the player-created missions are cool (there's a clever Wizard of Oz inspired one that I enjoyed).			"

												A F2P game with some elements of nickle and diming but they're avoidable. It's totally playable without putting a cent into it but you're restricted to two characters. There's no restrictions on the gameplay itself and it's quick to level to 60.     Resetting your character's active skills costs ""Zen"" which is real money, but you shouldn't have to unless you've been playing level 60 for a while. Resetting passive skills called ""Feats"" cost ingame currency called ""Astral Diamonds"" and it scales depending on how much points you put into it already. Astral diamonds can be traded for Zen and vise versa to help cover costs for an extra character or a skill reset if you're worried about spending real money, but it takes time to collect enough of.    Unfortunately, the economy is somewhat bloated with bot farmers selling ingame currency for real money, causing some items on the market to be ungodly amount of astral diamonds to buy. Finding a party to get into a dungeon is almost impossible unless you advertise yourself on the ""Looking For Group"" chat or bring friends. One of the classes, The Devoted Cleric, has a high difficulty curve that can surprise new players and is not recommended to play during your first time unless you know what you're in for. There's also balance issues with enchantments and high level pvp which the developers said to be patched soon.     All in all, decent free MMO that if you don't have problems with gambling (see TF2 or CS:GO i.e crates), should really only cost you none to 15 USD. Surpisingly fun and the classes feel great and powerful to play. It's recommended, if it is your first time, to just play the game however you want without worrying what build you should spec into.

												I have been playing neverwinter since beta, and I can say I enjoy the game. The story is interesting the gameplay is fun the graphics are smooth and the setting is just great. There are not many things I have found fault in with neverwinter but some of these are as follows, for an mmo neverwinter feels extremely linear with one quest linking to the next all the way to endgame. Another thing I dont like is endgame, I always get bored but this seems to just be the mmo way atm, there content creator helps somewhat in that user generated content can be pretty great, but it does not completely make up for some of the default content lacking that spark that makes it interesting. Even another thing that rubs me the wrong way is pvp, when the game was a newer release there seemed to be a more active pvp scene but now all the matches seem to me unbalanced and boring. Now dont think for a second I am going to end the recommendation on a sour note, I had a LOT of fun with the game on all my characters up until the point you start to feel that inevitable mmo fatigue. I recommend you try the game yourself to see if you like it or not, yea end game can be grindy, yea there are some ridiculous cash shop items but are these not things we have all come to expect from a free to play mmo? The game has a lot to offer and a lot of fun you can experience without paying a dime or grinding a second, so get out there and get playing!Update 7/30/14: Neverwinter fans rejoice, Neverwinter is coming to xbox and its getting a new expansion!Update 8/11/15: Neverwinter just keeps getting new content. I have not played in a while but this is good news. I hear its one of the most popular free to play games on Xbox now as well!			"

												Oh where to begin with Neverwinter. Now this review will most likely bring on a lot of controversy, but who cares.Neverwinter is a f2p MMORPG Published by Perfect World. Now a lot of Perfect World games tend to be ""Pay to Win"" to the extreme. Neverwinter is not pay to win unlike the others. The only thing to win in Neverwinter is PVP, but PVP isn't a big part of the game itself and there are no items you can pay real life money for to help you in PVP. Of course Neverwinter has an in-game currency called ""Zen"" that you can pay real life money for, but the only thing Zen lets you buy are ""Fashion Items"", dyes, companions, mounts, and a few other items not essential to own. Now of course like many other MMOs, in game currencies like Zen can allow you to pay for convenience such as buying a fast mount. Mounts serve no purpose other than getting you where you need to go at a quicker rate rather than walking. Is that Pay to Win? NO, it is not. What are you winning? A race to the quest area? People do not like spending real life money on MMOs, but the game is free is it not? So complaining is silly. Anways, the main currency in Neverwinter (that requires no real life money to earn) is called ""Astral Diamonds"". You don't want to spend real life money on Neverwinter? Have no fear, with AD you can purchase companions, mounts, and plenty of other neat items. Though for a price. 25k AD is the max you can earn with your daily quests, however, every dungeon you play you have a 90% chance of obtaining a ""Purple"" item. Purple items sell for a fair amount of AD on the auction house whether its to 20k or 1Mill. So really, earning AD is not an issue. Me? I've played Neverwinter since Beta two years ago and have never spent a dime to get the cool items I desired. I just played the game and earned AD, which as stated before, isn't as hard as people say it to be. The point of playing a game is earning what you want and working towards your goal. But many are lazy and do not want to work for what they want. I also forgot to mention, if you really want something off the Zen market but have no desire to pay real life money for exclusive items on it, did you know you can trade AD for Zen? Isn't that nice that Neverwinter allows you to do that? They give you every option in the game to get what you want without paying a single cent. I don't know about you, but thats very nice, especially for a FREE game. In game events also happen often, and every event gives you a chance to get a very unique item of some kind whether its so a very cool fast mount, a strong companion, or just a silly item like a portable throne! Now lets talk about the workers behind Neverwinter that are really a great group of people. They constantly work hard daily to keep Neverwinter running, adding new content very often, and keeping it bug free. The employees are also very easy to get ahold of and they are the most helpful bunch that will assist you with anything you need. Its very important for a game to have that. They also play Neverwinter, and they even take the time to play with players in-game and occasionally help out people in need. How cool is that? They also Stream on Twitch often and give away in game items and even phsyical items like T-Shirts. So overall, Neverwinter is one of the best free to play MMOs out right now. There's a reason I've been playing this game since beta. It even has an epic story line unlike many other MMOs that don't. Like everybody else, I skip dialog, I don't care, I just want to play. With Neverwinter, everything about it whether its to the lore or story line, is so very intriguing and makes you want to really understand whats going on and pay attention. Neverwinter is also very visually stunning and the amount of work and detail put into this game is really quite amazing. Don't believe me? Check out my screenshots and look at my Neverwinter ones. You'll also see that I have an epic mount, easily obtained by earning AD.Like MMORPGs? Want a game full of endless content you can spend countless hours on? Do you like Dungeons and Dragons? Then take the time to play Neverwinter ♥			"

												Unlike most RPG games, like WoW and a bunch of others, you don't have to pay to get past level 20. The content is pretty much released to everyone. It's better than any MMORPG out there on the market, another thing is that it's FREE.			"

												I've played this for about six months, though recently moved to Steam.First of all, the game is definitely not P2W. There are some cool items that you can get by paying, but mostly, they just look cool, or are unique, but in no way ""win"" the game for you. There's about 30 hours of great storyline in the PvE, but then the end-game gets quite ""grindish"", with only small gains in items or skills to get out of it. PvP is limited to an arena game, similar to most arena PvP games, but definitely takes some in-game focus to get good, especially at cap where the the early level 60 players are up against those with months of gear advantage.One favorite of mine is that the ""for purchase"" currency (zen) is available to trade on an in-game market for the ""earned"" currency (astral diamonds), which helps make even pay items available to non-paying characters without using sketchy outside markets.

												Fun game, They make it pretty easy to do the quest lines Without buying items from the zen market. It has a really cool browser app, So you can take care of some of your ingame responsibilities and mini games. It has a companion system which is cool. Makes it easier to solo.The only thing i hate is the queuing for dungeons, It's not like World of warcraft when you Que for one your in within a minute most times. It's not like that with this game you wait for some time or you search for players.I suggest buying one of the 59$ packs there's two of them. Don't bother buying the steam starter pack waist of a 20$. All and all its a fun game with its shoot and dodge mechanics. Your enjoy it!!			"

It's great fun and the fighting is so fluid. I play a hunter/archer elf and it's just fantastically fun :DDefinately worth the download :D			"

In this game you need to get to Level 13 before you judge it. The combat is addicting, PvP is alot of fun (also addicting), and for a free MMORPG the community base is plentiful. Havent had so much fun in an MMO since World of Warcraft.			"

												Welcome back to Neverwinter,♥♥♥♥♥♥is about to hit the fan!This is a MMO-game set in the world of wizards of the coast's Dungeons and Dragons world in the area that they call Neverwinter. You start of in a standed ship and from there on you go into the capital of Neverwinter to follow your quest and get new ones. Even though this is just another MMO game set in a medieval era style, it is amazing. I had a lot of fun playing this MMO and I really got the Dungeons and Dragons feel just as I have while playing the normal D&D game. The atmosphere is really good and the controls are easy to understand, for new and for experienced players.The game has also other things that are better than most MMO's. For example in most MMO's you just do your quest and level your character. In D&D Neverwinter you really want to follow the story and you really try to understand what is going on and what you need to do.Another great thing about this game is that the combat is more action-orientated. You do not use a key to switch between your targets, you really have to aim for them before you do your attack. That is in my opinion much better.Next to that, it doesn't really matter if you play this game alone or with friends, one way or another you are going to like this game and you keep playing.This story short: It is amazing so just play this game!

												Despite all the reactions you'll get from lovers and hater, this game is Free-To-Play, so I do recommend anyone to try it. If you like it, then continue playing it but if you dont, then no harm is done and just uninstall it from your system. It's that easy, cant get easier than that...well you can just not play the game but do you want to do that without satisfying your curiousity? Remember, human is curious of nature (just like cats, except trying this game wont kill ya).Personal opinion of the game: I like it and currently liking it a lot since it's based on one of my favorite past time; Dungeons & Dragons (doesn't matter any edition coz I'm a fan of all of it). If you're a real DnD fan and not a DnD purist who tends to stick to just one rule/gameplay, then this is a game for you (mebe just until you finish the main storyline or get to level 60 with 1 or more characters).

But I went through with it, created an account and was annoyed that I had to use lower case letters for my username. I shrugged it off. Then I tried to play the game. Guess what? More downloads, only in patching. To clarify, anywhere from 600 MB to 2000 MBs of space needed. I don't have the time, nor memory available for such a large game. Unless you have a fast computer/laptop, my suggestion is to stay away from this game. Especially if it leaves FtP status.			"

Their disables are too long compared to other classes and their damage is too high. Rangers have to channel an instant for 2 seconds to even come close to the same damage, and that gets interrupted on any damage taken. So, get a rogue, dominate pvp.			"

												This is one of those all-consuming, addictive to the point of dehydration and starvation type of games. If you like having a social life in the ""RL"" than I dont reccomend this game for you. But honestly- this is one hell of a fun game. Theres not much I dont like about it- Good story, decent A/V, continued play with new mods released regularly. The only thing I dont care for is the Zen Market. Some of what it has to offer is pretty cool and even useful. But the pricing really sucks. If you really want to get the cool stuff, or even just buy a handful of things that make the game a bit better or more fun, then expect to pay for it. A decent mount? $15-20. A cool companion? $5-20. 10 keys that can only be bought with real money? $11.50 Oh- and the chests they open may have some really cool stuff but dont expect to get it without opening 50+.

												Smells like Guild Wars 2 spirit. If you played that game you will get used to Neverwinter pretty quick - you can do similiar actions like dodging by rolling away from enemy, characters don't require mana to cast ""normal"" spells, et caetera.I've been a little prejudiced to Neverwinter - I played Dungeons & Dragons Online and it was terrible experience. This game, however, is pretty good and fun to play, especially if you have a friend or two to create party with and explore the world together. Lore is quite interesting and both systems and interface are designed very well. If you ask me, the only cons of this game are: a bit ""blocky"" animations and boredom which appears when you get on higher level and you are not fond of Foundry stories.This game is really worth to give it a chance.

At moment i am enjoying the game i did at the start mess around with the classes  and got bored really quickly but then i gave it another go and stuck to one character and found that it was a lot more enjoyable so my view might change as i play more but for now id give it a 8/10			"

												This game started to update itself and the update came with a Trojan called Win32/Kryptik.AGJL, which was detected by my antivirus software. I trust Steam, but this incident makes me question if this trust is maybe misplaced. Needless to say, Neverwinter was uninstalled and will not be installed again.			"

												Fun game, They make it pretty easy to do the quest lines Without buying items from the zen market. It has a really cool browser app, So you can take care of some of your ingame responsibilities and mini games. It has a companion system which is cool. Makes it easier to solo.The only thing i hate is the queuing for dungeons, It's not like World of warcraft when you Que for one your in within a minute most times. It's not like that with this game you wait for some time or you search for players.I suggest buying one of the 59$ packs there's two of them. Don't bother buying the steam starter pack waist of a 20$. All and all its a fun game with its shoot and dodge mechanics. Your enjoy it!!			"

												I've played this for about six months, though recently moved to Steam.First of all, the game is definitely not P2W. There are some cool items that you can get by paying, but mostly, they just look cool, or are unique, but in no way ""win"" the game for you. There's about 30 hours of great storyline in the PvE, but then the end-game gets quite ""grindish"", with only small gains in items or skills to get out of it. PvP is limited to an arena game, similar to most arena PvP games, but definitely takes some in-game focus to get good, especially at cap where the the early level 60 players are up against those with months of gear advantage.One favorite of mine is that the ""for purchase"" currency (zen) is available to trade on an in-game market for the ""earned"" currency (astral diamonds), which helps make even pay items available to non-paying characters without using sketchy outside markets.

												Welcome back to Neverwinter,♥♥♥♥♥♥is about to hit the fan!This is a MMO-game set in the world of wizards of the coast's Dungeons and Dragons world in the area that they call Neverwinter. You start of in a standed ship and from there on you go into the capital of Neverwinter to follow your quest and get new ones. Even though this is just another MMO game set in a medieval era style, it is amazing. I had a lot of fun playing this MMO and I really got the Dungeons and Dragons feel just as I have while playing the normal D&D game. The atmosphere is really good and the controls are easy to understand, for new and for experienced players.The game has also other things that are better than most MMO's. For example in most MMO's you just do your quest and level your character. In D&D Neverwinter you really want to follow the story and you really try to understand what is going on and what you need to do.Another great thing about this game is that the combat is more action-orientated. You do not use a key to switch between your targets, you really have to aim for them before you do your attack. That is in my opinion much better.Next to that, it doesn't really matter if you play this game alone or with friends, one way or another you are going to like this game and you keep playing.This story short: It is amazing so just play this game!

												Despite all the reactions you'll get from lovers and hater, this game is Free-To-Play, so I do recommend anyone to try it. If you like it, then continue playing it but if you dont, then no harm is done and just uninstall it from your system. It's that easy, cant get easier than that...well you can just not play the game but do you want to do that without satisfying your curiousity? Remember, human is curious of nature (just like cats, except trying this game wont kill ya).Personal opinion of the game: I like it and currently liking it a lot since it's based on one of my favorite past time; Dungeons & Dragons (doesn't matter any edition coz I'm a fan of all of it). If you're a real DnD fan and not a DnD purist who tends to stick to just one rule/gameplay, then this is a game for you (mebe just until you finish the main storyline or get to level 60 with 1 or more characters).

												I have played a lot of MMO's over the years this has to be one of the best I have played, as far as the dungeons go.The game is truly amazing graphics are just stunning gameplay good.Got a Scourge Warlock to lvl 60, and the fun does not stop there still loads to do at that point.Been playing this for a few months now, but sad to say this about a game, that is so nice""IT IS ONE BIG MONEY GRABBER"".Cryptic  done a marvelous job of the game in that respect I cannot fault it, but Perfect World have just turned it into a huge money pot like the rest of there game's.Svaba in a previous post has gone into more in depth, as regards the Zen market, and all of what he say's is true.You will only start with 2 character slots after that you have to pay 500 zen with reall money which will cost you £5 almost, ok I dont mind that, as I know they have to make money, but they even get you to buy there Life scrolls, so you can reserect on the spot if you dont have one you are respawned back at the nearest campsite.I will give this game a positive review, as i think Cryptic done an amazing job just wish it could to another compant rather than PW.

												I really had high hopes for this game.  It isn't that it's a bad game.  The fact is that most Perfect World games are cash shop oriented.  I intend to go back and play the new expansion at some point, but this game drastically fails at endgame.  Many of it's counterparts suffer from the same issue.  It's 4th edition mechanics as they were meant to be enjoyed, digitally.  It's a solid game for the most part, but the business model, and endgame inbalance means I can't fully recommend it.   Unfortunately there aren't very many D&D games available.  I would say go play Sword Coast Legends though if you want a proper D&D experience in a game.			"

												If you think it's F2P, try riding that ♥♥♥♥ing horse to PvP and fight P2P players riding their shiny dragons/epic mounts, and you will see the difference between F2P and P2P. If it's truly F2P game, it should be possible to farm Astral Diamond with reasonable amount of afford and time, but this is just plain money grab. Even so, difference between F2P players and P2P players shouldn't be *this* HUGE. Maybe you can pull it out being F2P to level 70, however, you will have a hard time completing quests, let alone PvP. Not just this, the game mechanic itself is RIDICULOUS; crafting, equipping, profession etc. not to mention bugs, lags, hackers. Thumbs down for dev team.Tl;dr *** NOPE.AVI - If you have it, uninstall. If you don't, don't waste your time. ***			"

												Without even touching on it's pay to win nature... It's been out over 2 years and there's still only 8 'classes'. Actually only 7, but there's two versions of fighter. When the game was first announced and the idea of getting to play all the varied classes and archetypes sounded like it would be great.Here we are over two years later and the starting 4 options that looked so promising have only been joined by 4 other options. That's 1 class every 6 months or so, such speed.I guess it's a great plan if they're wanting to keep this game going for 20 years, since that's how long it'll take them to cover the usual 12 base classes and each of their 3 or 4 archetypes.

												Allow me to start this review by saying that the game in it's basic,free to play version is a decent one to say the least,with a pretty nice community and enjoyable gameplay.Why then am I not recommening this game?It is common knowledge that these types of games are leaning more and more towards P2W,but while other games might actually care about you if you spend money,not this one.Not if use your Steam Wallet to buy the products at any rate.I used my Steam Wallet to buy some currency called Zen,hoping to sell it in game for quick Astral Diamonds,which is basically the common currency.Not only was I not rewarded the First Time buyer's pack,which is reserved for people who buy directly from Arc,my account was put on Probation: meaning anything I buy is bound to my account and I am unable to sell Zen.You would think a day or two while they verify the payment would be understandable,but it has been a week and a half and I am still on probation.I thought fine,lets try something else,so I bought Enchanted Keys which let you open Lockboxes,hoping to find a decent item to sell in the Auction House.The keys were also bound but what they fail to mention is EVEN THE REWARDS IN THE LOCKBOXES WILL BE BOUND.So for example if you found a mount selling for around 6million Astral Diamonds which you do not like or already have you're stuck with it.I can almost hear people say ""Dum*a// of course the rewards will be bound,your key was also bound"" but you are wrong,VIP players (and yes I am one) get an Enchanted Key everyday which is also bound,however the rewards opened with it are not.So to recap,I do recommend this game in the Free to Play mode,possibly get VIP,but do not bother using more money to be treated like a third grade citizen.

												Neverwinter offers almost everything that you could want form an MMORPG. There are tons of stuff to do, hell of a nominal system that will get your head spinning (even too much) but what lacks the most, is community aspect. The game is more based on making money, not making social contact. I found it hard to build a deacent community. Developers need to work on the social aspect. But if you have some friends to play with, it is a fun game to play. And challenging enough if no laggs appear. It is a 50/50 from me but it is worth trying, it is free.			"

However that is all minor to me as none of that interested me.The foundry has same amazing fan made content if the main campaign and dailies ever begin to bore you.All in all I liked it the paywall didn’t bother me and I soloed most of what I played If you’re looking for a Free to play MMO give it a shot!

Only cons are that you kind of need money for cool features (like every other online RPG game). Overall 10/10!			"

												most of the sossy jack♥♥♥♥♥who cant take change and are too stuck with WOW hype are the ones's criticizing it. it has pretty vast community of underaged kids and near dead old folks who are just easy to fak with.(is what i like about this game) other than that before it was easy for free loaders to earn exactly what paid players were getiing in 1-2 days of grinding what devs did, they made it immposible for both of the types to get end games without grinding atleast for over a month. thats the big change happened since last 4-5 mods, its fun. but if ur stuck with nostalgia u had 6 monts ago playing it and planing return to expect the same. leap into wow			"

												i have put 67 hours of my life into just one character and i dont plan on stopping there, the naysayers will call this game pay to win. i respectfully disagree with them. sure you can pay for keys to open lockboxes for a chance at a new mount new enchantments and whatnot, but it doesnt effect your effectiveness in battle. the system is great, i personally play as a rogue and this game makes you feel as though you arent useless. epic loot can be earned after lvl 60 in epic dungeons, and astral diamonds(real ingame cash) can be earned every day all it takes is some dedication. Most other MMO games made me feel like i had to grind to level up, but not so here, quests are the best way to level up and if you like PvP you can earn AD and a LOT of experience. it doesnt force the PvP on you making the noob characters feel more comfortable and less afraid to go out into the wilds. yes some areas are harder for noobs but thats not surprising for an MMO. you can use the auction house to make money or buy some awesome gear, i use it to earn astral diamonds. this game doesnt punish you for F2P and encourages group play as some areas are difficult even @ lvl. most of the things you can buy with Zen and AD (zen being a more expensive in game cash) are companions or special mounts, not gear. also the PvP matches you with players of your rank, making the game fair and up to who knows their class better. i fully reccomend this game to everyone, but more so to those who just want to quest casually and have fun.

												Great MMO. You can almost play the whole thing on your own. For the events and dungeons that require more players you can just join random groups that need players, making it almost a casual MMO if that's how you prefer to play.You don't even need to be a fan of the Forgotten Realms universe to enjoy this one, but if you do you'll like how true to the lore it is.

												This game is fun, but there are some flaws. You can grind up a character to lvl 60 in 2.5 days. One day during double xp events easy. Rogues are horribly overpowered in pvp. Their disables are too long compared to other classes and their damage is too high. Rangers have to channel an instant for 2 seconds to even come close to the same damage, and that gets interrupted on any damage taken. So, get a rogue, dominate pvp.			"

												SORRY FOR MY BAD GRAMMER I RUSHED THROUGH THISThis Game is one of the best mmo's i have seen. Honestly do have some problems, but there is no perfect mmo.My Pros to the game.1.Character Creation. It was easy to understand, and I didnt find myself taking hours just to make my character look nice2.Graphics are great. the game doesnt look like your run of the mill averge rpg.3.leveling is fast and fun.4.Objectives of quest are most of the time clear.5.although i dont like class based skills, they where done quite well in this.6.PVP, This has its flaws and perfections7.The story is over all good8.levels are nicely done8.Many People have been saying this game is pay to play or pay to win........... allthough i can see how they can get the idea, but let me tell you what a pay to play its....... runescape, have you ever playied it? well i have you have to pay to unlock skills, map parts, armor, weapons, and many other things. this game is not pay to play by a long shot.... granted there are some things that are anoying examples... companion  upgrades.... character slots... and other things, but it still isnt pay to play because of astral diamonds. granted it takes time to get these it isnt imposible. u can get up to 3000-4000 a day just by doing pvp....................................................... or even more if u do dungeons  and other stuff........you can also get them from profesions like leadership.... you log in click a few buttons set a task, do some pvp and bam u got u some astral........Cons to this game.1. Skill tree: Some times i just look at my feets/ skill point and im like am i doing this right.2.i go through 20 levels and my armor looks like the same♥♥♥♥♥♥i had on at the boat crash like wat3.PVP. has some balancing to do4.sometimes i find myself lost on a level and im like what am i suppose to be doing again.5.the heck is up with the dlc's jesusAGAIN SORRY DIDNT CHECK FOR GRAMMER JUST TYPED SO yea...Over all this is a great game.

												The following is just a prototype outline which I plan on updating as I progress further through the game. 27 hours in and I'm still just 'begining'The game starts off teasing with an overhead map of the entire AD&D world and asking from which part you hail. Avoiding the cliche of choosing ""Baldur's Gate"" or ""Planescape"" I opted for a lesser known region of which I've already forgetten the name of.After your selection the game, of course, carries you to the Sword Coast and dumps you smack dab in the middle of Neverwinter. Icewind Dale is there too as a secondary campaign once you've toodely-deed so far through the main romp. On the far side of Neverwinter's main area there is a crew lining up for an exodus to the arctic content but the ship captain will bluntly tell you to come back much later when you're less of a family man.If you're looking for a challenging single player experience with hefty reflex action combat; NW has strategically placed only a small number of hot keys around the WASD area and you can trip several of them at a time.Mixed with your shift key, space bar and mouse it's just as finger frenzy as the more action-oriented console games.Despite NW's choice to only focus on the Sword Coast and all overland travel is handled by fast traveling from a static overhead map - Each individual area is huge and some of the areas are laden in secrets, side quests and dungeons.I've had nearly thirty hours of quality entertainment so far and haven't spent a dime but there are some massive cash grabs going on - not so much that they are needed to progress but when players gallop by on invisible horses, and plow through crowds with mechanical bulls and spiders you realize that the REALLY interesting material pushing NW far beyond a Triple A game is going to cost your time or your wallet.Time? Yes, apparently everything that can be purchased for real cash can 'techincally' be purchased with Astral Diamonds but good luck finding many people storing, let alone offering to sell, their hard earned Zen.  There is a AD exchange for Zen always selectable from the menu along the top of your screen but seldom have I seen other players auctioning their Zen. Neverwinters management doesn't offer it at a base rate themselves so it's up to the players if they want to put real money up for grabs for more 'play' money. Hmm...But as I've said - I've had more fun in this game for free than most games I've bought over the years for $30 a piece and the material I've got left and overworld map to open up looks nearly endless.All said and done however NW's fun for me lies in the challenge and suprise of uncovering secrets on on your own - especially doing solo raids. The challenge is balanced perfectly to give a lone wolf like myself a hard time without it becoming unfair. I can easily compare the expperience to the lone wolf challenges in Warframe where it really seemed the game was loading it on heavier to try and choke up your wallet out of frustration but when you socked it to the A.I. you were all like ""YEAH! IN YOUR FACE YOU BLODDY DRIPPING ****!!"" I can only imagine having played the previous dungeons with several others and it would've been a total clean-up (especially if the other players were higher level) in those instances the experience might possibly reduce itself to another MMO where everyone stands around chatting in a theme park showing off the funny virtual clothes they bankrupted their parents for.

												PROS 1. Interesting combat system.Heroes are able to press the Shift button to execute unique abilities e.g. dodging, shield. Red areas showing AOE appear in the combat zone to show where enemy abilities are about to be cast allowing players to have an interactive PvE environment. It gives players simple but fun instructions on what to do.2. Quest directions. A shiny path will light up a waypoint to your quest helping players to end their quest faster and removing the need to search aimlessly or look for an online guide. Minor bugs do occur as the shiny path tends to jump to quests that it thinks are closest to you e.g. Switches to Quest A when you intend to do Quest B when Quest A is miles away and Quest B is next to you.3. Graphics. Better graphics compared to some other MMOs.CONS 1. The game is too biased towards players who spend money. There are 2 in-game currencies called Zen and Astral Diamonds that can be exchanged with real-world cash. Both currencies are able to buy essential items such as bank storage, bags, mounts, equipment, refining, auction house items and etc. E.g. You can only upgrade your companion for 200,000 Astral Diamonds or 30 in-house currency. You can buy your level 60 gear using Astral diamonds from the auction house.2.Tedious system of leveling. Players have to spend points into 1. Feats 2. Power 3. Attributes. Each tree can actually conflict in min-maxing your skills if you are not careful. Astral diamonds must be spent to unlearn skill points. The number of points gained per level is 1, so skill point placement might be quite important.3. Quests are repetitive. After the first few quests, the same pattern will emerge. Enter dungeon, kill monsters, kill a big boss, rinse and repeat. Monsters come in standard small, medium, hulk and boss sizes. There are only some semi-unique quests like ""Artifact Recovery"" but they still revolve around bashing.4. Tedious teleportation system. Zone-to-zone transport only occurs at locations called Gates. You must tranverse the whole way to a Gate in order to teleport to another area. There is no way to ""summon"" your ally to you. Even right-clicking and teleporting to the player's instance is bugged.5. Bugs. Dungeons do not reset and do crash e.g. Cloak Tower (CT)6. Game Environment. You can't swim or fly. 7. In-game currency.There are too many forms of currency creates a confusing system. Almost like the EU before the Euro. Value of the different currencies depreciate extremely fast for non-cosmetic items e.g. Seal of the Manticore will be much less valuable when you get Seal of the Pegasus and so on so forth. 8. No utility rewards The only focus is on combat. E.g. Epic Hammer of Forging +25 to Blacksmithing.9. Not enough storage slots.Not such a major issue as you can easily clear all the enchantments for gold. Gold is mainly used forrefining.10. End GameAssuming you collected all your boons.Your end game will revolve around only a few areas1. Protector's Enclave2. Ice Wind Dale3. Neverdeath Graveyard OR Icespire Peak OR Rothe Valley OR Whispering Caverns OR Ebon DownsThe reason for No 3 being grouped together will be due to Cult Secrets that you do daily. They rotate and you only ever need to go to one of them to kill a dragon/dracolich.Everything else is a dungeon/lair/skirmish and you can queue for those.You will be doing skirmishes quite often if you did not pay cash for zen/astral diamonds.11. GauntlygrymGauntlygrym can be done but it's quite boring. Most players simply turn on their computers leave Gaunt to run it's course, the combatants are not even active. They come back after 15 mins to run Delzoun Crypts regardless of who wins. The map is extremely large but there are very few things that are exciting.You have to convince a storm giant to join your cause by feeding him and giving him treasure. You build catapults by collecting wood and explosive balls. You fill up mine carts. You kill Duergar to get their items. They are mostly fetch quests with a time limit.12. Dead EnvironmentEverything is dead. The people function as lamp posts.13. Respeccing costs Astral DiamondsMy CW costs 78,000+ AD just to respecc Feats and Boons. This is a lot of in game currency.  On average, you can earn around than 5000 AD/hour.			"

Icewind Dale is there too as a secondary campaign once you've toodely-deed so far through the main romp. On the far side of Neverwinter's main area there is a crew lining up for an exodus to the arctic content but the ship captain will bluntly tell you to come back much later when you're less of a family man.If you're looking for a challenging single player experience with hefty reflex action combat; NW has strategically placed only a small number of hot keys around the WASD area and you can trip several of them at a time.Mixed with your shift key, space bar and mouse it's just as finger frenzy as the more action-oriented console games.Despite NW's choice to only focus on the Sword Coast and all overland travel is handled by fast traveling from a static overhead map - Each individual area is huge and some of the areas are laden in secrets, side quests and dungeons.I've had nearly thirty hours of quality entertainment so far and haven't spent a dime but there are some massive cash grabs going on - not so much that they are needed to progress but when players gallop by on invisible horses, and plow through crowds with mechanical bulls and spiders you realize that the REALLY interesting material pushing NW far beyond a Triple A game is going to cost your time or your wallet.Time? Yes, apparently everything that can be purchased for real cash can 'techincally' be purchased with Astral Diamonds but good luck finding many people storing, let alone offering to sell, their hard earned Zen.  There is a AD exchange for Zen always selectable from the menu along the top of your screen but seldom have I seen other players auctioning their Zen. Neverwinters management doesn't offer it at a base rate themselves so it's up to the players if they want to put real money up for grabs for more 'play' money. Hmm...But as I've said - I've had more fun in this game for free than most games I've bought over the years for $30 a piece and the material I've got left and overworld map to open up looks nearly endless.All said and done however NW's fun for me lies in the challenge and suprise of uncovering secrets on on your own - especially doing solo raids. The challenge is balanced perfectly to give a lone wolf like myself a hard time without it becoming unfair. I can easily compare the expperience to the lone wolf challenges in Warframe where it really seemed the game was loading it on heavier to try and choke up your wallet out of frustration but when you socked it to the A.I. you were all like ""YEAH! IN YOUR FACE YOU BLODDY DRIPPING ****!!"" I can only imagine having played the previous dungeons with several others and it would've been a total clean-up (especially if the other players were higher level) in those instances the experience might possibly reduce itself to another MMO where everyone stands around chatting in a theme park showing off the funny virtual clothes they bankrupted their parents for.

												SORRY FOR MY BAD GRAMMER I RUSHED THROUGH THISThis Game is one of the best mmo's i have seen. Honestly do have some problems, but there is no perfect mmo.My Pros to the game.1.Character Creation. It was easy to understand, and I didnt find myself taking hours just to make my character look nice2.Graphics are great. the game doesnt look like your run of the mill averge rpg.3.leveling is fast and fun.4.Objectives of quest are most of the time clear.5.although i dont like class based skills, they where done quite well in this.6.PVP, This has its flaws and perfections7.The story is over all good8.levels are nicely done8.Many People have been saying this game is pay to play or pay to win........... allthough i can see how they can get the idea, but let me tell you what a pay to play its....... runescape, have you ever playied it? well i have you have to pay to unlock skills, map parts, armor, weapons, and many other things. this game is not pay to play by a long shot.... granted there are some things that are anoying examples... companion  upgrades.... character slots... and other things, but it still isnt pay to play because of astral diamonds. granted it takes time to get these it isnt imposible. u can get up to 3000-4000 a day just by doing pvp....................................................... or even more if u do dungeons  and other stuff........you can also get them from profesions like leadership.... you log in click a few buttons set a task, do some pvp and bam u got u some astral........Cons to this game.1. Skill tree: Some times i just look at my feets/ skill point and im like am i doing this right.2.i go through 20 levels and my armor looks like the same♥♥♥♥♥♥i had on at the boat crash like wat3.PVP. has some balancing to do4.sometimes i find myself lost on a level and im like what am i suppose to be doing again.5.the heck is up with the dlc's jesusAGAIN SORRY DIDNT CHECK FOR GRAMMER JUST TYPED SO yea...Over all this is a great game.

I have a lot of fun playing this game put at least $20 into this game, if you were to ask me what MMO should I get, I would recomend this one not only does it have a descent story line (I don't listen to the story.) It also has great voice acting something a lot of MMO's lack.(Meaning the peson doing the voice is good at it. That doesn't mean it sounds good.)(COUGH* COUGH* DC UNIVERSE)(COUGH* COUGH* TERRIBLE VOICE ACTING)This game has a better overall story than DC Universe.HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												A very fun game, absolutely worth the time you'll spend playing it. To top that off, it's FREE. And though you'll begin very slowly, giving soldiers medkits and collecting broken arrows, the moment you expect a chore, you're fighting the Necromancer's chief in brute strength. From there, you can do anything you so choose, whether that be the plot line or discovering things you aren't supposed to yet.Every class and race feels individual, as some races change the loadout of your class. It runs off the familiar Stats from DnD, Strangth, Dexterity, Charisma, Constitution, & Wisdom. These stats will effect anything you do. This game requires skill rather than good equipment, unlike WoW, in that you can sidestep and teleport (depending on your class) to escape attacks. You have to have full situational awareness though, because if one enemy can sneak up on you, you're gonna have a bad time.You can quest with other people, which is fantastic and makes the game much more friendly than  other MMORPGs. There is even a mail system. And though some quests you do feel similar, you won't get bored of them. They never feel repetitive, although they sound like it.Bottom line is, if you have hard drive space, good internet, and NEED something to keep you occupied for the rest of the year, this game is definately for you.

												After having played this game for almost a year I can't suggest it. The game is a good concept driven to the grown by bad marketing and unbalance. The basic of the game is you running around in glitchy maps and trying to do quests that may or may not exist anymore. After leveling up 68-69 levels you will experience an extreme grind to 70 which is the cap. End game content includes you running for almost a month in the same map doing the same 3 quests every week with little to no compention.If you're hoping PVP is better try again as it is highly unbalanced with Trickster Rogues which will Stun you into death and can go invisible taking the lead. The next pvp prefered class are Paladin which can restore their own HP so good luck dying to them. If you choose any other class besides those get ready as the Devs and everyone involved with this game love and exploit you for your money. oh and if you want to bot exploit or scam you can too! just add money every week and they wont even ban you for cheating they'll suppend you for a week tops. I know its a great system! In any words ready to be exploited and used because neverwinter is for you.			"

												I really had high hopes for this game.  It isn't that it's a bad game.  The fact is that most Perfect World games are cash shop oriented.  I intend to go back and play the new expansion at some point, but this game drastically fails at endgame.  Many of it's counterparts suffer from the same issue.  It's 4th edition mechanics as they were meant to be enjoyed, digitally.  It's a solid game for the most part, but the business model, and endgame inbalance means I can't fully recommend it.   Unfortunately there aren't very many D&D games available.  I would say go play Sword Coast Legends though if you want a proper D&D experience in a game.			"

												If you think it's F2P, try riding that ♥♥♥♥ing horse to PvP and fight P2P players riding their shiny dragons/epic mounts, and you will see the difference between F2P and P2P. If it's truly F2P game, it should be possible to farm Astral Diamond with reasonable amount of afford and time, but this is just plain money grab. Even so, difference between F2P players and P2P players shouldn't be *this* HUGE. Maybe you can pull it out being F2P to level 70, however, you will have a hard time completing quests, let alone PvP. Not just this, the game mechanic itself is RIDICULOUS; crafting, equipping, profession etc. not to mention bugs, lags, hackers. Thumbs down for dev team.Tl;dr *** NOPE.AVI - If you have it, uninstall. If you don't, don't waste your time. ***			"

												Without even touching on it's pay to win nature... It's been out over 2 years and there's still only 8 'classes'. Actually only 7, but there's two versions of fighter. When the game was first announced and the idea of getting to play all the varied classes and archetypes sounded like it would be great.Here we are over two years later and the starting 4 options that looked so promising have only been joined by 4 other options. That's 1 class every 6 months or so, such speed.I guess it's a great plan if they're wanting to keep this game going for 20 years, since that's how long it'll take them to cover the usual 12 base classes and each of their 3 or 4 archetypes.

												Allow me to start this review by saying that the game in it's basic,free to play version is a decent one to say the least,with a pretty nice community and enjoyable gameplay.Why then am I not recommening this game?It is common knowledge that these types of games are leaning more and more towards P2W,but while other games might actually care about you if you spend money,not this one.Not if use your Steam Wallet to buy the products at any rate.I used my Steam Wallet to buy some currency called Zen,hoping to sell it in game for quick Astral Diamonds,which is basically the common currency.Not only was I not rewarded the First Time buyer's pack,which is reserved for people who buy directly from Arc,my account was put on Probation: meaning anything I buy is bound to my account and I am unable to sell Zen.You would think a day or two while they verify the payment would be understandable,but it has been a week and a half and I am still on probation.I thought fine,lets try something else,so I bought Enchanted Keys which let you open Lockboxes,hoping to find a decent item to sell in the Auction House.The keys were also bound but what they fail to mention is EVEN THE REWARDS IN THE LOCKBOXES WILL BE BOUND.So for example if you found a mount selling for around 6million Astral Diamonds which you do not like or already have you're stuck with it.I can almost hear people say ""Dum*a// of course the rewards will be bound,your key was also bound"" but you are wrong,VIP players (and yes I am one) get an Enchanted Key everyday which is also bound,however the rewards opened with it are not.So to recap,I do recommend this game in the Free to Play mode,possibly get VIP,but do not bother using more money to be treated like a third grade citizen.

You might like reach someone who is pay to win but you will need like months or maybe years of farming AD to make gear like his or buy it in auction . PVP on low levels is kinda balanced but then high levels its not , You are in pvp with 8k Power and the other guy is there with 27 k power :) thats like totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t . so PAY TO WIN GAME . I suggest you not to waste time in this game unless u are willing to spend money on this game cuz PVP is unbalanced and even PVE when they have $$$$$$ paid stuff they do hell of dps :) i would rate 5/10			"

												This game is  money grab pure and simple. All free to play has some purchase options, however, most are not as highly priced as the items in Neverwinter.  To buy enough Zen to purchase the dragon born or drow racial packs it costs you the price of a full game. This is for the race and a hero slot with very little else. These packs should by no means be more than $10 for what you get in them. Zen is completely unjustifiable at its current price. Astral diamonds, which is the in game currency, can be built up over time, but once you do it is not unheard of for the system to glitch you out of it. I recently lost 102K AD for a 7000 stronghold donation. The response from customer service was oops, oh well. The game play if fine, just dont expect to have any of the good items in this game without having $100's of dollars to spend on it.			"

												I've played this game a few months after it originally launched on PC and ended up quitting several times for the same reason. I'll break this down into categories: (tl;dr located at bottom)Itemizing+ Equipment isn't too hard to get. However, in the latest versions, the gear choices are a lot more static than they used to be. Doesn't offer too much customization.- Enchants are broken beyond belief. Getting the required amount of shards for Weapon/Armor enchants isn't hard. However, they all have a 1% chance to succeed. Forcing you to either grind and play a ridiculously unfair game of RNG or simply invest into the cash shop. Normal enchants aren't too much of a pain until you get them to Lvl 7, then they get very expensive and the success rates plummet.- Legendary weapons, while good in idea, have been ruined in multiple ways. Refinement Point Items (RP Items) used to be a lot more common than they are now. However, botters started farming them and flooded the market with them which effectively reduced the price of the items and made them available for everyone. However, Cryptic decided to make RP items bound when picked up which effectively destroyed the market. As a result, RP items are too expensive, the game doesn't offer a lot of money making possibilities, and the legendary weapons cost too much to upgrade- Legendary Armor/Accessories. Once again, completely imbalanced. In the current state of the game, there are many options to choose from but only about 3 that are viable and worth upgrading. The community has been very vocal about this and nothing has been done about it. The only improvements are obvious bugs with some of the sets have been corrected.Class Design- Many of the classes have serious problems with some or all of their Paragon Paths or skills. Hunter Rangers, for example, all typically resort to the game Paragon Path and the same Feat Path because the other two are underperforming or riddled with bugs. Scourge Warlocks suffer the same thing. Trickster Rogues also have a broken Paragon Path. There are too many classes that have had problems (some spanning years in the making) that have not been acknowledged or fixed+ For the sake of it, each class does bring something different to the table. The difference between a GWF and GF are very obvious. CW vs SW is also a very different kit. How these affect the game is a different storyUI and Game Mechanics+ The game separates itself from a typical MMO by limiting the number of active skills and redefining how passive skills work. Unlike a game like FFXIV, which has a ton of hotbars, Neverwinter limits you to 2 At-Wills, 3 Encounters, and 2 Daily Powers. Also, unlike most conventional MMOs, NW requires you to equip the passive you want to use instead of it being active at all times. You're limited to 2 active passive skills at a time.+ The User Interface is pretty simple and easy to navigate. It's intuitive and does what it needs to. Each menu in the game serves its own purpose and lots of tooltips are available.- This may be a personal problem but I would prefer if the skills had some sort of scaling formula on them to show how stats, equipment, and buffs affect the output of the skill.- Many options for Encounters, Dailies, At-Wills, and Passives do not serve any sort of purpose in any part of the game. This is part of Class Design.- The Matchmaking system for PvP and PvE is completely broken. PvE matchmaking does not respect any kind of party composition, so it's entirely possible to be matched into a party with 5 DPS and no heal/tank class. The same applies to PvP. Healing classes in PvP are an asset, so instead of evenly dividing classes between two teams, it's entirely possible for 5 DPS to be matched against 5 Healers which typically results in a permanent stalemate.PvE Mechanics+/- Previously, the game had a very respectable array of dungeons and skirmishes to choose from, both for leveling and endgame. Module 7 removed all but a handful of these and they still have not re-added all of the previously removed content which makes it very dull. However, for the instances they did re-add, their difficulties have been scaled up.+/- The item level requirements on endgame dungeons are incredibly misleading. Unlike, for instance, Tera, which scales its requirements on the general level of equipment you should have to attempt an instance, NW's requirements do not follow any sort of meaningful logic. iLvl can be inflated in a variety of ways and, as previously stated, the Matchmaking system does not allow viable party composition. Also noteworthy is that because iLvl can be inflated, someone with the iLvl to enter the instance can end up doing worse than someone who does not meet the requirements- The biggest problem with PvE content is also tied into class designs. Some classes underperform in PvE compared to all of their competitors. For instance, the difference between CW and SW. CW brings some modicum of Crowd Control to the party as well as DPS. SW brings comparable, if not lower, DPS and no Crowd Control. This leaves to very static party comps that do not accept certain classes.- The money-making possibilities from PvE activities are absurdly low. Given the price of RP items, enchantments, companions, etc, the rewards from PvE are ridiculously low and capped per day at an abysmally low amount. Furthermore, most of the equipment gained from dungeons is bound so it can't be traded for money anyway.+/- Two different currencies exist in Neverwinter: Astral Diamonds and Gold. Gold is pretty useless, only good for buying some consumables from NPCs (You'll typically only buy Injury Kits) and the starter mounts. Astral Diamonds (AD, henceforth) is used for literally everything else.PvP- PvP activities are very static. Of all of the PvP maps and modes available, none of them are based on actual PvP (Similar to TDM, DM, Assassination, etc). They're all based on point capture. The two IWD Zones only turn into capture maps during the Heroic Encounter that spawns at certain times of the day, however, these zones are usually very barren.- Very few improvements have been made to the PvP modes since the game was originally launched.- Some classes outperform other classes in every regard. For instance, and yet again, a CW is much more of an asset than a SW. A GF, the dedicated tanking class, has comparable DPS abilities to a GWF, the heavy weapon class. Some classes, once upgraded to a certain point, are effectively immortal when under focus fire from a group. Put simply, the class balance in PvP does not exist.- A lot of class balancing decisions are made from PvP-based feedback. For instance, Combat HRs were complained about for a long time. They weren't amazing in PvE either. As a result of the PvP feedback, the Combat spec was nerfed. The same thing happened to Whisperknife TRs as well. Ironically, if you start from older mods (Mod 3-ish), you'll notice a certain trend in the devs' logic against nerfing a single class. Might be a conspiracy theory but it sure stands out.tl;dr:The game has too many problems. Some classes are a complete waste of time due to bugs and underperforming compared to other classes which makes PvP more trouble than its worth and PvE a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The game is hosted by a company that has no other desire than to make money. This is obvious when the developers ask for community feedback and after a 50 page thread of feedback, they completely disregard it and make nonsensical changes to the game that do not fix the problem.I would not recommend this game to anyone. Even someone I hate.			"

												Okey so i got this game not long ago and it was really fun , the combat the leveling it is all fun and kinda easy but the game is Pay to Win . You might like reach someone who is pay to win but you will need like months or maybe years of farming AD to make gear like his or buy it in auction . PVP on low levels is kinda balanced but then high levels its not , You are in pvp with 8k Power and the other guy is there with 27 k power :) thats like totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t . so PAY TO WIN GAME . I suggest you not to waste time in this game unless u are willing to spend money on this game cuz PVP is unbalanced and even PVE when they have $$$$$$ paid stuff they do hell of dps :) i would rate 5/10			"

												This game is  money grab pure and simple. All free to play has some purchase options, however, most are not as highly priced as the items in Neverwinter.  To buy enough Zen to purchase the dragon born or drow racial packs it costs you the price of a full game. This is for the race and a hero slot with very little else. These packs should by no means be more than $10 for what you get in them. Zen is completely unjustifiable at its current price. Astral diamonds, which is the in game currency, can be built up over time, but once you do it is not unheard of for the system to glitch you out of it. I recently lost 102K AD for a 7000 stronghold donation. The response from customer service was oops, oh well. The game play if fine, just dont expect to have any of the good items in this game without having $100's of dollars to spend on it.			"

												I've played this game a few months after it originally launched on PC and ended up quitting several times for the same reason. I'll break this down into categories: (tl;dr located at bottom)Itemizing+ Equipment isn't too hard to get. However, in the latest versions, the gear choices are a lot more static than they used to be. Doesn't offer too much customization.- Enchants are broken beyond belief. Getting the required amount of shards for Weapon/Armor enchants isn't hard. However, they all have a 1% chance to succeed. Forcing you to either grind and play a ridiculously unfair game of RNG or simply invest into the cash shop. Normal enchants aren't too much of a pain until you get them to Lvl 7, then they get very expensive and the success rates plummet.- Legendary weapons, while good in idea, have been ruined in multiple ways. Refinement Point Items (RP Items) used to be a lot more common than they are now. However, botters started farming them and flooded the market with them which effectively reduced the price of the items and made them available for everyone. However, Cryptic decided to make RP items bound when picked up which effectively destroyed the market. As a result, RP items are too expensive, the game doesn't offer a lot of money making possibilities, and the legendary weapons cost too much to upgrade- Legendary Armor/Accessories. Once again, completely imbalanced. In the current state of the game, there are many options to choose from but only about 3 that are viable and worth upgrading. The community has been very vocal about this and nothing has been done about it.

												This is a very enjoyable game! It reminds me of World of Warcraft, mixed with a bit of Lord of The Rings Online. The combat system is dynamic, movement based, so you move about and attack instead of standing-by and using skills sort of style. The quests are great, atmosphere is glorious, and the soundtrack is most excellent. This reminds me of all the time I spent as a child playing Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate. It's a very fun game, full of things to do, I highly recommend giving it a ""least"" a try.			"

												One of the best MMO's on steam! I have a lot of fun playing this game put at least $20 into this game, if you were to ask me what MMO should I get, I would recomend this one not only does it have a descent story line (I don't listen to the story.) It also has great voice acting something a lot of MMO's lack.(Meaning the peson doing the voice is good at it. That doesn't mean it sounds good.)(COUGH* COUGH* DC UNIVERSE)(COUGH* COUGH* TERRIBLE VOICE ACTING)This game has a better overall story than DC Universe.HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												This game. Oh where to begin?Well lets start off with some requirements:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------AT LEAST 5 mb/s internet or you will be suffering.- Intel core i3 ddr3-nvidia 600 & Above-Competence-Friends (optional, but the game is much more fun with them)                       These are NOT REQUIRED to play the game                       Only to play it with decent FPS and somewhat decent graphics---------------------------------------------------------------------------------                  The first stages of this game are definately going to be the hardest, mostly due to the lack of tutorials. You have to find things out on your own, but I just cheated and went to the forums!  Once you get past level 15 (The mount level) You're pretty much requried to spend money on this game if you want a soemwhat decent mount. I love supporting games like this, but if it's f2p then it should atleast have some options. 7/10A good timewaster "

												I would like to say this MMO is great.  It has a wonderful system that is in place which is the ability to create your own maps for the game if you're tired of the content that has been created.  Many people feel it is a ""Pay 2 Win"" game.  It isn't unless you make it that way.  That's the real situation.  Overall though, there is nothing that you can't do in the game to play it and get to the same level as everyone else.  The situation is how much you want to devote to the game to get to whatever progress you as a player wants. However as a ""Free to Play"" game, there is a lot of free content that a person can go into and I recommend to eventually get into a guild or make sure you do all the required high level content to get some of the better gear.  I know recently there were some network issues but I believe it has smoothed itself out some and has become playable again.  I recommend this game to the hardcore or even the casual player because the quests are instance based but very quick at times.  It's only the raids that are a little longer and more involved.  Also, make sure to do your dailies but everything is solid for that MMO and recommend it to anyone.			"

												This great Dungeons and Dragons plays really good for 3rd person gamers as well as 1st person gamers, it has a much more dynamic combat than most mmorpg arround today, the movement and skills utilizing systems somehow could emerge the classic and the new. It's as good as Baldur's Gate, a bit more action packed, and it also has better graphis. Definitelly a great option for those who like the gameplay, art and strytelling styles of more mainstream non-free-to-play games (lookin' at u WOW).			"

												Really fun the first time through...buuuuuuut if you decide to make another character and go through with a different class the game gets really long and boring.It can get really expensive at times too since getting a good mount (110% move speed) can cost like $30-$40. Can also be very repetetive and grindy at times since most of the missions are the kill X amount of these things type of missions.  Pvp can be a complete♥♥♥♥♥♥show since most of the time you will go against people with like 3 billion gear score and they will fuuuuuuuckkkkkk you up.Those are all the big cons of the game and im to lazy to list the pros so yeahhhh......Its really up to you if you want to get this game or not but if those cons make u wanna kill yourself then you probably shouldnt get this game.

												Neverwinter is a very exciting, action packed MMO based off of the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. You DON'T need to be a D&D pro to play however, that just helps you understand the lore and basics of each class. It is free-to-play, but not pay-to-win. Yes, spending cash does help you advance faster, but anything and everything can be earned in the game without spending real-world dollars. The community is friendly in general, but it does have it's share of butt-holes like every online community. Recent changes to the game have been a major improvement, as some campaings/modules *cough cough* Tyranny of Dragons *cough* had extremely hard to obtain boons and gear, and the economy was trashed and ruled by botters. The devs have made huge strides in cutting out botters, and while not 100% clean, they took a hard hit. They prices the botters/scammers offer for their services now are really high, and there aren't nearly as much as their used to be in the zone chat. I highly recommend making friends, some of my best friends are from chance encounters in Neverwinter. It has it's flaws, especially the grind to reach level 70, the games current level cap. I suggest waiting for the fairly frequent Double Experience weekends/events to level a toon. My name in-game is GravitySage, and I am happy to help any new players. Welcome to Neverwinter!!!			"

												The game is free! You cant beat freeSo far i hit level 15, every couple of hours something new will pop up on your ""Daily"" quest journal. Sometimes this is to complete a sponsored user generate Dungeon in a a set time amount.Oh, this game comes with a dungoen creation tool called Foundry. You can create your own Dungeon. Make it what ever you want, you can even make whole storylines. This tool is kinda hard (they included) a tutorial which is pretty awesome. No MMO, EVER, has this option. Every day i log on, i see new content, more stuff to do. Yeah it has the normal storyline quest you can do.If you played the FTP The Old Republic. This mimics that formula a little bit. Mostly with companions and professions. Ever felt similar and easy to use. The game ""gate locks"" content to certain levels so you dont get swarmed with content at the start (which is nice)But this game has its downfalls, on high cap servers you will get very bad lag spikes. Sometime i have to search out a instance with lower number of players to keep from getting auto logged out. I have not played the most recent D&D addition, i played Neverwinter Nights 1 and read the legend of Drizz't. This is not the Neverwinter i remember. If you want any sense of what the story is trying to tell, you need to wiki the history, which is dumb for a MMO with such a rich lore.But you can pick up lore items which fill in the blanks, oftens times you get them after finding a new area or even just completing a quest. The  combat system is based off skill (so it wants you to believe.) Enemies will hit in such huge radiuses that you cant avoid. I did a test with my Control Wizard (its shift command is teleport) i waited till i was in the face of a enemy, and yes i know that not how you play one. I teleported forward, the game says you teleport 25 feet in a lateral line. I was still dealt damage, even tho this bad guy was a melee character and did not have a 25 foot hit range.For all its faults and weaknesses, Cryptic did a a good job, not Excellent but good. Its playable, its fun, hell i like it. I normally play EVE online and not something like this. Give it a shot, if you dont like. Like i said its Free, you only wasted your time.			"

Posted: January 5, 2014
												Neverwinter is a game that has me halting between to opinions. There are some really good parts about this game, but also some not so good or just plain bad. Let's start of on a positive note.The good!:It is a really fun MMORPG with a cool and dynamic combat system that makes you dodge, run around and use your abilities without them having very long cooldowns. This, in combination with the relatively easy and straigthforward quests, makes you feel like a god amongst men. Hacking and slashing your way through clearly inferior enemies with awesome attacks and skills that are animated beatifully gives a cool kick. I don't mind the easy quests either. They'll take you to a wide variety of area's and dungeons, really making you feel like a badass adventurer. The gear in the game is absolutely beautiful, which for me is very important. It does matter a bit if you are wearing a ""set"" of armor that makes all the pieces look good together. But even when leveling up and wearing rags the gear looks very cool.The not so good:As a casual gamer myself and trying to do some endgame a few flaws in the game come to the surface. The endgame dungeons are buggy as hell. If you do not have a guild or a full party that you can run dungeons with you are bound to use the game's queuing system (which works quite well actually). More often than not you will find yourself on a long dragging dungeon attempt that is usually about trying to exploit the dungeon's bugs in order to skip as many enemies as possible with people that don't seem to care if you die or not. None of the enemies really have any cool game mechanics, they just hit harder or faster than the last guy. I havent really had any boss fights that I found intriguing. Some of them were hard, yes. But that was just due to the enemy having a ridiculous amount of hitpoint and/or hitting very hard. I have not really had any fun in endgame dungeons yet.The bad:The game is published by Perfect world which isn't necessarily a bad thing at all. The game of course is Free To Play, which means that Perfect World will have you try to spend money on it at every turn you take (or atleast that is how I feel) because they have to make money somehow. The game has two main currencies : Astral diamonds and Zen. Both of these currencies can be traded for one another. Almost all the epic gear in the game is Bind on Equip, which means that you can buy all of this gear for enormous amounts of diamonds. For people playing this game full time it is not a problem getting this gear and selling it, but for the casual gamer it can be frustrating to get to these incredible amounts of diamonds without spending any money on it. I guess this all makes perfect sense for someone who is at peace with this system and will probably go ""yeah, so what?"". For me it is really an uncool feeling. I feel that the best gear in the game should only be available for the ones who have completed certain content and have really earned it. For me this feels like Pay to Win. Combine this with the buggy endgame dungeons and the games endgame feels like a letdown.Besides that, the game makes you pay ridiculous amounts for what I call ""comfort items"". Items you do not need to complete the game but make your life ingame so much more easy. Things like a big bag (8 euro's in Zen!!) and fasts mounths (40 euro's in Zen!!) are just incredibly overpriced. These are not microtransactions but you end up paying as much for a fast mount as you would for a legal copy of Guild wars 2 during it's release. Just plain robbery. Of course you can always farm the required diamonds ingame but for a casual gamer that isn't really an option.All in all it looks like Perfect World is trying to benefit from the casual gamer with a job that has no time to play the game full time but has plenty of money to spend on it. Since I am in that categoty I feel a bit exploited by the game.My advice!:Go play Neverwinter! The combat system and the cool area's will give you much fun leveling up. The game really feels complete with cool loot drops and giving you new gear almost every level you gain.Think twice about really endgaming Neverwinter. The endgame dungeon's are buggy and hard for casuals. The game feels really repetative after spending some time at the max level.Rating:+Cool Combat system+Feel like a god amongt men+Nice area, plenty to explore+Very cool skills/attacks and animations for all characters-Everything for sale-Hard for casuals to farm enough diamonds-Feels like pay to win sometimes-Comfort items really expensive-Buggy and repetative endgameAll in all I would score this MMORPG 7 out of 10.Give it a try!

												Really fun the first time through...buuuuuuut if you decide to make another character and go through with a different class the game gets really long and boring.It can get really expensive at times too since getting a good mount (110% move speed) can cost like $30-$40. Can also be very repetetive and grindy at times since most of the missions are the kill X amount of these things type of missions.  Pvp can be a complete♥♥♥♥♥♥show since most of the time you will go against people with like 3 billion gear score and they will fuuuuuuuckkkkkk you up.Those are all the big cons of the game and im to lazy to list the pros so yeahhhh......Its really up to you if you want to get this game or not but if those cons make u wanna kill yourself then you probably shouldnt get this game.

												Ive got over 100+ hours into Neverwinter, so I figured I should review it, and ill keep it short.The game is fun.  If youre thinking of the end game before playing it, just try it out (its free)The combat was innovative as it came before ES:O, and the combo and action combat makes  for a more action orriented experience from an MMO.  I actually had fun grinding my way to the top, because of the active dodgeing and combos with varying AOE, I was thrilled to take on 4 enemies at once by being agile (certain classes block instead). That being said, the Skills are somewhat limited, but they have modifiers to help add to the customization.  So while Wizard 1 may have the same skills as Wizard 2, their modifiers could make them more pure damage or pure control, or somewhere in between.  As for everyone complaining of the prices for mounts, companions, etc, Ill say this: All these things (ALL OF THEM) can be purchased on the AH for Astral Diamonds which you get from playing.  IT IS CHEAPER to buy $5 of Zen Coin and convert to diamonds, because a top tier companion is a lot cheaper in Diamonds than it is Zen (players CAN find the rare mounts, and sell them for diamonds).  TL:DR The free system in this game is ahead of the curve, because all paid for items can be purchased with the f2p system often for cheaper than the 'real money' shop. On top of that, the action orriented combat with active dodging and combos is super fun.			"

												Neverwinter Online is a decent enough game but is not anything close to actual D&D.  The game is more of a standard MMO with a D&D stamp or veneer over it.  The quests are very repetitive and have little variation between them.  The Foundry feature, which allows players to create their own quests for the community's use, has some good quests but this tool has not lived up to its potential.  NWO has an interesting skills system and the wide number of hirelings and mounts improve the game to some degree, but overall the game is disappointing and lacks long term playing potential.			"

												Neverwinter is ridiculously fun! I've logged quite a few hours in this game and the storyline is fun and engaging. I actually find the storyline while leveling up is quite enjoyable, when compared to other MMO games. The feel is very DND and the story captures several classic scenarios from table top gaming. Plus, who else doesn't love visiting some of your favorite Sword Coast locales?There is cash shop in the game that is a bit on the expensive side for some items, but they largely appear to be cosmetic and for bragging rights. Some items do give you a leg up on other players, but it's not so substantial that I would consider it to be pay-to-win. If you've got the cash and want to purchase some items, more power to you.As I said before, the storyline while leveling up is terrific. I've not really found another MMO that has the story be so fun and enjoyable. The graphics are beginning to show their age a bit, but this game is certainly on my list as one of the top MMOs available. Just be warned, the end game can get a bit grindy and lose flavor, but that's the case with most MMOs. All in all, this is a terrific little MMO with a fun PVP system and I would definitely recommend the game to anyone looking for a fun story and awesome race/class combinations.			"

												Neverwinter is a very exciting, action packed MMO based off of the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. You DON'T need to be a D&D pro to play however, that just helps you understand the lore and basics of each class. It is free-to-play, but not pay-to-win. Yes, spending cash does help you advance faster, but anything and everything can be earned in the game without spending real-world dollars. The community is friendly in general, but it does have it's share of butt-holes like every online community. Recent changes to the game have been a major improvement, as some campaings/modules *cough cough* Tyranny of Dragons *cough* had extremely hard to obtain boons and gear, and the economy was trashed and ruled by botters. The devs have made huge strides in cutting out botters, and while not 100% clean, they took a hard hit. They prices the botters/scammers offer for their services now are really high, and there aren't nearly as much as their used to be in the zone chat. I highly recommend making friends, some of my best friends are from chance encounters in Neverwinter. It has it's flaws, especially the grind to reach level 70, the games current level cap. I suggest waiting for the fairly frequent Double Experience weekends/events to level a toon. My name in-game is GravitySage, and I am happy to help any new players. Welcome to Neverwinter!!!			"

												Level 1~60 is a safe n pleasure progress.However after lvl 60, the game is changed to a mindless grinding for no really good story behind, PvP is straight forward pay to win.Developers of this game doesn't really care about what players want, bait and switch everything, they can even change their blogs after some false advertisements already started.The best online game with cutting edge combat system and nice graphics but also with the worst management.

												Lacks atmosphere. Kiddie art direction/ wannabe WoW, graphically. Hand-holding ""quest sparkles"" show you exactly where to go for any quest. Deity and character background has no impact on character or game play. Racial bonuses are super conservative, barely even worth thinking about. Far removed from D&D in all but name. This game is simply hard to like, or get into.			"

When the patches were downloaded game wont start... I closed and reopened game launcher and tried to log in again then it says I cant login from my current IP. Sent them another mail, will be another 24 hours until they respond... will update			"

												Just another voice to the choir.  Almost every negative review here on steam is spot on.   If you are playing for the first time, leveling a character 1 through 60 you will most likely love this game and I would recomend it.   It's has great combat that is responsive and fluid.  The quests are interesting and fun (for a first time play through).It's a wonderful experience until you reach the end game.   This is where the fun stops.   The end game is nothing more than a grind fest where you run the same quest over and over and over and over and over and over and over(keep repeating 1000's more times) again. Some of these end game campaigns are so terrible that you can actually buy tokens in the Zen store that lets you skip them. Yes for a mire $50.00 each(yes $50.00 'each') you can skip the 'dead ring' and 'sharandar' campaigns.  Think about it, people are actually willing to pay them money 'not to play' their game.  That is just insane.  Keep in mind that it is only for one character too.   Those tokens are not an account wide option. So if you spend any money for extra character slots to try out the other classes, you're stuck with doing those grind fest campaigns unless you pay for the tokens again.  It almost seems like a cruel joke.On top of that the refinement system is not casual player friendly.  If you are someone that only has time to play maybe 2 to 4 hours a week, there is no humanly possible way to collect enough refinement points to max level an item unless you are willing to spend money.  I would not complain about this if it was only a handful of enchantments you can place on weapons and armor.   But now you have dozens of new artifacts including artifact weapons and equipment.  All needing refinement to level up.  If you played 4 hours a day for six months straight you might be able to max level '1' of these items. yes '1' out of some 15-20 you can equip on your character at one time, which doesn't even include the ones you might keep in inventory to switch around depending on what tasks you are doing.  That is just for the refinement points and doesn't include the Reagents needed for the upgrade.   It's absolutely crazy.  There is no way a casual player is going to do this without spending houndreds of dollars to upgrade them.The other thing to be aware of is rebalancing changes.  Neverwinter has been adding new classes and content that has required the game to be rebalanced with every major update.   I understand that this is needed for better game play.  However as I mentioned above items that require refinement to upgrade is a very costly whether you spend the time or the money to do it.  When they rebalance the game what you may discover is that an item you are working on may no longer be worth the effort.  For example Mod 6 is going to change how regeneration and life steal works.  Anyone who has invested the time and or money to upgrade items that buff these stats might not have choosen to do so. That can be literally months of work for some people who used their time to upgrade those items or hundreds of dollars for others who paid to upgrade.SO if you're a new player starting out leveling a character 1 though 60 savior the moment.  It's doesn't last for the end game.   Once you get to the end game I would recommend you move on to something else.			"

It’s simply not possible at this point to converge the two coherently. And I would be happy to play my classes if I do get any messages.. But,Moving along, exactly why wasn’t the NW Beta/game originally apart of Steam when other games like NWK were in Steams shop prior to their releases you ask??Well Good question, maybe ask the Devs??

												been playing this game since it was open beta, it now sucks, the devs dont care about the players that have been here all these years , and 90% of the time , ppl cant log into it coz it keeps doing errors on sign in, and crashing , now you cant even make it work in safe mode, if you want to get reely annoyed and angry playing a game , then this is the 1 you wanna play, otherwise stay away from this piece of Cryptic crap!! In addition to annoying the crap out of you and crashing on login, all the classes in the game are broken in sum way, All the dungns are also broken , and usually the last bosses glitch out or bug , nd yu get nothing coz they cant be killed, or yu cue and get into a bugged instance, glitched out graphical errors on clothing items , (i.e. giant spike visible to all while mounted if wearing a helmut, this game was a great game, since mod 4 it has slowlyy slid down the hill, thru the sewage pipes, and is now a sewer monster of a game, and i have serious doubts with the company that makes it as a whole , since it seems i cud code the game better than they can nd i have rudimenntary knowledge of such things.  Anyways, if another company gets the game ill play it again, for now its being deleted until futher notice. PIECE OF CRAP !			"

												Played this for a little while. Got tired of the ridiculous micro-transaction paywall, the ""Dragon Timers?"" and the bugs and glitches. It's been so long since I played this that I couldn't even remember the name let alone why I quit playing. All I knew is that I will NEVER play this again if I have ANY choice in the matter. 0/10, won't make that mistake again!			"

												Don't get me wrong this game has a lot of good points but has one major flawI will start with the big flawThis game is is free to play and doesn't have a vip level caps or premium areas, its ridiculously expensive if you want to make any real progress. I'll give a few examples:+There are free mounts in the game which can be bought with in game gold-These are very plain and basic mounts -The best mounts in the game cost 2500 -3500 ZEN this translates to £25...... £25 !!!! for a horse skin and faster movement speed which i can buy a whole game for+You can earn astral diamonds (can be converted ZEN) 6 times a day so there is a way to earn the items- we'll say you might make 20000 astral diamonds in a day which i personally wasn't anywhere near doing but 1 ZEN = 380 AD so to buy that horse 3500ZEN you're going to need 1,330,000 astral diamonds which is 66 days of play. Which is stupid.....-downloadable content is ridiculously expensive considering its just items, gear and mounts.-high level items all require astral diamonds or zen-the ingame money is pretty much useless and can only buy health potions and kits-to unlock the treasure chest at the end of that dungeon you just did (not regular quests) requries you to buy a key with astral diamonds-game is too simple, you get 3 abillities, 2 passives, 2 big abillities and a class specific sort of ""mode"". These can eb swapped out with other skills that you unlock but heck give me some variety-game was never really that challenging, I'm sure it gets more difficult but I got to level 43 with very little difficulty+game looks alright for a mmorpg, very few look amazing-game is very poorly optimized, i'm running a titan x, 32GB of ram, 6 core with hyper threading and  all over clocked on a 4k screen.witcher 3 which is an absolutely stunning game graphically and rubs this game in the dirt always had 40+ fpsIn some areas this game makes me hit 20 fps which is abysmal-quests are quite repetitiveI guess I'll get to some positives then now+areas and mobs are diverse+boss fights are pretty cool+good to just pass some time if you've got nothing to play+game has a lot to do by the looks of it and if you've got hundred of pounds to waste then heck go ahead+very clear dungeons and dragons elements+though you can't use the majority of your abillities there's quite a lot to choose fromIf the developers want to improve this game make your zen exchanges rates better with real world currencymake the regular currency able to buy more things, literally everything should be pourchasable with coppers even if you have to balance it by making it quite a lotToo many sub currencies in the games e.g. seals, astral diamonds, zen, coppers......Things like loot shouldn't come at a cost to just open			"

												Exceptionally Pay2Win game, which is a shame, because the game is actually well made. Even at the lowest levels the game lets you literally purchase so much power that you can be 3-4x as powerful as a free players on your level. This is especially noticable in pvp, where someone the same level as you can 3 shot you in less than 4 seconds, regardless of your gear or skill level.This is also ade worse due to the class balance, letting some classes be 1.5-2x as powerful as others. Add Pay2win on top of a OP class, and you have a nearly-literal walking godmode, that can solo party dungeons with ease.Avoid this wallet-warrioring game, unless your a whale.			"

												After having spent more than 600 hours in game, I have come to realize that it is simply a money grab.All of the content is repetitive in nature, getting you to kill the same mobs and do the same quests over and over again in order to earn currency excahnged for gear. Gear which someone else can simply buy, if they wish to do so. The zones are not large, and the epic encounters are short and simple in nature.It looks good, but shortsightedness on the part of the CEO, and development team have lead to a game with a small amount of content which is repeated over and over. And Exploiting and hacking have not helped the economy.Essentially, the creators of this game are selling gear, and want you to have to continuously spend to upgrade in order to move forward. They dont sell fun, like any good MMO, of which i have played my fair share. They dont want to sell fun. Nor do they want long term customers. They want you to get in, experience all the points at which its hard to lvl, buy gear, finish the content, get bored, and get out, so that the next wave can come in without them having to buy new servers.You have been warned.

												This game isn't bad but hope you never need the help of a GM.   I was introducing a new player into the game.  We both were ejected from the server at the same time.  We log back in, she's stuck in the terrain - as in nothing but black around here. We  try /stuck, /killme, log in/out...nothing works.   We submit a ticket.   We wait.  We wait.  We wait.   We go find something else to do and we are auto-logged off.We come back SEVEN HOURS LATER.   She's still stuck.So...either we have to SIT THERE and make sure we don't auto-log off to get help...that's not happening...or seven hours later they still have no unstuck her.   That's a wonderful way to sell a game.Needless to say we are going to play a different game.			"

												Neverwinter is ridiculously fun! I've logged quite a few hours in this game and the storyline is fun and engaging. I actually find the storyline while leveling up is quite enjoyable, when compared to other MMO games. The feel is very DND and the story captures several classic scenarios from table top gaming. Plus, who else doesn't love visiting some of your favorite Sword Coast locales?There is cash shop in the game that is a bit on the expensive side for some items, but they largely appear to be cosmetic and for bragging rights. Some items do give you a leg up on other players, but it's not so substantial that I would consider it to be pay-to-win. If you've got the cash and want to purchase some items, more power to you.As I said before, the storyline while leveling up is terrific. I've not really found another MMO that has the story be so fun and enjoyable. The graphics are beginning to show their age a bit, but this game is certainly on my list as one of the top MMOs available. Just be warned, the end game can get a bit grindy and lose flavor, but that's the case with most MMOs. All in all, this is a terrific little MMO with a fun PVP system and I would definitely recommend the game to anyone looking for a fun story and awesome race/class combinations.			"

												Although the game is still going through some changes by releasing more stuff for you to buy, but I find many faults.  The most used classes are anything BUT archers.  (Trust me, I'm using one, and it's terrible.)  Most of the skills you're using are good to use, however, they're the only the best after level 10, the skills afterwards, or points you use, is weak and useless, even in Melee, it's just as bad by not inflicting damage, no matter how great your runes or armor, even weapon is.  The thing is, and what is making the genre of MMO's fail, is instead of fixing these problems, they instead turn to releasing more stuff for you to purchase and getting those isn't cheap either, for a new class, it's around $60.  This is what I'm finding the hugest fault in MMO gaming, (and Maplestory does way better at fixing this by being told there's problems and they have over 15 classes already I think.)  I will give it some credit to gaming art, story and very unique worlds, however, there are so many problems, some of the dungeons are terribly crafted in terms of boss fights (Grast the Gutwhatever is the main issue..), the tracking system does go out of whack, no safe paths when you want to avoid enemies just to go back to the NPC without the pain and hassle of taking on more enemies, that YOU just killed three minutes ago.. and the level cappage is just.. *sigh* (And there are enemies that are above the cappage, when you're still 60.  How the hell does that make sense and way tougher than you, PW?!)It's good if you want some uniqueness, but really, PW, you were doing fine with Perfect World, what the hell happened here?!  Did you just not care anymore?  Did you just fart the idea and packed it up cutely just so we won't detect the smell?  If you really want us to have a good time here, don't just whaft out stingy and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥junk just so you can suck it out of us.  If you are rich and time to spare, have at it, because somehow this is just not well thought out and properly done that literally puts D&D, Wizards of the Coast in the♥♥♥♥♥♥box.  Back to the paper and dice I go if that were the case.			"

												Graphics are good, to me at least there's no fps drop between max graphics and lowest, i think theyre quite good really, i haven't seen much better in other mmos.Gameplay is fun, if you like hack and slash you'll like this. You can have 3 powers, 2 really strong powers that you need to charge, and 2 class features at a time in your rotation.Voice acting in the game is alright compared to most i've seen in online games, might be a big plus if you don't like reading a lot of text.Quests are meh, get sent to this area, get lots of quests from the people, kill this and that, go to that dungeon, then report back to the main city and get sent to another area.However I do enjoy the campaigns, which have greatly improved lore in my opinion. If you're a D&D fan you'll appreciate it more as you actually get some lore notes as you play.In game store is the most expensive I've seen in a while, you'd have to spend some crazy money to buy a good mount and a companion. I will admit i spent 30 dollars so i could get some stuff. However, the game has an auction house where you can get highest tier companions AND mounts with astral diamonds, which you can get doing some daily quests and such. it might seem really expensive and time consuming, but it's not that bad. Also you can buy the zen and exchange it for diamonds, which can get you a crazy amount of diamonds so you can buy what you want from the auction house. I wouldn't recommend spending money in this game until you're maxed out and completed ALL campaigns. Only then should you start worrying about actually having high level enchantments and stuff. By that point you might even have to afford such things with the astral diamonds you'll probably amass. (it took me about a week after i hit lvl 60 to buy an epic set of gear)I see some people complaining about inventory space? Since i started playing i've never had problems with inventory management, i don't think i'll ever buy more spaceI read thru the bad reviews and they're all about the same things, how expensive things are in the game and i couldn't agree more. But honestly no one is telling you to spend money on it, you can get it all for free by simply farming. Oh you can't handle playing a game for months? why play mmos then? I been playing games like runescape since they came out, I played warframe since early betas, same with path of exile and other mmos.This game is fine, has it's flaws but most of the bad reviews are exaggerated. I hit the level cap a while ago and thru ingame farming, i have some of the best gear and weapons, along with those oh so expensive enchantments and what not which only took me about a 2 weeks. People don't realize that all mmos take time and effort to be good at, so what if it takes a year to be amazing at this game? I play many mmos and there's nothing about this game making it pay to win to the max. Only an idiot would pay to win, as you can see how crazy expensive things are. Most people you'll see with really good gear  didn't pay to win, they simply been playing since 2013? If you're getting destroyed in pvp it doesn't mean they paid to win, they just been playing way longer than you (it takes about a week to hit lvl 60 if you play everyday.)Overall, i would say this isn't the most friendly game to new mmo players, but i say its definitely worth playing. It may be a long run, but eventually you'll be one of those guys destroying newbies in pvp. If anything, play with a friend it makes the game much better, i never get bored playing with my friends.

												Fun action-rpg. Outfit designs generally look pretty good, gameplay is smooth. My complaints are that being free-to-play, the company running the game go a bit overboard on putting things in the game that you feel obligated to spend real money to aquire zen to buy, such as workers to make professions somewhat useful.  Also, there are alot of exploits in dungeons, yet the company seems to ignore most of that and ban people for much more minor offenses. I was even banned for botting because i played the game for 14 hours straight, doing nothing wrong otherwise and it took days to get the account unbanned due to a very bad customer support system (if you are banned, you cannot login to the website to update support tickets, so you must send a totally new ticket and note that it regards an existing ticket, and hope they read it rather than marking it as duplicate).Moral of the story: love the game, hate the company behind it.

												This is the first MMO I have managed to get into apart from EvE Online and I must say im loving it!I wasn't very impressed at first as in my opinion the graphics weren't very good (running maxed out) and the voice acting was so so... but once I gave it a chance the voice acting started to improve with most NPC's and some very attractive locations started to show their face (Vellosk and Ice Spire Peak to name a few!).The combat is so much better in this game then other MMO's of this type, its what keeps me coming back for more. As the combat ins't just button pressing but active it really helps immerse you into the game and makes victory's more rewarding. I've tried each class and all feel very different and fun in their own ways, I plan on getting all six to level 60 and epic gear (I would have to go with the Great Weapon Fighter as my favourite, so many destructive powers to choose from). That's a lot coming from me as games never really hold much attention for long apart from a very few, so Neverwinter has done well.The one warning I will give however is the Zen market. Everything in the Zen market (real money purchases) is very expensive, of course it is optional to buy items but the further you move through the game the more tempting Cryptic makes it to start and keep spending. I made a few purchases after my first character got past level 15 as I wanted to contribute to a game I was really enjoying... now I wish I hadn't as I find myself regularly spending far to much now on things I didn't expect too! For e.g. I bought a companion for 800 Zen, then I realised once that companion got to level 15 I would have to spend 500,000 astral diamonds to keep levelling him up so he would carry on being useful... then when the companion got to level 25 I had to spend another 750,000 astral diamonds to get him to the final rank of 30!  Ok so astral diamonds can be gotten hold of in-game but running a daily event only netts you 3,000, its going to take you a very loooong time to get anywhere considering astral diamonds are also used for lots of other in game tasks too. That's a rip-off.Having said all that I would still recommend this game, just avoid spending too much in the Zen/rip-off market and have more self control than I had.			"

												After playing over 1000 hours of this game I can say: NO dont download this game! The main issue on PC is the lack of good and NEW content; not redone old content, and unstable servers. The game is not pay to win at all; it's true that refinement items can be purchased through the cash shop but,  if you try to purchase all the refinement items that you would need;  you'd go broke! It costs so much to get anything in this game maxed out; you might aswell play the game and take your time. But that avalability of the items in the cash shop makes people (and by people I mean trolls and half-wits) a ""reason"" to spam in zone chat. It should also be said that the Devs have done a good job working with what they have in the game; but after the masive bleed out after mod 5; no one was left to spend money on the game and keep it going on PC; but, now its on the Xbone and they have some safety in revinue; alowing the PC to be the ""testing ground"" for new content. I do hope that the game would regain lost players and start growing once again but, this is just the hope of a long time player. If the Devs ever do see this I have some words of advice; make NEW content of quality! It doesnt have to tie into a masive  modle; it can just be a themed dungeon (like water, fire, air, or earth to tie into modle 6 or maybe raiding a massive bandit encampment if you want unrealated conent) with 3-4 bosses, some new loot, and even a random puzzle. Just some end game content that feels new;  you have a strong dev team that can pull content out of their♥♥♥♥♥if they wanted to;  even if you can make new textures you can reuse assets in new content, just aslong as we can have a new dungeon with new bosses and loot to run. This is what keeps players going new loot and more end game content. You could take a look at another game;  Path of Exile, a game with one of the best cash shop intergrations EVER. I cannont tell you how much I want transmogs for my gear. Making your charicter look good is a very important thing. Look at wow; people run dungeons from years ago for loot to transmog thier gear. If you dont want to add new loot because of balance but, want to add a new dungeon, just add in transmogs. Thank you for reading this massive wall of text!  "

												If you like Dungeons and Dragons or fantasy RPG's and MMO's, you might want to give this a try for the first ten levels. It's kind of fun for about that long, until the payment scheme sets in and you realize how hard it's going to be to continue on improving your gear and such without spending actual money. I spent real money on Cryptic/PWE's Star Trek Online, and if you've played any of their games before this isn't anything much different in terms of paying for flash mostly. As a general rule, I don't spend much money on these games unless they really appeal to me in some way. Ironically, this game is much better than STO in all the ways you'd want and expect it to be, but in the end, I wasn't moved enough to want to spend any money on this world. The Neverwinter backdrop is there still, but it's so different from the Neverwinter I remember that it seems little more than an heir in name alone. This could be any fantasy world. I enjoyed my character's special abilities, but meh. Give it a try, you might feel differently. I can't say much about advanced game content or what you actually get after spending real cash--the difference it makes and all. No great surprises here, good or bad. Due to security concerns over PWE's failure to properly secure customer information and their failure to notice a major incursion and/or notify the public in a timely fashion, I wouldn't purchase anything from them directly. EVER. Will Steam fall? Not will, but when... but why spread your information around in more places than necessary? That's my two cents. Enjoy.			"

												Note: This is being written just weeks after the Mod 5 launch. A lot can change in a few months so the relevance of some of the below information may be questionable in the months to come.I'm not quite certain where to begin with this.. All of this is based on my current experience with the game which I don't feel is really enough time to review it but I am moving on so I figured I could give some answers to questions I had going in.The game is an enjoyable experience and personally a perfect game for me. I love the combat, graphics, classes, etc. While there are a few minor gripes I would consider Neverwinter an positive experience whether you've spent a lot of time in MMOs or not, though like any other title it has it's flaws. If you're going to go in with a strictly F2P route in mind then the grind will be long and tedious after a while. The game lacks end game content, but the Devs are taking big strides in the right direction. PvP - Currently PvP is a super hit or miss thing with the community. P2W players can hit outrageous highs with no real need for a grind aside from a fat bank account. This isn't a big issue however because a typical player can grind out enough to at least nip the ankles of these PvP P2W titans in a weeks worth of grinding.PvE - Dungeons exist, but the time it takes to run with a good player is pretty small. Most dungeons can be solo'd so adding in four other players to one who is able to solo can make a dungeon run a fifteen minute task. There are a few tougher dungeons but you'll often find some powerhouse group in the LFG chat to run you through.There are a few other PvE events that are currently running in the game (post Mod 5) that have added a lot more content to end game PvE. These are small open world events where you (and up to 19 other people) fight an extremely ""challenging"" horde/boss and get rewards based on your performance, these can also be solo'd once you've gotten enough power under your belt. These are by far the best PvE experience currently in my opinion. The biggest thing to look out for in this game is the horrid zen market. You can easily sink money into this game and not know how much is flowing from your wallet until it's too late. At this point in time I have spent over $1000 between my wife and I on this game with nothing in game to really show for it, which is a big part of why I'm moving on from it.All in all the game is a really heavy grind, especially to get to top tier, but it is possible to become max geared without paying a cent. This is not a pay to win game, to misquote another player, this is a ""pay for convenience"" game. If you want to reach the top tier of your respected front you can either sit back and enjoy the daily grind for hundreds of hours or pay thousands of dollars to get there. The choice is yours and no one will ever have anything that gives them an advantage over you that you're unable to get by taking the opposite route.Hope this helps at least one person to better understand what they will be getting into here. Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope you are able to enjoy Neverwinter for what it really is.			"

												Just started this game today and to be honest I wasn't really impressed. So far it's not really a BAD game per say, it's just it seems so... Dull for me. The ""Action"" combat isn't all that actiony. Not like other games such as Dragon Nest or TERA.For me one of the main aspects of a game is the fun gameplay. Neverwinter simply did not thrill me. I dislike how you cannot move while doing a skill or attack. What is the point of a action game if you cant be active while fighting? Combat seems very clunky. I stress that this is just my personal opinion, as numerous others love the combat in this game, It's just not for me.On top of which, as many others have posted previously, the game is heavily Pay2Win as levels progress. While I may not have witnessed this first hand, I have seen overpriced mounts, and the obvious gap between paying players and average ones. Boss mechanics consist of mostly Cone / AOE  then spawn Adds. Repeat process as difficulty ""increases."" Really all it is doing is repeating the cycle, as there aren't much more mechanics than that. Check Youtube videos, it's obvious.Don't get me wrong, while I may be picking at these features, this is just what personally put ME off from the game. There are some players that play into endgame and never pay a dime. While it's obviously harder for them, If you truely like this game or the combat, then you really don't have to pay a cent. It's just annoying how much of an advantage paying DOES give you. Overall I think this is a decent game to pass the time as leveling is somewhat enjoyable if you enjoy the combat, but if you're looking for interesting endgame, an ""equal"" F2P experience, and genre changing mechanics, then look somewhere else.

I really wanted to like this as a huge forgotten realms/D&D fan but the combat is truly dreadful and there's not enough detail from the onset to make me want to go further. From a more technical aspect the graphics are mediocre but then they were obviosly set up to accomodate low end machines. The audio is below par and the controls though not terrible couldbe mich better especially where the camera comes in to play.			"

They going to release stronghold soon, wich is a 4th domination match map. PvP is only domination. Only good point of this game, gameplay.Ain't worth it anymore. They don't fix bug there's only 6 dungeon in end game. Only 3 pvp map atm 4 with stronghold. Bug abuser, gold farmer/spammer in the chat. Gear based game(I wouldn't mind it if it was less pay to win). And perfect world is the worst company when it come to managing a mmo. Just go on the star trek online store page or APB reloaded one they are all manage by this company and they are all heavily pay to win.			"

												This game is alright and all, but it seriously lacks some major points in a MMORPG. The karaoke content is too low, and I can't even jam out to my favorite 80's songs while slaying orcs. Please improve this game accordingly.			"

												This game came into my attention sometime ago. Me, having spent my chilhood playing Neverwinter Nights, was one of the many, many people who gave this a try, out of pure nostalgia.I ran into problems at the level of downloading the game, though. Steam only allows you to download the launcher, which then proceeds to leech the 5GB of this game from the developer's site. Which takes five hours. I wouldn't complain much about it if this game wasn't on Steam anyway. Why can't you just download the whole game from Steam, especially considering it's far superior it terms of download speed (Team Fortress 2, 12GB, downloaded in maybe over an hour)? This question still bugs me even now.First things first: this is (supposed to be) based on the 4th edition of D&D. I am not a specialist on this topic, but it seems to be very, very different from older editions - definitely more so than the 3rd edition differences from 2nd. Apparently, somewhere along the way, Clerics lost the ability to carry heavy armor and use shields and even normal weapons - instead, they run around with magical symbols which they basically just hold up and channel divine power or something like that on top of not being able to actually heal stuff directly (their first heals are drain and regen-based), sword-and-shield and two-handed-weapon Warriors were differentiated, Rogues learned to Flash Step, and Wizards taught themselves how to cast spells while wearing armor. This is as utterly unfamiliar to anyone used to NWN and 3rd edition as it sounds.In the race department, we get basically what we would expect from a typical D&D game: humans, elves, halfelves, dwarves, halflings, and halforcs, with tieflings as an added bonus. Also, the game differentiates three different ""subraces"" of elves (sun elves, wood elves and drows). Nothing out of ordinary here, to be honest. However, it disappoints us when we get to the available classes: we get only Cleric, Wizard, Rogue, Ranger and two types of Warrior (offensive and defensive varieties). Even the 2nd edition had more options, such as Paladins or Druids.In terms of gameplay, other than your typical Feats, we get three different types of powers: At-Will, Encounter and Daily. At-Will is basically your standard ""swing sword to deal damage"" or ""shoot magical bullets to deal damage"" things that can be spammed over and over. Your basic attacks, putting it simply. Encounter powers have cooldowns and are more powerful than At-Will. Finally, Dailies - no no no, it's not a viariation on FF11's Two-Hours. It's more akin to Weaponskills: you hit stuff, a gauge charges up, when it's full you unleash a ridiculously powerful attack at the cost of the whole gauge. How do you fill it? Either by dealing damage or doing class-specific actions (such as healing for Clerics). It's nothing really special, but it works and fighting stuff is fun. The game frequently throws dungeons your way, too, which usually end in boss fights, and are definitely a breath of fresh air - instead of beating up stuff on the surface, you beat up stuff underground. Powerful attacks from bosses are highlighted in red on the ground before they hit - pressing a direction twice causes you to slide and dodge any attacks. This makes it slightly more action-RPG-oriented than other games like that. Slightly. Speaking of the bosses, the fights can be pretty much summarized with ""hit the boss a lot of times, watch as it summons more minions and either deal with them or ignore them, dodge the occasional powerful highlighted-and-telegraphed attack, heal if you must, hit them some more"". It just lacks the technicality and complexity of a D&D game.In terms of storyline, well... our character, besides more-or-less stupid questions, doesn't really get any development. I know this is a MMO, but come on, it's named after one of the best cRPG series and systems ever made. You'd expect something more than an evil old woman who has Evil Overlord List violations up the ante as a main villain.This game is also, well, allegedly free. You can play just fine, but other than the standard ""box that has to be opened by a key bought with real money"" shticks, you also have to shell out if you want to get the strongest equipment and enchantments on it. A lot of games today take this approach, being seemingly F2P but filled with occassions where you can shell out to upgrade. For example, you can't create more than two characters without buying additional slots. Two characters. Even by character slot limitation standards, this is just absurd.The last, and most important thing to mention: this game takes place 100 years after Neverwinter Nights. Somewhere along that time span, there was a Spellplague that basically caused the whole Neverwinter to be torn down and rebuilt from scratch, much like Warsaw after the 2nd World War. I repeat: the Neverwinter we all know and love is dead. Instead of a great story-driven cRPG with good fights and character development, we get yet another more-or-less generic MMO, which doesn't really do much to its originality besides carrying the names of Neverwinter and D&D.I don't recommend this to neither D&D fans, nor Neverwinter Nights fans. Both of those kinds of players are going to be utterly disappointed in this. That isn't to say this game isn't playable, or fun, for that matter. I would probably look at it from a different perspective if it wasn't named after NWN or anything related to D&D.			"

												Pros - -Straightforward gameplay, follow the ground glitter and 95% of the time, you will find where you have to go for a quest.-Really fun quests and storyline.-Breathtaking sceanery, that bridge in the ice is what?-No new abilties every level, (unlike many other MMOs) pick what you like and improve what you like AND no full hotbar for every ability you only have 3 slots (4 for wizard). So how you play changes depending on which ability set you slot.-Most vetern players are friendly and willing to help new players learn content. (Some are elietist who kick you for being new, but most are more helpful.)-Foundry community makes some of the most fun adventures EVER! (Shoutout to [Tired of being the Hero].)Cons - -Pay To Win, If you want any chance at endgame, you gotta shell out money for Zen to buy weapon and armor enchantments, enchantment improvements, and stronger companions. Yes you can farm the Astral Diamonds and use that to buy Zen, but if nobody is selling Zen you are stuck waiting or struggling on content that is beyond your gear.-Game constantly advertises someone winning rare lockbox loot. ""Player:(LuckyDude) won a [Shiny Unicorn mount) from [IceCrystalGemMetal Lockbox]."" as if it is always trying to get you to try your luck...~LIKE A CASINO~-End Game Content (Icewind Dale for me) was VERY long to reach, had to do daily quests for over a month to unlock it.-Account security is only as good as your ability to not use the same login/password elsewhere. (yes, I failed this and logged in to see my character emptied out.)-Admins / customer service type very good english but are not the brightest tools. (lost all equipment and entire inventory and 400,000 Astral Diamonds and ~200 Zen. Everything recovered but BUT AD and Zen. 3 more tries were made, but nothing else was returned. So I moved on to RIFT and TERA and had a TON MORE FUN!			"

												Great game with great class mechanics, and a nice user interface and combat interface. Follows D&D pretty well with limited flaws from D&D and Forgotten Relms. The pvp system is nice, while it is in an arena format... you do get some good xp, mats, and currency from these pvp matches (win ro loose) and being 5v5 platform of pvp it is very fun. if any downfall at al it is that the chat system is a bit offish at times, with needing to hit enter and is a task at times to change channels and talk while questing. over all great game.

												After playing over 1000 hours of this game I can say: NO dont download this game! The main issue on PC is the lack of good and NEW content; not redone old content, and unstable servers. The game is not pay to win at all; it's true that refinement items can be purchased through the cash shop but,  if you try to purchase all the refinement items that you would need;  you'd go broke! It costs so much to get anything in this game maxed out; you might aswell play the game and take your time. But that avalability of the items in the cash shop makes people (and by people I mean trolls and half-wits) a ""reason"" to spam in zone chat. It should also be said that the Devs have done a good job working with what they have in the game; but after the masive bleed out after mod 5; no one was left to spend money on the game and keep it going on PC; but, now its on the Xbone and they have some safety in revinue; alowing the PC to be the ""testing ground"" for new content. I do hope that the game would regain lost players and start growing once again but, this is just the hope of a long time player. If the Devs ever do see this I have some words of advice; make NEW content of quality! It doesnt have to tie into a masive  modle; it can just be a themed dungeon (like water, fire, air, or earth to tie into modle 6 or maybe raiding a massive bandit encampment if you want unrealated conent) with 3-4 bosses, some new loot, and even a random puzzle. Just some end game content that feels new;  you have a strong dev team that can pull content out of their♥♥♥♥♥if they wanted to;  even if you can make new textures you can reuse assets in new content, just aslong as we can have a new dungeon with new bosses and loot to run. This is what keeps players going new loot and more end game content. You could take a look at another game;  Path of Exile, a game with one of the best cash shop intergrations EVER. I cannont tell you how much I want transmogs for my gear. Making your charicter look good is a very important thing. Look at wow; people run dungeons from years ago for loot to transmog thier gear. If you dont want to add new loot because of balance but, want to add a new dungeon, just add in transmogs. Thank you for reading this massive wall of text!  "

												Fun action-rpg. Outfit designs generally look pretty good, gameplay is smooth. My complaints are that being free-to-play, the company running the game go a bit overboard on putting things in the game that you feel obligated to spend real money to aquire zen to buy, such as workers to make professions somewhat useful.  Also, there are alot of exploits in dungeons, yet the company seems to ignore most of that and ban people for much more minor offenses. I was even banned for botting because i played the game for 14 hours straight, doing nothing wrong otherwise and it took days to get the account unbanned due to a very bad customer support system (if you are banned, you cannot login to the website to update support tickets, so you must send a totally new ticket and note that it regards an existing ticket, and hope they read it rather than marking it as duplicate).Moral of the story: love the game, hate the company behind it.

												Neverwinter has turned into a cash-grab affair, marked with horrendous ""balance"" choices and item changes meant to put more money into the coffers of Cryptic Games Studios. The mobs are too strong, the melee classes too weak in short. The more I played this game, the more repetitive it seemed to get. I was fine with the repetitive nature of the quests at first because I was playing during the double-exp week, but I soon grew bored of having to quest all day because I could not PvP (not going to overpay for expensive gear and enchantments that may grow obsolete with the next patch or two). In conclusion, stay away from this game for now if you don't wish to spend your hard-earned money; there are better games for free than this sham of a free-to-play.			"

												When i first played Neverwinter i was lost with a short intro and pushed straight into the game but after leaving this game sat in my games for a while when i returned i liked it so much more so let us move onto the Pros and ConsPros -Great Customisation With many Classes, Armours and Races there is no lack in varity and choice with plenty of possible outcomes in players gear and race choices Fun gameplay - With all the choices players have the gameplay works well with some classes having a more tanky feel and some a more ranged theres a good mechanic to go with it that lets players enjoy their chosen class even moreCons - P2W - This game has the feeling of you have to pour money into it to get the most fun which i would expect from a MMO but with 337.94 worth of DLC it feels more like a cash cow Thats all i have to say with 5.2 hours of game play but ill be back with more later :-)			"

												Game is actually good! First time when i tried to launch it i thought it will be some stupid game, like every free to play mmorpg, but then i started to play it and i started to enjoy it more and more. I think big impact to like this game was that i found great guild. Guild invited me and i just joined, i don't even know, but people there are great!			"

												It's free-to-play, and definitely has some pay-to-win qualities. But if you're a casual player and don't care about being L33T, it's quite fun (and free). Lots of D&D lore, especially if you've played any of the recent D&D Encounters adventures. Rules are based on 4th Edition, which is my favorite edition so far. I've played dozens of hours before it came to Steam. Leveled a cleric to 60, and have a couple lower-level alts. I only paid once, to get the founder's pack deal when it first came out in beta. There's definitely dozens of hours of free entertainment here, no IAP necessary. Get a group of friends together and play it for fun PvE and it's totally free.			"

												Worst support ever!! Don't play this title.   I thought one of the mounts looked neat so I bought one of the DLC packs for the game for me and a friend. About a week later my account got hacked and I lost all my resources I had gained in the game.     I issued a ticket and got a reply. What there support said is that there was no way for them to see if the attack was from me or another IP so they would not do the rollback. I had high hopes for the game the idea is neat but if you are just going to be one of the many hacked accounts where no rollbacks are given what is the point in playing the game.     If eventually all your stuff will be gone and you will have to start over then what is the point. Perfect world has terrible support google around and you will see for yourself terrible response times and no real support when they do get back to you.			"

The register button is not working properly i guess, because i can't click it.Go to Arch game! wtf I just made my account on it (logged by facebook) but invalid password while login on never winter and also I didn't know my own password, arch game never ask for you to type your own password that I thought it was same with my facebook password. It was not! my facebook password got 14 character but on arc game only 8?? Funny I never know my own password (as long email just for validating)			"

												Hearing stories of Dungeons & Dragons seemed epic and I loved the concept. I've never played the card game with anyone, and when I stumbled upon this game, I was quiet amazed.I have experienced many MMO's, from WoW to a million of other titles - but I've never really engaged in them since all of them seemed similar to WoW. All of them were reflections of what WoW became and it seemed pointless playing other MMO's. This is a whole other story.The character creation stage of the game didn't amaze me, although reading backround stories about each race was quite nice. Choosing the back story of your now-ready adventure is also unique allowing you to rolepay and ""bond"" with your fighter as weird as that sounds. With these sort of games it's hard to see the things that ""make you stay"" from the very beginning, but the main reason behind all the hours that I put into the game is because of the combat system. You don't have a million spells compressed into hotkeys that make you smash your keyboard at any important battle. Here, you have a limited amount of tabs of spells available at one time. It's easy to handle, and easy to get a hold of. Having such limited access to a wild root of spells, prepares you to make serious choices - but also allows you to develop your own way of battle with a few classes, which is quiet special and makes the game more enjoyable. You might have a friend that is a Priest, like you, but he might be a ""engaging in battle"" priest (obvs not a tank) whereas you may be a support priest healing him. Having a group of friends that are all of a different class is obviously the best resolution, allowing you to see how all the classes engage in battle and how all the classes can work together to reach the same goal. The opportunities are endless and with no time limit on how long you have to spend playing, you can be deciding your own way of fighting technique - in your own very way for some time. That is the main reason I stayed and I'm not vouching for anybody else. The game is more enjoyable (not better by any means) when playing with your friends. Dwelling in deep, dangerous dungeons with a group of close companions sounds like a dream and if that's what you're looking for in a game, then Neverwinter should be your choice. There is a large number of dungeons from an early level with them getting more advanced as you advance. The monsters get tougher and more bigger with each new dungeons available. Each dungeon ends with a final, gigantic boss which you SHOULD find challenging. They range from demented souls to... dragons.But yeah, that's just a small ounce of the game. If you're trying to find out more about the game, the best advice I can give is to actually play the game because streams and recorded videos cannot capture the full essence of the game.By no means am I an expert in this game, but I hope that this helped the newcomers that are trying to get in the game.

												Overall, the game is passable, if not that user-friendly.A few points, qualms, and nitpicks about the game, and the latest expansion:- I get the impression that the shift from F2P to P2W is becoming more and more pronounced; while I can understand that you need to generate revenue, why not introduce a subscription model (steady income for you, steady if most likely slow influx of Zen to subscribers)? It works in DDO or SWTOR well enough, imho (purely from player perspective).- new content vs stability: it seems that new content wins hands down; whenever a new feature is introduced, there are visible breaks in existing content. Would definitely benefit from a few extra man-days to functional/compatibility/regression testing, before going live...- ok, the devs give us new cosmetic character options, new paragon path for HR. Nice, really, thanks for the effort. But...why can't we get any option to use these new nifty things for existing characters? Would it break the game and their company totally to provide ONE free retraining/appearance changing token on a PER ACCOUNT basis?- Free Dungeon Keys! Perhaps the niftiest idea in the new module...but why make the ""free"" key unique? Why not make it like the Celestial Coin system, so people like me who can basically play only on weekends (with only running the dailies on weekdays) could ""stack up"" on the keys, and then burn through them during the weekend?- new areas and graphics look promising...but even with settings dialled back to Low, I'm getting more lag than prior to Module 3...when I was playing with Medium-High resolution...- queue system (used for 5-man dungeons and skirmishes) could still use work - would it be that hard to implement the ability to invite people into an already-running dungeon group if one person drops out? The current setup makes helping friends who got stuck at a dungeon endboss without a full party an exercise in futility as you try to queue in again and again, hoping that you get sorted into the correct group...- In-game bug reporting: I guess (and hope) its just me, but every single time I used the ingame support/bug report options, it simply vanished somewhere; without even an automatic feedback message...- Upgrade chances: so...if my chance to upgrade an enchantment from level 5 to 6 is around 40-50 percent, why do I almost consistently need AT LEAST 9-10 preservation wards to succeed? Random bad luck goes only so far as an explanation...- lastly, random chance generator for lockboxes or chests. Seriously, the chances/RNG for opening useful stuff from a lockbox is in my experience abysmal - its especially bad when, after opening dozens, or a hundred lockboxes you got practically nothing...then you see a player opening 4-5 orange-quality items in quick succession. And opening chests is perhaps even worse; in the last six months, I opened TWO chests where the drop was not some kind of potion, but preservation ward (bought with Celestial Coins) and Mark of Potency (very large chest reward for rare lvl19 leadership quest).

												Played this before it was on Steam so don't have gaming time on this platform.I ""only"" have two max level toons and not even full T2 sets on them. That's how fast I lost interest.After gaming session there is mostly just bad feelings because of the unbalance of F2P and P2P players and constant gold seller spam.Only good memories I have left where from meeting few nice people in guild I was in.The storyline didn't leave anything that would make you want more.The player created content (Foundry) was nice touch but it's main goal is just to give AD when you farm them 1h per day.Questing was somewhat simple, like current day ADHD youngsters like it. For us older generation its just too boring.Graphics where old when game was released, but for laptop gamers can't blame as game runs smooth.Total score: 45 / 100 from me.			"

												This game is a slap in the face to Forgotten Realms fans everywhere. It dangles a tantilizing world full of vibrant colors and loot in front of you then ♥♥♥♥♥ slaps you everytime you begin to have fun, whilst motioning for you to dump money into its greedy maw. You are UNABLE to ADD FRIENDS or PARTY without either SPENDING MONEY or grinding to level 15 which took me approximately 8 hours to do, upon which the majority of dungeons are SINGLE PLAYER which completely defeats the purpose of playing a god damn MMO. Then when you do get into a actualy party with friends and join a dungeon, it completely mismatches you with overly leveled powerhouses that can cheese the whole ♥♥♥♥ing dungeon as you follow behind getting either loot not for your class or loot locked behind TF2 style loot crates which require REAL WORLD MONEY to unlock. THEN; at the end of the dungeon you are rewarded with no loot unless you buy a key (with real world cash mind you) to  unlock the chest. This game is a disgusting, greedy slap in the face to Neverwinter Nights fans and should never be played by anyone. I'm mad triggered if you can't tell.			"

												Neverwinter is Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG). It's a FREE TO PLAY game, which means you don't have to BUY the game to play it, BUT there is the option to buy game packs which give you certain in game items that make the game easier to play. You can also buy items in the game with real money to obtain otherwise unobtainable items.Although you can spend real money, you don't HAVE to; you can level your character(s) up in the game and find some special items just by playing for free.The in game graphics are obviously dependant on your graphics card, but on my 770GTX the graphics are very smooth and detailed.One issue I do have with the game is it can be laggy when there are a lot of players on one map. My internet connection is fibre at 40mb and I never get any less than 33mb/s down and 8mb/s up, so the lag is certainly not my connection. Cryptic just don't have enough server space/speed to cope at times.I would certainly recommend this game if you like role playing games, and to be able to play for free if you want to, is fantastic in my opinion.

												Did you like the old Neverwinter Night games? Then skip Neverwinter!Did you play Dungeons & Dragons pen-n-paper? Then skip Neverwinter!Neverwinter is a very shallow action MMORPG with avarage graphics and a badly optimized game engine. Having a mid-high end PC myself, both my GPUs will run at 80%-99% most of the time because of the bad engine, and it already has fried an old GPU of mine >:( When settling for less active GPU usage, the graphics just become plain ugly.Neverwinter has a D&D tag on it, but it's extremely loosely based on the D&D4 rules (which I think are the worse around). And Forgotten Realms and Neverwinter? The devs obviously glanced into the lore and thought they'd got it all. Well, you never can grasp the whole Realms in just a couple of months - it takes years of ACTIVE roleplaying there to know what's going on and Neverwinter shows it just fine. NPC factions in places where they should not be, NPC characters that have been dead for ages that are alive again, even while there was totally no chance on ressurection whatsoever.			"

												I would say first, it is really an action game using RPG elements more than an actual RPG. While you do have the ability to customize your characters stats and abilities and you do take quests, there is really only one way to complete quests, which is to kill everything between you and the quest marker and then talk to whoever is waiting for you at the end. Further, even though this character is a rogue, I don't pick locks or pockets. I can disable traps, but in a group everyone runs through the dungeon so quickly there is no point in trying to disable anything.That said, the combat is pretty fun and action packed. I tried the PVP arena for the first time yesterday and had a blast. And then there is the Foundry. The Foundry allows players to create their own adventures that other people can then go through. I've tried a few and they seem to be pretty creative and fun (my earlier screenshots with the dancing skeletons and the upside down world were from two different foundry quests.) Once you are done with a Foundry quest you can then rate it for others.Overall I would say the game is pretty good, I have been having enough fun to keep going back			"

Cryptic (Perfect World Entertainment) is well known for releasing a slew of subpar mmos that are all cash grabs, immediate mmos come to mind are Champions Online, Star Trek Online, and of course Neverwinter, all of which have the majority of their content HEAVILY blocked by paywalls.Cryptic (Perfect World Entertainment) is also a notoriously bad company with terrible business practices, seriously. Do a quick google search of their name or mmos and you will see widely spread player/customer discontent and stories of PWE outright ignoring even paying customers sometimes, refusing to ban trolls, and handling their business with zero strategy for retention because they do not CARE about customer retention. They only care about milking money out of you for as long as you will put up with their abusive one-sided relationship and then as soon as you try to talk back?

												This is is just awesome. There are so many classes and races that allow you to create your ideal character so you have a lot of fun. This game has one of the best combat systems I've ever seen (right next to TERA) that makes combat fastpaced and makes you feel like a total boss when you kill an enemy and the ragdoll death physics kick in. Although one problem with the game is that it is one of the least open world mmos out there. There is also an awesome story line that makes you solve one problem in Neverwinter and move on to te next. The feealing of finding an awesome peice of loot in a dungeon is just great. This game is so much better when you play with a friend or two so recommend it to a friend. There is a TON of types of enemies so combat is never repetitive because you can be fighting a squishy minion and out of no where a hulking guy with a giant axe walks up to you and he takes a lot more dodging and abilitie using than the others. I would reccomend this game to everyone becuase it's fun, has great combat and quests. Only thing wrong with it to me is the no open world.			"

												Setting and enviroment is impressive and the fluid combat system is a joy to play. But gameplay (questing, the story (what story? lol), character ""progression"", dailies, dungeons, pvp) are horribly simple and repetitive. If this game was made by Bioware this could have been an epic title worthy of the Neverwinter name...but sadly ""Perfect"" World is a shoddy dev with pretty awkward free to play models. The story would have been enough alone to hold this game up there with the big titles at the moment if Bioware would have made it. I have no idea how/why people would rather play this over other free to play MMOs out there, it's just dreadfully dull. I give this a 4/10, only the presentation of zones and the fun combat system keep this game mildly worth playing...but I still wouldn't reccomend it. Could have been so much more if it wasn't made by a dev who's history of MMOs is sketchy at best.			"

The QER + atwill + daily system is wonderfully intuitive. I hope some more games adapt this, as I grow more and more tired of Neverwinter catering to a whiney few people.			"

												This is a D&D MMO loosely based on 4.0 rules in Neverwinter's settings ( Forgotten Realms). I have been playing this since open beta and I am still playing it today. The art and graphics are nice, but I do not like the lack of noticable changes in character creation (most of the characters, of the same race, look very similar to eachother).  I would not say this is a complete game, there are plenty of things they need to add and things they are working on. There are plenty of races to choose from, all but two are free (but who wants to play a moon elf or a menzo renegade, when you have regular drows?!).There are 6 classes with more in the works. You play how you want to play, choose what skills and gear you want to use for your character.For me, it is hard to talk about class balances because of what the classes were made to do. Hunter Ranger had recently been released and I haven't read, or played, much of them. Though, when you look at the other characters, they have very specific roles (for most of them anyways). Wizards have a lot of AoEs and crowd controls, Guardian Fighters are tanks, Clerics are healers and can even off tank is spec/geared properly. Rogues are pure damage, but are very squishy, and the same thing with Great-Weapons Fighter (thought I feel they are lacking in damage, but mine is very low level).  I also don't PVP, so that is another reason why I can't really talk about the balances. I have done plenty of dungeons/skirmishes and have a varity of classes certainly helped out.It is a linear game, simply one quest/a group of quests after the next. You do get daily rewards, once you are level 10 or so, but can loose your weekly coins if you skipped a day (you get two coins a day: one type of coin you keep until you spend it, the other coin will stack up to 7 and is the one that will disappear if you skip a day).  I would say give the game a try to, at least, level 15. At that level the foundry will open up to you. You will be able to make your own dungeons, or play dungeons that other players have made. The foundry gives you all the tools you need to get in for something very simple and later something more complexed.I have never felt the -need- to buy anything, but I have put money into this game. I don't care to have a faster mount since this is not an open world game. I don't mind making a few more trips to the vendor to clear up bag space, it's not really that different from other MMOs.  There is one pack where you can buy gear (which I don't really approve of), but other than that the gear in the Zenn store (cash shop) has no stats and it's only there to make your character look pretty. I can't really say I like any of the companions in the Zenn store, I simply use the companion you get for free or one I got during an in-game event. I am not happy about only having two free character slots, but enjoyed the game enough and didn't mind spending the money for more character slots. Besides, anything that can be bought in the Zenn store could also be bought with the in-game astral diamonds. Saving up those diamonds can take awhile, even more so if you do not play that often, but it can be done.I would give this game a 8/10. There are plenty of things they need to work on: class balance, more content, playable classes, and so on. The graphics are nice and the game play is fun. I do not have a level capped character, but I am not really have a hard time leveling. I would say I have over 400 hours into the game, I stopped running raptr so I'm not sure how much I really spent playing this game. Am I pressured into buying anything? Sure, but it is only character slots or vanity gear. That wedding dress would be all kinds of cute on my wood elf! I am also addicted to making new characters, and what?!So, give it a try and see how you like/dislike it! Also, if you are experiencing glitches or lag I suggest going to the Neverwinter site and downloading it from there.			"

												Updated review ( Everything after 420 hours playtime  is lvl 70/mod8 content)Neverwinter is an action  F2P MMORPG with faster lvling than wow , interesting combat and 8 modules (mini expansions all for free)IS the game P2W? Not really you can pay and get things faster but it should be more than possible to get full epic lvl 70 gear and ViP rank12 plus mounts all for free once you get to lvl 70 and do some grinding.PROS:-The game + modules are 100% free you can even get VIP without paying!-The combat is diffrent and interesting.-Clean and easy to use UI, no more 50 hotkeys to clog your screen.-You can earn a decent amount of ingame currency and buy the same stuff as wallet warriors.-Lvling from lvl1-60 is very fast.-Free Artefact weapon just by reaching lvl 70.-Free stuff from ingame store during hollidays (mounts,bags, refining stuff )-Ignore lists are account wide(take that gold spammers)-Most lvl 70 equipment is accountbound.-The mod 8 equipment is easy to get and very good.-Minc the character you quest with at lvl 60-70 is hillarious.-Do a  cool questline made by R.A Salvatore.-Fight alongside Drizzt Do'Urden.CONS:-Game can be laggy even on high end computers.-Disconnections happen at the most inconvenient times.-PVP is a bit unbalanced and you will find yourself with a crappy team vs premade.-If you have low itemlvl no good guild will take you in.-Lvling from lvl 60-70 takes way too long, wanted to shoot myself in the foot.-Some items on the AH is way overpriced.-If you are not in a guild you will have no more quests at lvl 68 ish.-The Devs removed ALOT of cool dungeons when lvl 70 came out, they might come back tho.-Gold is useless-Goldspammers are annoying and everywhere, just like wow.So after all this, do I still reccomend the game? yes, because I am having alot of fun and my guild is doing lvl 70 stuff My personal opinion is that the Pros outweight the cons even when you fight a wallet warrior in pvp haha.My score 8/10 (could be worse , a few bugfixes and some old dungeons back from the devs and I will bump it up to 9) "

												Neverwinter is a very fun, accessible MMORPG.  The combat utilizes the most fluid, action-oriented system I've ever seen for an MMO, and the customization options are much more advanced than most games in the genre.  I've been playing Neverwinter since it was in open beta, and I even did a video review about a month after it's official release—in which I scored it a 9/10.  This is hands down my favorite MMORPG currently, and it's definitely the easiest one to convince your non-MMO friends into playing.  I'm so glad this has finally come to Steam so I can start logging my hours and playing with my friends on here.			"

												The game is certainly enjoyable for a F2P MMORPG. The dungeons are fun and the progression keeps you interested. Also, the combat feels satisfying. My only real problem with this game starts and ends in the cash shop. Everything is incredibly overpriced, I mean 40 to 50 dollars for a mount? Literally 200 dollars for bonus content? Anybody that knows Perfect World Entertainment knows that their a greedy publisher and they implement their greedy business module into every game they touch. So no suprises there I guess.In conclusion Neverwinter deserves your attention. It's a good game with a bad publisher. Give the game a try and it might just suprise you but keep in mind that if this is a game you plan on sticking with, you'll probably end up emptying out your bank account just to keep up with the top players.

												Played this game for a long time. And hada lot of fun too:) Until my friend got it and he spent loads of his real life money to getthe best gear, mounts, companions and thehighest level. Don't play it much now:( But i can't give the game a bad review justbecause your able to buy basically everything with your real life cash.Neverwinter is an amazing MMORPG. I haveplayed this game for a long time now andloved every min of it. Don't judge the game because other people take theeasy option and simply buy everythingwith there real life money! The game canbe fun and exciting if you allow it to be.Neverwinter - 6/10			"

												It's Free to Play, what more do you want? I see a few bad reviews on the game as far as MMO Pay2Win which is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, you're not being forced to buy into the minor cosmetics, why not enjoy the game to it's fullest? I've put in two and a half hours with a friend which was well worth it, the combat system puts most other MMO's to shame in my honest opinion unless you're the type that likes quickbars and endless rows of abilities. You have a chance to dodge melee attacks as a Ranger ( Haven't played any other class.) which is nice, it brings a similar mechanic as Dark Souls into play which I find extremely well thought out. My advice: Try it out if you have free space on your computer, you're not losing money if you simply TRY. IT. OUT. Don't take the people's opinion that wouldn't reccomend this game, take it into your own judgement. In all honesty I give the game a 8/10 why not a perfect score? Simple, because it isn't perfect BUT it is fun if you have a few friends you can tag along with.			"

												This is probably the best F2P MMO I've ever played. I mean it. I've played WoW,Rift,Everquest, even Runescape! This game has amazing graphics not only for an MMO, but for games in general. It breaks conventions by making missions not kill said many enemies but by constantly pushing the stroy forward with interesting characters, the best combat system for an MMO I've seen in years, An immersive world, and does the F2P model perfectly. There are NO major short cuts to instatly leveling besides the starter kit, which you could get in the game, just after spending a good ammount of time, so there are no paay walls. Did I mention user created dungeons? Yeah. Just give this game a try, even if you don't like it, it's free so nothing is lost. Play this though! It's great!			"

												i have many hours into this game.  imo this game has something for everyone.  pvp, grind, crafting, auction house, zen/AD economy & questing to name most.  this is my suggestion: play the game for one month or to level 60 w/o spending _ANY_ money.  find what you like about it and play that.  then decide if its worth throwing money @ or worth raising another character (you get 2 characters for free account).  monthly and seasonal events reward companions, weapon skins and, rarely, mounts.  not to mention the role playing crowd (visit the Moonstone Mask).note this is perfect world entertainment so if you play STO or any of their other properties you already have an account.  combat is commanded and _not_ auto-combat like most mmos.  we must aim and target our spells lest we miss, and thus, perhaps, get to start over at the last campfire. i recommend:Play with your friends!  even w/o voice if you have a plan you _will_ win.  (even in grey wolf den)  ps if you dont have enough zen for something it will likely be on sale soon enough.  check weekly for deals.  EDIT: Level capacity expanded to 70.  New reason to play the game (again), endgame gear is no longer endgame.  4th increment of skills added.  Say hi to Minsc, really.			"

												9/10 im an entirely free to play person. i have not paid a dime in this game simply because i cannot afford it. this game has alot less grinding and farming aspects to than most rpgs i have played (i.e. star wars the old republic, world of warcraft, and fath of exile, with a hint of diablo). most people say that neverwinter is a ""pay to win game"". i respectfully disagree, the only issues that i have ever encountered in neverwinter are that; the massive amount of clans (both hardcore and casual alike) but that comes with the mmo terratory. i dont like how much the game does like for u to buy things like astral diamonds but hey give it time and ull get enough without paying. so to people who think this is pay to win, play star wars the old republic without paying and max out a character (trust me its a pain) in short in comparison to other games that i have played that are mmos this game by far is both the funnest, freindliest, and longest lasting mmorpg that ive ever had the pleasure of playing. i have high hopes for what future modules hold and what new character concepts that cryptic come up with. now putting all that aside i think if you enjoy mmos this might be one for u! give it a try and remember with mmos the max level is just a stat and the adventure doesnt stop there. in fact it is just the beginning to a whole new adventure!

												As far as an F2P goes, this is a good solid game, if you're a massive MMO fan you wouldn't think of it in this way however. It encorparates a rather large range of classes and races for a f2p, and is one of the best looking MMO's I have ever seen. The PvP features in this game are weak however, gear plays a huge role, arguably more important than level, and there are some serious class balancing issues when it comes to PvP. PvE is where the game truly shines though, the MMO features here are spot on, and arguably better than most paid MMO's. The tank and dps roles are pretty much identical to most other MMO's on the market, but the role for a healer in this game is one which I have never seen before. As well as giving out heals, the healer doubles up as a support dps role too, and the damage isn't minimal either and is only slightly less than the other dps classes. This means that if you choose to play healer in this game you won't have a dreadfully boring time like in other mmo's. The AI in this gameis solid also, they aggro against the correct people and respond well to circumstantial situations. Overall I'd urge anyone to download this game, even if they're not an MMO fan, it's a solid game which is especially good for those new to MMO's. One last thing - normally when you hear the words free to play in the gaming world, the word micro transcations comes coupled with it. This game doesn't hide the fact there is micro transactions available for those who are too lazy to put hours into the game, but it doesn't shove them in your face like most other f2p's. Really good job by the devs of this game by mking a good solid not too simple but not too complex MMO			"

												In this review I'm mainly going to focus on the free2play/pay2win aspect of the game.I'm writing this as reaction to all the misinformation and outright bull**** spread around by clueless inviduals who gave up on the game the second someone with better gear made them feel inferior to the core, resulting in them calling Neverwinter PAY2WIN ever since.Let me state it right off the bat. There's nothing, and I mean nothing in this game that can't be obtained by just playing - and it doesn't even take crazy long to get your character into elite gear either.But you're not limited to just weapons and armor - all cosmetics, mounts, pets, literally everything is at your disposal without spending a penny.The game features a currency exchange system between Astral Diamonds (the game's primary currency, among others also used by Auction House, where you can get pretty much everything) and Zen (premium currency used in Zen store, aka cash shop).There's no limit to how much you can exchange and you can do it both ways, so once you start running epic dungeons or find any other way to earn AD, you can get yourself whatever your heart desires, leaving your wallet untouched.So it's all up to you. Sure, you can spend cash to speed up your progress in getting things if you want, but it's most definitely not a necessitty. I've never spent a cent myself, yet all my characters are in the ultimate gear, riding the fastest mounts, and it's not a rare sight that I get called a ""casher"" by people who don't know their way around the game yet and blindly believe you can't get the best stuff without paying. Those are the same people who eventually ditch the game and end up writing ZOMG P2W reviews over here in their bliss ignorance.TL;DR: If you don't mind spending some (reasonable) time working towards your gear, improving it piece by piece, you won't have any problems getting your characters anything you might like, without spending cash. I believe that's one of the things that RPG's are about after all, making your character more powerful as you progress through the game.If you just want to have the best stuff handed to you for free without spending time (or money), well then look for a different game. And good luck with that too.With this out of the way, it's time for some pros and cons.Pros-as mentioned, a solid free2play model that doesn't require you to spend money at all-six classes, each of which can be built and played in a number of ways, offering a completely different experience-I want to say enjoyable and entertaining gameplay and combat system, but that's highly subjective, so you best see for yourself.-a lot of lore if that's your thing-very good visuals-there are new short-term events coming up every few weks, usually in the form or a time-limited skirmish event (for instance ""Call to Arms: Defend the temple"" is active right now), or a chance of valuable event items dropping form any mobs you kill for a couple of days-there are also neat seasonal events that last about a month, like summer festival and winter festival, with a lot of stuff to do for fun or decent rewards-new content being constantly added, altho the rate of large content updates (so called ""modules"") is a tad low.-a large scale of gear and transmutation items that, along with dyes and dye packs, let you give your character a unique lookCons-endgame content is still slightly lacking, especially in the PvP department. However, it's being worked on, there's been a rather large PvP update two weeks back and even more stuff is on the way in the incoming module 3.-ever since the shards merged, the game tends to be a bit laggy from time to time. just for the record, the server is located in the US and live in Europe.A few notes:-noticed some people complaining about bots. I haven't seen a single bot in lvl 60 PvP in months. The only bots I ever see are the ones spamming zone chat with website links, and those you get used to easily. I basically don't even perceive them anymore.-I have minimal experience with DnD, so I can't comment on the game in that regard.			"

												It's a bit grindy, but it's free.  Combat is fast paced, and the decisions you make when leveling matter.  If you plan on playing end-game, expect a lot of grinds.  You can skip some by saving some AD for when you hit max level, but the grind will still be there.pros: Free, fun (especially with friends), classes distinction/differences, fast paced/action combatcons: grindy, LFG tool is garbage, One class is often OP (rotates with patches)			"

												Excellent gameplay and decent graphics, PvE can be a grind but party up with a friend and its fun as can be. The endgame was decent but it did feel like a lot of quest grinding but there were still dungeons, skirmishes, raids etc to spice up said grind. I hear that its a pay to win but i have to say that i disagree, you can run with stuff that you find in the campaigns and wind up decimating in PvP, there are only a few things that you can pay for to buff your toons and some of them you can get in-game with luck and a lot of patience. As you can see from my hours played, i've dedicated a lot of my time to this game but its not something that you HAAAVEEE to play all day everyday but once you get into it, its hard to stop. I definately reccomend this and aye if u wanna play with me, i just started a couple new toons on my @juiip account so add me			"

												9/10 im an entirely free to play person. i have not paid a dime in this game simply because i cannot afford it. this game has alot less grinding and farming aspects to than most rpgs i have played (i.e. star wars the old republic, world of warcraft, and fath of exile, with a hint of diablo). most people say that neverwinter is a ""pay to win game"". i respectfully disagree, the only issues that i have ever encountered in neverwinter are that; the massive amount of clans (both hardcore and casual alike) but that comes with the mmo terratory. i dont like how much the game does like for u to buy things like astral diamonds but hey give it time and ull get enough without paying. so to people who think this is pay to win, play star wars the old republic without paying and max out a character (trust me its a pain) in short in comparison to other games that i have played that are mmos this game by far is both the funnest, freindliest, and longest lasting mmorpg that ive ever had the pleasure of playing. i have high hopes for what future modules hold and what new character concepts that cryptic come up with. now putting all that aside i think if you enjoy mmos this might be one for u! give it a try and remember with mmos the max level is just a stat and the adventure doesnt stop there. in fact it is just the beginning to a whole new adventure!

The 'give us your money' ('so that you can give us more money') Ads are EVERYWHERE. You almost cant complete a quest without the game trying to tempt you into opening your wallet. While I understand the dev team needs revenue, I would much rather a thirty second video ad at start up than the CONSTANT whine and plea for money.			"

												Profoundly flawed due to an overt emphasis on gambling with RL $ via RNG and special items. However, the early user experience is remarkably intuitive, player generated stories/quests are in some cases truly quite fantastic. The game over all does capture the Never Winter setting flavour with an engaging overall ambiance. Attention to detail is quite refreshing with a number of NPC's obviously going about their lives. It's a small touch yet really gives a city or location a life of its own, that the players' characters are simply witness to.At a certain point it does become a level acquisition game complete with Kill x # of [creature], Find x # of [object] etc. It can get a bit tiring and boring if you've seen it all before. Otherwise not a terrible game.			"

The game is not really that great for me i mean i choose the class  ----- Trickster Rogue -----  worst class ever i don't even know why there is a class like this i wanted to role play or feel like a rogue/assassin/ninja squish but massive damage that piles damage quick and is a fast class i was completely WAY WAY WAY WAY off the class is more of the squish looks like a ninja/assassin/rogue that does above average damage with 2 second stealth and is a very slow moving character the TANK class actually moves faster then the rogue class runs faster moves faster damages faster piles faster and isn't squishy the RANGER  class moves faster piles damage faster has aeo effs DOESN'T hit higher but is way way faster when attacking which is stupid because a rogue is suppose to again pile damage fast and hit fast and hit hard which he/she does not.So summary: The game has a good story line, Terrible just aweful can't emphasize this enough design of how the classes are so broken they make no sense TANKS are fast with high def and fast attack, RANGERS fast attack fast movement high def, MAGERS average movement average attack speed  HIGH damage output high def, ROGUE class low def average movement speed a little bit above attack speed a little bit above average damage ouput. This game is designed poorly on classes but incredibly on story. You can't immerse yourself into it it's just not that good			"

												For a MMORPG Neverwinter looks great and sounds good... The combat system is easy to learn and the quests seem good and fun so far. Allmost all npc:s have voice acted dialogues. Graphics are great and very detailed. The world seem alive and full of players. There is a lot of different cool looking monsters and enemys. Your given a lot of different choises to make..You need to choose your race and class carefully..Most of the skill sets/kits give you the opportunity to do some additional exploration, like opening hidden doors and scavenging resources/spotting traps.For the F2P part I havent seen anything you would ""need"" to pay real money for yet. All is seemingly achievable by playing and spending your in game resources.If you are in a hurry I can imagine you need to pay to win.And Im not in a hurry :) Iw been playing Neverwinter with a friend and the need/greed/pass system seems to work just fine. It also seems like some of the loot is shared by all players so we both get to loot the same chests* and so on(*note that not all loot is shared).  I found myself skipping some of the sidequest dialogue because its not allways very good. Sometimes the npc:s are a bit boring and just seem to stare with glass stale eyes (warmly affectionate eye contact;)And I also had some connection issues with the servers from time to time.All together a positive experience so far.If u like MMORPG:s you might really like this too.

I'm tired of waiting for Steam Support and its a load of crap that I need to. My account is djpon3scratch... NOT donieboy20... Quit trying to send me to whoever the ♥♥♥♥ that is and give me my account back. Until then your review from me will be 0/10.			"

												i hate rpg style games and genrally games like this, and have hated this game from time to time. but overall this game is well made, there is alsways something to do in game weather you enjoy fighting against players working together to fight the many challenges. or just sitting in protectors enclave trading and selling like a boss.. tons of stuff to do loads of events, very active devs.. new game content always being deveopled. i started off as a fighter now i just love the atmospere of the game and buying and selling in auction house. seeing all the new mounts and compainions running around is good. i get laughed at from time to time in game becuase im wearing old school gear from 2 years ago that is usless in game, but it looks sick :)come play			"

												Neverwinter is a very interesying game when you first start playing it, but the bad part is when you reach level 60. The quests become repeatable, so you are doing the same thing over and over again making it very boring. The PVP system is very unbalanced after level 60. The only time you are gonna win in a PVP match is if you have the best equipment for your character. This game would be a great one if there were a variety of quests post 60 and a more fair PVP match making system.			"

												The game had me at the character creator. It was so in-depth that I spent nearly two hours designing my character. She was just as complicated as the Skyrim creator could have made, but with more color choices. Unfortunately, after the tutorial, it was clear that this is not a AAA game by any means. The controls are alright, zoom doesn't exist except for glamor shots, the basic townsfolk NPCs walks like scarecrows up stares, the mission voice acting was sub-par even though I was glad it was there. 15 minutes into the first main hub, I knew it wasn't a game I would enjoy playing. Elder Scrolls Online was the last MMO I enjoyed, and I left that one before level 30 because it just didn't do it for me. I'm a hardcore MMO player who is between games right now, so I have a very high standard, but Neverwinter is just not nearly as good as any of the competitor offerings.			"

												This game is fun at first, you run along like any other MMO and grind out levels and when you hit 60 you start to pay for it, literally... In order to win at PVP in this game, you need a pre-organized group and a lot of time and money (real money) to farm AND buy the enchants needed to not get owned by the people who already have them. If you are looking for a time killer, then this game is for you. But if you want something that gives you a sense of accomplishment and doesn’t make you feel like throwing your computer out the window after every PVP match then don’t waste your time on this one. EXTREEM PAY TO WIN…. And did I mention pay to win.			"

												I have to admit, I find this game extremely enjoyable for a casual player that really has no intention of reaching 70 and being the best in the game. Although, and I'm not sure if I'm the only one or not, but I am constantly being disconnected from the servers. It's very annoying! Anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour is all I can get in before I get disconnected and have to login again! Logging in again works instantly everytime, but nothing is more annoying than fighting something to just have your game freeze and take you back to the title screen!

If you go in to it knowing that it is more hack'n'slash you might enjoy it. It has elements from D&D which is cool.... just don't expect the combat to feel anything like D&D's dice based combat. If you want dice rolls go play [if it's still alive...] DDO, Dungeon's and Dragons Online. It's based in Eberron which I'm not a fan of but it's better than nothing.			"

												People class this game as ""Pay to win"", I just don't understand how you can think that. Every item which can be obtained via methods of real currency can also be obtained in the game. Some people think that the PVP is just a battle of ""who has spent the most money on their gear"" and yeah, that's how most games work guys. With your three encounters, two dailys and passives, everyone is very equally matched and the only thing which makes one player stronger from another is the gear. Yes, skill and teamwork do take a part but at the end of the day. Work hard, earn gear, rule Neverwinter, or, Spend real money, buy gear, rule Neverwinter.Either way, this game is a incredible freebie and is well worth a play!			"

												The game is nice, but the Foundry is what shines the most with the ability to play virtual Dungeon Master...  And since you can pretty well customize your social channel tabs, the annoying elements can be silenced efficiently to focus on your game style (even to the point of having the impression of NOT playing just another MMO at all... a blessing for the anti-socially enclined and generic grumpy old dudes just trying to play dungeons & dragons in friggin' peace)... The controls are fairly standard if you've played other games of the genre (Everquest, Diablo & Sacred series) and the learning curve is forgiving enough at the early stages, not so much later-on but that's just spicing it up. Would have preferred a more classical class system but I guess real challenges AD&D died after 2nd edition, when kids were too scared of playing with THAC0 rules and began having thieves throwing magic missiles :P But the game itself is still fun, in video game format.

												Neverwinter is a great MMORPG and you can easily spend hours apon hours on this game.Yes there are some in-game purchases but this game is surely not a pay to win game i mean there are some aspects of what you can buy with real money and just have slighty better equitment then others but wont give you a huge advantage on PvP and especially PvE.There are many ways to dodge these payment methods but would just take a little more longer time, which im sure you have. But i would say it is tottally worth paying for a couple of items in game and it doesn't bug me one bit :)The Items you would probs pay for is a faster Mount, Champion (Follower) and maybe a 10x (bundle/deal) of lockbox keys.Which would probs cost you 25-30$ I highly recommend this game as the gameplay is awesome and there are hours of content in game.I would also recommend is grabbing a couple of friends the level with each other and once you guys reach the max (Level 60) you guys could go on Dungeons, Domonation PvP, Skermishes and Foundry quests (Quests that are made by players them selvs.)Dont just take my word for it and go and give it a try :) Thanks for reading this :DAlso come check out my gaming channel :)http://www.youtube.com/user/turtl3vg "

Posted: August 20, 2014
												First off I need to say I am a huge Dungeons and Dragons fan. I have been since Baldur's gate and the original SSI Goldbox PC games. So, I jumped at the chance to play an MMO of my favorite setting and world. I have not been disappointed at all. If you are hardcore into Faerun lore and enjoy a good D&D themed setting and action MMO combat, then this is the place for you.I've been playing this game nonstop since early June of this year (review written at the end of August). Module 4 has just been released and I am enjoying it a lot. A lot of people say this game is ""pay to win"" and I simply have to say that this is not true. yes, you can buy all the best gear from the in game auction house because most gear is ""bind on use"" instead of ""bind on pickup,"" so if you don't have use for a drop that you win you can sell it on the AH. This, being a free to play game, does have a cash shop, but except for some companions and the more expensive packs (dragonborn pack and hero of the north pack) you cannot buy ""power."" Everything is either cosmetic or utility.One thing I will say is that this game is very solo friendly. Even if you put real money into buying things in this game it is still a grind heavy game. You'll be grinding for weeks (and in some cases months) to get what you want. I personally really enjoy it as it gives me something to always do. The grinds feel involving and fun to me. Each of the different campaigns offers you ways to permanently increase the power of your character over time. The daily areas also have solo dungeons that end in an epic boss fight, so each time you do them it still feels pretty epic, even if you already know what to expect.Leveling in Neverwinter feels more like a typical MMO setup than D&D, but the D&D flavor is still there in everything. The stories are involved and there are several solo dungeons that you'll do in each zone as you're leveling up. These provide an epic single player experience and some of them can be quite challenging (Rime Fang, I'm looking at you). The zones in Neverwinter are somewhat gated and not open world in the slightest. If you've ever played Neverwinter Nights 2 for PC they feel a lot like that. Leveling speed is relatively fast. I was able to reach max level (60) on my first character within 3 weeks. This is an MMO that I will be playing for a very long time. End game group content is a lot of fun and quite challenging. The largest group you'll ever need for anything is 5 people as raiding has not been added to this game yet. However I do have to say one thing bad about this game. DO NOT USE THE IN GAME GROUPFINDER OR LFR CHANNEL TO FIND END GAME GROUPS! The game is unfortunately full of exploiters and gear score elitists that are very very unfriendly towards new players. BUT, there is something you can do! Join the channel /NW_legit_community and form your end game groups in that channel. Sure it might take a while to form a group, but you'll be with the best Neverwinter has to offer. This channel welcomes new players and helps them learn. This channel doesn't care about your gearscore. As long as its high enough to queue for the dungeon that is good enough to get a group in this channel. Its basically the only place outside of my guild that I will form dungeon delves with. The community is entirely player moderated and has been very successful for me. I was lucky that I found that channel shortly after I started playing.My name is Sharastrix@zshikara in game. Please feel free to ask me any questions you may have.			"

												3.5/5 Neverwinter offers a smooth and polished exterior, but lacks the core elements which make a good D&D MMOPros:- Extensive combat system- A lot of classes and character customization- Fun with friends- Great graphics, sound, and overall game qualityCons:- Linear quests- Has nothing to do with D&D- BIG emphasis on Pay-To-Win- Buggy (queue system and incomplete patches)			"

												I was having a decent time at this MMORPG lite.  It was kind of simple and easy to get into.  The missions progressed rather easily and there is a lot of player created content that has passably playable dialogue.  But after I hit about level 35 or so, the difficulty of the mission progression seemed to stop suddenly and required me to start grinding out earlier quests or find parties.There were also a lot of minor issues like the pathing that guides a person around quests, tiny text errors here and there, and occassional problems with major party quests not updating as having been completed.  I could overlook these things but it did seem to lack a lot of polish, although in most respects very functional.Unfortunately this ended one day when after an update the game just failed to launch.  I tried repairing it through the ingame repair system, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and then I even tried a work-around I needed to do for Dota 2 which I had the same problem with once.  None of it worked and I can no longer play this game even though I had wanted to.  I just tried again after a few months and the problem still persists.  Oh well!  It's F2P anyway.			"

												For anyone who has played DDO and liked it you should definitely give Neverwinter a shot, They take the concept of less is more to a new level.  Combat is fast paced, skills are easy too use and understand and the graphics are nearly awe inspiring.  Having trouble finding a quest?  Can't pick your way through city streets?  No sweat turn on the Quest navigation and instead of just showing you which way to go on the minimap, it will also show you an illuminated path to follow in order too get you there.  Only complaint is the same one I have with most MMO's and that is lag in the big cities, however if you've got a burly enough of a machine this not an issue.			"

												To summarize, solid system design, but could be much more expansive.I love the combat system. Rogues especially are as rogues should be- hyperactive glass cannons. I cannot wait for more classes to be released- as it is I think there are not enough to choose from, but they are all well designed. Also, I enjoyed being able to pick my character's background, but it would be very cool if it had some influence on the game. The linearity of the world makes it feel rather small and repetitive, so I think it should be much more open world, and having a much larger world wouldn't hurt either. Player made quests is an exceptional feature too.			"

												Excellent gameplay and decent graphics, PvE can be a grind but party up with a friend and its fun as can be. The endgame was decent but it did feel like a lot of quest grinding but there were still dungeons, skirmishes, raids etc to spice up said grind. I hear that its a pay to win but i have to say that i disagree, you can run with stuff that you find in the campaigns and wind up decimating in PvP, there are only a few things that you can pay for to buff your toons and some of them you can get in-game with luck and a lot of patience. As you can see from my hours played, i've dedicated a lot of my time to this game but its not something that you HAAAVEEE to play all day everyday but once you get into it, its hard to stop. I definately reccomend this and aye if u wanna play with me, i just started a couple new toons on my @juiip account so add me			"

												This company Discriminates against steam players.  They offer rewards to people that use their arc system or their own website despite offering their game on STEAM.  People on steam pay just as much money and shouldn't be discriminated against.  If this company doesn't want people to use steam then don't put the game on steam.  Frankly they should show more appreciation as I personally would have never installed this game if it was not on steam.   I have spent more money than I ever should have but the game was enjoyable until the discrimination became extremely apparent.  Contacting their customer service is a joke, as all they do is respond with something that looks pre-determined.  Even after being ""escalated"" I still got no satisfactory resolution, which I either wanted the promo piece that everyone I know got or a refund of the money I transferred (in came zen that is NOT spent) to get the item.  So far they don't seem to want to help which officially makes these people disloyal to customers who do spend money.  In case someone reads this and thinks I am complaining for no reason, the people that got the reward are people who transferred money into zen and transferred it into neverwinter.  The fact that I use steam shouldn't matter since I have spent 200+ dollars since December on this game and others i'm sure have too and those of us who use steam didn't get it and are being effectively punished for being steam users.  I call for all steam players to boycott this game.  This company only used steam to get more players as no one would hardly be playing otherwise and yet they refuse to extend the same rewards to steam players that they give others.			"

												I've played Tera and the other Dungeons & Dragons MMORPG, but neither of those gets close to Neverwinter imo. The look of the game and the fluent control, make Neverwinter a great experience. It's easy to get used to and I've never ran out of things to do. However, i'm not so far in the game and I wasn't able to go through a dungeon yet, although I did watch some videos about it and it looked just as amazing.Long story short: I recommend the game, because its a well-thought and absolutely playable action MMORPG, with much much content.

												I am never a great fan of the 4th edition mechanics in Dungeons and Dragons but, Neverwinter has managed to convience me that it works as an action RPG in a persistant MMO setting.Neverwinter is strongly based on the Neverwinter lore and it brings together a mixture of traditional fantasy MMORPG gameplay together with fresh tried and tested approach from Star Trek Online and Champions Online.While I am generally never a fan of cash shop economy games like Granado Espada and Maple Story, Cryptic's unique approach of Astral Diamonds economy tries to balance the in game wealth of paid and free players. However, I do question the motive and causality of making Astral Diaminds as the only currency on the exchange as it nullifies the purpose of the exchange in the first place.Another feature borrowed from Cryptic's other games, is the introduction of the Foundary. A virtual space where gamers are provided with tools to create their own adventure for other players to enjoy. There are some benefits for contributing which are determined by other players.This feature is powerful enough to recreate entire Dungeon and Dragon modules written for table top play to exist in Neverwinter.Like Star Trek Online, I am really cautious in approaching this game. At this stage, Neverwinter is likely not to score a lot of points in terms of content and mechanics. But Cryptic has demostrated that through time and positive feedback a game can mature and possibly redeem Dungeons and Drangons in the MMORPG market.			"

												It is enjoyable at the beginning but after a while it start to become very boring. The game-play is enjoyable, but there is only one path you can take, number of leveling areas is not enough especially when you want to begin with a new character. PvP is very fun actuallly, but PvE is boring. After leveling a bit, you realize that you are doing the same things over and over again. The Foundry system, which allows players to create their own quests, is a very good feature of this game. You might find very creative players with funny quests.Appearances of equipment are very alike, when you see a character of your class with a close level to you, your appearance is totally the same.It still is playable, but not recommend to those who tasted many MMORPGs before.

												NOTE:Pls Read about Elemental Evil more down in my Review as i can only recommend the Game until LVL 60!The Game itself is like WoW on many Terms as both are based on DnD Pan and Paper Game.However Neverwinter has (in my Opinion) the actual better Fighting System because it doesnt feel as Stiff as the WoW one because you get Feedback on Crits and the Characters actually do attack faster its hard to explain.On the F2P/P2W Aspect i can say it is like in many other Games.You CAN have everything free if you:1) Have no actual Life and play 16h per day.2)Accept that you will never have the Gear to be good at PVP (but you are gonna be good enough for Raids and Stuff)3)Have Sense for Economy and trade Stuff to make profit (its not really that easy but i read about it but i honestly never tried that.Also you can get the Premium Currency called ""ZEN"" for free as Exchange for  ""Astral Diamonds"".These Astral Diamonds are the Currency for the Ingame Market and Auction House,so basically everything besides the Premium Items.These Diamonds you can aquire by:1)Completing  Daily Quests.2)Trading Items to other Players for Astral Diamonds.3)Buying ZEN with real Money and exchange them for Astral Diamonds (Thats the way to speed up getting actual decent PVP Gear.4) Opening Chests with  Keys you can aquire from Premium Store for a little amount of ZEN(sometimes yields more Astral Diamonds if you sell these Items but its quite a gamble.Having these points said the Game is pretty similar to WoW but i prefer it due to the more responsive fighting System and the PVE Quests are more obvious when it comes to moving from one Area to another(in WoW i actually had to google to which area i had to go next cause there was no followip Quest)Also all the Expansions in Neverwinter are free so if you dont wanna play PVP ever you can enjoy this basically for free.~~~~~~UPDATE on LVL 60+ Content introduced in Elemental Evil Expansion~~~~~Sometime ago there was the Module(Module = Expansion in Neverwinter) 6 introduced to the Game called Elemental Evil.Many Players looked forward to this Expansion,but unfortunately i must say it isnt that good.That is mainly because Cryptic (the Game developer) added new Areas to the Game,which is always a nice thing, but these areas are recycled from the old ones and only contain the typical generic MMORPG Quests.Also to make things slower you have to complete 3 Times 16 Quests for each Area but you can only have 4 Quests at once.And these Quests are very boring so i dont recommend this Stuff.Also the Levelcap was raised with this Module from 60 to 70.Many players expected new Endgame Content to come because of that but Cryptic just recycled the old Areas to Level 70 and every Player has to grind his old Sets again which makes many Players leave the Game and i can honestly understand that.So overall i would give this module  a thumb down but as the game itself to lvl 60 is still very enjoyable i will leave it at that but i cant recommend trying to get through these Quests its not worth the afford.

												what can be said about neverwinter?what does it have that other mmos dont?Ill start this review in retrospect, all truely good mmos Ive played were unpleasant at first, and i diddnt touch them for some time after. when i did pick them back up however, their true beauty shined through and their qualities were made clear.neverwinter is no exception.     in fact, neverwinter is the pinacle of this occurance.I hated it at first because i couldnt run it well. I diddnt understand the economy, and diddnt know how i was going to do endgame because i was new.but the day i picked it up again was the day i became engulfed with love for the game.I have not had as much fun in any other mmo as of yet. I have played terra, runescape, wow rift, path of exile, you name it. neverwinter blows them all awaydespite the bad reviews, despite the ""pay to win"" nature inspite all of the negativeity surrounding this title, It is a true gem.when you start out, you will be on the road to the main town hub, on a newbie's quest if you will,finish that and you will be doing dungeons, pvp, and raids called skurmishes. that is if you do it vanilla only.dip into the foundry, you will be solving murders, exploring drug induced dreams and fighting the power rangers. hell, pick the right one and you can fight cathulu.insanity, hilarity and all out craziness will insue should you pick the game up. you will not have a dull moment and the game is worth at least a look.overall I give the game a 9/10 if for minor gripes with loading and dungeon queue times. other than that, if you overlook it, it is a 10/10. I advise going and picking it up.			"

												It's a fun MMORPG and a great experience to veterans and newcomers of the genre. The strongholds update lets you meet more people, and all in all have a fun time. The problems begin to arise if you play the game casually, and it is definitely notable. I would play he game around 1 hour a day, and eventually made it to level 70. Once you reach that tier, the game becomes immensely boring to those who don't want to spend money, PvP, or trade. Like most MMORPGs, replay value is minute due to more effort being placed into multiplayer gameplay. Altogether, the game has it's audience, I'm not sure if I would fit into it. 6/10.			"

Friendly people, nice fighting action, great graphics, and most importantly, does not require money. I've played a lot of RPG's and this is probably the best one. It does, however, becaome tedious at times. Then again, it is an rpg, so...... But I definitley recommened this game.			"

												I recently decided to give this game a shot, having not played an MMO since Guild Wars 2 shortly after its launch I wasn't going in with incredible expectations. I had heard quite a few complaints about Pay-2-Win trappings as well as balance issues within the game but was willing to go in with an open mind.The character creation was puzzling to say the least, I in part already knew I'd be rolling dice to create a character, but the question is why make the player sit there and reroll dice over and over to get their desired stat rolls when you could just let them choose instead? Rolling for stats makes sense in a in person Pen-N-Paper scenario where you get one shot at them. Otherwise there is absolutely no purpose except to waste the players time or to negatively impact new players who don't understand the mechanics.Then came the intro cinematic, it was jarring to say the least, I understand not every game gives you context in it's beginning cinematic, but this one goes out of its way to avoid any context whatsoever. On top of that the motions (and emotions) of the characters in the cinematic are jarring. I would say this isn't due to poor animation (the animation at the very least seems adequate) but instead seems to be due to a complete misunderstanding of how humanoid creatures interact with the World. Yes, it somehow looks that akward.I was willling to push through despite the previous reservations I had due to friends and reviewers alike giving it negative feedback as well as the poor first impression I had already received from just the intro cinematic and character creation, but then, upon entering the game World I was bombarded with ""Admin notifications"" that flooded both my chat log and also popped up on the very middle of my character screen. What were these messages you may ask? They surely must be important for them to be so jarring as to completely remove me from experiencing the game and trying to gather my bearings, right? No, in fact, they weren't. They were messages spammed to me by the ""Admin"" about people opening locked boxes/chests and receiving ""rare"" items. These messages are not only on by default, but they cannot be turned off or disabled in any shape or form. Both the jarring text that pops up and completely breaks all immersion as well as the spam in your chat log. You can't even make a separate chat log for just specific forms of chat (Guild, Party, etc) that won't be spammed by this as it is on permanently in all chat logs you create.That's pretty bad, right? But they have to make a buck, right? Well, certainly, Okay, so then, if I spend money on some sort of subscription, open a few boxes or buy some sort of premium one time membership then you can disable these messages, right? No, you still can't. This, my friends, is how you do free to play wrong, the Pay-2-Win is strong enough in the game already, but then for them to shove unremovable messages all over your screen that are there whether you support them or not? This prompted me to immediately close the game and uninstall every shred of it I could find on my system. I wasted two hours downloading the game, registering an account and patching it, but hopefully I saved someone else some time and frustration. If you value immersion, fair F2P games, intuitive character creation and story I can tell you from the very brief time I spent with the game you will get none or very shoddy versions of all of these. For context, I didn't get into a single battle before I ended up uninstalling the game, but I had over 20 messages about ""Player XXX getting the Everlasting Hydra Mount of Smiting"" flood my screen in that time.

												I play it for fun at first cause i had nothing to do, but after a while i realize all the f***n stuff like your armor enhancement weapon etc. is the same for almost the rest of the game ( the stat just increse a little). The worst thing is mounts and companions you get without using astral diaamond or zen sucks.REALLY SUCKS. Although many reviewers say that pvp in these game is unfair because some 'genius' would use 100+ of dollars just to get an op class to win you. BUT i am proud to say that i (most of the time) got the highest kill in pvp and I DO IT WITHOUT EVEN GIVING THEN A PENNY. whereas some s****y player that pays still get their  ***  kick. In my region most guys havent even hard of d&d but i love it since i was a school kid ( i heard it from my cousin hat its cool) and i have been playing with its board games and baldurs gate , but really man this is not even close to d&d.The only fun thing new players will enjoy is the story which actually isnt that interesting and the gameplay , the graphic aint bad either :).  The game is also very simple if you play any rpg or mmorpg before this will be easy.There is also the quest made by players themselves call the skirmishes which some of them is quite fun :))). you can get lots of astral diamond if you complete this daily skirmishes quest.( which is really ESSENTIAL in this game if you like cosmetic and good looking mounts ).The things that ruin this potential game is the so call f2p tag that turns it into a p2w game. If you still want to play it , alittle advice dont bother about the pvp unless your a millionare. :)			"

												It is enjoyable at the beginning but after a while it start to become very boring. The game-play is enjoyable, but there is only one path you can take, number of leveling areas is not enough especially when you want to begin with a new character. PvP is very fun actuallly, but PvE is boring. After leveling a bit, you realize that you are doing the same things over and over again. The Foundry system, which allows players to create their own quests, is a very good feature of this game. You might find very creative players with funny quests.Appearances of equipment are very alike, when you see a character of your class with a close level to you, your appearance is totally the same.It still is playable, but not recommend to those who tasted many MMORPGs before.

												This game has to be one of the best MMORPG games I have ever played, this game unlike all the basic click and go games, you use arrow keys and attack using your mouse rather then auto attacks and such, and the skill system forces you to choose wisely so nom ore button spamming PvP!			"

												I have a love for DnD games. I really have given this game a fair play. Over 400 hours of gameplay on the clock. Which I spent in part with guild mates, friends, and by myself.The game boasts great combat and exciting DnD stuffs to tingle your taste buds. For long time fans and newcomers alike.Each class feels unique and has its own challenges and paths to grow upon. Making you feel more epic with each ability you gain or master. The game is quick to award your heroic deeds with exciting loot and treasure, making it a fast to ""grind"" and a fun time with friends or guild mates. The graphics do look quite good for a F2P, and you never have to be stuck with one setting for a long period of time.There are so many great looking locations to feast your eyes on. Also a wonderful array of foes to slay! There is a great amount of fan service from the depths of the dungeons and beyond.There is also a wonderful custom map/ adventure maker! Allowing player generated content like I’ve never seen before in a MMO! You can take on the collective imagination of DnD fans from generations old and new. An outstanding feature and worthy of a look.But this game has a horrible underbelly, a dark one. I regret to inform you that it is rotten to its core as a social experience.It has fallen to the same fate of many F2P games. In the most typical and harmful ways.Complete with gold buying/selling, spam from bots, power hungry players with no social graces, and a terrible micro transaction system that hungers for your cash long after you have fed it. Boasting “sales” and “bonus packages”. Some of which are cringe worthy.  I have listed some of these grievances below. If you want to skip down to my final thoughts please do.There is a serious problem with the power balance due to an inflated economy system and broken auction house feature. Making it difficult to match your peers in PVP, gain knowledge in-game of items and their uses, and keep current in dungeon runs without the help of the richest guilds or deepest wallet. Crafting in the Neverwinter also costs you laughable wait times and pitiful returns. The pay components costing too much and the in game alternative being ""buying gold"" for powerful gems and enchantments. Leaving a huge gap between the player base.The micro transaction system has a list of sins which can go on for miles. For starters, you have to spend increments of money for a simple purchase, locking you into owning in game money and pitching it for items. You have to pay separate fees for every aspect of this game. Most of which is per-character. From expanding your bank/ inventory per character. To buying keys for random chance pots. My favorite being the respect token for changing your character abilities/ feats. It must be purchased every time you want to change your character’s play style. It is not unlocked, but purchased every time for any given character. Playing this game for free is very possible. But a long term investment in the Neverwinter can cost you the price 2-6 new titles or pay-to-play services with far better customer service.And formost..The game has attracted the typical internet fare, meaning you will spend more then enough social time blocking or muting your fellow gamers to get some peace from trash talk.  The community at large doesn’t respect itself, and you will be hard pressed to not to run into these types on a daily basis. Please, avoid this game if you are looking for a un-invasive F2P social game.  There are a few people making this game worth playing society wise. For every few guilds making the game open and fun for anyone. There are dozens of hateful players waiting for you.If this game was sub-based, or a standalone title, I would suggest to everyone I know!As a F2P. It’s a good thing gone sour.			"

												Excellent gameplay and decent graphics, PvE can be a grind but party up with a friend and its fun as can be. The endgame was decent but it did feel like a lot of quest grinding but there were still dungeons, skirmishes, raids etc to spice up said grind. I hear that its a pay to win but i have to say that i disagree, you can run with stuff that you find in the campaigns and wind up decimating in PvP, there are only a few things that you can pay for to buff your toons and some of them you can get in-game with luck and a lot of patience. As you can see from my hours played, i've dedicated a lot of my time to this game but its not something that you HAAAVEEE to play all day everyday but once you get into it, its hard to stop. I definately reccomend this and aye if u wanna play with me, i just started a couple new toons on my @juiip account so add me			"

												Profoundly flawed due to an overt emphasis on gambling with RL $ via RNG and special items. However, the early user experience is remarkably intuitive, player generated stories/quests are in some cases truly quite fantastic. The game over all does capture the Never Winter setting flavour with an engaging overall ambiance. Attention to detail is quite refreshing with a number of NPC's obviously going about their lives. It's a small touch yet really gives a city or location a life of its own, that the players' characters are simply witness to.At a certain point it does become a level acquisition game complete with Kill x # of [creature], Find x # of [object] etc. It can get a bit tiring and boring if you've seen it all before. Otherwise not a terrible game.			"

												I was having a decent time at this MMORPG lite.  It was kind of simple and easy to get into.  The missions progressed rather easily and there is a lot of player created content that has passably playable dialogue.  But after I hit about level 35 or so, the difficulty of the mission progression seemed to stop suddenly and required me to start grinding out earlier quests or find parties.There were also a lot of minor issues like the pathing that guides a person around quests, tiny text errors here and there, and occassional problems with major party quests not updating as having been completed.  I could overlook these things but it did seem to lack a lot of polish, although in most respects very functional.Unfortunately this ended one day when after an update the game just failed to launch.  I tried repairing it through the ingame repair system, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and then I even tried a work-around I needed to do for Dota 2 which I had the same problem with once.  None of it worked and I can no longer play this game even though I had wanted to.  I just tried again after a few months and the problem still persists.  Oh well!  It's F2P anyway.			"

												For anyone who has played DDO and liked it you should definitely give Neverwinter a shot, They take the concept of less is more to a new level.  Combat is fast paced, skills are easy too use and understand and the graphics are nearly awe inspiring.  Having trouble finding a quest?  Can't pick your way through city streets?  No sweat turn on the Quest navigation and instead of just showing you which way to go on the minimap, it will also show you an illuminated path to follow in order too get you there.  Only complaint is the same one I have with most MMO's and that is lag in the big cities, however if you've got a burly enough of a machine this not an issue.			"

												To summarize, solid system design, but could be much more expansive.I love the combat system. Rogues especially are as rogues should be- hyperactive glass cannons. I cannot wait for more classes to be released- as it is I think there are not enough to choose from, but they are all well designed. Also, I enjoyed being able to pick my character's background, but it would be very cool if it had some influence on the game. The linearity of the world makes it feel rather small and repetitive, so I think it should be much more open world, and having a much larger world wouldn't hurt either. Player made quests is an exceptional feature too.			"

												Its a fun run of the mill mmo, slash'em up game. If your a hardcore D&D fan then im sure you'll find lots to hate, considering lore, and gameplay. Otherwise its a HUGE pay-to-play. The gold you get ( wich has the copper, silver, gold system) will only buy you the low level items, and some potions. The astral diamonds are used to buy better items, decent mounts, and deccent companions, but can only be gained through special task, such as daily missions. These are pains to do and in the end its usually not worth the work. The zen, a.k.a. the money you but with real money, is used to get the advantage while going anything. That means buying good items, good mounts, and good companions. All of these things being pretty important. Its such a pay to play, that all of the steam DLC's cost $450. Yep, thats right, 450 frickin dollars. Besides that, the combat is fun, and the game has some nice graphics, but there is the issue of everything else.4.5/10			"

												Neverwinter is a great MMORPG and you can easily spend hours apon hours on this game.Yes there are some in-game purchases but this game is surely not a pay to win game i mean there are some aspects of what you can buy with real money and just have slighty better equitment then others but wont give you a huge advantage on PvP and especially PvE.There are many ways to dodge these payment methods but would just take a little more longer time, which im sure you have. But i would say it is tottally worth paying for a couple of items in game and it doesn't bug me one bit :)The Items you would probs pay for is a faster Mount, Champion (Follower) and maybe a 10x (bundle/deal) of lockbox keys.Which would probs cost you 25-30$ I highly recommend this game as the gameplay is awesome and there are hours of content in game.I would also recommend is grabbing a couple of friends the level with each other and once you guys reach the max (Level 60) you guys could go on Dungeons, Domonation PvP, Skermishes and Foundry quests (Quests that are made by players them selvs.)Dont just take my word for it and go and give it a try :) Thanks for reading this :DAlso come check out my gaming channel :)http://www.youtube.com/user/turtl3vg "

												People class this game as ""Pay to win"", I just don't understand how you can think that. Every item which can be obtained via methods of real currency can also be obtained in the game. Some people think that the PVP is just a battle of ""who has spent the most money on their gear"" and yeah, that's how most games work guys. With your three encounters, two dailys and passives, everyone is very equally matched and the only thing which makes one player stronger from another is the gear. Yes, skill and teamwork do take a part but at the end of the day. Work hard, earn gear, rule Neverwinter, or, Spend real money, buy gear, rule Neverwinter.Either way, this game is a incredible freebie and is well worth a play!			"

												The game is nice, but the Foundry is what shines the most with the ability to play virtual Dungeon Master...  And since you can pretty well customize your social channel tabs, the annoying elements can be silenced efficiently to focus on your game style (even to the point of having the impression of NOT playing just another MMO at all... a blessing for the anti-socially enclined and generic grumpy old dudes just trying to play dungeons & dragons in friggin' peace)... The controls are fairly standard if you've played other games of the genre (Everquest, Diablo & Sacred series) and the learning curve is forgiving enough at the early stages, not so much later-on but that's just spicing it up. Would have preferred a more classical class system but I guess real challenges AD&D died after 2nd edition, when kids were too scared of playing with THAC0 rules and began having thieves throwing magic missiles :P But the game itself is still fun, in video game format.

												First off I need to say I am a huge Dungeons and Dragons fan. I have been since Baldur's gate and the original SSI Goldbox PC games. So, I jumped at the chance to play an MMO of my favorite setting and world. I have not been disappointed at all. If you are hardcore into Faerun lore and enjoy a good D&D themed setting and action MMO combat, then this is the place for you.I've been playing this game nonstop since early June of this year (review written at the end of August). Module 4 has just been released and I am enjoying it a lot. A lot of people say this game is ""pay to win"" and I simply have to say that this is not true. yes, you can buy all the best gear from the in game auction house because most gear is ""bind on use"" instead of ""bind on pickup,"" so if you don't have use for a drop that you win you can sell it on the AH. This, being a free to play game, does have a cash shop, but except for some companions and the more expensive packs (dragonborn pack and hero of the north pack) you cannot buy ""power."" Everything is either cosmetic or utility.One thing I will say is that this game is very solo friendly. Even if you put real money into buying things in this game it is still a grind heavy game. You'll be grinding for weeks (and in some cases months) to get what you want. I personally really enjoy it as it gives me something to always do. The grinds feel involving and fun to me. Each of the different campaigns offers you ways to permanently increase the power of your character over time. The daily areas also have solo dungeons that end in an epic boss fight, so each time you do them it still feels pretty epic, even if you already know what to expect.Leveling in Neverwinter feels more like a typical MMO setup than D&D, but the D&D flavor is still there in everything. The stories are involved and there are several solo dungeons that you'll do in each zone as you're leveling up. These provide an epic single player experience and some of them can be quite challenging (Rime Fang, I'm looking at you). The zones in Neverwinter are somewhat gated and not open world in the slightest. If you've ever played Neverwinter Nights 2 for PC they feel a lot like that. Leveling speed is relatively fast. I was able to reach max level (60) on my first character within 3 weeks. This is an MMO that I will be playing for a very long time. End game group content is a lot of fun and quite challenging. The largest group you'll ever need for anything is 5 people as raiding has not been added to this game yet. However I do have to say one thing bad about this game. DO NOT USE THE IN GAME GROUPFINDER OR LFR CHANNEL TO FIND END GAME GROUPS! The game is unfortunately full of exploiters and gear score elitists that are very very unfriendly towards new players. BUT, there is something you can do! Join the channel /NW_legit_community and form your end game groups in that channel. Sure it might take a while to form a group, but you'll be with the best Neverwinter has to offer. This channel welcomes new players and helps them learn. This channel doesn't care about your gearscore. As long as its high enough to queue for the dungeon that is good enough to get a group in this channel. Its basically the only place outside of my guild that I will form dungeon delves with. The community is entirely player moderated and has been very successful for me. I was lucky that I found that channel shortly after I started playing.My name is Sharastrix@zshikara in game. Please feel free to ask me any questions you may have.			"

												Neverwinter is just like every other MMORPG released. It's amazing how this genre has not seen any innovations for years, but the games keep attracting players by simply changing up the attacks, character models and dialogue.Walk, walk, talk to NPC, go fetch stuff, walk, walk, talk to NPC, go kill stuff, walk, walk.So boring. Cut your losses if you've used real money in the in-game store. This is a time and money sink where players don't actually have fun and there is no reward or sense of accomplishment.			"

												Great game that runs great on Low-End computers on lower-mid level settings. I'm using an HP laptop (i3 processor, 4gb ram, intel HD 4000). I've already logged about 20 hours on this game. Highly recommend it for the awesome combat in the game. Way more immersive combat than WoW.			"

												It's a good FTP game, were you can get pretty far without paying for anything, but if you are looking to be competitive and want to be a survivor in raids it's going to take hours and hours of farming... If you don't want to take weeks or even months grinding away on quests and raids, you're going to have to buy one of the RETICULESLY overpriced DLCs.All in all, it's a VERY well designed game. Fun to play, with endless re-play potential.			"

												The game had me at the character creator. It was so in-depth that I spent nearly two hours designing my character. She was just as complicated as the Skyrim creator could have made, but with more color choices. Unfortunately, after the tutorial, it was clear that this is not a AAA game by any means. The controls are alright, zoom doesn't exist except for glamor shots, the basic townsfolk NPCs walks like scarecrows up stares, the mission voice acting was sub-par even though I was glad it was there. 15 minutes into the first main hub, I knew it wasn't a game I would enjoy playing. Elder Scrolls Online was the last MMO I enjoyed, and I left that one before level 30 because it just didn't do it for me. I'm a hardcore MMO player who is between games right now, so I have a very high standard, but Neverwinter is just not nearly as good as any of the competitor offerings.			"

												Played on arc downloader not steam downloader steam downloader was giving me problems of not downloading all the files.Updates---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(this has not been updated to the new module 4 nerf the game is a lot more even now but i'm to lazy to completely edit review.)(module 5 fixed a lot of awesome stuff, games good but it get repetitive and really no good end game goal, still fun game tho still to lazy just try the game i guess if u want)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I know it says do not recommend BUT this game has an incredible story line its really good its a decent game EXCEPT the game is all about which class you pick it's not how long you spend playing the game it's not exactly pay to win but paying can give you a big big boost giving you a big advantage against other players definetly BIG advantage. The game is not really that great for me i mean i choose the class  ----- Trickster Rogue -----  worst class ever i don't even know why there is a class like this i wanted to role play or feel like a rogue/assassin/ninja squish but massive damage that piles damage quick and is a fast class i was completely WAY WAY WAY WAY off the class is more of the squish looks like a ninja/assassin/rogue that does above average damage with 2 second stealth and is a very slow moving character the TANK class actually moves faster then the rogue class runs faster moves faster damages faster piles faster and isn't squishy the RANGER  class moves faster piles damage faster has aeo effs DOESN'T hit higher but is way way faster when attacking which is stupid because a rogue is suppose to again pile damage fast and hit fast and hit hard which he/she does not.So summary: The game has a good story line, Terrible just aweful can't emphasize this enough design of how the classes are so broken they make no sense TANKS are fast with high def and fast attack, RANGERS fast attack fast movement high def, MAGERS average movement average attack speed  HIGH damage output high def, ROGUE class low def average movement speed a little bit above attack speed a little bit above average damage ouput. This game is designed poorly on classes but incredibly on story. You can't immerse yourself into it it's just not that good			"

												I recently decided to give this game a shot, having not played an MMO since Guild Wars 2 shortly after its launch I wasn't going in with incredible expectations. I had heard quite a few complaints about Pay-2-Win trappings as well as balance issues within the game but was willing to go in with an open mind.The character creation was puzzling to say the least, I in part already knew I'd be rolling dice to create a character, but the question is why make the player sit there and reroll dice over and over to get their desired stat rolls when you could just let them choose instead? Rolling for stats makes sense in a in person Pen-N-Paper scenario where you get one shot at them. Otherwise there is absolutely no purpose except to waste the players time or to negatively impact new players who don't understand the mechanics.Then came the intro cinematic, it was jarring to say the least, I understand not every game gives you context in it's beginning cinematic, but this one goes out of its way to avoid any context whatsoever. On top of that the motions (and emotions) of the characters in the cinematic are jarring. I would say this isn't due to poor animation (the animation at the very least seems adequate) but instead seems to be due to a complete misunderstanding of how humanoid creatures interact with the World. Yes, it somehow looks that akward.I was willling to push through despite the previous reservations I had due to friends and reviewers alike giving it negative feedback as well as the poor first impression I had already received from just the intro cinematic and character creation, but then, upon entering the game World I was bombarded with ""Admin notifications"" that flooded both my chat log and also popped up on the very middle of my character screen. What were these messages you may ask? They surely must be important for them to be so jarring as to completely remove me from experiencing the game and trying to gather my bearings, right? No, in fact, they weren't. They were messages spammed to me by the ""Admin"" about people opening locked boxes/chests and receiving ""rare"" items. These messages are not only on by default, but they cannot be turned off or disabled in any shape or form. Both the jarring text that pops up and completely breaks all immersion as well as the spam in your chat log. You can't even make a separate chat log for just specific forms of chat (Guild, Party, etc) that won't be spammed by this as it is on permanently in all chat logs you create.That's pretty bad, right? But they have to make a buck, right? Well, certainly, Okay, so then, if I spend money on some sort of subscription, open a few boxes or buy some sort of premium one time membership then you can disable these messages, right? No, you still can't. This, my friends, is how you do free to play wrong, the Pay-2-Win is strong enough in the game already, but then for them to shove unremovable messages all over your screen that are there whether you support them or not? This prompted me to immediately close the game and uninstall every shred of it I could find on my system. I wasted two hours downloading the game, registering an account and patching it, but hopefully I saved someone else some time and frustration. If you value immersion, fair F2P games, intuitive character creation and story I can tell you from the very brief time I spent with the game you will get none or very shoddy versions of all of these. For context, I didn't get into a single battle before I ended up uninstalling the game, but I had over 20 messages about ""Player XXX getting the Everlasting Hydra Mount of Smiting"" flood my screen in that time.

												While I am often put off by free-to-play mmo games, this one struck me with one tle that I knew all too well. Dungeons and Dragons! This instantly brought me into the game, and cuased me to play it. While it may be just another mmo, it has the best combat systemin ANY MMO I'VE EVER SEEN. When you cast a spell upon an enemy, it actually feels like it. Unlike oer mmo's such as WoW or RIFT in which yout spam 1 consecutively with 2 or 3, this game actually has you use your mouse and q,e,r ablilities. While you may only be able to use 3 or 4 abilities because of this, it dosn't deny that this is the BET of mmo combat. While I didn't find the story or atmosphere entertaining, I found something that I couldn't find in other mmo's. The feeling as if I was actually fighting a wizard or a skeleton or what ever I had to fight. I was immersed in the world by the usage of their awesome combat system. It's not perfect, but I enjoyed it a hell of a lot more than WoW or RIFT. 8/10			"

												Free to play MMO's tend to not work, which is common knowledge (aside from Guild Wars) and you could say I'm severely surprised and blown by how good Neverwinter actually is. I don't feel myself grinding as much as I would in other MMO's and if there is some grinding involved it doesn't feel like a chore, and the leveling up doesn't feel too slow. I've only played the game for one day and I'm already at Level 20 and still not bored of the game unlike SWTOR, and WoW which made me bored at around the 20 mark.It's also been a blast to play with friends, and the fact it has a lot in terms of character customization and backstory is one of the things that hooks me the most into it. These characters really feel like your own and that's awesome. It's free to play so you have no worry about wasting money on the game, which is totally optinal with buying gear, mounts, and special perks.I really want to buy that Dragonborn race though...			"

If you go in to it knowing that it is more hack'n'slash you might enjoy it. It has elements from D&D which is cool.... just don't expect the combat to feel anything like D&D's dice based combat. If you want dice rolls go play [if it's still alive...] DDO, Dungeon's and Dragons Online. It's based in Eberron which I'm not a fan of but it's better than nothing.			"

Don't call it a Dungeons & Dragons game if there is nothing D&D about it, other than setting up your character and dice rolls. That's it. It's another Runescape game, which was also really stupid. Also, I want a damn horse and I couldn't get that because the stupid quests they give didn't pay enough. Speaking of quests, those were dumb. Don't waste your time and memory for this game.

												Definatly a fun game, not just button mashing and dungeons that you can play with groups can be challenging sometimes. The typical missions are very easy and PVP is ok. After you complete the main game the game does become very repetitive and quite boring but the main campaign/story line is definatly worth playing and you will reach the max level cap (60) before you complete the game. Maps switch from huge to quite small but there are usally caves and dungeons to explore as well and you always run into other players even when completing the campaign. Takes about 60 hours to complete the main storyline and side quests to this game, after that you can do retitive quests and ""campaigns"" to get legendary armor for your character which can be quite boring but if you really like the game i guess you would still find it fun completing the same mission or killing the same dragon over and over and over and over and over for 1 item.

												NOTE:Pls Read about Elemental Evil more down in my Review as i can only recommend the Game until LVL 60!The Game itself is like WoW on many Terms as both are based on DnD Pan and Paper Game.However Neverwinter has (in my Opinion) the actual better Fighting System because it doesnt feel as Stiff as the WoW one because you get Feedback on Crits and the Characters actually do attack faster its hard to explain.On the F2P/P2W Aspect i can say it is like in many other Games.You CAN have everything free if you:1) Have no actual Life and play 16h per day.2)Accept that you will never have the Gear to be good at PVP (but you are gonna be good enough for Raids and Stuff)3)Have Sense for Economy and trade Stuff to make profit (its not really that easy but i read about it but i honestly never tried that.Also you can get the Premium Currency called ""ZEN"" for free as Exchange for  ""Astral Diamonds"".These Astral Diamonds are the Currency for the Ingame Market and Auction House,so basically everything besides the Premium Items.These Diamonds you can aquire by:1)Completing  Daily Quests.2)Trading Items to other Players for Astral Diamonds.3)Buying ZEN with real Money and exchange them for Astral Diamonds (Thats the way to speed up getting actual decent PVP Gear.4) Opening Chests with  Keys you can aquire from Premium Store for a little amount of ZEN(sometimes yields more Astral Diamonds if you sell these Items but its quite a gamble.Having these points said the Game is pretty similar to WoW but i prefer it due to the more responsive fighting System and the PVE Quests are more obvious when it comes to moving from one Area to another(in WoW i actually had to google to which area i had to go next cause there was no followip Quest)Also all the Expansions in Neverwinter are free so if you dont wanna play PVP ever you can enjoy this basically for free.~~~~~~UPDATE on LVL 60+ Content introduced in Elemental Evil Expansion~~~~~Sometime ago there was the Module(Module = Expansion in Neverwinter) 6 introduced to the Game called Elemental Evil.Many Players looked forward to this Expansion,but unfortunately i must say it isnt that good.That is mainly because Cryptic (the Game developer) added new Areas to the Game,which is always a nice thing, but these areas are recycled from the old ones and only contain the typical generic MMORPG Quests.Also to make things slower you have to complete 3 Times 16 Quests for each Area but you can only have 4 Quests at once.And these Quests are very boring so i dont recommend this Stuff.Also the Levelcap was raised with this Module from 60 to 70.Many players expected new Endgame Content to come because of that but Cryptic just recycled the old Areas to Level 70 and every Player has to grind his old Sets again which makes many Players leave the Game and i can honestly understand that.So overall i would give this module  a thumb down but as the game itself to lvl 60 is still very enjoyable i will leave it at that but i cant recommend trying to get through these Quests its not worth the afford.

												Neverwinter is like free copy of WoW with stats of Pathfinder. Levels are almost the same. Bosses are stronger strong mobs (except the final ones) but its fun to play. I like to play player-maded campaigns and like the companion and spell system. I'm currently playing Warlock and i hate that i have no AoE spells except the 3rd basic attack. If you have lot of freetime and dont want to pay for WoW this is the best thing you can do.			"

												As a player of the widely acclaimed Neverwinter Nights years before, I was excited when Wizards of the Coast finally brought the franchise into an MMO-Style game. Not as large as your big World of Warcraft or RIFT type games, player-base wise. The feel of the world/environment reminds me of something like Game of Thrones.If you're really technical, you can design your own dungeons and quests for players to battle creatures in.Fap/10.			"

												I've retaken this game after a short experience in single player to try it in multyplayer. Besides the game mechanics, that I judge innovative and different from the usual MMO system, this game manages to give a clear presentation of the forgotten realms to those who still don't know them, with lore items, character's personalization and short but good dialogues. So, if you want a ""all leveling and raidin"" experience, this is still a good option but I'll suggest other wow copies. If you want to discover or, like me, meet again the Forgotten Realms and enjoy the D&D style, go ahead and try itPS: really light requirements, very accessible			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.Eat.			"

												Good game for people who like the locked on attacks and almost no dodge mechanic. Has a good story but it is wanting for some important quests instead of many mini quests. game can get boring because of the time it takes to level up when you get above lvl 25. PVP is ok but is super boring (fighting normal enemies makes my adrenaline pump mor than PVP.) all the classes seem to be balanced but in pvp the Ranger plays hide and go seek. This game is fun for those who like a bit of grind and large 13 v 1 boss battles.  TOTALY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!			"

At level 60 PvP is incredibly unbalanced, queues for dungeons take hours, pretty much any gear you will need can be purchased with Astral Diamonds, which you can buy Zen to exchange for ridiculous amounts of Astral Diamonds. TL:DR Wonderful first playthrough, terrible end game, pretty much P2W			"

												Being a Dungeon Master (Game Master for Dungeons&Dragons) has really influenced my vote as to whether this game is good or not. If you are not familiar with Dungeons&Dragons and the concepts related to it than this game may not be as enjoyable for you. This game is set in the world of the Forgotten Realms, bringing back memories of Baldur's Gate, The Legend of Dritz, and so on. There is a lot to like if you are into D&D, so if you are into D&D than this game is a must. Everything is lore/story driven, so those who like it that way will be pleased indeed. Anyway, onward to the pros and cons.Pros-Graphics, they look just plain awesome. Although graphically it is on par with many of the other popular MMOs out there, again, if you like D&D than you can really appreciate how the game looks and feels. It feels like it would look if a Dungeon Master described it, anyway, moving on.Customization, basically unlimited character customization. Although you are limited into choosing one class, you can literally develop your character however you see fit. In terms of character creation, you can literally create your character to look like anything, almost all of the player characters are entirely unique from each other.Combat, although the combat is somewhat like any other MMO, if you are a D&D player than you will really enjoy the combat. With skills straight from the tabletop RPG, it really puts on the ""This is a D&D"" seal on the game. Lots of skills to, more than you can possibly keep track of and use.ADVENTURE CREATION! There is a system that allows you to create and post your own custom adventures/quests into the game for others to enjoy. For a Dungeon Master, this is a HUGE positive trait that I will always love about this game. With nearly unlimited potential, you can create whatever you want, literally! My current project using the system is to recreate an adventure that I had with my real D&D group, but in the Neverwinter game. I would have given this game a positive review just for it even if the game was horrible.Cons-Unoriginal, the game itself feels like any other MMO to be honest, although there are some very defining points that set it apart. The combat, controls, and quests just feel like your typical MMO, lacking in variety. But the overall presentation of these quests are actually really good, lots of good story elements and lore.Pay To Win, I would say this is a more or less kind of thing. Although if you play the game a lot and get by without paying, the game itself wants you to spend your money on it. Whether it be cool costumes or mounts or anything else, if you want a really cool character be ready to pay. At higher levels this isn't really a problem, but early on you will be targeted and prompted to buy things.Conclusion-The game itself is very good, and a must for any D&D player. I highly recommend the adventure creation aspect of the game for any Dungeon Master, there is a lot of potential in something like this. Lots of great story/lore, plus untold stories created by players like ourselves! Anyway, that is all for now, hope this helped!May your adventures be many and always end in reward!-Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League			"

												Anyone who's saying this game is completely pay-to-win is a complete dumbass. You only pay to proceed faster in the game and it's a common aspect of all MMORPGs nowadays. PVP here sucks (in a way) so there's no point rushing for PVP items. On the PVE side, the loots from dungeon raids are relatively generous so reaching 2.4K gear score can be done in less than 3 days after reaching level cap ---- oh btw, reaching level cap (lv70) is a breeze even without exp boost from guild boons, VIP or whatever source. Another important factor to consider is that this game is highly skill-based. Getting the top-line equipments won't save you if you're a stupid player. There's more to say but I guess this is enough to prove my point.Come on guys, be fair and give it a shot first before constantly whining about everything. Been playing MMOs since Ragnarok Online (around year 2000-ish) and definitely I couldn't say Neverwinter is the best but hey, it's better than most games out there right now. If you ask my rating on this game, I'd honestly say only 7.5-8/10. Still needs a lot of work but since I'm hooked, it's definitely good. PS: THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT ""MMO PLAYERS"" NOWADAYS WANT INSTANT GRATIFICATION AND IF THEY CAN'T GET THAT WITHIN FEW WEEKS OF PLAYING, THEY'D IMMEDIATELY BRAND A GAME AS P2W. SUCH STUPIDITY. DON'T PLAY MMOs WITH THAT KIND OF ATTITUDE AND PLAY BARBIE INSTEAD .. SHEESH. GTFO			"

												     While Neverwinter leaves a bad taste in some folks mouths, I found it be fun, fast, and creative.  Sure, every free-to-play game has to chase the paper a bit,  but the only things that aren't available to the average player are upgrades that make the playtime faster.  And honestly, you might be cheating yourself if you try to shorten the amount of time you put in for stuff.  For me, Neverwinter is about following traditional DND ideals in a new way, with a cohesive vision and storyline.  There isn't a large free-roam world, but I find it refreshing to actually know where to go and what to do.  There's plenty of surprises and secrets, there's plenty of tough battles, and there's a lot to do.  When you max out your levels you've only really played about half the game as it is.  The foundry (playermade quests) adds an ever expanding option as well, so it's tough to get bored with Neverwinter.       If you're in to competitive multiplayer however, that's where Neverwinter falls short.  The PVP is fun and fast paced, but at the higher levels there's a noticable advantage between folks that invest money and those who don't.  As stated before, you can get almost everything in the game through playing, but the amount of time you have to put in as opposed to the few dollars you can spend leaves you a bit discouraged.  The money system in the game is pretty weird too, as you have Zen coins, Astral Diamonds, and Gold/Silver/Copper.  The gold you get from killing monsters is nearly worthless as you progress, and most in-game trading is done through the Astral Diamonds.      I think that this game is an overall success, and If you're on the fence, I'd say go ahead and play it- It's free.  You level rather quickly anyway, so you can get the gist of classes and playstyle without delay.  Happy Adventuring!			"

												So this is my second review, after that horrible train wreck mod 6-9 were. Neverwinter is back, and better than ever! They fixed most of the graphical optimization issues, so running the game is no problem. Servers can still be an issue at times, but it's clear that they've been working on that as well. Gameplay is the usual neverwinter, at end game running dungeons is enjoyable again. The level grind from 60-70 is still boring and a hassle, can't really do much about that though huh? Some aspects of end game really push towards paying since it can feel impossible at times. Though the game is completely free to play, since everything necessary is obtainable in game. 8.5/10 Would recommend now.			"

												Gameplay:Neverwinter Online deviates from its traditional itirations of D&D gameplay. Hybridising elements from action RPGs like Diablo and staple MMORPGs like World of Warcraft and Star Wars.Considering its Free-to-Play nature, there are no surprises with the omnipresent harsh grind to get better levels and items. Often tempting the player to make in-game purchases [overvalued to say the least, only providing limited relief from the grind].The game itself is young - needing polishing in its class balancing in both PVE/PVP, attendance to bugs/exploits, map pathing to say the least.The community itself is growing steadily, with the simplified action gameplay and D&D nostalgia appearing to be some of the draws.Customer Support:Despite the promising appearance of the game, it is hugely let down by its flippant and poorly accounted support services.Appeal tickets appear to be unanswered for days, then the tardy reply is often a simplistic resolution [often to the account holder's disadvantage]. Repeated follow-ups by users may be met with harsh penalties. Inquiries to detail Terms of Service infringement reasons are wholly ignored.***NOTICE***I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND NEW AND PRE-EXISTING PLAYERS TO WELL INFORM THEMSELVES OF THE PUBLISHERS ""TERMS OF SERVICE"" IN THEIR ARC CLIENT!**I personally found certain sections of their terms rather ridiculous and would only serve to benefit the publisher; leaving the account user bereft of protection against scams, hacks, and misdemeanors from the online community.Impression:The game is enjoyable [in terms of combat and its pace] early on, though current business model affecting gaming immersion and lack of accountable player support damages the experience of the play through to an extent.

												This game is good and bad...--GOOD=I get mixed feelings from it. The PvP is amazing, yet can be broken at lvl 50+ due to p2w additions to gear and enchantments. On the other hand It's a matter of patience and skill.I mean, if you can be bothered to fork out like 50 or 60 quid for this game it's worth what you pay for. Otherwise don't bother paying, because there's very few draw backs from f2p and subs.--BAD--Tha bad thing about this game is that yes it pay to win and you will meet some players that just have some stupidly overpowered gear or items. The game is broken now as of a few later patches. I do believe corrections are being made. Sadly the p2w aspect of this game slung me away on a catapult.			"

												as i'm sitting here typing this i've loged in 31.7 gameplay hours. this game is fun. how is it fun? lets itemize a bit.lets start with the graphics. they clearly tell you what's going on, no problems. for those who place more importince on grahpics that i do: exelent specal effect displays that do not hamper the view of what's going on. easy to look at terrain and charcters, no eye sores here. what else do you peeps look for? dunno'game play, the combat (of wich there is plenty) is a bit more frantic than most mmo's i've played. you have to aim at your target, simply selecting it then pressing keyboard keys doesn't work, aim or you won't be able to hit with single target attacks, aoe attacks are easer to pull off, just make shure you are pointing in the correct direction. oh, and watch out for the big red areas, they show up when something hostile is about to land an attack there. about a dozen charcter races and (currently) 6 distinct classes. you get some tokens to rent a mount from a quest, let you know if you want to purchase one, or just keep walking. if you want to buy a mount there are an assortment of styles and speeds to choose from. and you can have a hierling, you get one of your choice free when you complete the tower zone, others can be purchased with ingame coin or (i assume) from the ingame store for real money.questing: the quests have decent varity and no confusion. read the quest discription, follow the provided waypoint. easy enough, as long as you can survive whatever gets thrown at you. if a new area is to hard, back up to your last zone and help peeps with there quests, another lvl or two makes a big difference and they will apreacate the help. or just run the dungeon a time or three more, this will also help peeps with their questing.sound? good. with 5.1 i have a good idea of everything going around me, on my comp screan or not. npc voiceovers are nicely done. combat noises are also nicely done. but this game is one of the very few i have problems with the voip, although i am apparently an exception here, as most i've talked to it works just fine for.crafting, what is an mmo without player crafted goods? at lvl 10 you can start crafting items from any of several professions. step one: hire a (free) assistant,the first one takes 5 sec, then have your assistant gather goods, refine gather goods, or make useable products. you can find crafting goods while out adventuring, this helps a bit. you start with one crafting work slot and get others by reaching various mile stones, wich you can read from the select a workslot space. you will probally will have the ""get a profession to lvl 3"" milestone first, and it doesn't take to long to get. somewhere in here i need to mention that when you make an item you have your assistant(s) work on it in real time. most tasks are in the neighhborhood of 10 to 15 min, some will take longer, however. when your hierling is done with the work, just collect the resule and (if you want to) have one of them start working on something else.community. in my exprience frendly peeps are the name of the game. need help, somebody will have a useful and polite answer in no time. friendly conversation is one of two topics i regulary see, the other is putting together a group for a quest.  gold farmers exist here, but just right click on their name, choose  ""report spam"" and they get put on your ignore list free of charge. no need to keep reading their spam. well, there was this one time i squelched somebody for rude coments to one of my toons, just right clicked and choose ignore for that person.i think this covers everything. oh ya, game is free to play, they appear to get their $ on optionals, other than needing to purchase everything indivudally. or paying for things that other games provide for free, i'm thinking about one you had to buy items with real world $ to speak in global. more charcter slots and keys for those lockboxes that get passed out like candy on hallowween are the only ones that i notice. 'course i don't brouse the real money shop, you might find usefull stuff there. thinking of, i may just get a couple of extra charcter slots to try out diff classes.			"

												Best D&D RPG I've played since Baldur's Gate D.ABest MMO I've played since Runescape. Simply put; simple is king.  It's like a plug and play. You get it, read tutorial steps once and you are ready to go. It involves skill on a different level, not only do you think about your command combo's but you actually have to know where you will stand. you can see red circles for charging/casting moves from enemies, there is a very accurate dodge system that you have to use yourself by pressing ""shift"" (limited stamina). And many more various other powers, passive abilities, mounts and pets. It can be a very friendly community, because Neverwinter has a system where it parties you up, if you need/choose. No constant standing around waiting for a nice group to let you in to Clear Dungeons, Onslaught Skirmishes, and more.  This game is free, it's great.  I was convinced by the ""what is Neverwinter"" video. This game is worth a try by everyone, and it's definitly worth keeping. Try find a free MMO that is this easy to get into and offers as much fun.			"

Although it strays far from the classic D&D style that it's claiming to be, the classes are well made and make for a very enjoyable MMO type of game. However, as the game progresses, microtransactions seem to nearly be the only viable option to continue growing your character. Overall, the game is fun and enjoyable, definitely worth playing.			"

I just recently did a boss quest and Died because I have no party to handle off those uncessary enemies3.Character damage Balancing This is so serious I facepalmed to the fact on how much damage difference is...That's basically it other than that, Game is amazing has awesome story, nice gameplay (graphics are supportable),Awesome race selection, Pay to win isn't a big issue and challenging.

												Neverwinter is a pretty standard Cryptic MMO in that everything about the game is incredibly mediocre. The game isn't your typical ""hotkey MMO"" - you instead have only a handful of abilities at any given time. Because of the lack of keys I found combat to be very boring and repetive, but for people that don't really like the ""bazillion and one things to remember"" it may be a good thing. I personally wasn't a fan of it.A lot of assets are reused as well. For 30 levels I found myself fighting the same types of enemies in the same types of enviornments, and story wasn't compelling enough to keep me interested. Very little of the source material is actually important, the game is essentially a self-contained story and even simple things like the city of Neverwinter itself is built from the ground up to be unique, so people like myself that played Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights etc. really have nothing to look forward to in terms of revisiting these locations.Classes are very bare-bones right now, and while variety is well enough, it doesn't even begin to compare to the kinds of options Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate players are used to. The ""die rolling"" character sheet on character creation exists, but it doesn't feel like actual dice rolling. It seems as though Cryptic made it so there are several chances you can get and the game just flips between them to simulate you're rolling your stats. I spent maybe ten minutes re-rolling to get an unoptimal roll and it simply never happened. My highest numbers were always on my classes two highest stats, with one or two points favoring one statistic over the other. I never managed to get really high Charisma on a Fighter, for example.The biggest comparison I can make to the combat system is Tera. The game has an ""active"" style attack and offense system in place, but for the most part I experienced no challenge whatsoever in a solo enviornment. In groups all of the content I experienced was trivial (especially in raids etc.). Maybe this changes as you get higher into the game, but I spent my 30 levels bored out of my mind and completely uninterested in what was going on story-wise. If you're new to MMOs in general, I think you will have a lot of fun, however. It strays far enough from the ""WoW-clone"" formula to be appealing in my opinion, but at the same time it doesn't take any huge liberties with gameplay mechanics or... anything else, for that matter, to really justify choosing to play this over the plethora of other MMOs that are available. Cryptic's use of the license is just pathetic, really. Apart from seeing ""Neverwinter"" in dialogue or on the map I was convinced that this was just another generic D&D inspired gameworld. When it comes to ""is it ACTUALLY free to play?"" I found the game to be pretty fair compared to other experiences I've had with this genre. At no time did I feel like paying for something would make the game easier, nor did I feel it was necessary to progress. With the research I did (I didn't spend dozens of hours on forums or Google so take this as a subjective opinion) the vast majority of things in the game that could be bought for real money were mostly convienence items. More bag space, faster mounts, armor/clothing cosmetics, that sort of thing. The game is using Cryptic's infamous ""lockbox"" system, however. And the middle of my screen was essentially permafilled with ""SO-AND-SO OPENED A BOX AND GOT STEAMING PILE OF DUNG"" so if you're not a fan of that type of marketing then beware that this game is very bad about that.In terms of content I found that the game was somewhat lacking. Crypic's ""mission creator"" system I experienced from Star Trek Online is present here, and it seems as though it's essentially been copy & pasted. This I found to be both good and bad. Good in the sense that there are really creative players out there that are doing Cryptic's job for them, bad in the sense that when anybody complains there ""isn't enough content"" most retorts will be ""then play community-made content"". The missions I played by players were varied, and while I never tried to make any missions myself, if the mission variety is any indicator, then Cryptic's tool is very versatile and seems to get the job done well enough.With that being said, it brings me around to my least favorite aspect of this game: the dailies. At an incredibly early level (approx. level ten) you are introduced to daily quests. If you're not familiar with daily quests, they are essentially very basic, oftentimes simple (but time consuming) quests that can be done on a timer (typically 12 to 24 hour period cooldowns). In Neverwinter the dailies revolve around PvP and player-made content. Once the initial ""new"" feeling wears off (just as any other MMO) the dailies become monotonous and tedius. The rewards are fairly bad as well, and never motivated me to invest a lot of time to complete them. Overall I was very disappointed in this game, and Cryptics consistency with creating average MMOs that adhere to a very strict formula. Being big into Neverwinter Nights I was continually let down with this game's lack of story and of license use, and in general the ""safe"" way Cryptic approached yet another MMO. Even more so since it lacks the sort of exploratory freedom of Star Trek, and the creative freedom of character of Champions Online. This game is a middleground to both of those games and as a result I feel it suffers for it. For the reasons listed above I simply can't (and won't) recommend this game to anybody but those that are extremely tolerant and/or accepting of the ""standard MMO business"" that has become so mainstream. And for those that are D&D enthusiasts, my advice, from one D&D fan to another, ""move along; there's nothing to see here"".			"

My group of friends all started playing and it was fun but we burned through the game in about 2 weeks trying to keep up with eachother. After we reached the max level, there was just nothing exciting left. Sure there was pvp but nothing that really kept us interested. All in all it was a good run but just too short.Its worth a try if you enjoy late game grinding or pvp mmorpg's but I don't recommend it for most gamers.			"

												A average to good game at times, the free to play model they chose to use doesn't seem intrusive until around level 40.  If you're an item hoarder forget it, they give you a hobo's hankerchief and a broom stick to carry a jumbo jet's worth of items.  Unless you have money you want to spend.  The item progression based on apperance is sad to say the least, my character looked like he did at level 5 when he was level 45.  The dungeons are difficult and satisfying but there is little chance you'll overcome obstacles with a sub par group.  The combat is fast and fluid and the telegraph system is refreshing compared to slower MMO's but don't expect a lot of variety as you'll be using most of the same moves throughout the entire game.  You get a limited amount of Champion slots so pick what you want to play wisely or get ready to delete some hard work.

												Good game reccomend it, but minor flaws. let me list them.1.When you die you get an Injury which either slows your movement speed or be more vunerable.My opinion: Remove it, entirely this is a major nuiscence and shouldn't be there.2.When you fight a boss more regular enemies come.My opinion: It's an ok move considering you might fight bosses in parties, but what if you solo? I just recently did a boss quest and Died because I have no party to handle off those uncessary enemies3.Character damage Balancing This is so serious I facepalmed to the fact on how much damage difference is...That's basically it other than that, Game is amazing has awesome story, nice gameplay (graphics are supportable),Awesome race selection, Pay to win isn't a big issue and challenging.

As soon as I got into the actual world there was constant spamming in chat of deals to get ingame currency. Not to mention all of the damn currencies in the game, I saw at least 5 different currencies ( which you can probably buy with irl cash making it a pay to win). Horrible experience.			"

												Neverwinter is a pretty fun MMO, while it uses a lot ""MMO clichés"", it is a fun MMO experience.I found myself immersed in the fun world that this game shows you. It has fun combat, a nice character creator and good graphics. This game also has a mode called ""Foundry"" where players create their own level scaled quests for other adventurers to play through. The only downside are the semi-repetitive quests and the lack of armor variety. But that aside, this is a great MMO and all of you who are looking for a fun MMO to spend hours in should definitely try this game.Graphics: 7/10Story: 6/10Combat: 8/10Customization: 6/10Atmosphere: 8/10Overall: 7/10 "

Mod 3 was the best.- Armor from Mod 3 is still the best in the game... but they have two newer Mods..-No way to inpect what something looks like before you buy it.-They made dragonborn race and charged 75$ for the bundle. The race still makes all the noises humans do... and can't wear helmets or hoods just one they give you with the bundle.. so no helmets for you because your dragonborn.-Literally everything in the game is designed to eventually make you want to spend money just to have enough space in your bank and bags and things cost a rediculous amount just to transmute appearance...-Worst thing about this game.. The Dev team does not listen to the players... at all.. and they do not fix anything and now they just release♥♥♥♥♥♥poor end game content with no heart or soul. Run from this game. It no longer deserves recognition. Also don't ever buy lockboxes... you wont get anything for your money but a lot of trash.Pros:-Fun dynamic combat-Decent amount of customization if you are willing to pay-Cool mounts and companions-Fun the first time through-Voice acting is decent-Graphics are not too bad-Has a ton of potential if not backed by such a notoriously bad money grubbing company			"

												NeverWinter is the best F2P-from-the-start MMO to date. By that I mean, disregarding MMOs that started P2P and then made the switch to F2P (eg. LOTRO, RIFT, et al.).There's a lot of content without ever having to drop a dime, not just in the core game itself, but because of the hundreds of player-made modules - some of which are quite good. Unlike PoE, which has aesthetic-only micro-transactions, NW does have boosts and gear you can buy, but all of it can be bought with in-game money (a lot, of course), and none of it is P2W.The game may not be for everyone because the combat feels different than your typical MMO (more like a third-person action-adventure game), but I quite liked it.PS. This is NOTHING like NWN or NWN2.			"

												If this was sold as a normal rpg, it would be similar to a tablet app. But for a PC MMORPG, this game doesn't have a publisher that have the player's gameplay experience in mind. Then again, not alot of other MMORPG's are blessed to have a ""good"" publisher.Edit: I think i wrote that late at night after I closed neverwinter for the last time. I wanted to emphasise the importance of mmo publishers to actively play their games. Perfect World Entertainment's attitude to critical problems with the game was simply to ignore them and publish new redundent and convoluting content. Eventually, the lore was a mess, ingame economy lay in ruins, and character progression rendered as a sad emulation to World of Warcraft.The only saving grace to this IP would be the control and combat mechanic. It's actually really intuitive and feels incredibly natural during PvP. Even with lag, the whole concept kept the feeling of control over my character in the game. Targeting with my mouse reticule is the future for mmos; tab targeting is you fighting the GUI before the GAME itself. I was going to play another game that has similar control/combat mechanic (Black Desert Online) but that is also FTP. I won't step into this genre until it cleans itself up.			"

Gameplay is the usual neverwinter, at end game running dungeons is enjoyable again. The level grind from 60-70 is still boring and a hassle, can't really do much about that though huh? Some aspects of end game really push towards paying since it can feel impossible at times. Though the game is completely free to play, since everything necessary is obtainable in game. 8.5/10 Would recommend now.			"

												First off, do not expect this game to be any thing like the Bioware games.  It is a totally new game engine and the HUD is completely differeent.  However, if you're a true fan of Faerun then you will thoroughly enjoy this game.  It's an adventure with a wonderful story line which follows the R.A. Salvatore novels of Neverwinter.  Valindra starts the game off by meeting you in the very beginning and you'll end up with and EPIC battle against her through several dungeosn.Now, for the game mechanics.  Personally, it was hard for me to get used to because I loved Neverwinter 1 and 2.  I played them ALL!  In fact, I was a huge Neverwinter Nights player when it was on AoL.  So, I struggled through the mechanics of the game and didn't really like it, but after playing from Closed Beta all the way up to the new module for Dragonborn Classes, this game is one of my favorite games of all times.Give it a chance if you're really a Faerun fan or R.A. Salvatore fan.  You'll fall in love real quick.UPDATE:  UNDERDARK MODULE---------------------------------------------------The latest update has shown great improvement since the horrible mistakes of Module 6.  There's still some lingering problems like favorite dungeons still missing and gold/diamond spammers are worse, but the overall direction of the game is doing better.  If you left because of Module 6 then you should return and check out RA Salvatore's new story line with his novel characters.			"

												its an amazing game! - my 2013 reviewThis game was amazing when i first started out, i thought this was the best thing since i couldnt afford WoW at the time. I No-Lifed the ever loving♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game until i had a max level character in 2013, then i fell off MMO's and moved to other games. When i rediscovered this game and i thought of all the good times i had on this game, i also saw they had new content (this was around early 2015) so i hopped on ready to continue my high level character, only to find it not there. I was really confused so i tried thinking if this wasnt the right acc. but i only ever made one. So i try going to their website to find the answer and get my guy back, I never found the answer and ii was so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥i uninstalled the game and never went back (until now of course, im writing this review) Still never got my guy back but ive given up all hope off him resurfacing in my lifetime. Im now remaking a char. and to my surprise i'm actually having some fun so far. Although from my memory there are alot of differences, some good some bad. I dont know what happened to my guy, but aside from that i would recommend this game to friends, if any of my friends ever felt like playing Neverwinter instead of WoW... - my late 2016 review			"

												I've been playing this game since May (I just downloaded on Steam) and have been quite pleased with the gameplay. Although it strays far from the classic D&D style that it's claiming to be, the classes are well made and make for a very enjoyable MMO type of game. However, as the game progresses, microtransactions seem to nearly be the only viable option to continue growing your character. Overall, the game is fun and enjoyable, definitely worth playing.			"

												This game is good and bad...--GOOD=I get mixed feelings from it. The PvP is amazing, yet can be broken at lvl 50+ due to p2w additions to gear and enchantments. On the other hand It's a matter of patience and skill.I mean, if you can be bothered to fork out like 50 or 60 quid for this game it's worth what you pay for. Otherwise don't bother paying, because there's very few draw backs from f2p and subs.--BAD--Tha bad thing about this game is that yes it pay to win and you will meet some players that just have some stupidly overpowered gear or items. The game is broken now as of a few later patches. I do believe corrections are being made. Sadly the p2w aspect of this game slung me away on a catapult.			"

												Though I have 4 hours on this game, 3 of them were trying to get it to run. Between troubleshooting my and a friend's client, I've found that many people have issues with it as well, and the solutions are extremely convoluted. For me, just getting the client to run was the first of many problems. I'm sure if it works its fun, but I can't even get to that point. It has crashed going full screen, it has crashed trying to go into safe mode, it has crashed by idling, it has changed me default brightness settings for my machine as a whole. I'm running it on a 2 month old computer, so I know my hardware is not the issue. I'm very disappointed with how this whole ordeal has occured.			"

												This was the first MMO I was genuinely interested in, being set in a D&D world AND Forgotten Realms AND paying homage to the old Neverwinter Nights series (sort of, though it's obviously different), so I thought I would give it a try. It turned out to be very solid for a free to play game and I've been playing it actively since.The game's presentation overall is really great. It's extremely easy to learn, menus are easy to use, the graphics look fantastic (with a cool one button ""inspect"" mode for taking nice screenshots or just looking around)  and the soundtrack is really good. There's loads of customization options for character looks and races also. Classes not so much but I'll get to that point later.Gameplay wise, it plays more like a hack n' slash action RPG than an actual D&D game. I think that's ultimately a good decision because not everybody can be expected to learn the whole ruleset just to play the game. While I would've liked to see way more D&D mechanics like alignments and skills being used, I think the system is fine and I adapted to it fast. Classes' skillsets are pretty limited too and only become more different later on, and the game does not have that many classes yet so you're bound to see lots of people playing typical rangers and rogues, but hopefully more are added later on. Overall the game feels ""streamlined"" this way so it's easy to pick up without having to worry too much about progression. But the combat at least feels crunchy and satisfying.The setting is pretty interesting, being set after the Spellplague, the world is very different and there's lots of interesting new stuff going on, especially if you are familiar with any past Forgotten Realms games / books at all (the game also heavily references Salvatore's new books), and it has tons of lore relating to pretty much everything. Places, characters and monsters also look and feel very D&D-like, and I think the game's art style overall is very similar to Neverwinter Nights 2's, just prettier with much better animations and character models.Then there's the Foundry which allows community created quests (with their own levels and everything) to be played in the game just like normal quests and that's a very interesting feature. I only briefly tried it so far but there's loads of good content available and anyone can make and share their own quests (provided you are at least a certain level). You don't even need to do anything special, you just walk up to a job board ingame, choose a quest, and the game does all the downloading and set up in the background for you. They play like modules for the old Neverwinter Nights games, if you're familiar with those, except they're integrated into the same game world. That at least ought to add replay value to the game.Lastly it's free to play which to me at least is a huge plus and so far I haven't encountered any content in the game that I would need to pay for which is great. I don't know about high level play yet (lv22 at the moment of writing), but for a casual player like me who isn't all about being super competitive, I think you can get along as a free player just fine. The only real downsides to the game for me are its lack of difficulty sometimes (most of the standard quests can be easily soloed) and limited roleplaying. So yeah...I would recommend it. :P You have nothing to lose anyway by trying it out, especially if D&D / NWN interests you anyhow.==================================================TL;DR with plusses and cons:+ Excellent presentation / quality for a F2P game+ Very nice graphics+ Easy to learn+ Fun combat, practically infinite content thanks to Foundry+ Good use of lore- Limited customization for classes- No actual D&D roleplaying (alignments)- Lacks D&D mechanics like skills- A bit too easy, especially if you stick to recommended levels.

												This review is based on approximately 3 hours of interupted game-play.  Considering it is free to play I'll be cautious about my reservations about this game, so here goes:Uber:-  Decent selection of character races & classes-  Has a glowing-sparkly trail of prettiness that you can choose to show which leads you to your next objective-  Fast sense of progression, your character obtains new skills and abilities regularly which keeps it interesting-  Some ability graphics look really goodMeh-  Physics graphics are cheesy - players run with an odd motion-  Interacting with objects or NPC's can be tedious as you need to 'interact' with F key which can be buggyJust....no-  Very linear when not in town - always a set path-  Early level game mechanics are highly favourable to the player (overpowered) and although that can be fun sometimes I found it made the beginning of the game bat-turd boring. Overall it seems to be trying to follow the game play mechanics of World of Warcraft but without the cartoon graphics.  As an avid Dungeons & Dragon's fan I was hoping for more with character creation but I appreciate how it can become daunting if over complicated.Overall it's a decent free to play game but I wouldn't spend money on it.

												I was having a decent time at this MMORPG lite.  It was kind of simple and easy to get into.  The missions progressed rather easily and there is a lot of player created content that has passably playable dialogue.  But after I hit about level 35 or so, the difficulty of the mission progression seemed to stop suddenly and required me to start grinding out earlier quests or find parties.There were also a lot of minor issues like the pathing that guides a person around quests, tiny text errors here and there, and occassional problems with major party quests not updating as having been completed.  I could overlook these things but it did seem to lack a lot of polish, although in most respects very functional.Unfortunately this ended one day when after an update the game just failed to launch.  I tried repairing it through the ingame repair system, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and then I even tried a work-around I needed to do for Dota 2 which I had the same problem with once.  None of it worked and I can no longer play this game even though I had wanted to.  I just tried again after a few months and the problem still persists.  Oh well!  It's F2P anyway.			"

												this game is 1 of the most addicting games ive ever played and isnt pay to win like most would think, most of the top quality gear can be bought through the auction house or by completing campaigns, my only complaint is how terribly unbalanced the pvp is but the pve is pretty fun and challenging			"

												I have a love for DnD games. I really have given this game a fair play. Over 400 hours of gameplay on the clock. Which I spent in part with guild mates, friends, and by myself.The game boasts great combat and exciting DnD stuffs to tingle your taste buds. For long time fans and newcomers alike.Each class feels unique and has its own challenges and paths to grow upon. Making you feel more epic with each ability you gain or master. The game is quick to award your heroic deeds with exciting loot and treasure, making it a fast to ""grind"" and a fun time with friends or guild mates. The graphics do look quite good for a F2P, and you never have to be stuck with one setting for a long period of time.There are so many great looking locations to feast your eyes on. Also a wonderful array of foes to slay! There is a great amount of fan service from the depths of the dungeons and beyond.There is also a wonderful custom map/ adventure maker! Allowing player generated content like I’ve never seen before in a MMO! You can take on the collective imagination of DnD fans from generations old and new. An outstanding feature and worthy of a look.But this game has a horrible underbelly, a dark one. I regret to inform you that it is rotten to its core as a social experience.It has fallen to the same fate of many F2P games. In the most typical and harmful ways.Complete with gold buying/selling, spam from bots, power hungry players with no social graces, and a terrible micro transaction system that hungers for your cash long after you have fed it. Boasting “sales” and “bonus packages”. Some of which are cringe worthy.  I have listed some of these grievances below. If you want to skip down to my final thoughts please do.There is a serious problem with the power balance due to an inflated economy system and broken auction house feature. Making it difficult to match your peers in PVP, gain knowledge in-game of items and their uses, and keep current in dungeon runs without the help of the richest guilds or deepest wallet. Crafting in the Neverwinter also costs you laughable wait times and pitiful returns. The pay components costing too much and the in game alternative being ""buying gold"" for powerful gems and enchantments. Leaving a huge gap between the player base.The micro transaction system has a list of sins which can go on for miles. For starters, you have to spend increments of money for a simple purchase, locking you into owning in game money and pitching it for items. You have to pay separate fees for every aspect of this game. Most of which is per-character. From expanding your bank/ inventory per character. To buying keys for random chance pots. My favorite being the respect token for changing your character abilities/ feats. It must be purchased every time you want to change your character’s play style. It is not unlocked, but purchased every time for any given character. Playing this game for free is very possible. But a long term investment in the Neverwinter can cost you the price 2-6 new titles or pay-to-play services with far better customer service.And formost..The game has attracted the typical internet fare, meaning you will spend more then enough social time blocking or muting your fellow gamers to get some peace from trash talk.  The community at large doesn’t respect itself, and you will be hard pressed to not to run into these types on a daily basis. Please, avoid this game if you are looking for a un-invasive F2P social game.  There are a few people making this game worth playing society wise. For every few guilds making the game open and fun for anyone. There are dozens of hateful players waiting for you.If this game was sub-based, or a standalone title, I would suggest to everyone I know!As a F2P. It’s a good thing gone sour.			"

												I love this game! It's been a long time since I've played an RPG, and I've never played an MMO. I can't say enough about it. The controls are very easy to get used to, even if you're used to console gaming. The storyline is fun, I enjoy the quests, but I love the fan made portions, such as the foundry. Overall, I'd say this is a fantastic game.			"

												As a player of the widely acclaimed Neverwinter Nights years before, I was excited when Wizards of the Coast finally brought the franchise into an MMO-Style game. Not as large as your big World of Warcraft or RIFT type games, player-base wise. The feel of the world/environment reminds me of something like Game of Thrones.If you're really technical, you can design your own dungeons and quests for players to battle creatures in.Fap/10.			"

This is tied up with TERA but TERA gets tedious from time to time... Neverwinter on the hand has mutiaction combat statisics and has a great storyline and has better dungeons that other games. Simply sponsered by Dungeons and Dragons. This game as amazing graphics for an rpg mmo. BUT I dont judge graphics. Neverwinter is a FREE TO PLAYmassively mutiplayer game.			"

												Like this game a lot, it's fairly easy to learn and the animations are really nice. Graphics are also great, but I tone mine down some due to lag. When there's over 30 players in an area it can get really bad. Thankfully there's the option to move to another channel with less players.The fighting is both mouse and select keys, but you can customize your set up so those that wish to can. There's an auction house, there's dungeons and you can upgrade your gear and give your companions upgrades too. There are events that offer extra bonuses and something to do besides quests, dungeons and pvp areas.There are new expansions and new race or even new class options, currently there is a new expansion coming soon. There is a new class that will be coming soon. Not sure if there's room for another race at the moment, but one never knows.Customizing a character avatar is really nice and there's even an area under History where you can enter a bio about the character. There's a bank and email system, mounts and there's even player created dungeons/instances that you can play. After a certain level, you can even try a go at making your own.This game offers a lot of ways to play and things to do. I think it's well worth it for a free 2 play game. Yes there is a store, but it isn't required to buy anything to have fun playing.			"

												Pros :1. Hours of entertaining gameplay!2. Hundreds of quests so you never get bored!3. A ton of different adventure zones to travel to and from.4. A quest maker called The Foundry to share, and make your own quests!5. Fun dungeons and good loot at the end!6. A good party/buddy system to quest and adventure with new friends you meet ingame!7. The ablility to dye your characters clothing! (Small feature but good!)8. Thousands of gear to find in dungeouns, quests, and the campaign!9. Mounts to ride for faster travel!10. 8 different classes as of now and another coming soon!11. Multiple races and vast customizing of your character!Cons :1. 2/3 of the things in the Pros list are bought with real world currency for Zen. (the ingame currency)2. Needs a fairly good pc. 3. One of the races is locked as DLC.4. Playing multiple hours at a time makes your butt hurt from your chair. It makes you have to take breaks. What a horrible game!Overall I would highly reccomend this game. As it says it is a D&D style game with upgradable attributes and skills. Other games like TERA lack in this department. I havent found an MMORPG that ive liked this much in a while, Great for friends to play or just solo. GO PLAY IT.			"

												EDIT: They have already brought back 4 of the older dungeons, and a lot of new content with the latest expansion ""The Maze Engine.""Quite a decent mmorpg, faithful to the Dungeons and Dragons universe. Action based combat, standard leveling system that is a bit tweaked to match the dungeons and dragons feat and stat system, and not really pay to win, as some people have suggested. You can gather gear without paying anything, and you can also buy Zen, the currency that you need to pay real money for, with actual in game cyrrency (Astral Diamonds), although it is quite expensive. My only issue with the game so far (I am a lvl 60 guardian fighter) is that they removed many of the older dungeons in order to revamp them to match the higher levels, and many storylines fall flat just before you face the final boss, because there is no dungeon to go into. However, they have already started bringing some of them back, so this issue should be resolved in the near future.Other than that, I am having a lot of fun with it, especially as a person who is an avid DnD player (both dungeon master, and actual player), since I know a lot about the world I am playing in. If you enjoy fantasy, and an action based combat, give it a shot. After all, it is free :)			"

												Okay so don't get me wrong it's a really fun game in all honesty, with friends it's even better. Met some cool people here too. But I honestly can't recommend this game to anyone. Take my actual game time, remove about 30 hours and that's how much I actually played because the launcher is utter cancer. Second the game is horribly optimized, I have to play something that looks pretty much like morrowwind style graphics yet it still has almost no frame and my pc is really not that bad because I play games that look tons better but run tons better too. You can't really do all that much without spending either totally insane ammounts of time playing or spending money. You are limited to 2 characters unless you buy more slots or spend hours upon hours to get enough stuff to sell and then convert the diamonds into zen etc etc bla bla... I really gave this game my everything and no matter how much I wanted to love this game I just couldn't because there were way too many issues. Gameplay is awesome and so is the story and overall lore and I honestly love these but like I said just way too many issues for me to recommend this game to anyone. If you've got a beast of a pc with way too much time and/or money on your hands, pick the game up and enjoy otherwise goodluck actually playing.			"

												This game was great. I loved it at first. Then i made my first purchase at the aution house....I just wanted a mount of my own. I spend 800 astral diamonds they went to strawberry shortcake. but i did not get my horse.....i continued to play then did a quest where i was gonna get a free companion. it seemed to be working until i chose the healer from the npc. and he told me to equip it....opened up my idle companion menu and guess what! NOTHING WAS IN THERE. WHAT A TRASH GAME CANT EVEN HAVE A PROPERLY WORKING ITEM MANAGMENT SYSTEM! UNINSTALLING			"

												Its a fair game. Quiet fun, though it could use some work on certain aspects. For example: Being able to travel faster from place to play to avoid unnecessary confrontations and long travels where people would get lost. It is also hard to run a party at times. 7.5/10			"

												How the heck this game has very positive reviews?Look i have 1.5k hours played, probably alot more before this game was added to steam.1. This game has virtually NO SUPPORT from the devs.2. It is by far the biggest pay 2 win game out there, you can literally buy better dmg with real $.3. There is no class balance, some claases are straight up better and others might as well not be in the game.4. The dungeons are very boring and don't give you any rewards, at the end of the day you need to pay real $$$ just to complete the dungeons.........which makes no sense, no real progression.			"

												Downloaded neverwinter stronghold thinking it might be a good game, but then i discovered it was another game by cryptic! It is just another blatant moneygrabber using zen credits in the same way as star trek online! That aside it is also difficult to play relying to much on the keyboard rather than using the mouse to make things simpler! It is a confusing mess that is to complicated and clumsy and has nothing at all to do with the way dungeons and dragons works! It is obvious the prople who made it have never played the real game or did any research on it or it wouldn't be such a mess. So don't even bother waiting hours for the patch to download just give this game a miss and find something better!			"

												After playing roughly 30 hours, I can say the game wouldn't be for me, and I personally don't recommend it. My reasoning is that it gets unbelievably repetitive, its like you are copying what you did every time, just fighting or managing something that is a different shape or color. If anything, I want a game that is creative, stands out, keeps interesting, etc. This game just didn't have those qualities. And leveling up is such a pain at some times, as stated before, its very repetitive, and it gets harder which makes it slower. Overall, it was okay at first, but it lost it's spark early in the game.			"

												Well, this is one of my fav free to play games on Steam, and when I say FREE-TO-PLAY it is free to play. Anyone can say this game requires real money but if you spend some time playing it you can reach a conclusion that if you do enough daily dungeon, skirmish and PvP you will get a lot of Astral diamonds and with those diamonds you can convert to Zen Coins. so yeah. totaly free to play game. I've spent some time now and I've created and deleted a lot of character's and in my opinion they are pretty well made with a lot of awesome combos. In my opinion this game still needs a little of optimization for low end pc's. Oh and one more thing, I requested a GM help because I had my missons bugged and within 1-2min my problem was fixed!!! no joke :DGood game with awesome gameplay, easy to learn and endless fun. Neverwinter is one of the best free to play games on steam right now and you play it!			"

												This game was simply ""ok"" when it came out, After several character nerfs (with the promise of more to come) and the destruction of the ingame economy and the massive mirco-transaction style, this game is bad. period.I cant even say micro-transactions when 1 item can cost you 160 dollars. This game was bought by a foreign company that stripped what they HAD TO, an only what it had to from D&D, so that they can build a simple illusion and then nickel and dime you. (More like 20 and 50 you). They even Charge 200 dollars for the hero of the north pack, this game as a whole isnt worth that, ontop of that you still have to pay for other stuff in the game! Most items of value in this game are bound to your account on pick up or on equip, which means you cant trade it to other players for your mutual benefit, pwe/cryptic wont allow that. Their most recent assualt on player to player trading was to bind all enchanted keys, now its much much harder to trade up for better gear/items. They did this just intime for their lockbox event which you need these keys to open.. if you cant trade for keys guess where you have to go to get them now? Bottom line. If you plan on grinding for your gear and taking the time to learn your class and to understand it, or even giving pwe/cryptic your money in order to get ahead in this game, stop and think about this. They bind the items you own to stifle you, while giving them the edge in market, they nerf your character class after the hard work and effort you poured into it, youll most likely have to respec now, that isnt free btw..With asking prices or 35 50 100 200 bucks for single items, you are given NO SECURITY for your investment.This game is near death, Nothing, no amount of money you pay for it is going to let you keep your character or items once they decide they arent making enough money to keep servers up anymore. After driving away the life force of the game with unfair business costs, in the end they still made money and walk away conteplating what franchise they can hijack and run into the ground next. You? youre out how ever much money you wasted and have NOTHING to show for it.. since ive played first, ive uninstalled multiple times and each time i came back wanting to give this game another chance, based on my love for d&d, but each time ive come back to find a new way cryptic has ruined this game. There are chat bugs/ friendslist bugs note bugs, dungeon delve chest bugs (you arent guranteed your epic chest after epic dungeons anymore) the game constantly crashes and quest bugs. I can understand bugs, relly i get it..but these bugs have been around since i first started playing! how can cryptic program so many more pay walls or item bindings or new items to buy but cant fix bugs.. that shows where their priorities are. 3/10 screw PVE/CRYPTIC and evetyone who even looks like pwe and cryptic for hijacking D&D and ruining it. try it for yourself or read all the other negative reviews.

The small guys have come out with one huge great game and I am a daily player now and absolutely love it.  They did a heck of a job on it considering a lot of the competition out there has a lot more money and power to put into their games but this is every bit as good and I will play it for a long time to come.

Sending in a ticket didn't really help and making new accounts didn't work. Even my ranger had a glitch besides the server problem and that was were he lost every quest and couldn't level up. I spent about $30 on this game because I thought it was put together and well made but these devs really suck because they didn't make the gameplay smooth and it is really frustrating when you can't play. It was really fun but im just so fed up on having to delete the game and restall it. Also the patch is HUGE so when you need to restall you have to wait hours for it patching. PLEASE FIX THIS!			"

The Down side to this Game  is  the gain of Astro diamonds which is  their true  in game currency ..Gold is  only  used for  potions and few other things.. You need astro diamonds  to buy  stuff on the auction house or purchase  items from  their astrodiamon venders .Recent  update made   it so you can  gain 7, 200 a day from  doing both Dungeons and Skirmishes   you can refine 2,400 Astro Diamonds a day. the prices for  most things in the auction house is  really high..There is always tons of Gold spammers..The great thing about this game your not hindered  from quests you don't get told you must vip in order to get access to quests or  hotbars or other things.. Their Vip offers you  xp Boost,  1 enchanted key .which unlocks a   lockbox that gives you a random item and trade bars not many trade bars but adds up..the key is only 1 character a day on the account your viped..  however each characters get also  gives you a bag that gives 10 identifications scrolls a day and a epic dungeon key.. you gain vip levels   that doesn't lower  when you pay for  Vip (i haven't  varified this fully)  but your Vip  does expire depending on the vip you chose .. .This game is worth a shot.. :))			"

												Besides being a Guild Wars 2 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy? Astonishing lack of technical support for the players, gigantic amount of bugs... I'd like to like this game, I want to, but there are so many better games out there with a similar formula that this one is not worth your time. If you're a DnD fan like myself and can get over the gameplay, you'd still be disappointed. Before I mentioned the lack of support those who try to play this game, I'll share my story here: After playing a while a non steam version I changed my computer, tried to install this game via steam but it didn't work. I tried everything, got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and tried to contact the costumer service for assistance but got an answer that somehow sounded like ""lol can't help you #solveyourownproblems"". What if I had spent money on this game, now I couldn't reinstall it and all I spent was lost for no reason whatsoever?			"

												-----THIS IS LEGIT PLEASE READ----- So ive played Neverwinter for more than the amount of hours i have on steam because it was originally installed on Arc. ---- THIS IS NOT BAAD OK? -----Even though  Neverwinter got some thumbs down, trash reviews, the game is still amazingly fun to play. Many people say Neverwinter is a f2p (free to pay) game even though it isnt. You can easily get everything you could ever want in this game for absoulutely FREE! You just need some time and effort. Now even if you pay it would make things a LOT easier but just to prove point you can get anything for free. Note: (The extra race that comes in the dlc is a paid race, but its not too big of a deal, shh)---- Pros ----- Class/Races are all unique in its own way, you can customize in depthly your perfect character with 7 classes and 12 races of different variety to the stealhy Trickster Rogue and the brutal Great Weapon Fighter.- Graphics are nice a fluid and feel like you are playing a Dungeons and Dragons game it is suppose to be. Even though some people say the graphics are cartoony, look at the games that are popular like *cough* Borderlands 1/2.- Great community, now this is just opionated, but i think the community for NW is kind and ""family"" like. For me i am in a guild who always is responsive and always ready to do runs (dungeons) which is hard to come by in soloq.- Leveling... instead of the many hours it takes to grind to get to max level like in most mmo's, in NW you can easily get max level in 2 days non-stop (not like ive expirimented). People say this is bad, but i think it is great because late game is what the majority of NW is about.- Controls, the controls for the game fit your hand perfectly, with only few abilities per slot that you can have. Instead of having the millions of powers, spells, combos that have you hitting every number on your keyboard in NW you can only 8 abilities for quick fluid control. (You can swap out different abilities ofc, if people were confused by that).- Late game, is one of most fun things to do in NW, with the 5 FREE MODS (dlc) that came out just for achieving that perfect toon to have the perfect equipment, stats, and looks that we so desire. Even though the game is born after Dungeons and Dragons, its not all Dungeons. There are many other things to do, pvp, daily quests, foundry (the best), events and also the Action house. I know there is more but i cant name at the top of my head. Now ofc there is dungeons which is a blast to run through with your friends.- ALL OF THE MODULES (DLC) ARE FREE. yup it is.---- Cons ----- Could be more open world... its all divided between different zones.- Nerfs are a little annoying to some classes after mod 5.- Cant think of anything that could be bad other than the amount of time it takes to farm Astral Diamonds to certain expensive items.Its reallly your choice, but i would recomend playing it before you pass it.

												Neverwinter is just like every other MMORPG released. It's amazing how this genre has not seen any innovations for years, but the games keep attracting players by simply changing up the attacks, character models and dialogue.Walk, walk, talk to NPC, go fetch stuff, walk, walk, talk to NPC, go kill stuff, walk, walk.So boring. Cut your losses if you've used real money in the in-game store. This is a time and money sink where players don't actually have fun and there is no reward or sense of accomplishment.			"

												People class this game as ""Pay to win"", I just don't understand how you can think that. Every item which can be obtained via methods of real currency can also be obtained in the game. Some people think that the PVP is just a battle of ""who has spent the most money on their gear"" and yeah, that's how most games work guys. With your three encounters, two dailys and passives, everyone is very equally matched and the only thing which makes one player stronger from another is the gear. Yes, skill and teamwork do take a part but at the end of the day. Work hard, earn gear, rule Neverwinter, or, Spend real money, buy gear, rule Neverwinter.Either way, this game is a incredible freebie and is well worth a play!			"

												The game is nice, but the Foundry is what shines the most with the ability to play virtual Dungeon Master...  And since you can pretty well customize your social channel tabs, the annoying elements can be silenced efficiently to focus on your game style (even to the point of having the impression of NOT playing just another MMO at all... a blessing for the anti-socially enclined and generic grumpy old dudes just trying to play dungeons & dragons in friggin' peace)... The controls are fairly standard if you've played other games of the genre (Everquest, Diablo & Sacred series) and the learning curve is forgiving enough at the early stages, not so much later-on but that's just spicing it up. Would have preferred a more classical class system but I guess real challenges AD&D died after 2nd edition, when kids were too scared of playing with THAC0 rules and began having thieves throwing magic missiles :P But the game itself is still fun, in video game format.

												Neverwinter is a great MMORPG and you can easily spend hours apon hours on this game.Yes there are some in-game purchases but this game is surely not a pay to win game i mean there are some aspects of what you can buy with real money and just have slighty better equitment then others but wont give you a huge advantage on PvP and especially PvE.There are many ways to dodge these payment methods but would just take a little more longer time, which im sure you have. But i would say it is tottally worth paying for a couple of items in game and it doesn't bug me one bit :)The Items you would probs pay for is a faster Mount, Champion (Follower) and maybe a 10x (bundle/deal) of lockbox keys.Which would probs cost you 25-30$ I highly recommend this game as the gameplay is awesome and there are hours of content in game.I would also recommend is grabbing a couple of friends the level with each other and once you guys reach the max (Level 60) you guys could go on Dungeons, Domonation PvP, Skermishes and Foundry quests (Quests that are made by players them selvs.)Dont just take my word for it and go and give it a try :) Thanks for reading this :DAlso come check out my gaming channel :)http://www.youtube.com/user/turtl3vg "

This Game is worth $60...and it's free 10/10This game has all of the content of a $60 dollar game, and it's free. It has a really good fluid combat system, and requires some strategy. The game does have similar storylines regardless of class, but the game is so good that it doesn't even matter. I highly recommend this game. Each class has its own weaknesses, and strengths, and you have to skillfully play to them. It is super fun. Play this game right now.			"

												I've retaken this game after a short experience in single player to try it in multyplayer. Besides the game mechanics, that I judge innovative and different from the usual MMO system, this game manages to give a clear presentation of the forgotten realms to those who still don't know them, with lore items, character's personalization and short but good dialogues. So, if you want a ""all leveling and raidin"" experience, this is still a good option but I'll suggest other wow copies. If you want to discover or, like me, meet again the Forgotten Realms and enjoy the D&D style, go ahead and try itPS: really light requirements, very accessible			"

Stamina bar way too low and walking is extremely slow and tedious. Just loking at the game gives me eye strain and a headache, This is coming from someone who plays games 10+ hours a day. As soon as I got into the actual world there was constant spamming in chat of deals to get ingame currency. Not to mention all of the damn currencies in the game, I saw at least 5 different currencies ( which you can probably buy with irl cash making it a pay to win). Horrible experience.			"

												Good game reccomend it, but minor flaws. let me list them.1.When you die you get an Injury which either slows your movement speed or be more vunerable.My opinion: Remove it, entirely this is a major nuiscence and shouldn't be there.2.When you fight a boss more regular enemies come.My opinion: It's an ok move considering you might fight bosses in parties, but what if you solo? I just recently did a boss quest and Died because I have no party to handle off those uncessary enemies3.Character damage Balancing This is so serious I facepalmed to the fact on how much damage difference is...That's basically it other than that, Game is amazing has awesome story, nice gameplay (graphics are supportable),Awesome race selection, Pay to win isn't a big issue and challenging.

I opened a ticket and asked if they could restore my lost item and the responce wasn't that they ""couldn't"" it was that they ""wouldn't""  Finding this out also took about 1.5 weeks which was insane!I can't support a game that disreguards helping their players with accidental item loss... especially on a paid account, time and money is better spent with a better game.

												Been playing neverwinter forever, (baulders gate and NWN days, dang im old lol)  I was really excited to see it become mmorpg.  Was even more excited to see the mission foundry, then nearly cried when I found it was no longer available.  I would still recommend if your looking for a break from WOW, gameplay and graphics are great.  Just...man...no foundry, so very sad.			"

												Good game for people who like the locked on attacks and almost no dodge mechanic. Has a good story but it is wanting for some important quests instead of many mini quests. game can get boring because of the time it takes to level up when you get above lvl 25. PVP is ok but is super boring (fighting normal enemies makes my adrenaline pump mor than PVP.) all the classes seem to be balanced but in pvp the Ranger plays hide and go seek. This game is fun for those who like a bit of grind and large 13 v 1 boss battles.  TOTALY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!			"

												This game is good and bad...--GOOD=I get mixed feelings from it. The PvP is amazing, yet can be broken at lvl 50+ due to p2w additions to gear and enchantments. On the other hand It's a matter of patience and skill.I mean, if you can be bothered to fork out like 50 or 60 quid for this game it's worth what you pay for. Otherwise don't bother paying, because there's very few draw backs from f2p and subs.--BAD--Tha bad thing about this game is that yes it pay to win and you will meet some players that just have some stupidly overpowered gear or items. The game is broken now as of a few later patches. I do believe corrections are being made. Sadly the p2w aspect of this game slung me away on a catapult.			"

												Neverwinter was able to hold my interest to a lasting degree, something that no other MMO has. Between the rich lore and the dynamic, quick combat system, it is much more accessible and interesting than, say, WoW. The freemium status doesn't hurt either, and the classes are fun and varied, with regular updates.That said, it is more interesting to play when you have a buddy to watch your back and level up with you.

												Downloaded the game 3 days ago, and now I have 30+ hours of playtime on Neverwinter. It's THAT addictive.The game is great! Lots of people, a good questing system, etc. Many agree that this game is amazing, but there are some cons despite what the community and players tell you. Based on what I have found on my 30 hours of gameplay, let me show you my pros/cons.Important Notes:-This game is not P2W like many say, you can go along fine playing for free, just steer clear of the PvP arena, the P2W players will be there.-Game is in english...Pros:-Great questing system, and trackfinder.-Combat is great!-Lots of people always online, you'll probably never go into an instance and find that you're the only one there.-Lots of content-Amazing graphics for a free game, can lower/higher at will.-Engaging.-Can spend HOURS on this game and not get bored.-Many dungeons, can spend hours playing with friends in a dungeon and have a great time there.-There's a bit of secret bosses, places, etc you can find in a dungeon.Cons:-You can only get 1 basic mount, then you'd have to either wait till an event comes or buy it with zen.-Astral Diamonds --> Zen is at a very low exchange rate.-Lots of stuff in the game, the AD and Zen are overpriced.-Mods speak in a different language than english. (For all you englishmen)-The damn dropboxes get annoying, you get the same thingo over and over again, and you can't open it without zen.Summary:The game's great for first-time RPG players to try and get a taste of things, and you could really have fun in this game. But to achieve true potential of this game, you'd need to grab a few bucks out of your wallet to really make your character stand a chance in those PvP arenas. Note:I hope you found this guide useful, enjoy your stay in NeverWinter! "

												I played this alot before the game came to steam and some after.Levling is fun to a point. The quests, dungeons and various adventures to be had is quite entertaining really. Some of the quests are even unique and more innovative than other MMO's. Definitely some great ideas here.However, If you want to be somewhat serious/hardcore, be prepared to spend a ridiculous amount of real cash.If you look at the prices of DLC packages for this game, you will get a hint of what im talking about, and the costs for some things are insane.P2W factor is strong within this game, the amount of paywalls are an insult to the entire f2p genre.I do recommend this game for a quick party/LAN/Coop play, but definitely not for serious hardcore mmo gamers.I mean, who even pays 189,99€ for a DLC. 420,94€ if you want all the DLC's, thats insane.Would rather have a monthly fee...

												NeverWinter is the best F2P-from-the-start MMO to date. By that I mean, disregarding MMOs that started P2P and then made the switch to F2P (eg. LOTRO, RIFT, et al.).There's a lot of content without ever having to drop a dime, not just in the core game itself, but because of the hundreds of player-made modules - some of which are quite good. Unlike PoE, which has aesthetic-only micro-transactions, NW does have boosts and gear you can buy, but all of it can be bought with in-game money (a lot, of course), and none of it is P2W.The game may not be for everyone because the combat feels different than your typical MMO (more like a third-person action-adventure game), but I quite liked it.PS. This is NOTHING like NWN or NWN2.			"

												Ok, here's the serious answer. You can spend time or money to get more powerful.. Sorry for the crappy crayon drawing and lame graph, but I had to make due in a pinch. Power gains are rapid and easy for small investments of time/money. However, the way the game works, it becomes increasingly expensive in terms of time or money to increase your power, to the point where it might take days or weeks (or supposedly hundreds of dollars) to increase your power a very, very, very small amount...like less than 1%.Thus at a high level, a character might have exponetially more hours (or money) invested in it, but a very, very small actually difference in power (5-10%). For some people, this is apparently a huge deal. Particularly in PvP there are some people who simply do not possess the skills or reflexes to overcome a 5% difference in gear. For others who are very skilled or practiced, that differences is far outweighed by said skills.However, you're going to see the typical ""OMG IT COSTS LIKE THOUSANDS OF DOLLAHS TO BIS"" stuff when this question gets asked. And the answer is, yes, if you want to level to 60 and instantly have the best EVERYTHING, the market price is probably close to $2000. But if you're willing to put even just a small amount of time into the game, that price drops dramatically...zero for some people. "

												Laggy, buggy, grindy as hell of course like in all go kill X mmos, dungeons are ridiculously difficult and thats totally OK with me... problem starts with the rewards... they absolutely not worth the hassle you can just skip all dungeons in the game and lvl right to the top while not doing a single one and you'll be absolutely fine...This game of course, as is the case with all mmos with more or less shiny graphics, will interest all the usual kiddie passengers of hype trains, but not mmo veterans like me and perhaps you if you got at least 10 years of mmo experience - walk right past this one, nothing for you here, this game will make you fall a sleep out of boredom.More details:1. I haven't figured an efficient way of making astral diamonds except doing those dailies that grant you 1-5k per quest then cooldown for 4++ hours yet they ask you to pay 300k of them just so you can upgrade ur companion and allow him/her to lvl up from 15 to 20... i shudder to think how much it will ask you to pay for the upgrade from lvl 20 and up....2. Reward box that you open as you level up drops only absolutely worthless stuff, i dunno why its even there... probably to make Perfect World Entertainment look charitable.3. Crafting is a total laugh not only not worth the hassle but the mats are difficult to procure as well unless of course you open your pockets... and it works in a way made for EMPERORS of LAZY, cause absolutely everything is automated.. you only need to push button and forget it for a few hours.4. Combat dull as hell, basically you just chop mobs by using 3 skills and left mouse button - thats it. (yes, for real).------------------------------------------------------------------Sigh~ when will they start to make actually FUN mmorpgs.... makes me want to be born in 80's againAh right almost forgot... in case you were lured here by Neverwinter Nights the rpg made by bioware, don't be deceived, this game has NOTHING i repeat, NOTHING of what made the rpg Neverwinter Nights fun, nothing whatsoever.The mmorpg version of Neverwinter is a failure that will quite possibly kill-out any further sequels to the original Neverwinter Nights the rpg... a most grave loss for me because they rarely make such amazing rpg's these days.

												Neverwinter Online is a MMORPG young, and this can be seen in many details and features to be fixed, but the basics to offer to the public within a few months we are all very good value. The Foundry alone might be worth the price of the ticket and, if we think that in this case the outlay to play for the title of Perfect World is 0, do not try it would be a crime. Play with it, go to the heart of the mechanical and you will see that you will not regret the time spent in the game world, if i must be able to keep in check the shop and the economy could have on your hands a few months a great example of how to develop a free to play MMO.

												I really enjoy this game.  It's got a combat system that I really haven't seen before, as well an interesting story.  Let's be Frank though.  I play on Tabletop, so when my friend said DnD Rpg I had to check it out.  The game is very enjoyable, and has plenty of hours of opportunity, but it's entirely Pay to Win.  Sure you can purchase the in game Real world currency for Astral Diamonds (an in game currency) but the exchange rate is insane.  Meaning like most other MMO, those who pay end up being those that rule the Events or Pvp.  Currently the best enchants and gear are nearly impossible to get without using real world money.  The gameplay is fun, linking all the quests together with an introductory cutscene, it makes for both excellent story, and beautiful graphics.  That being said, people need to remember the game isn't  that old.  As the second Module just came bringing the class total up to 6, there isn't all that much varity for compisitions. The leveling curve isn't anywhere near as steep as other games, meaning you can get a character to the current level cap of 60 in just a few days, which may leave you bored feeling like there is nothing left to do but spam those final high level missions for loot.  Gameplay is fairly simple.  It's enjoyable and not at all hard to get the hang of.  The skill tree can be somewhat overwhelming at first, and it may be worth your interest to get a respec after you've gotten to the level cap just so that your first time through you can learn what all your skills do and play with different combinations. The compainion system is a great idea, allowing players to have a Cleric follower heal them if they're squishy, or a Striker doing damage if they're a tank.  But the sheer number of resources it takes to level the 5 basic ones up past level 15 means they quickly fall out in usefulness.The foundry system is neat as it allows players to make and share their own quests and stories in game.  Just a neat thing I think.New players who join now wont be jumping into a game with everybody at the level cap.  There is plenty of people at all levels, so finding a group to play with isn't that hard.   "

												IGNORE EVERYONE WHO HATES AND SAYS THIS IS PAY TO WIN!!!!!   THIS GAME IS COMPLETELY F2P!!!!!The currency focus is on Astral Diamond to Zen conversionAD Farming is actually really fun, and once you hit the lvl 60-70 mark is a way to get the gear you're looking for anyway.  The campaigns for lvl 70 that give you daily repeatables actually help with their own individual facet of the game throughout.  For examples, one campaign focuses on armor, another is geared towards artifacts and refining, one has an angle towards a specific in game profession, but the boons and gear you get from each ""grindy campaign"" help in the PvP matches so that you DON'T have to spend any real money to get great, OP, gear.  By doing skirmishes and dungeons daily you can earn Astral Diamonds.  You can also earn them from selling items in the Auction House.  You can then convert the AD to Zen and ""spend real money"" in the game without actually spending a penny.  That's where it can seem a little grindy to have to farm AD's daily, but if you have the help of a guild/stronghold behind you, I can almost guarantee that you will find some people to help you get that done!  Then it brings up the point of not just Domination style PvP but you can have stronghold vs. stronghold in raids and sieges!!!  The stronghold idea has only further expanded the playability of the game.  I LOVE this game and would (and have) recommended it to everyone I know!			"

												Having logged a significant amount of time and after finally taking a serious interest in this game I think it is time for a review. Why you should play NW: (i.e. Is it worth the time)If you have enjoyed playing MMOS in the past (wow,Tera,vindictus, etc..) you should try NW and if your new to MMOS it's a great starting point. For grizzled MMO vets it is a nice refresher with great combat, a wide array of skills and powers, and an economy that is pretty stable (for now). The PvE is interesting and a fun thing to run through, it's got great visuals and a large amount of characters. PvP is also present in a big way. The que system is well organized and there is even ranked play. There are also whole different play styles based on pvp (different armor to use, powers, feats, items, etc). The game itself has great visuals and any graphics hungry max setting fps PC behemoth computer builders have a chance to go nuts graphics wise. (Don't worry it also runs on toasters). End game content ramps up the PvE and PvP in a big way with campaigns and artifacts so tons of play value after basic lvling campaign is done. Also like all MMOS you got your guilds and they have events and it's all hunky dory (if you can't tell I tend to solo play).If you are new to MMOS NW is great because it in a sense is simple. It guides you in the beginning better than any MMO I have seen. The combat is quick to grasp but still fun and interesting. Figuring out your play style/kit you use comes easily as you settle into your character.Problems with Neverwinter.Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥we got somethings to talk about: (keep in mind despite all this I still love/am addicted to NW)First and foremost: this game in a significant manner is pay to win. Endgame PVP is ruined by people that can decimate you due to there incredibly overpowered kits. Seeing a guy that has almost 3x the gear score you have in the same pvp match as you leaves some very lasting effects on my opinion of pvp. Anyway back to the pay system. I recommend that you invest at least a little cash in this game as a jumping off point once you reach lvl 70 just because you won't last a second in pvp if you don't. I wish there was no pay system and we could just upfront pay for Neverwinter so the title Free To Play wasn't slapped on it. Just invest a little on enchantments. And a mount and refining and more refining and even more refining (you get the point) The refining system: ok so in this game there are artifacts that you have to charge with refining points to make them better (also enchantments to charge but eh ♥♥♥♥ that). Currently the final ranks of artifacts vary (legendary/mythic) to get to legendary takes waaaayyyyyyyy to many refining points so don't even get me started on mythic. This system in principle is good in practice but holy ♥♥♥♥ it takes to long. Cryptic, listen, do everyone a solid and make refining less of a grind and give us some time left on our lives. Seeing people run around with all mythic gear makes me seriously question the state of their bank account or the state of their social life( no offense no lifers). I can't imagine the time it would take to do that. Back to PVP: ok so pvp as a game type is great. Capture the points on a 5 on 5 match, fun, simple, organized BUT!!!! BUTT!!!!!!!!! It is so unbalanced. Once in a millennia do I find a game where it is a hard fought good game between two relatively even teams that comes down to a last push or last second play. Almost always there is a clear winner from the beginning. This is always attributed to mismatched gear scores. I should not be a guy with a gear score of 2,600 facing a guy with a GS of 4,500 (measured as of 2/16/16, measuring of gear scores has changed before). Fix this please. Organize it by rank or gear score or whatever, even if it takes longer to que it will be worth it.  Alone vs Party play: if I can recommend anything to newcomers is find a friend early on. I choose to play solo (my choice can't blame the game) but it is hard. Forget dungeon delving alone it can't be done (except you 4.5k GS guy) also things can get a little grindy sometimes and it is nice to have a friend during this time. Also 2 heads are better than 1, NW offers a lot especially lvl 60 and up. Having a friend to help figure things out with will benefit you in many ways. This is less a criticism and more a helpful recommendation. Find a friend or find a guild do it early or be prepared you brave soul.FINAL NOTE:Despite these minor problems ( the few lines of code Satan himself added) I still love NW. Why I don't entirely know. Maybe because I have a serious addiction to a game that can suck money like Gaben during a steam sale or maybe it is a new breath of fresh air in the MMO genre with a nice combat system a wide array of play styles and classes and a constantly updated and changing world with a dedicated dev team. If anything proves that I like this game it is the 330+ hours I have spent on it. Try it, love it for the gameplay and hate it for the pay system but don't miss it.			"

												So now I'm 20 hours into the game. I'm level 34 (almost half-way to the level 70 cap) And most of the 20 hours I've played the game for have consisted largely of the same thing; Talking to someone, killing a bunch of things, interacting with some sparkly object and returning to the same person to repeat the pattern until they tell me to go to se someone else.Repetitive as that sounds, I've really enjoyed it! I'm aware that there are more things to do in the game, like profesions and dungeons, but those three things are about it. and all I care to know about the main story is that it involves some necromancer or something like that.I've also heard that the game contains things called ""Campaigns"", buit I'm going to assume that I'm too low-level for them as I havent found a way to access them.I've found that the loot-drops are quite good... I regularly fing myself changing around my gear and enchantments, unlike other loot-based games where I will usually end up sticking with the same lucky drop for many many hjours before I find somethiong better.And I've always hated targeted combat in MMOs (Just one of the reasons runescape sucks)... The combat in this game feels fluid and engaging. You really feel like your personal skill level effects the outcome of the battle.Overall:Story: 6/10Gameplay: 8/10Voice-acting: 4/10 (There are some truly horrible attempts at regional accents scattered here-and there)Content: 8/10Maps: 9/10 (Big and Varied, for the most part)Yep... This game cured all my cravings after bninge-watching SAO in a day!			"

												Well, it looks like the game code was programmed by crazy monkeys from the jungle of India.At first, you get game client from Steam. Then you have to create another account.Then there are an autoupdate pack which is applying by client.After that there are patch from game server that needs to be installed.At this point the game starts with ""loading bar"". And there will be another""loading screen"" after the first one.And only after all that $hit the game finally crashes when the second ""loading""comes to an end!If you'll try to verify game chache, there always will be 2 files which are not passing the check.But the games works in Safe Mode... Good job!			"

												P2W but not unbarableVery simpel just a few keys to manage, that however is also a little problem.to few keys can get borring. only one weapon type for the whole game is sad. Most items are classlocked and that is sad, why cant a paladin use a 2 handed sword but lose all tanking benefits for fun ? just make it so he cant roll on it !!Weapon figther have a big♥♥♥♥♥sword from start to finish, no other big weapons :-( would like just axes and hammers, come on it is not to much to ask for.Very few spells over all.But again that adds to the simplisity of the game and makes it easy to get startet with, so it is super for casule play or with some one who dont play to much, would be easyer to get me GF startet on this then lets say Rift or POE where teh skill trees can be very specifik.So with the goal or a good easy to play game it is very good.Only 2 char slots is not alot but not expencive to get more, generaly i dont fell the omg i have to pay ril money to play this like other gamers.In GW2 you cannot trade as a free player, = instant delete and forget!All in all a good game that does exatly what it promises!

												Neverwinter is one of the best free to play MMO's out there - playing 20 hours with friends we all love the aspects of the game.The question is; 'is this a pay to win?' There some aspects which fall under the category like buying mounts with their real-money currency ZEN or weapons. Anyways, to answer the question I've played twenty hours of this game and so have all my friends who've played alongside me have really decent gear.We fight people in the PvP Arena who've spent actual money on the game, and we rail them like it's no tommorow.Download this game - fight monsters and heroes today.

												Very poor game design. The graphics were great as well as the cut-scenes. The game play was very streamlined and dumbed down to death. I didn't get very deep into the game at all, so it's possible it gets more in depth later, but there was nothing to draw me in to playing further. The voice acting was actually annoying because these NPCs never shut up and just blather on about stuff that really doesn't need such long winded explaining. I immediately quit the game and uninstalled when I backed away from a boss a few inches and it went to full health and super ran back to its spawn point. Really? This game is not worth my time.1/10			"

												This review is aimed as a response to the top review which i strongly disagree with. THIS IS NOT A PAY 2 WIN.Although it strays from D&D it isnt that far off, the gameplay itself makes up for it. One of the best designed MMOs ive ever played, the graphics are stunning the combat is fast paced. and you may argue that the quests are b oring and linear but tell me one MMO that doesnt have that.Classes are boring? far from it. each class offers you 3 distinct ways of playing your character. IE a hunter ranger can stick with range skills, melee skills, or support.PVP is all skill, and all of the T2 items, runestones, Enchants u can get without paying as long as you know how to ( google it ). Coalescent wards and perservation wards wont cost u a dime if u do the daily quests and earn your AD, then using that AD u can buy the wards in the auction house.			"

It's almost 2014.A slightly more active combat system provides minor engagement, but envelope pushing MMOs like Planetside 2 already do that way better.			"

												Been searching for MMORPGs lately, and I stumble upon this among many other MMORPGs.Neverwinter is a MMORPG game set in typical D&D setting. Neverwinter tells you a story about a kingdom which is now a shadow of its former self. The remain of the city of Neverwinter was only Protector's Enclave, which even was built recently by the king Neverember in order to preserve the fallen Neverwinter. Other parts of the city has either overrun by orcs, rebel, and even undead and demons. There's The Foundry, which is basically quest maker. You can make your own quest here, and other players can play and rate it.The main plus for this game is the simplicity and action. Unlike some MMORPG of its time, Neverwinter offer some different playtype for you to play and some skills available at your disposal. The Foundry is quite an interesting aspect of the game. However, what lacks in Neverwinter is open-world. This game lets you feel the 90% of the game after you reached level 70. Leveling up is easy as well.TL;DRThis is a great game to play solo, but if you like more open world game, this game might not suit you. 8/10			"

												This game may be good for people who want a more casual MMO experience. If you are bothered by the ""Go here and Kill Y number of X"" this game has very few of those. In the beginning there aren't that many. The quests are interesting for the most part.Around level 30 there's a little bit more of the lame quests, but doing these lame quests is thank god not your only option. The skirmishes are a lot of fun. They are small party dungeon runs. Those are a LOT of fun.THE best thing this game has to offer is the Foundry (user created quests and dungeons). The Foundry quests are simply awesome. They are almost as good as if they were taken out of a single player RPG like Dragon Age. There was a Game of Thrones themed one, where I had to battle alongside Jon Snow. There was also one where you became an evil character, became the dungeon overlord, gathered minions and killed the heroes.There are also episodic Foundry quests, which are constantly updated by the kind user. Doing all the episodes can last several days. 1 episode is usually 30 mins long and they are ideal for doing daily foundry quests. That way you always get just a little bit further with the quest's own story.So the leveling up part is good and a lot more fun than in other MMOs (e.g. 1st 20 levels of wow are boring. here they are fun). Once you hit level 60, you will still have more campaigns to do, which came with the modules (expansions) and reach level 70. There's a lot to do, it looks like you won't get bored of those for several hundreds of hours.HOWEVER, the end-game sucks big-time. Once you are done with all the campaigns, it's not really worth playing it anymore, unless you are planning on investing real money. Sure you can get the shiny mounts by farming too, but that requires way too much grind. To get the same items, you have to grind for several weeks intensively every day (6+ hours/day).But you won't get there until you spent like 100+ hours with the game, which are actually fun.+ new expansions are always around the corner, which give you more campaign missions and new areas to explore, new dungeons, skirmishes, etc. All in all, I think 100+ hours of fun is worth downloading, I think. Then you can still do the insane amount of Foundry missions available. OR create some yourself for some little sandboxing and become the Dungeon Master yourself!Also, PVP sucks. It just sucks, nothing more to say about it.			"

												Welcome to the internet. You have nothing but free time for drama and pay to win VS QQ'ing pugs in PvP? Neverwinter is the game for you! Today for you, we have a broken♥♥♥♥♥game that the dev's refuse to fix so they add new mounts like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ golden lion, a nice change from all of the birds: Dildobirds and Assbeaks. Like companions? You better be a hardcore PvE'er or you're wasting your precious gold, zen, AD, time and effort. Exhausted from all the ingame drama? Have an event! Have money to spend? We're having a flash sale! Finally have money but the sale of over? The players have broken the market! Like gambling? Try your hand at  the legendary mounts, and possibly sick your mount at your attacker... Unless they are best in slot, then you did a whole 4K damage off of their 140K+ life, GOOD JOB PUGGLE! If herpes infested roleplaying is more your style, I invite you to go to the Moonstone Mask in Protector's Enclave, where you can throw water balloons at the roleplayers, and dance like a♥♥♥♥♥♥in your courtesan's outfit. And don't forget the endless hours in the chatboxes QQ'ing over people using this bug or that macro or this glitch or that hack or that cheat or who has a bigger sword♥♥♥♥♥♥or who sucks their mom's left♥♥♥♥♥at age 30. Welcome to Neverwinter, where everyone gets way too personal, and the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ comes out on top in PvP.			"

Character progress is relatively fast, but what makes it standout is companion quests, crafting and many other mini games. Plus it's D&D property. Next step for me would be creating my own quests and giving something back to the community.Oh, and you will absolutely love combat system!!!			"

												Dont buy(into) this game because they have zero integrity.I played nwn before it moved to steam. Spent about £60 on various items, grinded and geared out 4 lvl 60's plus enchantments. Then, a little while before the ranger update i quit playing for 6 months.I come back to the game after a break and my account had been plundered. Please note, it was never 'hacked'. It was accessed by the only people who had my account info, arc. All my lvl 60s were still there, but every single purple enchantment had been removed.I KNOW my account wasnt hacked. It was plundered because it was inactive, therefore inside job.  "

												So...well let me kep it short for you (or not, idk yet) - the game runs like trying to kick barefoot a lubed brick up a slippery slope, regardless of what machine you have. Gameplay wise -the idea isn't that bad, but the game is not only badly optimised but it also has lag issues, again regardless of your your internet, which makes the combat pretty much screwed (mobs hit you even before they raise their swords, so dodging is practically pointless in most cases). Even if you are willing to overlook such things (for some weird reason, you poor lonely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥), the game gets repetitive very, very soon (Like most games associated in any way with PW). You would be stuck doing daily quests and going in the same instances over and over, and over, and over. Grinding FTW... is I guess what the devs thought.The game also wants you to pay for even small things that you shouldn't (if you want more than 2 character slots, and etc.) and to top it off everything is overpriced (at the time I played there was also a race behind a stupidly high paywall).The saving grace of the game is probably the eastetics, but they can only work on you for a time. Don't waste you time on it, you would only be disappointed as you realise how much better the game could have been, but sadly will probably never be.			"

												I've been playing NW for a while now and so far I'm really enjoying it. It seems really well made and I'm having fun exploring and completing the quests. The devs do a pretty good job of connecting with the players as well. I've been able to watch a couple of their twitch streams and like that they give out a bunch of prizes and also in-game content just for joining in.I think this game is definetly better in a party, so go find (or make) a friend or two!
