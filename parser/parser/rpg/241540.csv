												I finished State of Decay, I enjoyed it, and I would recommend it--but with some hesitations. The more I played the game, the more it felt sort of rote and a little tiring. It feels like the developers built a great core gameplay loop, but didn't do much to add to that.The way the game works is thus: You have a base stocked with survivors. As time passes, the base uses up resources. So you go around a few towns and surrounding countrysides, break into houses and warehouses and the like, and steal stuff. You'll find both items that your character can use, and resources that your base can use. You carry regular items in a backpack, which has both a slot and weight limit after which you get encumbered and tired more easily. Base resources are loaded into a large rucksack, which further encumbers you. If you can't carry everything at an area, you can send for someone from your base to run to where you are, pick up the remainder, and bring it back to the base. NPCs can get caught by zombies while they're making their way out to the looting point or while they're making their way back. You can designate certain buildings to be ""outputs"". The game doesn't explain at all why you would do this, but the internet explains: the most important reason to do it is that an area designated a outpost spawns no zombies and is booby-trapped so that if external zombies move through, they get killed. You'll want to put at least a few outposts near your base to sort of create a zombie-free buffer. The second reason, which is not made clear in the game at all, is that if you leave base resources in an outpost, you will have a permanent daily allowance of that resource, which lowers your need for scavenging. By the end of the game I had a daily surplus of food and medication and broke even on fuel, so I only needed ammo and construction materials.After a while your character will get tired. Fatigue lowers your maximum stamina. You can keep playing, but it'll keep getting worse. So you're advised to go back to home base and switch to another character. Likewise, serious injury lowers your maximum health. This is the game's way of forcing you to use multiple characters. This can be frustrating if you only have a few with good skills. Skills include cardio, wits (ability to search through things quietly), melee combat, shooting, and reflexes (appears to relate to combat) and they are leveled up by using them; someone who shoots all the time will quickly get a high level of shooting skill. At a certain point, once you've leveled skills, you can also select ""specializations"" for your characters. The game does not explain this, so it was about 2/3rds of the way through the game before I discovered this was a thing.While you're out and about, you'll be asked to do missions. Missions could involve helping out neighboring groups of survivors, going to save one of your runners who has been caught in a zombie-infested area, helping to board up a building, climbing tall buildings to locate new sources of resources. You can also find new areas to move to, as each base has different built-in facilities and different numbers of expansion slots. I only moved my base once, from the default church into a spacious and facility-rich warehouse. You can use materials to build different areas in your base; a guard tower, a garden, a medical tent, a research library, a cooking area, a gym/training area, etc. Some require particular survivors with particular skills to staff them, but most just give you a sort of passive boost. You can upgrade most building facilities. Ultimately other than areas that help survivors recover from fatigue or injury, I didn't really notice much of an impact from base facilities at all. It felt like another mechanic that was sort of neat but ultimately hollow.There is a plot, but not much of one. At random, you'll get radio missions to go deal with various groups of people. There are military personnel who are here for an unknown reason, local small criminals and drug/weapons dealers, a group of friendly survivors, a courthouse serving as some kind of post-collapse civilian government, and a few one-offs. The actual plot missions themselves differ very little from the random missions you get. For example, taking the sheriff on a ride-along to clear out zombie infestations and save a trapped civilian is exactly like clearing out zombie infestations and saving trapped civilians.Your player characters are basically randoms. You start as a camping dude named Marcus who has great default skillset. He's accompanied by a perpetual whiner who is useless named Ed. You meet up with an ex-military woman named Maya. Pretty much everyone else after these three are total blind randoms. There are five or six NPC voices that voice everyone; there's a wide wide wide variety of dialogue but little in the way of characterization. They do this because anyone can permanently die. During my first run-through, I lost both Marcus and Maya due to bad planning about 10 minutes apart 4 hours in. I was so gutted that I restarted the game. In my second and final playthrough, I was about 7 hours in when I lost Marcus on a routine errand. I considered restarting again. So they've done a good job of making the loss of a high level character pretty tragic. Marcus was my only loss that wasn't ordained by plot reasons on my second playthrough.I guess I would describe my experience as sort of hollow. I loved the melee combat, which is quite complex and very tense (although poorly explained). I loved driving around in my car and opening my door to whack a passing zombie, or doing a donut and whipping a zombie hanging off the back into a telephone pole. But... I guess I never really felt like anything matters. I'd just wander around and scavenge (unnecessarily, my resources were never low) until I'd get a mission, missions were basically no different than wandering around in general, I'd play side missions until I got a plot mission, which were no different really. Occasionally I'd have to go back to my base to check on construction or switch characters. I was never scarce on weapons or ammo or meds at my base. I always had more than enough influence, the game's currency.So in conclusion, I'd say that this is definitely a game that's worth trying, but that if you're like me, you might get tired of part-way through because there's not a lot of variation and much of the game seems a little like busy-work.

												Seeing i poured more hours into this game than the average review-writing player, i figured i should write my own review as well. There might be spoilers.So here goes:I'm not a fan of most zombie games, which seem to revolve around ""shoot millions of zombies to win"". There is no ""winning"" State of decay. The zombies are everywhere and the horde is endless. The base game ends when your survivors manage to leave Trumbull Valley and you are left wondering ""How long will they last without my help?""And this is exactly what i love about State of Decay.The game & DLC's in a nutshell:State of Decay:You and your buddy went on your annual fishing trip, while you were gone large swaths of the US have been overrun by zombies. You get attacked as soon as you tie off your boat. Fighting them off is easy enough but now need to figure out what happened and where you can find a safe place to stay. Jump in the nearest car and meet up with fellow survivors holed up at a church. Then the game begins for real and answers are gradually given.Breakdown:Same map, alternate storyline. Several weeks after the outbreak, you and Lily are the last 2 survivors of an enclave and you know you wont last much longer on your own. While you look for another enclave to join, Lily packs up and will meet you there with whatever supplies are left. Once settled it's back to basics: survive for as long as you can. You quickly realize resources are dwindling while zombie numbers increase. Eventually it's time to move on: you pack all equipment in the RV, load up your most important survivors and look for a new home. Your new home is on the exact same map, but with fresh resources and.. more zombies.Lifeline:New map. You are in command of the last military outpost in the overrun city of Danforth. You must secure your base, shore up your defenses and start the search for various survivors. The brass will direct you to high-value assets: scientists, doctors and their families whose expertise might be crucial to find an eventual cure. Along the way stranded survivors cry out for help and you're the only one with the means to respond. Your actions will decide the fate of not only Danforth, but possibly the whole world.I'll do a short pros and cons but there are a few things i should really point out first. State of Decay is not about killing lots of zombies. It is about people trying to survive the zombie apocalypse. There are endless zombies but finite resources. Sure, it is great fun to smash your truck into a few zombie hordes or grab a machine gun and go on a killing spree, but that's not the intention of the game. When you're done a good truck will be broken, perhaps beyond repair. Or a lot of bullets will have been wasted on ever respawning zombies. So when you clear an area of zombies, you damn better scavenge as much as you can.When you scavenge you may find resources you can use to improve your base or tools for zombie killing. Food and various painkillers/stimulants are also often found. There are a few possible home sites (bases) in the game for you to eventually choose from. Each of them has certain requisites and advantages/disadvantages, but larger is better :). Always you have to make tough choices: will i go for a workshop to repair weapons & cars, or rather a field hospital to aid the people who will inevitably fall sick? No one wants to go down with Black Fever.. trust me. Maybe i can have both IF i sacrifice room for the workout area, but then all survivors will have less stamina and fighting skills.. Choices.Over the course of the game missions will pop up: help scavenging, clear out an infestation, save a survivor, trade resources with your neighbours, kill a freak zombie.Unfortunately most of these missions can be boiled down to a simple fact: your fellow survivors have the mental capacity and survival skill of a baked potato. You are the only one who's good at it, and it's up to you to do ALL the work. I found this annoying when i first played the game and put it aside for a few weeks for that reason only. However, if you accept that's just how it is, embrace it, and you'll still have a most enjoyable game.A few other points of light irritation:- Graphics: good enough for a game of this price, but definately not top notch.- Controls: especially car controls feel sluggish.- Clipping: zombies occasionally clip trough solid objects. Not a problem if it's just a regular zombie, a bit more annoying when it's a Big Un or Feral in an enclosed space.- Useless survivors: Plenty of them and no ""clean"" way to get rid of them.The pros:Open world game: You go where you want, when you want.Permadeath: Your survivor got ambushed and killed? He's dead, no reloading an earlier save.Stamina & carry capacity: The game's way of saying you're just an average Joe, not Rambo.Traits and Skills: The game's way of taking the ""average"" out of ""average Joe""Soundtrack: Composed by Jesper Kyd. 'Nuff said.Mods: Don't like this or that? Maybe want to see more of that other stuff? Check out the modding community, or find out how to do it yourself. Besides tweaking Breakdown to make it more enjoyable, i also added myself as a playable character. Much fun was had.All in all i found this a very enjoyable game and the DLC's are definately worth it. Has been on sale several times @ -66% orso. Even grabbed back to it a few months after i finished it.			"

												""There are a lot of zombie games, but this one looks old, but feels fresh"" Game overall is very good and deep, and has nicely executed gameplay mechanics that make you occupied for long time, just because you come back to it for more. You need to gather supplies in order to survive, but also you need to keep people in top shape by wiping out infestations, killing hordes, gathering supplies and eventually take them outside of base and kill some zombies together with them to make them feel more clever. Base too small? Find another one, and order everybody to move to it. You've been long time outside of base exploring the area? Your character will get tired and eventually run out of stamina (or the stamina bar will be impossible to fill fully). When you'll get hurt too many times, your health lowers and you need to switch to other characters. Lost your character? It's gone. You cannot have it back. This is the main thing I love in this game. When you loose one of characters, it hurts, this character is gone. This is when I realised that dialogs and overall - story - of characters is very good and nicely written. At some point I felt so emotionally connected with Markus (main character you start as first time) that when I died while playing as him, I've started game again from the beggining, because I didn't want to loose him. Did I mention that game is open world? Yes it is, you can do whatever you want untill whole map will eventually run out of resources. That is another unique thing about this game. Nothing respawns. Crashed your car and it exploded? You loose it. Gathered supplies from nearby house? They're gone. They never respawn. This adds so much realism to the game, and fear that you need to take risks in order to survive. You can also get some new freeloaders to your base. Of course it will be possible to switch to them, after you fullfill tasks they give you (going to their base and dropping supplies), or just after bringing them to your base. Generally speaking, there is a lot to do, and this review will not cover all of this stuff, you just need to find out more by yourself.Technically speaking, this game is pretty outdated. Graphics are somewhat old looking, but they're not ugly. Just textures could use better resolution, and animations could use some more fixing. Well, we cannot expect much as Undead Labs ported this game from Xbox 360, where it was successfull as it is now on PC. It runs on CryEngine 3. First I thought it was Unity 3D, but after some readings I've discovered it uses Crytek's engine. I thought that it pretty much wasted it's potential. As mentioned above animations are sometimes jerky, and doesn't fit the situation. Some textures are ugly, low res, but overall, it's not ugly to the point to make you puke. Performance is pretty poor on Ultra Spec. It does run noticably better at High Spec (Graphic options are named like this) with 60FPS, but does have some drops to 40 in towns. My PC is not top notch, I have i3-3.2 GHz, 4GB RAM, Radeon HD7850 2GB, but still it could use some more 'love' to make it run smoothly. Game has very limited graphic options (one slider) but it does job well improving the performance.Controls. Game lacks some stuff that could come in handy for some group of players. I dislike forced Mouse Acceleration. Thank god Undead Labs added rebindable keyboard bindings, so it's easier to configure and play. Game does not have multiplayer and will never have. Developers stated a lot of times that this game won't have any possible coop or multiplayer. It's all reserved for upcoming Class4 (this game is Class3) and honestly? In single player it plays so well that I didn't even noticed lack of multiplayer. Overall, game is worth the money, so is upcoming 'Breakdown' DLC which will only add some more of gameplay. Game has enough content to make you occupied for looooong time. It's best zombie game to date, it looks old, but feels fresh despite it's obvious flaws. Undead Labs - Congratulations.8.5/10			"

												Definitely a decent game, it can be a little repetitive but it does offer some good fun. It really reminded me at times of playing a GTA game with zombies in it.Know this before buying!!!The worst part about this game hands down is the fact the game plays on its own when you are not there....What? Things progress/change when you are not playing! This should have been a Hardcore feature or something similar, seems like the devs were taking the ""simulation"" aspect a little too far. If you only have time to play an hour here and there, you might not want to play this.The other annoying part about this game, which I think ties back into the simulation aspect, is the save system. While some may like the system implemented for this game, I find it unbelievably stupid. It's basically only checkpoints, no save points you can create, ever. My ideal save system would be like Fallout 3's, essentially any time and anywhere. These issues might not bother you or might make you want to play the game more, but for me, these issues make playing the game less enjoyable. I still recommend it as there is some good fun, but just be warned about those features. I would have surely waited for a cheaper sale had I known about those features first.			"

												Game is a real shocker. Open world zombie game done pretty good! Combat for me, is fluid and very fun. You can easily trample 5-10 zombies with this system and never get angry at someone doing what they're not supposed to be doing it. The NPCS during combat are amazing, they do so much damage a full crew of 4 could likely take out 200 zombies. A smart move here, is that in this game killing zombies is mostly useless! They did not add any sort of item cultivation or gold drops from zombies which is great.The environments are pretty good as well. You always feeling like youre in a random farm or in a little suburb, largely because the zombie variety is so good as well!The ability to macro manage your ""crews' resources and deal with shortages and other random misfortunes is a great add.

												What a great game. Truly the best zombie game out there. It has all the stuff I always wanted to see in a Zombie Survival game.Yet I give it a thumb down, simply because:40 Hours into the game and I lost my savegame. Not a single survivor was lost, I was near the end. Unlocked most of the characters in Breakdown and suddenly it's gone.Apparently that's something that just happens. This is known among the users for quite awhile and yet it was never patched. PC Port of this game is a freaking joke. Instead of fixing this broken piece of ♥♥♥♥♥, they decided to spit on the paying customers and re-release it as some kind of GOTY edition, with better visuals and actual bugfixes. Of course the guys who bought the game with all the DLC would've to rebuy it again. Makes so much sense, right?""Thanks for your support, here, buy the game again, but this time with some fixes.""So in conclusion if you supported these greedy and lazy SOBs during their early access period, you're punished for it.Not buying from those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s again.Thanks for nothing, you disloyal, greedy, lazy-♥♥♥ developers.

												State of Decay is a game that fills a niche that many games tried to fill but none did yet. But it does it in its own unique way, and it does it very well.You are managing a group of survivors in a zombie-apocalypse. Its something you need to get used to, there are alot of random characters and some plot centric ones that you can get attached to, and mourn for when you loose them to the zeds. There is permadeath, and its cruel. The game can bring out emotions in alot of ways, which is a strong point for it.There is also base-building in the game on several predetermined locations. The game is a Sandbox, things happen if you are playing or not. As long as you keep morale high and your base secure, you shouldnt have too many suprises whenever you get back to it after you took a break. The story is told over different mission arcs that you have to follow, to eventually get out of the valley the game takes part in. Overall the story is well presented but it could have been longer and the end is unsatisfying in my opinion. The non-story missions are quite repetitive and can get to be a bit of a chore over time.Generaly the game felt too easy once you know how to deal with the zeds and have your survivors trained. Yes, you can level your survivors skills and there is nice progression in the skill system. And even tough you might feel like a zombie-slaying superhero at times, as soon as you pay not attention for a moment you can be in dire troubles. If you get reckless you will loose characters to hordes, and to special infected (which are very similar to those in Left4Dead). The graphics are pretty dissapointing resolutionwise, and the user interface is clumsy and ugly at best. That is because the game was ported from consoles for PC, but generally ist not a bad port. The Devs really tried their best to make the game work for PC. The controls with Keyboard & Mouse where fine (Controllers work too of course). The graphical variety still can overcome the bad texures, so that those only stay a minor annoyance.I didnt run into any plot-stopping bugs or crashes (seems those where fixed), the game gets still patched from the devs and there will be a second DLC coming out at one point. The first DLC adds an endless mode to the game which is a nice addition.Its a bit weird to sum up this game with its many small flaws and at the end still say its a great game, but it really is, even tough it could surely have been better in many aspects. Its the whole experience and atmosphere that makes it worth playing. Its a unique game in many ways, and a very welcome and creative suprise in the many zombie/survival games that all feel pretty similar overall.Everyone should play this, wholly reccommended.And dont lose Maya, like i did.

												I recently bought State of Decay from Steam’s summer sale for around 4€ and I don’t think I’ve ever been happier with a game purchase. I’ve heard/read people saying it’s a good game but didn’t realise it was SO addicting too.Let’s start by explaining what the whole game is about, without spoilers of course. It’s zombie apocalypse time and you are one of the survivors. You aid other survivors, build a community, search for supplies like food, gas, ammunition and weapons to survive.You have the freedom to move around the open world how you like, set up a base (home) in various locations, choose what kind of services your base has (medical room, library to study, mechanics to fix cars & gear etc.)You can build watch tower in your base, order men to practice shooting, extend the safe zone around your map by sniping everyone around your base, train other neighbouring survivors in your camp in exchange of goods.You can take over empty buildings like gas stations, cafeterias etc. and build outposts there. Outpost have a ‘safe zone’ around them, where zombies will not spawn so it’s a good place to have a breather. Outpost also grant you access to your base supplies, so you can quickly switch weapons and other gear there.Your base has a radio that helps you keeping in contact with other survivors and NPCs in the world. This is also how you will get most of your quests, distress calls etc. You can contact your base via radio and ask them to track specific supplies for you - or you can just scavenge around and search houses and buildings for everything usefull.You can load stuff you find in your backbag and in trunk of a car. When you can’t carry more, you can ask base to send runners who will make their way to your location and loot the place. You can wait for the runner and aid him in returning the goods back home, or go your merry way and let them do it without you. They are usually quite handy with their weapons, though it all depends on what gear you are giving to your community.Sometimes they chew more than they can handle and might end up surrounded by zombies, trapped in house etc. If you like your buddies, you go and help ‘em - or let them struggle alone. If you don’t offer any help, that has an impact in your own reputation within the group. So basically, don’t ♥♥♥♥ around and help your own men. Also helping neighbours and other communities has it’s benefits.The more people you have living in your base, the more rations they take up per day. The more people you have, the more security you have. The more people you have, the more inner problems you have. People will occasionally get mad at each other, have sleeping problems, fear the outside world. Quite often you can solve these issues - but there’s bound to happen something nasty eventually.You start the game by controlling one person. After a while you gain more friends and allies and you can then control them too. Once a person is too badly wounded or too tired, you can then switch to another person and keep doing the tasks required to survive, while others rest and keep up the base. (Guard the perimeter, cook food, hunt for supplies, fix broken equipment, manufacture traps, silencers, bullets etc.)The world inside State of Decay goes on, even when you are offline. The event gradually slow down, the more time you are away from game and in three (3) days the time will be almost at stand still. So, if you have a real life too and log in the game next day, be prepared. Something might have happened to your community while you were away.If you are into zombie/post apocalyptic game this game is a must buy. I highly recommend it. Oh and remember, if you ♥♥♥♥ up and someone dies, he/she is dead for good. I was saddened to see my favorite guy die just because I was too cheap with healing kits.			"

												Zombie survival at its finest. Great game play, awesome open world experience with zombies. The zombies are a threat in large number but easy to deal with in small numbers. Looting is enjoyable and rewarding at times other frustrating when zombies keep coming from the noise your making. Level up characters can make you think about who you take out on supply runs and how careful you plot your moves when dealing with large groups of zombies or special zombies. Shooting is good but you have to keep in mind that the zombies will start coming to you the longer you stay in one place shooting rounds off. Interactions with other characters is there but with other survior groups things can be improved upon trading mainly. over all I still stick by my first line and I do suggest this game to someone look for a good zombie survival game with a open world. And there is upcoming DLC for a endless how long can you survive that scales the zombies up the longer you live.			"

I enjoyed this game greatly and was looking forward to more of the bugs to be worked out. But it seems they have rereleased this game to us instead of patching or fixing it with the claim that they are using the new DX11 to justify it. So if they fixed it for their ""new release"" I would assume they have no intention on fixing it for the original game and dlc's. This was one of those companies that was heading in the right direction but have lost track of the value of a majority fanbase.			"

												I absolutely do not recommend anybody purchase this game. It has been abandoned and the numerous issues still surrounding it will never be given attention or fixes as the developer has now moved onto a ""remastered"" version of the game called ""Year One"" -- all updates, all improvements, all fixes, are now part of Year One Edition and that is a paid upgrade.Yes, the developers and publisher are now charging for updates and patches. They trotted out some inane rubbish with lots of grovelling and heartfelt pleas about how they really would give the update away for free if they could afford it, honest! really!So no, do not buy this game. It is abandoned.Do not buy Year One Edition either, because the developers are untrustworthy, duplicitous con artists.			"

												Found the game very enjoyable but became burnt out on it very quickly, its incredibly repetetive with a very short storyline surrounded by filler side missions (mostly involving useless AI's that cant do ♥♥♥♥ for themselves). Combat is fun, the feeling of survival is VERY strong and immersive and the range of weapons (both ranged and melee) are pretty darn impressive. Not to mention for all those people who love their eye candy.. fairly good graphicsThe main thing that gets me with this game however is that the survivors you work with overall are just... useless. Your base's radio operator is constantly spamming you with messages about how ""so and so has wandered into a horde of zombies like a dumbass and you need to save them!"", you go and save his/her ♥♥♥ and then another message comes in about another idiot who's achieved the same thing (sometimes even the same guy! xD) Ultimately you dont really connect with any of the characters in that most of the lines and voices (there is very little variety in this regard) are just copy and pastes from one person to another, all in all i would estimate about 5 voices for each gender. One thing i always like in my games especially open-world ones are the mods! there are quite a lot of different mods for this game involving things like little tweaks to zombies, combat, vehicles ect and big stuff like base overhauls and porting weapons and vehicles from the DLC into the main game. Probably put an extra 20 hours into the game thanks to this.The game is certainly worth buying for a zombie fan if you've got cash to spare or it's on sale but dont expect to be playing it for months to come, its a very short but sweet playthrough for most people i have spoken to despite the flawsI would rate this game a 7/10 and i hope that people find this review i made useful			"

												I absolutely do not recommend anybody purchase this game. It has been abandoned and the numerous issues still surrounding it will never be given attention or fixes as the developer has now moved onto a ""remastered"" version of the game called ""Year One"" -- all updates, all improvements, all fixes, are now part of Year One Edition and that is a paid upgrade.Yes, the developers and publisher are now charging for updates and patches. They trotted out some inane rubbish with lots of grovelling and heartfelt pleas about how they really would give the update away for free if they could afford it, honest! really!So no, do not buy this game. It is abandoned.Do not buy Year One Edition either, because the developers are untrustworthy, duplicitous con artists.			"

												After about 17 hours I finished the campaign, and I enjoyed this game very much!Let me give you all some pros and cons from my perspective:Your mission is to survive and make your stand with others like you, gather supplies and look for shelter is the first thing that comes to mind, and also try to kill everything in a specific area to try and create a ""safe zone"", which is actually impossible since the zombies will eventually spawn there again. I saw a horde spawn right next to me right after I got out of the car once, I disliked this aspect of the game to say the truth, it killed the ""sneaking"" feeling of hunting down and intercepting enemies before they reach the area you just cleared.A car is your best friend in this game, they are just ridiculously over powered. Once you unlock the vehicle delivery radio assistance you are pretty much invincible, that makes the game really fun because you can go out playing bowling simulator with zombies in the streets... But it's a huge con in my opinion, the game gets too easy. A fuel system would be a good idea to implement, and also a specialization system to turn the cars on, it feels really weird that every car in the city is open, with infinite gas and the keys just sitting there in the ignition...When you die you die for real, and since there's not a manual save option in the game make sure to press f4 when you see you're not going to make it... When you die you switch to another survivor from your group which is friendly to you, or if you don't have any friends you just get a random guy. I died once and decided to restart the game, learned my lesson the hard way.Once you progress enough in the game you can relocate your base, the best option is the Snyder Trucking Warehouse. You need at least 12 people in your group to move there, and once it's up and running you are going to feel untouchable, since you can have up to 8 outposts, and the consequence of that is a very big safe zone for you to chill during the zombie apocalypse.Regarding the other survivor groups that appears during the game, the only thing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off is the fact that you lose trust with them, if for example you approach them with a car, you get a penalty for ""reckless driving"" and they also can catch on fire if you throw a molotov near them, don't even think about using guns, unless you are alone, they will get in your way and get hit. But if you swing a machete or a sledgehammer in their head nothing will happen... It would also be really cool if other survivor groups could attack you, trying to steal your supplies or even your base.You lose stamina and even health as time goes on, the only option to get better is to switch characters and let the other one rest. But most people really don't want to go out playing with another survivor, there should be an option to rest and wake up rested the next day. It's also much more difficult to play in the night, you do have a flashlight, but other than that everything else is completely dark, all you can see are the red eyes of the zombies, and that's awesome! I remember one time when I went on a mission to retrieve a watch for one of the survivors, I had to go to the starting area of the game, and I went there after the sunset and managed to explode my car trying to jump a broken bridge, which attracted a lot of zombies, and there wasn't any other vehicle nearby. All I had with me was an axe and some firecrackers, I had to sneak all my way through the woods, and use the firecrackers to get the attention of the nearby hordes so I could get the damn watch and gtfo of there, I felt like I was in the game at that moment, and that's when I thought, this game is awesome! Totally recommended!			"

												NOTE: This review is months old so the game might be different (and $10 cheaper) now. To those who think you're being original asking how I can 'not recommend' it with 200 hours logged... it's been remarked upon, check the other comments. I'm not saying it's terrible, just that I didn't really recommend it- read the whole review, not just the red thumb, you might decide the positives outweigh the negatives for you. Also, I didn't actively play for 200 hours.State of Decay's a good game, and a mediocre 'simulation.' Unfortunately it insists on trying to be a simulator too much and the result is a flawed game that demands respect but does little to respect the player's time. SOD has an impressive open world with most buildings having multiple entry ports. These buildings are part of the world and require no loading as do some games. This is necessary because at any time you might need to escape into or out of a building as zombies attack. There are also multiple sites for 'home bases' which is nice but are not without problems: restrictions on facilities that don't make sense, barbed wire fences that block players but not zombies, etc.The zombies themself are well-done, and most can be outrun or fought without much difficulty... until the complications start. Like running from one pack of them right into another, or having one come around the corner just as you've used up your last bit of strength. There are also special zombies, some of which tend to be pretty annoying because of their quick lethality and insane hitpoints. I find the zombie hordes to be much more enjoyable, as they lead to more tense moments and thrilling fights\escapes\deaths. There are quite a few characters in the game that can be found or not found randomly in most cases. Sometimes you'll only know one was there when you find a corpse. Others can be recruited and, if you earn enough ""trust"" from them, become playable. This brings up a strange mechanic of the game: who are they trusting? The game does not have a 'main' player character (though you always start as the same guy) and affords no opportunity to create one. Instead the player switches between different survivors encountered. While many of the possible characters have interestings traits and appearances, it would be nice to be able to create one, and this would make more sense mechanically than having a pool of survivors share nebulous resources like 'trust' and 'influence'. It would seem such an idea runs afoul of the designers' narrow philosophical approach to the game; more on that later. Unfortunately many of the random characters end up feeling generic, even to the point of sharing the same voices. Because you can't see someone's traits before recruiting them, it's a crapshoot if you get a useless drunk or a warrior doctor. Since it's not easy to kick people out, one strategy\exploit is to constantly recruit survivors and then purposely kill the weak ones by guiding them into a group of zombies. That such a tactic need exist points to a need for improvement in the game.The quest missions are good, though there are not many of them; most of the time will be taken up by a series of ""SOS"" style requests for assistance that get annoying because of their frequency. It would seem that the survivors whom the player is not controlling exist solely to get in trouble and make the player divert from whatever task he or she was doing and rescue them. It gets very tiring to hear the radio operator keep calling out ""Aren't you going to help our friends"" again and again as you're trying to find the supplies to keep the base going. Also annoying is the fact that there are some quest missions you can let linger for as long as you'd like, and others that resolve (i.e. fail) on their own, but the game doesn't differentiate between the two types for you. This feeds into the idea that the devs wanted to force the player to choose between competing tasks, but ends up just overloading the game and stopping the players from doing what they want... unless you're okay with one of your survivors dying because you were across the map. Guns and other weapons are plentiful and varied, the latter perhaps unnecessarily (how many blunt objects do I really need?). Ammunition is so scarce that it makes some guns nearly useless but there are ways when you want to just open up with an M60. And yes, doing so will draw plenty of zombies, so a silenced .22 pistol is much more effective. Weapons are fun to use in general. Survivors can 'level up' with different weapons, making them seem like an investment, a nice feature that could have been used even more: how about experienced survivors stop needing their hands held? There is no save option (but on exit) and the game enforces permadeath. Moreoever there is a rudimentary 'simulation' (more of a calculation upon restarting the game) that bases itself on how long you've gone without playing and the state of decay (see what I did there?) at the time of quitting. It might just take away a bunch of your influence and resources, or it might cause all sorts of other problems if you had to quit while things weren't hunky-dorey (i.e. without clearing infestations, raising morale, etc). This is the biggest problem I have with the game, as it sits there on my steam shelf threatening me, saying ""if you don't play me now, you might as well never come back."" So I tend not to go back. Changing one's system clock can circumvent the process, but that seems like a ridiculous workaround. While the game slows down time progression after a couple days, it's a very poor choice to have such a mandatory 'feature' for people who may only have a couple hours every few days to play. You'll log in hoping to progress your game, but instead be forced to try and make up lost ground. It hurts what could be a great game to pick up and put down occasionally. The developers want the game played a certain way and stress that they are trying to simulate a zombie apocolypse, rather than make another game like ""Dead Rising."" Unfortunately, SOD doesn't do better as a simulation. The player is always having seemingly every task delegated to him or her, but is expected to play as just another NPC. It's clear that if the player weren't around, things would collapse (at least given what happens when the player logs off to attend to real life for a few days), yet you lose 'influence' (i.e. money) by putting a weapon in storage (the store) and taking it back out again. Again, there is an exploit to avoid this, but there shouldn't need to be one. I could get behind the theme of a zombie game that focuses less on individuality, but I'd want it to be done better; maybe an isometric like Jagged Alliance... except with zombies. It would be nice to see other survivors going about their tasks instead of only hearing from them when they need help, for example.Had the developers made the permadeath, save system and 'simulation' into a recommended or 'hardcore' feature, the game would be quite better off, as would players who could make that choice. The open world, while a little small, is quite good and does feel somewhat populated (particularly before various locales get overrun via the storyline). Walking or driving around feels 'right,' even when it is a little annoying to have to drive across the map. I'd recommend this game to someone who really wants to get addicted; it can make you want to do just one more thing before bed, taking up lots of time. It also does 'open world' quite well. But if you don't have that time available, I would be wary. I came down on the side of ""not recommending"" in general largely because the developers are so strident about their 'vision' that they not only don't include some basic gaming conventions (i.e. save slots), but actively disassociate from them. Just because something is popular doesn't always make it bad, and making something harder doesn't necessarily make it good.			"

												State of Decay has one of the best plots that Gamers have been craving. An open world zombie game, that you can explore, build shelter, scavenge food, and so forth. Altough it doesn't deliever on all their promised points.+ Great Concept+ Addictive+ Interesting (and altough somewhat annoying) Characters+ Scavenging and organizing stuff for your camp is rewarding+ I've personally encountered few bosses- Very repetetive gameplay- Very repetetive dialogue- Too easy, theres no difficulty option..- Not Very rewarding loot-AND WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ IS IT NO MULTIPLAYER?I've been waiting for this type of game for a while, ive always wanted to be the masterming of a zombie apocalypse, i like the fact that when you die as a character, he or she is gone forever. You shouldn't mess around in this world. This is serious business. But it's too easy! During my so far 13 hour gameplay ive died ONCE. It makes scavenging, and ""having a chat"" with your fellow survivors feel like a chore.Good Concept, Good Game, Could've been alot better.7/10 "

												Bought this game on release. One year later they bring out another version of this game called Year One Survival Edition (http://store.steampowered.com/app/329430/) and......stopped the supported for the previous version. But instead of giving the remastered version for free to owners of the previous, you are supposed to purchase it again. This is not acceptable and therefore I am voting the game down. Other publishers made this better. Gave you either the redux for free or for a cheaper price. I CANNOT RECOMMEND TO BUY A GAME FROM THOSE DEVELOPERS. To the substance of the game. It has interesting parts, but graphics are not that good and gameplay gets boring very fast. Overall I was disappointed that I purchased it. The menu are very confusing and could have been made more clear. The survival aspect is not worth the money.NOT RECOMMENDED (5/10)			"

												While the game itself is fun, the dev's are terrible supporters of their product. The game was a mediocre console port, with glaring issues for the pc (performance, gfx, controls, interface/gui, etc.) While most issues weren't completely gamebreaking, they added up to enough to make me quit the game until propper support was released.Two DLC's (one of which was originally announced to be free) and one year later, glaring bugs and issues are still abound, with no support. Now, they have announced the Year One Survival Edition - which includes the original SoD + DLCs + added content + gfx update + some bug/control fixes. Sounds great! Except they want to charge another $30, AND drop all support for the original SoD.edit: Since this game is no longer supported, just get YOSE edition when it goes on sale for ~$5-10.6\10			"

												For all of you looking for a true zombie survival game, you've come to the right place.  You're going to spend a ridiculous amount of time having stories to share with your friends unfold before your eyes.The base game has an enjoyable story, though it's the sandboxy feel that goes along with it that makes this game an excellent one.  You are continually capable of working toward your next story goal at your own pace, though if you're like me you'll find the majority of the game is spent exploring, collecting supplies, building up your base, dealing with other survivor groups, gaining skills for you survivors, etc.  Every character has a unique backstory and there are -a lot- of survivors out there that you might run into and have join you.The base building is simple, yet very enjoyable as well.  Depending on what skills your survivors have, different options are available and you have plenty of options available to you.  Do you want to be able to support more survivors?  Build a bunkhouse and a garden so that they have a comfortable place to sleep and food to eat if your scavenged supplies run low.  Looking to cut back on the sneaking around and really take the fight to the zombies?  An infirmary will keep your survivors healthy and a munitions shop will keep them well armed.  Just remember, even healthy, well armed survivors might run into a challenge when facing off against the 'freaks' or special zombies.The Breakdown DLC removes the deep story aspect of the the vanilla campaign, though it adds a brand new achievement system that unlocks 'hero' survivors that, more often than not, are more capable than your average survivor.  This mode also has 'Breakdown Levels', each time you complete one you move on to the next, more challenging phase, with new survivor achievements to unlock.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the zombie survival genre.  I'd been looking for a game like this for a very long time and was extremely happy when I installed it and truly learned what it was all about.  Enjoy and I'd love to hear your stories!			"

												NOTE: This review is for the original version of State of Decay (which sadly is no longer available for purchase), not the Year One Survival edition.State of Decay is a third-person open-world zombie apocalypse game where you build and fortify a base of operations, recruit survivors, and scavenge for useful items and vehicles. It's a highly addictive, frequently tense, and often action-packed game that exceeded all my expectations, and I strongly recommend it.  While you initially start by playing one survivor, as more people are saved and given shelter in your community you'll be able to switch back and forth between a dozen or more playable characters. This becomes a necessity, as survivors will get injured (or even permanently killed) or just flat-out exhausted when performing missions, and will need time to recuperate. Characters have a handful of skills such as melee combat, fitness, or shooting that will level up with use, and some survivors you recruit will even turn out to have special talents, such as an expert gardener who can increase the amount of food supplied by the greenhouse you built at your base, or a munitions expert who can use your workshop to create useful items such as pipe bombs or mines. Your community as a whole has a morale level that you need to keep reasonably high by completing missions and scavenging supplies, or risk adverse results such as a survivor abandoning the group, or even deciding to off themselves. Influence is also measured and plays a huge factor. Provide for and assist the community and you'll be able to equip yourself with better gear from the group's communal supply, convince another survivor to tag along and watch your back, or direct the group's radio operator to keep an ear out for the location of especially needed supplies. Slack by letting missions expire or by failing to scavenge enough useful items, and you'll end up poorly equipped and with minimal clout until you can turn things around.While there's a variety of activities and missions to take part in - rescuing newly discovered survivors and getting them back to base safely; hunting down relatively rare boss zombies (or ""weird ones"" as the characters sometimes refer to them); working your way through several threads of primary story missions; or simply trying to return home in one piece with that valuable case of medicine or that fragile high-end sports car you happened across - there's no doubt that Decay is primarily about fighting zombies. And seeing as how they're virtually everywhere, you can't outrun them beyond short distances (zombies don't get winded, but you definitely will, often at the most inopportune times), stealth is only practical on occasion, and vehicles are too fragile to be used as your main zombie-killing method, you'll be engaging zombies quite frequently whenever you're away from your base. There's a reasonable variety of nicely-done fighting animations. Special combat moves can be unlocked as your skills improve, and that weakling survivor who started out by barely being able to swing a pipe and had trouble defeating even a single zombie without getting gnawed on rather extensively can become a real powerhouse in time, rendering an encounter with a few zombies as nothing more than an annoyance, and even becoming capable of wading into the middle of an entire horde of half a dozen zombies or more and coming out alive (although almost certainly not unscathed). While guns are a relatively common find, making noise in Decay generally leads to bad things happening, so you'll likely be doing most of your killing hand to hand. The noise from bashing in a door or a zombie's skull, the engine of a vehicle, or even just searching through an abandoned house can be enough to alert a nearby zombie or two; firing off a few shots from a pistol, shotgun, or rifle, even one with a suppressor attached, seems to bring every zombie for blocks around running, and is best done only as a last resort, or when you're a few steps away from a nearby vehicle or the safety of your base, or in the handful of story missions where you actually have some significant backup. Fortunately, even though you may do it hundreds of times by game's end, sprinting up to a zombie so you can dropkick it to the ground and then finishing it off by driving your knee through its face never really gets old. It's a thoroughly addictive game, building and improving your base and leveling up your various survivors. It's also often a surprisingly tense one. The game has a day/night cycle, so half the time you're in the dark, and getting a request to clear out a nearby infested warehouse or hunt down a dangerous boss zombie when you can barely see ten feet in front of you is unlikely to be something you'll look forward to. Even during the day, some of the structures you'll enter will be shrouded in darkness, with a zombie unseen (but fortunately usually not unheard) ready to pounce from some dark corner. And of course there's the ever-present threat of permadeath. No matter how badass your survivor is, there's always the possibility that a fight will spiral out of control, that beating one zombie to re-death makes enough noise to alert another, and fighting that one draws in two more, and suddenly routine combat has turned dire and potentially deadly. That one time you keep your injured, exhausted, broken-weaponed, out-of-healing-items survivor out extra long because you're low on influence and you've decided to search one more house for supplies may also be the one time they manage to accidentally alert a nearby horde. Which quite possibly will lead to you becoming an unwilling witness to the rather brutal death animation. Decay is not without some issues. There are minor annoyances, such as the lack of variety in the vehicles, or the fact that despite gasoline being a salvageable resource nobody thought to bring a generator along and you're forced to stumble around your base bumping into walls in the dark with an under-powered flashlight. But there are a few more serious issues as well. At least one side mission failed to trigger. One of my survivors clipped into a piece of furniture and became stuck, forcing me to exit mid-mission and lose progress, while on another occasion a favorite survivor became inexplicably glued to a structure's outside wall, making her a nice easy target for a charging boss zombie and getting her killed (on the final story mission, no less). And the game essentially continues to play after you exit, with the continued, unseen scavenging and activities of the community members simulated the next time the game is launched, and while that lends it an interesting twist, it has a tendency to cause overtly negative events, such as illogical, precipitous morale drops, and some players even reporting returning after an absence to find significant items or survivors themselves having disappeared without even a journal entry of explanation.Ultimately though, those issues have little bearing on the overall experience, and the positives far outweigh any negatives. In short, not only is State of Decay the most enjoyable game I've played in recent memory, it's quite probably my favorite game of 2013.			"

												They are now releasing State of Decay with better graphics and we can just all hope we get upgraded since its we who bought the game that made this possible, but not likly since they have gotten a new name on it ""State Of Decay Year One Survival Edition"". and for all of us who bought the game and all its DLC's we have to buy a new game even thou its the same game and only get 33% off the full price, when ppl do this i stop supporting that company/ppl on every new release they have, since they cant upgrade the ppl who made them money to begin with, so this is a rip off, dont buy. Better to go and play farmville on facebook sadly, at least they dont ask you to take it in the brown eye and then ask you to lick it clean afterwards. But latly there have been alot of this crap going around with giving the game away for free after ppl allready have bought it, so the ppl who used money on it feel like they are treated badly since the guys who didnt support the game by buying it gets it for free.

												Yeah...Dont think I'm willing to burn away $30 for a game I already own. For those interested who have NOT originally bought and played this game, State of Decay is actually a really fun game. For me it did a pretty damn good job at making it seem like you were actually surviving. Going out to scavange, ammo is sparse, there's permadeath, you have to build your base and maintain it. It felt like zombie survival. Sure it was buggy...really buggy at times but it was still fun. So after however long it's been since I've played it I figured I'd give it another play....only to find out that the game I have is garbage and have to buy it again in order to play itThis is terrible, this is a scam. You cant update the game and delete the original. What was so hard to just fix the actual game? So no. I'm not gonna rebuy the game I already own. For people who havent played it, I'd recommend it...for those who own the game...dont bother. You already own this game			"

												Was a great zombie survival at one point, until the developers decided it would be a great idea to rerelease the same game in HD, and screw their fanbase over by leaving us with a buggy and poorly optimized game.At the timeof release, I really really wanted to like this one; but the ""state of decay"" the game is in now is an understatement.The developer pushed their customer's good faith too far and their new HD release (with bug fixes!) shoved Undead Labs back into obscurity. Literally forcing you to buy the same title, for a patch and some new paint.TLDR; Don't buy it, was worth it at one point; not anymore.			"

""IT'S GOOD RIGHT? I MEAN IT DOESN'T SUCK.""I still remember it. 3 years ago. 4th September. I was about to date one of the most bomb girl you ever saw. And guess what? What I was doing instead of doing what I was suppose to do? Well, I believe you got it right. Since this is review of State of Decay and I mentioned it just now for the first time, your answer is State of Decay. Alright, enough of sentiment, let's get into the game. Story starts out pretty weak, again with lot of questions and as usual you are just ordinary citizen of small US town and after a while zombie-killing machine. The whole story itself is really not that important, at least wasn't for me, it's about enjoying that zombie rampage, enjoying RPG elements and just trying to survive. Really good thing is, that you can die, your friends can die, people in your house can die but you will take the control of somebody else and you'll continue. That's really awesome. Way more better if it was just ""you die, game over"" cliche. AI is really really weak. No matter if it's zombies or survivors, it's both really low. Survivors are absolutely not independent. It's not like I do mind taking care of somebody else, but thing is that they can't take care of themselves and that's it.Getting supplies, scavenging town, building rooms in your house, upgrading your house,, building new spots and making area secure is one of my most favorite elements out of this game. Audio is not really strong side of State of Decay and visuals are not that good either, but there's no reason to turn away from it.  Game will last you estimated 12 +- hours and price point is fair. You can extend that time period by buying two DLCs which are basically worth buying. I will make more in-depth reviews on both on their respective Store Page. So now just few sentences.Breakdown - This DLC does not carry any story, it's just basically let you do infinite survival. You're unlocking different heroes and try to survive as long as possible. Hordes are spawning fast, and supplies going away fast too. When you run out of everything you'll use your RV to get out. And to be honest that's it. Get it for 2,49€ in sale.Lifeline - You are in control of Greyhound One unit on your way to rescue scientists. New map, new characters and new weaponry. It'll extend your gaming experience by 3-4 hours. Linear but still fun. Again, get it in sale and you're good.Get both for achievements.To sum it up, pretty nice zombie survival game for good money, pretty enjoyable and you can play it even second time and still enjoy it. Easy achievements and killing hordes is fun. Weak AI and audio but you can live with that. Most definitely worth the shot.Bonus Point: Wheat FieldsRating: 8/10 "

Literally nothing changed while I was gone. Not too many patches and the game is a poor port that struggles to push 45FPS on a good rig.Then the ""Year One"" edition came out so you can buy the exact same game with the exact same stuff again but with basic patching and ""better textures"".Trusted devs, got stabbed in the back.

												State of Decay, is a zombie game that focuses on survival. Population size is dwindling along with the resources you can find throughout the city you explore. Time is not on your side, the world will persist even when you are not playing. Finding a fortifiable location to barricade from zombie hordes is critical to winning the game.ProgressionAs you progress through the story you are given certain facilities to use as your headquarters, once you hit a certain point of the game you are allowed to re-allocate your base.SurvivalThe main game focuses on a balance between survival, difficulty and story. Any character you play can be killed off by zombies and stay dead. There is no way to bring them back other than starting over again or attempting to exit the game before it auto-saves. Some characters clearly have better traits than others especially the first guy you play as. If you let them die, you will be disadvantaged. Training multiple characters to be strong and capable of survival is critical. Breakout DLCThe DLC is survival oriented with the story stripped out, which results in a good experience, not interrupted by constantly redoing cinematics or certain missions over and over. Instead, it allows you to play at your own pace and repair the van to proceed to the next difficulty. Every trip reduces the total amount of resources within the city, scales the damage of the enemies up, and reduces the amount of cars available.Persistent WorldA major con to some people but also appealing to others is the persistent world. Alot of people dislike the fact that while you're away from the game the resources are depleting every day. The people who play more hours a day have a much greater benefit than those who play few hours or attempt to play it casually.			"

I also understand that they payed extra to get more content. Which is well in good but you could at least send down the bug fixes so we can play the game again. This killed an impecable game which I throughly enjoyed. In short another great game killed by greedy devs. Game 6/10 Devs 0/10			"

												Sod was a good game, though it did have some minor bugs, with worthwhile DLCs.The makers though decided to give a middle finger to this games owners by deciding to package up future bugfixes and every other improvement into a 'special edition' of the game. Rather then push bugfixes for the game - as they should - and release the enhanced content - New weaponry, missions, graphics - as a DLC they decided to wrap everything up into a entirely new game.Owners of this game were given  the ♥♥♥♥♥ end of the stick - You want bug fixes? Ok, just buy this game again!			"

												I don't normally post reviews and before today I would have posted a positive review. Today I thought to myself, I haven't played State of Decay in a while, that would be a lot of fun. But wouldn't you know it, the damn thing doesn't work! Completely unplayable. The Undead Labs logo screen freezes and after a Ctrl-Alt-Del I get to the menu and the text is just black boxes which are located nowhere near where the text should be. I tried my luck, clicking around on the screen to try and just get into the game, but the game itself is just a black screen with some coloured boxes at the bottom. This game was great, but I cannot play it and I think it's absolutely ♥♥♥♥ that the developers/publishers won't migrate players to the newer version or at the very least release a patch so I can play the game that I PAID FOR.

												At first you may thought that...typical ""owh, it's another generic zombie game"" ... but don't... it's not, it's better... Have you watch/read/play the Walking Dead series? No? than you should...if yes, feel it's different than other zombie genre? cause that's how State of Decay will make you feel. Have you try DayZ? or Rust, or Borderlands or other apocalyptic games. which most of it focus on 'multiplayer' or 'coop'. If that what you digg, than good for you. What if you didn't? what if you want to play a single player experience and proceed at your own pace. Without having to deal with 'a**hat' in online game, that will ruins your game by killing you at the glimpse of your body. Than, this is your game. A single player experience of zombie game that you never play before.This game is not about all out killing zombies. It's more of a base management simulation. When it make you feel/think how to survive day and night, while managing a group of survivors. Like how Rick have to, in Walking Dead. Gathering resources is not because you want to, but only just because you need. Take only what you have to, and leave the rest for later. Resources are scatter.. and limited for the whole map. No respawn of resources. You may see the map kinda small, but after you travel, it is really big. Lot of places to scavange. Lot of story to unfold. Roleplay a bit on your journey. It will make the game better. Take the limitation in game as a challenges, on what you can do in order to overcome those obstacles, such as storage limits etc.  Feel the need to survive, in this State of Decay.			"

												Hello guys!For all of you (like me) who struggle(d) with the issue of game freezing after Undead Labs logo, dispair not! There is a simple fix : create a .cfg file named ""user.cfg"" with these simple parameters : r_Fullscreen=1r_Width=1920r_Height=1080or any of your liking, depending on your monitors native resolution, then place the file in the ""Game"" folder in the game`s install directory so : Steam/steamapps/common/State of Decay/Game. Now you`re set to go! Game engine will render scenes and text properly. But remember not to touch the resolution sliders as it will result in a crashdump. You can only alter the details slider (which will be set to min by default).Now, for setting up AA, this is what you will have to do if you have an Nvidia card : SGSSAAOpen State of Decay driver profile via NVIDIA Inspector.Change Antialiasing compatibility to 0x000012C1[4]Change Antialiasing - Mode to Override any application settingChange Antialiasing - Setting to 4x [4x Multisampling] or 8xQ [8x Multisampling]Change Antialiasing - Transparency Supersampling to 4x Sparse Grid Supersampling or 8x Sparse Grid SupersamplingApply changes. This method is very performance demanding and may decrease your general performance.FXAAIf you are a NVIDIA user enable FXAA from NVIDIA Control Panel or NVIDIA Inspector.Or use FXAA Tool.SMAAUse injectSMAA by mrhaandi.Or use SweetFX by CeeJay.dk.I will leave my source for all the information I`ve posted, but you can find more there, so check it out : http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/State_of_Decay.

												Do not buy this game, allow for me to explain.I played this game for hours on my 360, before I knew how great gaming on a PC was. I used to go to Undead Lab's website and look forward to everything they would post however now I see who they truly are. Once on PC, the game itself ran decently, however as I continued playing I noticed constant frame droppings for no reason. I also took note of the animations in the game, they seemed really awkward. The textures also seemed to look dull, I was expecting them to look a bit sharper considering this was running on CRYengine but never mind that. A remastered version was coming out to the new consoles, which means an update for us!!!! .... kind of.We too on PC got the Year One version however what it is, is simply an update to this version of SoD. Literally an update, you are literally being forced to pay a fee for an update. This version of the game seemed to be dropped and they will only continue updating the new version. Shame on you, Undead Labs. I don't think I will be purchasing another UL game for now.			"

												Game is extremely meh. It's repetitive, grindy, and feels incomplete/unfinished especially with its joke of an ending. Base building is super shallow and relationships between survivors are nonexistent. AI is atrocious for survivors and zombies. If you're in a siege mission, then all your AI companions do is stand still and board up windows while the only thing that zombies do is attack the boarded windows. Big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s don't enter the house, they just ram into it which damages the boards. You literally have to exit the house and kill the zombies outside to progress things.Your survivors constantly go missing/get stuck/need to be rescued, hordes constantly spawn, infestations constantly spawn, special zombies constantly spawn, etc. The game simulates itself when you're not playing it so if you don't want to come back to a game where all your neighbors are dead, all your supplies are drained, and your group is missing, then enjoy babysitting constantly to quit the game on a good note. You can also just keep the game indefinitely paused to prevent this.There are few home sites, and only 2 of them are any good.Scavenging is pointless if you play for long periods of time. Despite having a day/night cycle, days only pass during simulation. Supplies only drain when you're not playing the game and you can easily overstock on everything in about 30-45 minutes.The game is also incredibly easy. After clocking in about 30 hours, I only died once and that's because I was trying to make my experience as hard as possible.Mechanics are easily abusable. Stuck alone with no health and a feral chasing you? Switch to a character in your home base and then switch back to your character. He/she will teleport immediately back to base.Game is very short too. You can easily beat it in 8-10 hours.I guess the best thing I can say is the port is very faithful to the 360 original. They even ported over all the bugs and glitches!Almost nothing has changed in this game from when it was an Early Access title to a full fledged release. There are no graphical customization options, limited resolution options, awful performance, and mouse acceleration.The DLC looks like it might be fun but I'll stay away from it until it's sub-$5.My full review:

												What starts off as an interesting and fun open world zombie survival game, quickly turns into a chore of repeating the same tasks over and over again. Not only this but the 'main' missions are very few and far between meaning you have to wait, without any notice of when the next mission will come, to continue the main plot of the game.

												This is a pretty solid game, very difficult at times, but then a zombie apocalypse would probably be difficult.  The ability to choose safe houses and upgrade resource providing buildings while having to maintain and keep them safe is interesting in terms of providing an almost RTS-esque play style.That being said if any of this appeals to you, Buy the new version for like $35.  I will not be purchasing that because I bought it on sale years ago, played it and loved it.  Figuring ""hey ill wait a few months and  reinstall the full version"" I uninstalled the game and waited.I then found out you had to re-buy the full version even after purchasing the early access.I decided to never buy Early Access again.

												State of Decay is a third-person zombie apocalypse survival game developed by Undead Labs and published by Microsoft. State of Decay is a single player only game.State of Decay gameplay is quite deep, but somewhat repetitive at certain point. At the start of the game, you play as two main characters, Marcus Campbell and Ed Jones as they are ambushed by the living dead. Then you will have a home base where you and other survivors making a stand against the undead. From there, the sandbox play begins. Your home base is where you and your others survivors live, obviously, and it needs supplies to survive. You need to hunt and raid outside to get supplies like foods, medicines, building materials, ammunitions, weapons or fuels. Your home base can also be improved, you can build a workshop, garden, sleeping area and more as long as your home base has the space for them. You can move out from your current home base and find a new bigger or better one too. When you're out there hunting, you may find some neighboring survivors or survivors who may want to join you in your home base. You will also find some driveable civilian vehicles which can also be used as cargo for your scavenged supplies for you to bring home. Your home base will sometimes attacked by approaching zombie hordes. You will need to set up some outpost to defend against these living dead hordes. Outpost will also create a small safe zone outside your home for you to take shelter.In State of Decay, survivors can become tired, injured or sick. When that happen to survivors you currently play, better get home and switch to another survivors. Yes, you can switch characters when you have become friends with them. If a survivor gets tired, his/her max stamina will decrease, same goes when he/she is injured. Survivors will also gain some experience and skill as you play with them, such as cardio, wits (ability to search faster but quiet), fighting, shooting and more. But beware if your survivors is killed, their death is permanent. Survivors can be equipped with melee or firearms, whichever you prefer, but melee weapons will gets damaged over time and will be destroyed if not repaired. Firearms can also gets damaged and if not repaired, will become jammed but not destroyed.Graphics of State of Decay is great, looks good, but not one of those next generation thing. Using CryEngine 3, State of Decay does have good environment view, lightning, good textures, physics and effects. Characters animations are great, when dodging zombies, attacking with melee, it's good. Blood and gore effects are also present in this game, in fact, you can see your survivors getting torn in 2 pieces by the zombies.State of Decay performance is good, but can use more optimization. At maximum setting, the game sometimes but rarely stutters which can ruin your aim when using a gun. Aiming a gun also seems clumsy and quite hard. Otherwise the performance is good and fine.If you're looking for more friendly zombie apocalypse game, then State of Decay is for you, since the game is single player only, you won't find yourself get shot from the back by somebody when you just spawn in the game. With deep gameplay mechanics, State of Decay can entertain you for many hours. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

You left everyone who purchased the whole game and DLC's and decided to publish the updated version as a new game (YOSE) and sell it for a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money to force people to buy it again if they won't to have the game up to date. That's something a blood-sucking company such as EA would do.			"

												You will never get over the beautiful nature and atmosphere in this game. You don't need the YOSE Day One DLC to improve the graphics. I thought they were going to release a normal update but instead they charge you $30 for some simple improvements that you don't need. As for the glitches they aren't bad at all and sometimes aren't even noticeable. It's still beautiful the way it is. If you're one of those people who are into super fast paced massive Rambo shooter garbage games, then this game is not for you. Because it's slow paced and ridiculously relaxing but can also be challenging at the same time. And VERY realistic, because even when you quit the game, it still carries on!This game is a shocker, it's wonderfully made and most probably the best zombie survival game out there. Open world. Excellent vehicle handling and controls. I love the gore. Smooth combats and the NPCs are amazing and not brain-dead. The soundtracks are lovely. And the atmosphere is one of the very best.A true feeling of surviving an apocalypse. Scavenging for resources, such as food, medicines, ammo, fuel and materials to improve your base. Building outposts. Setting up traps to prevent the zeds from nearing your home. Requiring skilled people to be able to do things such as repairing the vehicles, creating weapons and explosives, training the survivors, doing experiments and so much more. Meeting other survivors you can help and trade with. You always need to make sure you are well prepared every time you're out on a mission because you never know when you can encounter a horde or the freaks. Zombies can be hilarious with their not so bright brains but can be distracted with lights and noise such as gun shots, cars, sprinting. But what I like the most, is when someone dies, they're really gone. Which is frustrating, but makes you do your best to survive and be better at the game. It's really amazing! There is so much more things to do! I only wish it had Co-op or multi-player, so I can never stop playing it. But still, I can't get enough of it. I highly recommend it and both DLCs. You get to experience the zombie apocalypse as the army in Lifeline. And you get more of State of Decay in Breakdown. And both are very challenging as well and incredibly fun! Five stars!			"

												While undeniably a fun open world experience that is hands down more entertaining and rewarding than games like DayZ and H1Z1, this game has always been a buggy mess on the PC with graphics that are lackluster at best and a downright mess at worst. To be blunt, it needed a ton of mods to be even minutely enjoyable after an hour or so. It was in desperate need of major patching to fix graphics issues and repair many of the game breaking bugs it suffered from, and finally that improvement is here! All you have to do is repurchase the game and double your monetary investment!			"

												I've been playing Undead Labs's State of Decay for the past several weeks after nabbing it on sale. The game is a single-player third-person zombie apocalypse sandbox of sorts: while the main game has a storyline to follow, you certainly don't need to follow it and the story won't advance until you do, giving you a lot of time to just poke around.I have enjoyed the game very much.  It's certainly interesting enough to play and while it starts out reasonably tame, it can get quite difficult.The main game begins with your character and a buddy returning to the more civilization-adjacent parts of a national park after a two-week fishing trip only to find that, while you were gone, civilization kind of had a major meltdown.  From there, the game focuses on steath and survival by building up friendships with others and establishing a base from which to operate and outposts to reinforce that base and provide small ""safe zones"".CriticismsThe criticisms I have are somewhat picky.  To start, the story is very simple and somewhat shallow — it would be easy to play through it relatively quickly and then be just done with the game.  A lot more could have been done, but, as I understand it this was Undead Labs's first game, and it was made for XBox Arcade with all the limitations that requires -- so we will perhaps see more story development in their next full release.Second, there just isn't enough information in the tutorial; you feel bombarded with information (because a lot comes in through your Journal) that you can't make much sense of — and then lost because basic information (such as the benefits of establishing an Outpost, or whether it's wise to leave resources in Outposts or loot them thoroughly before setting one up in a location) can be a little difficult to find.Third, there are too few voice actors, meaning that you end up with the same voice actors' lines being used for several different characters who end up sounding exactly the same while they say (verbatim) the same things; get two of them with the same voice together on a mission and it can get kind of confusing.Finally: the driving physics and UI need some work.  The game was set up for XBox, so maybe this is where PC players like me start to have problems.  But while I can play Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto and drive just fine, I find the driving in State of Decay frustrating — especially because the smallest mistake can send a car sailing through the air as though it suddenly weighs nothing.  And cars that turn over always explode, so there's that.PraiseMeanwhile, though, State of Decay is nice to look at: the colors are just muted enough to evoke the proper autumn at the end-of-the-world feeling, and there has been a lot of attention to detail in filling out the large area (Trumbull Valley) in which your character gets to roam.  There are three small towns to explore, as well as a lot of countryside, with a lot of interesting things to look at if you appreciate the details.The game also makes you take a step back and figure out how to survive.  Your character can go stealth or maniac, or pretty much anything in between.  But don't count on the zombies to cooperate since that's sure to get your favorite character eaten nearly every time.  And since death is final, that really makes a difference.Strategy and sound are important, which I really enjoy, and on top of that there is also resource management to deal with: you've got a base full of survivors who need food, medicine, and ammunition to remain survivors, and construction materials to keep their base up.  Scavenging through the zombie-infested, burnt-out world is a constant necessity.In the end, the game is definitely worth a few bucks (especially if you can catch it on sale), and I look forward to other games from Undead Labs.Breakdown DLCI've played several hours of the Breakdown DLC (at level 5, currently), and it's been a lot of fun and a lot of frustration, but the frustration really seems to be the point of it.  It's primarily the sandbox version of the base game, with a couple simple tasks to do to ""move to the next level"".  Each level, the zombies get more numerous and more difficult to deal with and the scavenge-able resources get harder to find.If you don't mind that sort of challenge — the one where you are pretty sure you'll ultimately fail — it can end up being a lot of fun.

												wow...that game blew me away.i was never too much into those zombie and/or survival-games...but this title might have changed this :)The mix between scavaging ressources, fighting zombies, driving/walking around the open world and trying to keep your group of survivors alive and sane is pretty well done.The game will push you to do all the above, that you won't end up bored, but it's ""relaxed"" enough to not make it frustrating (imho).Basically all houses in the world can be entered and searched for goods you'll need for your outpost, which adds a lot to the atmosphere as you don't have any locked doors (at least not that i can remember).The world itself is pretty beautiful and detailed, although graphics isn't the big strength of the game, it still is very well done, but it would have been nice to have some tuning options (antialiasing etc pp).Gameplay will become repetitive, with few sidemissions to do, like rescuing other survivors, cleaning out zombie-infested areas and helping other survivor-groups out.But for me, the variety of options you have, makes it interesting all the time because you seemlessly switch between scavenging, doing a sidemission, driving around, sneaking around, looking for better outposts etc. so it never became boring for me (but i could understand if people find it too repetitive).All in all, it's a great zombie-survival open-world game and would recommend it to anyone who even slightly into those games.

												The stealth gameplay is decent if you have the patience for it, melee is more or less a button mash, shooting isn't anything spectacular, but it works good enough. Driving is fairly straightforward, though you can't drive through barriers, making you have to look for the long way around some areas. Honestly, it's a port of an arcade game, so what can you really expect in this regard.There's a permadeath feature in this game, which is an interesting feature, but it serves to highlight State of Decay's biggest problem. There's no reason to care about anyone apart from the intro characters because you'll quickly realize that, past some scripted events at the starting base, dialogue between survivors is generic, and the only real personality you get out of any of them is via their stats sheet.If the people we're supposed to care about in your game/show/movie/whatever don't have unique personalities,  we have ZERO reason to care about whether they live or die. If we can't care about the characters, we can't care about the story they're in. And that's what happened to me. I quit just after getting a new base,TL;DR - An open world zombie survival game where the humans have about as much showable personality as the zombies, possibly even less.  Skip it. "

												You know the feeling where you're playing a game that's kinda terrible but you really really want to level this ♥♥♥♥ so you can finally go to sleep and do it again tomorrow?Turn that entire an entire game and you get State of Decay. It's a flying kick zombie skull crushing base building persistent sandbox world morale mission dating sim with a bevy of uniqueish characters and firearms that is probably actually detrimental to your health. I mean... the game progresses in real time when you're not playing.DLCBreakdown is a survival version of SoD's main map, procedurally populated that allows you to play different characters from the story with unique abilities. Lifeline is an actiony soldiers-kill-zombies-and-rescue-civvies game that is more linear and has a smaller map. It also adds guns and a vehicle or two to the base game. It's probably a 6 hour game if you blew through the missions back-to-back.Worth?I'd say the base game and Breakdown are worth $10. Lifeline would also be worth $10 on it's own. This game is the type most people do one long binge session, then don't touch again. Despite the DLC there's not that much replay value.This game is often on bundle for $10 or less with all DLC.

												Unfortunately, while the game on its own is good, the developers decided that instead of patching the game for free, they would re-release it under the guise of a ""remastered"" edition.

												I tried to like SOD but unfortunately it didn't like me. The game starts well with you straight in the thick of it, which almost made up for the bad cut scenes where my character's feet are glued to the floor. Nothing is explained: the whole inventory, skills, crafting menus are left for you to faff about with until you get the hang of them. The only skill you really need however is inventory management in order to shuffle around all the semi-useless tat you find and carry: putting them in bags, putting them in backpacks, putting things in car boots, driving somewhere and unloading it all again. It's like a packing-for-holiday simulator without the holiday. Friends help out, but sometimes run back to base for no reason. Others won't let you be their friends but occasionally get sad, even though you're doing all the work. You scavenge the same building four times in one street. The same four lines of dialogue are heard again and again. Enemies spawn endlessly from quest locations. On and on and on. Finally comes the best surprise: the game plays itself when you turn it off. All your tiredness goes away (hurrah!), all your stockpiling runs out and all your barracades are taken down (not so hurrah). So that's SOD: it's like my day job. I work hard while others do nothing but get tired, sad or both, the work mounts up faster than I can deal with it, and if I take a day off, I'm twice as busy when I get back. 4/10.			"

												Being a big fan of the zombie culture that has been getting dramatically more popular over the past decade I couldn't tell you how ecstatic I was for the launch of this title. The world isn't in any shortage of zombie games, there being even a few survival style ones out there. I'd like to think I've tried most of them as possible even some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones *coughfortzombiecough*. Typically I'd pass over console titles, but this was different. As a gamer who has played PC games exclusively for around ten years or so I was really biting the bullet when I purchased an XBox and accessories to play just this title alone.I was not dissappointed. Undead Labs delivered a title onto XBox live like no other when it came to this particular niche of the zambonie genre. Even with a broken XBox that I had bought cheap, and a knockoff microsoft controller that had it's share of problems I was having a blast. I watched the world around me change as I began ransacking the county, ventiliating craniums along the way. My survivors honed their skills, as they were being equipped better and stockpiling more, still surprising me to this day with how many weapons there are. The empty courtyards of the bases converted into stat boosting facilities. Hordes moved through town, infesting and congregating at buildings. Other survivor groups came and went. Joined us, or were made into lunch. It was quite pleasant. Unfortunately the general overlay of the map does not change, and even then the console hardware wasn't up to snuff to help matters much either.Then the PC version released. I most certainly was excited to see what was different and when I launched for the first time I was pleasantly surprised. After maxing out the settings it looked like an entirely new game. Through its developement I was a bit salty about the title going to XBox Live, and still think UL would've been better off focusing on it as a PC title to start with but this more than makes up for it. Breakout launches tomorrow, and I've been watching the updates for it. Its going to be good, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed good.If you don't have State of Decay already, you should be ashamed. Its only $20 and you will get your money's worth and then some. The only thing that could make this near perfect zombie game over the top is multiplayer.			"

												This is the first game that I wish had a ""maybe"" to answer the question, ""Would you recommend this game.""State of Decay has many of the things that I have long looked for in a Zombie Survival horror type game. But before I get ahead of myself lets break it down.Graphics are fairly good in my opinion. The specular maps aren't really anything to write home about and the texture resolution will not light the world on fire but for the price and from a small developer they did alright.The sound if pretty satisfying. Different guns and bomb have a variety of splody sounds and I'm not really one to care too much about bass or presence...my gaming rig doesn't even have a sound card O_oStoryline is fairly simple. In the campaign you are a survivor with a friend camping in the mountains when you realize the world has gone to ♥♥♥♥. You meet up with other survivors, find shelter and have quest missions while you try and figure out how to get out of town for good...blah blah blah. To be honest I found the storyline campaign long, and annoying. Far too linear and the fetch quests became really annoying after a while. The rest of this review deals solely with Break Down.Breakdown is the sandbox version of the story campaign with ALL of the storyline elements and quests removed. It lets you set up a base, and ""outposts"" around the town that provide a ""safe area"" where zombies can't spawn into. These outposts can be set up around, food, medical, ammo, or building supplies which can give a bonus to your total supply cache.Scavenging is the major function of this game. Search houses, find anything helpful and take it back to the group. The player is rewarded with ""influence"" points that allow them to set up more outposts, relocate the base, or perform special actions from special characters within their group. A military character will have an ""artillery strike"" option. A priest has ""words of encouragement"" that can remove negative fatigue status from a character. Influence is also needed to remove any supplies a player might take on a scavenging run, guns, ammo, melee weapons, medical supplies or food.Break down's goal is to survive until the ""escape RV"" is located, fixed and supplied. The player then chooses a small group of characters to get on the RV and leave the town. You are then randomly spawned back into the same town and the difficulty increases. More zombies, fewer supplies, harder special zombies.There are a LOT of zombies as well as special zombies. Combat becomes a balance of choosing the right weapon for the right characters. (ie: matching the proper weapons with a characters stats.) Using the right moves in combat that will maximize damage output while minimizing the use of stamina. You will meet randomly generated NPC characters that can join your group. The player is capable of switching between characters and infact HAS to in order for previous characters to rest, or heal from wounds.This is where the tedium comes in. State of Decay is full of crap, awful characters. You will find drunks, slobs, jerks, sleazeballs and s luts. None of whom will aid you in your survival. You have a maximum number of characters that your base can support and the game quickly turns into a macabre ""culling"" of the ""dead weight"" from your group. You can and will take characters out on supply runs and make sure they your ally never returns. Or you may just take direct control of a character and throw them off a cliff to break a leg and be eaten by zombies. You won't do this once, or twice. You will do this as many time as it takes, until the game spawns good characters. The problem is that you don't know the stats of survivors you invite to join you...until they have joined you.This can become mind numbingly boring. The environments are HUGE and mostly empty. You will drive for miles into the country, past farms and fields. There are only two towns in the game. Missions and friendly ""enclaves"" spawn randomly so if you are in the southern most town you can receive a quest on the other end of the freaking map...hope you like driving.Another issue is that the game had ""Early Access"" and I believe it also had a beta and there are still tons of glitches and flaws in this game. There is an active game forum on their website. You can report glitches and the staff is usually quick to respond but I hate small developers turning paying customers into their own game testers. I've been a game tester before and if I'm reproducing a bug for a developer...I'm getting paid for it.State of Decay Vanilla had tons of bugs, many that crashed the game. Before those were fixed, Break Down DLC came out. The bugs still haven't been fixed and they are releasing their second DLC.Inconclusion, I guess I can't recommend State of Decay. If you can get it bundled 75% off or more on a steam sale or humble indie bundle, go for it. But full price...noooooo.			"

												State of Decay takes straight away: once the loading screen disappears, you should become separated from the frock of live dead persons and to drag especially nimble zombie from a neck of the best friend. The shy hope to find rescue on a post of a coast guard quickly disappears — instead of the armed soldiers three ""civil"" frightened to death there huddle. 15 minutes later roaring crowd of walking corpses will break into the house and will relieve survived of need to be afraid. This game will be suitable for fans to kill the zombie. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours). "

												After so many hours of gameplay and updates, the game behaves worse than ever. It is still full of bugs, and its performance has become terrible. When I bought it, before any dlcs were out, I could run it on ultra settings or high and have no problem with the performance, now I cannot run it even on medium settings, it misses frames, there is lagging and several other issues graphic wise. The controls behave horrible especially when you are driving a car, any car. I have a gaming laptop, it's 4 years old and needs to retire and get some rest but it still runs Skyrim, Dragon Age origin, Dragon Age II, Fallout New Vegas, Dead Island, Dead Island Riptide Risen, all 3 of Mass Effect, to name but few, it runs them as it did when it was young without problem. So instead of improving the game they made it worse. Now I see they release it again, probably with every issue fixed but they ask again money for it from their customers, us who bought this crap from the beginning. No I do not recommend to spend your hard earned money for this game. They do not respect us and they try to squeeze more money out of us.			"

												So much potential, squandered. They released the entire game in stages selling it as DLC. The simple fact that normal things like basic replayability was sold to us as DLC was absurd enough, but the hostility of their community managers towards the earlier critics of the game is what caught my interest most of all as I take a keen interest in the use of suppression tactics against gaming media who aren't part of the sycophantic love-bomb crowd. You can tell a lot about developers and companies based on the way they handle criticism. Some people, like Squad, will cyber stalk their critics and try to 'expose' them for past misdeeds (in their eyes), others will wear it and even address it and repair their game improving it's standards. In the case of State of Decay it seemed they would actively delete any criticisms they encountered which left me far more cynical of their game overall. But even with a fanboy attitude when I first discovered the game it was another 'great potential, poor execution' zombie game, sadly. :(			"

												This game was quite fun and I still find myself playing it on occasion, the bad review isn't necessarily completely the game's fault, mainly the developers. If you could care less, go buy YOSE unless you already have this version.This game itself was quite buggy on many PC configurations, though I could have recommended this game to anyone despite the bugs because the gameplay was worth it.However, the bugs and issues were fixable with some tweaks. Now, they charge for an update to the game which is a very scummy move from Undead Labs and it's becoming much more common with other developers as well.If you already own this copy of State of Decay, save yourself the headache and spend your money elsewhere because the ""Update"" is not worth it. If you really want the game but don't own it, YOSE is the only (Legal) choice now.			"

												Edit: Forget this review, the devs are releasing a newer, improved version of the game, so get that instead.Yet another zombie survival game. Oh, don't we see them so often? The answer is: Yes, HOWEVER, this game takes a new and interesting approach to the apocolypse. Nevermind finding a cure or trying to leave town to some place nice and quiet; State of Decay forces you into a world where the main focus is to fortify a home/base and to live off the surrounding, sometimes desolate buildings. Find food, feed your community members. Find materials, upgrade your base. Find oil, power your generator. Find ammo, defend yourselves from the shambling remains of what used to be your average Joe. Find and rescue other survivors, convince them to join your community. Survive as long as you could as a community. This game makes it clear you need a hand in the end of the world. Now, let's not get too off-topic - this is a review. This brings the question: So why should I get this game?    Well, although this game had a so-so port from Xbox to PC, although it has semi-frequent glitches, and although it has rather repetetive dialogue, the game makes up for this in many other aspects. I can play this for hours on end, but for the sake of my mental health, I keep each session under 4 hours. This game is great fun, and it can seriously get nerve racking at certain points, whether from the plot or from you just scavenging a town alone. There hasn't been one point in this entire game that I didn't enjoy spending time in the destroyed world that remains. After all, you don't choose the world you live in, but you choose what role you will play in said world.All being said, I highly recommend you give this game a go, and if you like it, get the DLC (but we'll leave the DLC for another review or two).

												State of Decay is the kind of zombie game I'd been hoping for; equal parts exploration and combat, with sprinkles of RPG on top. Are there flaws? Certainly. Does the game feel complete? Not in all areas, but the core concepts and ideas are so good that in the end (heh), it doesn't leave you feeling as though you got half a product.    Despite some quirks and an abysmally abrupt ending, I think State of Decay is worth your time and money, and here's why.GAMEPLAYLet's be honest here: this game, like many other games, lives and dies based on its gameplay. There are other factors that are good, but if the gameplay was bad in a game like this, it'd be looked over, maybe rightfully so. Luckily, Undead Labs has nailed almost every single facet of gameplay, from melee and ranged battles all the way to their robust progression and homestead systems. I'll break these down into small sub-sections for readability's sake.          COMBAT - RANGED           State of Decay, like many other games, features both gun-based and melee-based combat, but unlike some, doesn't miss a step with either. The ranged combat is typical TPS fare, but with much more emphasis on ammo conservation and timing your reloads carefully. There are many guns on offer, from rifles and revolvers to shotguns and grenade launchers, and they each have unique handling amongst the many varieties in each type. There are also skills you can unlock to make yourself better at certain types of guns, as well as a handy late-game skill to slow time when aiming, and you can craft and find weapon suppressors that last a certain amount of shots for when you need to headshot some zeds, but not attract dozens of others.          COMBAT - MELEE           The melee combat is satisfingly meaty, and by the end of the game I felt like there was a lot to it that I hadn't begun to master. With a handful of melee categories, and quite a few weapons in each of those, every swing you take at a shuffling corpse is different, but all of them feel meaty and, dare I say, visceral. There's some limb dismemberment, leading to situations where an undead is still coming at you with both of its arms laying on the ground behind it, but it's all about either decapitating a zombie as it stands or knocking it to the ground to finish it off with a cool animation. There are some skills that tie into the melee as well, including ones that make you excel at a certain kind of weapon, or just sweet knockdown skills, my favorite of which was a low spin-kick that all-but-guaranteed a knockdown on multiple targets, setting up sick combos as I spun and crushed my way to victories. There are durabilities on each melee weapon, unlike guns, but they're pretty abundant so you never feel helpless for long. The only downside to using melee is that it's tied into your universal stamina meter, meaning if you don't make your hits count, you'll quickly be out of breath against zombies that just won't quit.            MOVEMENT AND VEHICLES            The on-foot movement is pretty basic, but the sprinting, climbing, and vaulting over objects is all hooked to your stamina, so not only can you not sprint for long, but sprinting into a fight is a bad idea. You can eventually level up your Cardio over time, but by and large you're going to want to use vehicles for anything that's more than a slight jaunt. The good news is, there are dozens of vehicles, all with different handling and appearances, and driving them is fun as hell, probably because it's never not satisfying to throw open your door into a zombie while you're doing 50MPH across a cornfield. There are some.. curious physics when you collide with something in your car, leading to some amusing crashes where I was thrown, rolling, into the air as my car hit something and did a forwards flip, but by and large the vehicles are well-done and can really get you out of a jam, despite the fact that zombies can climb onto and tear doors off of your vehicle. When this happens, you and your passengers can be pulled out of the car by an especially overzealous zed intent on your destruction.                PROGRESSION               Progress in State of Decay is level-based by skill, and each skill levels up by repetition. Kill a bunch of zombies with a gun, your Shooting levels up. Run for miles and you'll be rewarded with a boost to Cardio. It all feels very natural, and at certain levels you'll unlock new skills to help keep you on your feet and help you put the dead back in undead. Each character levels up differently, and some of them have different traits, meaning a few characters might level up shooting quickly, but be bad at Wits, or vice versa. It's a good system, and it means you'll want to swap between characters frequently.               CHARACTERS AND DEATH                To be able to switch to a character, you need to be in Friend status with them, meaning you haven't shot them too many times/nearly ran them over/made decisions they didn't like. It's a basic system, but one that ensures you'll want to keep on everyone's good side so you can use as many characters as possible, especially since death is permanent. When a character dies, they're gone for good, leading to morale losses, but you can pick up some of the stuff they were carrying and bring it to your home base for a slight morale boost, leading me to the next subject: home.               HOMES               The place you'll be spending a lot of time in, bringing supplies to, and upgrading is up to you; there are a variety of home spots after the first main one, and where you want to set up shop is up to you. Personally, after I made my first homebase switch, I felt vaguely annoyed. I'd lost a lot of progress and had to rebuild some facilities, and by the end of the game it didn't seem to have mattered much. A watchtower is all I really needed, so someone could keep zombies from breaking in, and by the time I got that at my second house, the game had very few missions left. Nonetheless, the amount of facilities you can build is pretty good; ranging from sleeping areas to infirmaries and workshops, each one grants bonuses or crafting options, and they can help turn the tide against the undead onslaught. You'll need to find the materials for each, though, and that's a big part of my annoyance with the game, as you'll see next.             LOOT/SCAVENGING/EXPLORATION             To scavenge a shiny, white glowing container, simply walk up to it and hold a button. A small ring pops up, showing how close you are to being done with scavenging that. Holding another button means it goes faster, but is louder and has the chance to make a loud noise, attracting zombies. When it's open, you figure out which stuff is worth taking in your very limited personal inventory, see if there's any Construction Materials/Ammo/Medicine/Food containers inside, which load onto your back and make your stamina drain very fast with sprinting, and back out. You can only carry one of this kind of container at a time, but later you can radio scavengers to come pick up more. It's a fine system and the first 100 times, it's fun to see what kind of things you'll find, but by the end of the game it becomes a chore, especially since materials get scarcer and scarcer, leading you to driving all over the map in hopes of finding a stash of materials to build another upgrade to your house. The constant fetching can be annoying, which I'm about to gripe on further.  --Continued in comments-- "

												I don't recommend you buy this game, which is good because you can't.I would leave a review on the Year One Survival Edition page but I don't own the double-dip version.Negatives:-People often float everywhere and the animations are busted.-Looks like the camera lens has been coated in vaseline to hide the console quality graphics.-Combat system is all about awkward animations and clicking.I get the feeling that the developers made the game so that they would enjoy it, and not so that we would enjoy it:-There are loads of systems at play which are mega-confusing to anyone except the people who made the game or have the time to read through lengthy guides online. It doesn't help that the game doesn't pause when you're in the menus, so you can't even take your time to study them or learn what's going on. Every couple of seconds there's someone shouting over the radio or a zombie approaching - I like that they were trying to emulate the experience of the zombie apocalypse, but I'm trying to learn the damn menus and read the damn numbers and remember what I was doing last time I played. And that leads onto the next problem:-You have to download a mod to turn off the 'feature' where medical supplies/food/etc are used up in real time when you're not playing the game (the worst design decision I have ever seen). If you stop playing for a while, loads of your supplies are used up. Not because anyone in the game world did anything, but because you yourself stopped playing the game for a week. Makes no sense whatsoever.Positives:-You can't buy this.			"

												While those interested in the burgeoning zombie survival sandbox genre have no shortage of titles to partake of, those seeking a solo experience have been left with few options, particularly on the PC. Multiplayer games inspired by the Arma 2 mod, Dayz, seem to be popping up everywhere but the appreciable potential for a singleplayer game that focuses on PvE rather than PvP has on the platform gone unfulfilled. State of Decay looks to cash in on this opening, offering up a sizable chunk of game world populated by zombies, AI survivors and lots of loot-filled buildings to scour. While there are more than a few rough edges in State of Decay and a lack of the heart-stopping tension found in Dayz, there is an engrossing and enjoyable game here with a lot of things to do given the low cost of entry.The start of the game sees you fighting zombies and completing simple fetch quests for a small group of survivors garrisoned in a ranger station. You are introduced to the combat and looting mechanics, but these only garnish the more engaging aspects of the experience. Soon you find yourself entwined with a larger group of survivors holed up in a church just outside a small town. This will serve as your base throughout most of the game as you earn the trust of fellow survivors, fortify your encampment and go out in search of supplies. Ensuring the well being of this group of survivors is ultimately what keeps State of Decay moving forward, as it provides good incentive for you to engage in the gameplay tasks which without context would be fairly banal.After the opening sequence of the game, the constant flood of missions that you are informed of via radio chatter take a back seat to exploration and looting. Ensuring that your group of survivors have enough food and medical supplies will be the most pressing issue, and can be remedied by searching through houses which may contain zombies, supplies or occasionally survivors who can be convinced to join your group. You can climb tall objects and 'survey' the surrounding area, revealing locations of interest. Once inside a building, objects which contain items must be searched, and this takes several seconds to complete. Whether you try and sneak around avoiding combat with the walking undead, quietly scavenging what you need, or go in swinging to clear a house of its decrepit occupants before searching for goodies remains entirely up to you. You can radio home to request an AI survivor come out and pick up the supplies for you, but this requires clearing a location of all zombies first.If you decide to clear a location of zombies before poking around for loot, the combat is functional but uninspired. With a melee weapon you swing away until either you run out of stamina, the zombies' heads explode or your weapon breaks. If you manage to knock a zombie down you can finish it off with a brutal swing of your chosen instrument of death, but most of the challenge lies in ensuring you don't get surrounded or backed into a corner. Firearms are straightforward and satisfying to use, although ammunition isn't readily available and firing a unsilenced weapon will attract nearby zombies, meaning they are best used only when the situation gets out of hand. Sneaking around zombies is a viable method, particularly when dealing with larger groups, and can be accomplished by takedowns from behind, distracting zombies with objects or using firearms with home-made silencers that only last for a set number of shots.The zombies themselves shamble around convincingly enough, at least until they get stuck in the terrain which happens all too frequently. The undead will hop through windows, climb fences and grab you from behind as they endeavor to end your life. Special zombie types eventually start showing up, which range from the bullet-proof SWAT zombies to ones that explode in a cloud of poisonous gas when killed to hulking beasts that charge like bulls and sponge up a lot of firepower before going down.If you do get killed, which happens very infrequently, rather than reverting to an old save you will start playing as another survivor in your group. It is in your best interest to keep survivors alive for as long as possible since you gradually gain passive improvements to a character over time, such as improved stamina, melee damage and increased health. If you are out and about with one character for too long, their maximum stamina will be decreased until they go back to the base and rest. When you do this, you will take control of a different survivor, meaning you will end up playing as many different characters throughout the game.While the explorable area in State of Decay isn't huge, you can enter and drive vehicles left lying around which are all conveniently unlocked with keys in the ignition. Driving a car feels responsive and light almost to a fault; if you crash into an object at speed your vehicle will go flying in some pretty crazy ways. Running over zombies is a very effective way of killing them, although cars will become damaged in the process. Zombie hordes roam the streets, and running into them at full speed will be as damaging to your vehicle as it will be to the shambling flesh-eaters.The amount of time you spend on State of Decay is linked directly to how invested you become in the well-being of your survivor group as well as your tolerance for repetition given there is no real end to the game but the random objectives start repeating. It takes a good amount of time and scavenging to fully upgrade your survivor camp with an infirmary, vehicle-repair station and watchtowers among other fortifications, but if you don't buy into the well being of your AI dependants you will struggle to care enough to go through the trouble of collecting all the required materials.If you have been looking for a zombie-themed survival sandbox but don't want to contend with bandits and hackers in online games, State of Decay will scratch that itch. The lack of tension in exploration is vindicated by fairly complex mechanics surrounding the well-being of a group of survivors you must watch over. State of Decay succeeds in its ambitions and despite some rough edges provides a compelling open world experience.Recommended "

												It's actually a decent game.  However, there is a game-breaking bug that can occur very late in the story that stops progression.  Lots of people have reported having this bug for about a year now, yet it's still there.  Since the game constantly auto-saves as you go, you're just hosed and have to start over.  For that reason alone, I can't recommend it.			"

												State of Decay is the open-world third person apocalyptic survival game that I have waited for this whole generation, Day Z and Dead Island were close for me but they both lacked a few things here and there. While DayZ had survival, Dead Island had the world and mechanics, State of Decay have both of these aspects, and pull them off very successfully.You quickly realize that the game push a lot of information at you the first few hours, like every home base can only have so many structures, do you want more sleeping areas to keep the characters in the camp rested? Or maybe you want a library to research some better medical aid for when someone get hurt? From this point on the game becomes very dark, it will test your moral. And rightfully so.Every now and then you stumble across new survivors, complete strangers in need of help. What are you going to do? Do you help them and risk running out of food? Or do you save them in hope of finding a few food supplies?This also takes us back to the base aspect, you could build a garden instead of a library or sleeping area, as this will give you food daily. Because food each day must be good right? Yes, it is, but if you don't have enough beds for everyone, each character will slow but sure get tired, fatigued. This goes for your playable characters as well as NPCs in the camp.If a player character don't rest after a while of exploring, the stamina will decrease, making you worse in combat and increase the chance of dying. Death is permanent, and there is no save/reload feature to abuse. The game autosaves after each finished mission, and that is it.The less playable characters you have available, the harder the game gets, because you have less to pick from when the others need a few hours in the bed to rest.Keeping a character alive and well will not only serve as a jump option, but they also gain skills and level up depending on what they do. Melee combat? Increase the fighting skill, making you more efficient with melee weapons. Same goes for guns, looting etc.However should you be unlucky and die, the items you got on you can be retrieved with another character, so don't panic!You will meet tough situations where people you know get infected, and we all know how to ""fix"" that problem. It can be a hard call, depending on the connection with each individual character, the NPC can get overrun while on a supply run you called in, and if you don't help them, may they RIP.The game consistently keeps throwing missions/tasks at you, you have to prioritize, which is more important? Save this guy? Or scout this area to call out locations of meds, zeds or maybe you want to find out what the Army is up to.The story is also pretty well put together, i keeps you interested, and makes you feel connected with the characters living in the world, making you feel the need to help (most) of them. Helping other survivor outposts will also benefit resources like ammunition, food, construction material etc. But how you play in the world also affect how everyone in the world watch you, reckless driving is negative and will make everyone look at you in a bad way, same goes for reckless shooting. But in the end, it's all about survival, keeping morale up, food on the table and killing the zeds!			"

I can't say that I was happy after hearing them saying that they weren't going to add co-op to this game which would of increased the replayability even more.

GG EVERYBODY WE TOOK YOUR MONEY! I attempted to get a steam refund because of a glitch where literally I couldn't advance story and all that happened was my camera panned around the sergeants head. I attempted to fix this by removing all files and doing a fresh install and it didn't fix. I was denied my refund because ""I played the game 4 hours"" When in actuality I played the game about 1 hour, and spent 3 hours trying to debug something because I WANTED A FUN GAME. Okay I lied it was probably about 1 hour 15. While the additional hour was spent waiting to see if maybe something would load around the sergeants game and the remaining time was spent doing a brand new save file seeing if maybe I had just a corrupted save. So in the end ♥♥♥♥ YOU STATE OF DECAY. They ♥♥♥♥ing push out a ""year one addition"" and advertise it on Steam I wouldn't buy it. If it fixed all the bugs then ♥♥♥♥ing let everybody who bought your first attempt get it for free? NO YOU WANT $20.. yeah you know what you can take the $20 I spent on your game, buy a ♥♥♥♥♥ and shove it up your ♥♥♥ you piece of ♥♥♥♥ game developers.			"

												State of Decay is a GTA-esque zombie survival game.  You play as a group of survivors who must search for supplies and safe-houses while the main storyline unfolds.  Even though it’s another zombie game, this one does a whole lot of things right.  The story is almost generic but game play is quite enjoyable and after a while you really care for your crew.  It is devastating to lose a character after working so hard to level up his/her skills.  And dead means dead people.  No going back to reload saves here.There are several RPG elements, not only for your characters but for upgrading your base as well.  The game also added a touch of realism by having people get tired which temporarily gives them a greater and greater stamina penalty until they rest.The above being said, the game does have a large number of bugs still present, from clipping, to map glitches, to even crashing every now and then.  Also, this game BEGS to be co-op.  It would have been fantastic to go out and scavenge supplies and run over zombies with friends.  Sadly, the devs have stated that it would take too much to add co-op to the game at this point.  Huge missed opportunity there. Issues and all, there is no buyer’s remorse.  I still had (And currently am having) a ton of fun playing this game.  And that’s the important part! "

												Small price tag for a game that will yield a far-above average amount of hours even without DLC.An all-original free-form survival game that focuses on the growth of a group rather than the goals of a single person.Where do I start - base building, a large open world map, character traits, firearms, epic combat, etc.State of decay is an open-world, 3rd person, survival, group-management game that will definitely leave a mark on your ability to enjoy any other game that resembles it.The player progresses through the game by managing their group and their base. Keeping your group up to date with supplies, keeping your survivors from going insane, and keeping things mellow, are some of the tasks the player upholds when they first start their game. The player does not play as a single character, or a 'god' that overwatches the community, but rather the community itself. The base concept is that you gain enough trust with a person to befriend them, at which point you can switch back and forth between the characters you have befriended to take advantage of everybody in your friendgroup. There is no single main character, although the player can choose to concentrate on a single person. The twist here is that when characters die, they are dead forever, and won't come back. When playing the game, the player upholds a third person perspective with whatever person they are playing as. You can loot and scavenge, clear areas, set up outposts, scout out areas to add icons to your map, and much, much more.This game is one of those games that will leave you in doubt considering how much content it actually has versus how much you would think it didn't from a distance. There is so much going on in this game it is easy to miss the minor features here and there. From a distance, one may think it is just a third person combat-based shooter. But if they put any more than an hour into the game, and actually saw what the game had to offer, you would rethink your entire perspective in a single matter of visiting the base management screen.What I'm trying to get at is that the game does not start strong with the story mode. The game gives you the illusion that you are playing a game where you just follow a line of missions where you just go from mission to mission until eventually beating the game. Until you reach the church (The base and group the story mode gives you to start), it will seem like that. The game does not provide convinient tutorial on the game's content, leaving it up to the player to realize that they aren't playing a linear game maybe 3 hours since they started.There is a 'random bank' of survivors to ensure that the player will not end up with the same people every time (unless they are counting the story characters from story mode), there is no set spots for certain items to spawn, and every game playthrough you go through will be noteably different. The game generates missions based on what is needed or if the player hasn't tended to a growing problem. If you leave a guy to wallow in his anger for a long time, he will be at risk of snapping, giving the player the option to try to talk them down from their bad mood, or ask them to leave, as an example of this. Other survivors you aren't playing as can ask you for help, or you can even ask them for help as well.The game does not use money currency or anything like that, you use your influence in the group to make descisions and take things. This also means that you definitely do not start in the decision-making ranks, meaning that you will have to play it for a little bit before you gain the trust needed to make the big move to the bigger compound, stop that zed hunt, etc. Influence can be gained for sticking around for a while and doing a lot of influence-gaining tasks. Be involved with your group, and your group will be involved with you. It's not a game where you can screw around and hope your bros will survive.That's the one bad thing - you can't really screw around when driving that car off a cliff will destroy it permanently or the fact that ammo is really rare. It depends on what your motives for playing are.While I recommend this game, I must warn you that it requires time and goes off of a real-time simulation. Survivors will gather little supplies daily, or you might get lucky, but there is daily rates of consumption of each material depending on what your setup is. Maintenance may be required, but usually your group will make it. It's nothing you can't handle.Get this game if you have the time. If you are looking for something combat-based that you can play in an hour and not have to worry about anything, go play something else.			"

												Liked the concept and followed this game from the beginning, but wanted to wait while most of the technical issues will be fixed. Now Undead labs no longer support the game and offer me to pay them a second time for patched version.A blatant money grab if there ever was one. No person with any self respect or sense of justice will buy anything touched buy Undead labs ever again.			"

												So appearently, two years after the release of this buggy heaping mess, they decided to re-release the same game with an appearent ""Remastering"" to make it seem like a completely new and exciting game.The first game, this game, was buggy as hell, hard to run, unfun, and just generally a snooze-fest.The updated re-release, while seeming and/or promising to fix this, ends up having not fixed any of the bugs that made the first game such a train wreck.Not only that, but it appears they also did not fix anything.So, basically, this is a real-life simulation of if the WarZ dev team actually came up with something good, and did what they did what with the changing of the name and the lack of any other changes, before reuploading it. However in this case, the initial junk pile was never taken down, leading to two versions which, if you compare side-by-side, show that they hadn't changed anythingEven with the updates I never bothered to buy, I can't imagine that it would magically become a better game, or one that is good to play.

												Not the finest or the most polished game there is, but it managed to introduce a fresh spin to the open-world undead genre, with its permadeath elements and well-developed character/home base enhancements. Though side missions can be tedious, you're not obligated to them, and managing your base and the survivors in it can always be a blast.Combat's relatively well-made, keeping the tension up as you maneuver through the hordes hoping not to lose your best character - the undead never ceases, after all, so it's either that you focus on the job and get creative, or get efficient, or get killed.

												I actually liked State of Decay quite a bit. It's a fun little survival game with a lot of atmosphere and great community expansion with NPCs. Unfortunately the developers decided to drop support and instead release the exact same game with a minor patch and graphical update as a ""remastered edition"" that costs $30.State of Decay decayed way too soon.

												State of Decay certainly doesn't waste any time. Mere seconds past the Start screen, it throws you headlong into a zombie apocalypse in full bloom. Tree branch in hand, you clobber the shambling corpses attempting to munch on your screaming camping buddy, and then seek out the few remaining survivors while scrounging for supplies, weapons, and ever-safer home bases. That's just the first 20 minutes, but the core of State of Decay's gameplay never changes as you make your way through its open world and battle an endless cast of zombies. State of Decay finds its soul in the dreary repetition of apocalyptic survival.State of Decay's open world manages a substantial degree of immersion, complete with an expansive and occasionally intimidating map and the ability to drive cars freely across the landscape. The cars handle poorly, but the ability to use them to mow down roving zombie swarms offers a malicious satisfaction. You quickly learn to fight zombies only if you absolutely have to in State of Decay, and therein lies much of its appeal. This is not a game about Bruce Campbell badassing about in Evil Dead; it's a celebration of the normal person and all of his or her associated weaknesses. Some of the characters you come across have no combat experience at all.Death is permanent in State of Decay, which means that even characters with fully voiced storylines and unique dialogue die forever if you let them get overrun. From there, you can only continue through the eyes of another character you've befriended.Few things add more tension to State of Decay than the terrifying noise guns make, because a single foolish shot can bring an unmanageable horde upon you.Permanent death is a smart addition, though, since losing characters with high skills across the board carries with it a real sense of loss, particularly if their voice quests and customized responses in some quests led you to believe they were an essential character. Sometimes they don't even have to die in the field; if a character you've been controlling sustains enough injuries--a few undead chomps don't result in instant zombification in State of Decay--he'll lie bedridden and useless at your home base. The good news is that the need to rest and switch out characters results in you amassing a balanced group of playable characters anyway.It's a bit strange that a game that places such a heavy emphasis on interpersonal relationships should have no cooperative mode. You spend your time with State of Decay alone, joining up with other NPCs only for specialized quests and escort missions that bring other survivors back to your current base camp. It's especially odd since State of Decay starts out with a party of two, suggesting that you'll always have a buddy at your side if need be.State of Decay serves up a near constant barrage of suspense and immersion that leaves even the briefest jaunts away from your home base tinged with the threat of death. Its flaws are numerous and impossible to ignore, but in spite of them, State of Decay is a captivating survival adventure set in a bleak and harrowing world.			"

												Fantastic game, by far my favorite zombe/sandbox/survival game. Takes some getting used to the menus and features, but is well worth taking the time and effort. A few features are annoying, like the frequency of random events and requests bogging down the ability to just explore and enjoy (it seems the developers are more used to creating quest-driven games and aren't too comfortable with open worlds), and there are some bugs that the dev team seems uninterested in addressing. But the game is otherwise so fine I'm willing to put up with these.So why not recommended? Because this is sadly a classic case of a company taking horrid, blatant advantage of their supporters. I bought the game in early access PC port mode, and what do us loyal fans get in return? Refusals to fix bugs, DLC that adds very little and refuses to fix bugs, and then a massive re-release that is just a slight visual upgrade that yet again refuses to address bugs and - big surprise - early access peeps don't get access to.Newsflash, video game developers: Giving someone early access is an implicit contract that (1) you will actually finish the game, and (2) your early supporters are supplied with upgraded versions as the game further develops.Undead Labs has clearly decided to abandon their project and just soak up whatever money they can from the suckers. It is painfully obvious they had no intention to actually finish the game once the money started rolling in. They - and especially founder Jeff Stray - are dead to me. I will henceforth blacklist any game they put out (assuming the unlikely outcome that they produce any more), as well as any Xbox port to PC, and anything Jeff Stray or other leaders of this offensive scam ever attemt to do in the future. Pathetic.			"

UPD: Added a paragraph about the Lifeline DLC below.Don't you just hate it when you return from a relaxing fishing trip at the lake and find out that both your wife and mother-in-law turned into vicious man-hating psychopaths? Oh wait.As you have probably already guessed, this is a cross-species relationship simulator where you spend roughly about twenty hours of game time bashing your former loved ones and neighbors in the teeth with a rusty pipe wrench. Over and over again. Oh, and don't forget to rob their house while you're at it! That's it. That's the entire game. Honest.In all seriousness, this is by far the best open-world zombie survival simulator around, on a par with Project Zomboid, but let me be (for real this time) honest there for a moment. It gets repetitive. It offers nothing new to the zombie apocalypse genre, story wise. It's full of (albeit, hilarious) geometry glitches. But then again, so is Skyrim! Yet it's a great game. So what's so special about SoD, anyways? Well, for one, how about tossing a creepy-♥♥♥ talking doll into the midst of a zombie horde to keep them entertained while you rummage through somebody's underwear in search for an aspirin? B*tches love talking dolls. Still not enough? Fine.SoD, much like The Walking Dead, has a great deal of realism added to it. Resources you scavenge, for once, play a huge role in the game and your characters aren't unstoppable killing machines - if they die, they die permanently. SoD has quite a heavy emphasis on strategic micromanagement, instead of being just another run-n-gun. Finding a suitable home base, upgrading its facilities, going on exhausting day-to-day scavenging runs, and keeping morale up is essential, and what makes the game incredibly fun. The story... Well, it's there. Alongside with everyone's favorite Plucky Comic Relief trope (Barry Wheeler? Joe Barbaro? Yeah.). But anyways.Looking for a highly immersive zombie apocalypse experience? Look no further. Just one word of caution, it's highly addictive. And if you're a true masochist, try out the Breakdown DLC, which ramps up the difficulty and removes the story altogether, focusing solely on the survival aspect. Just don't forget to tell your mommy you won't be coming for dinner.Too busy trying not to become one, amirite. She'll understand.P.S. For those still having doubts, Lifeline DLC is a super nice (and surprisingly cheap!) addition, since it FINALLY features a whole new map for you to explore: I'll go so far as to say that it's worth buying just for the map alone, and if you get it on sale then it's just a steal. My only complaint is that you don't have a lot of freedom during the story since you're on the clock pretty much 24/7. But I guess that comes with being in the military, eh?			"

												This game is awesome for Zombie Survival fans, it has lots of characters, missions, and of course boarding windows.  For regular gamers this game will get real boring, real fast.  Its all a series of fetch quests, then again that is what survival is, get food, building supplies and other stuff to keep your survivors alive.  This game has permadeath where once a survivor dies their gone for good.  Also the game plays itself or something when its turned off or if the player stops playing the game keeps playing itself.  While the developer on their forums wrote up this long post about how its impossible to remove, ignore the dev, and just download a mod because there are tons that disable the game from playing itself.  The game is very unique, and its a HUGE world.  There is alot of dialog in this game, its pretty impressive really.  Finally a zombie game that is PVE, not that PVP crap like other games which is just any FPS deathmatch game with zombies.  This is a game based on survival.  There are some flaws in this game.  For example if you loot a house of stuff or search it, the house can never be searched again.  But if you kill the zombies those in that house, those will come back again and again.  So its kind of out of balance that way, even the cars wont respawn.Regular People:  1/10  Value:  $4.99Zombie Fans:  7/10   Value:  $9.99			"

												This game has finally everything I had hoped for in a zombie game - especially regarding the survival aspect of it.The thing most people tend to forget about zombies and zombie stories is that the zombies are not the main threat, not the main reason the outbreak is so hard to survive. This game gets it right: The main problem is gathering supplies and keeping a group together, you have to be able to rely on your teammates and hope you have enough space to carry the loot to your hub so you can upgrade it defend it against zombie hordes marching your way.I also love the aspect of finding new survivors and them helping you out - or abuse your medical stash.All in all, State of Decay just gets the Zombie Apocalypse right.

This review is based on playing the game with all DLC:Quite frankly one of the best zombie survival games I've played in an extremely long time. While it suffers from some bizzare design choices, it still as a whole presents a zombie survival simulator that isn't just about bashing zombie's brains in.The base game:The base game with no DLC is a solid experience. It starts you off in a tutorial area to teach you the basics of the game, killing zombies. When it comes to interaction with zombies you have three choices. Fight, run, or sneak by. Fighting is pretty good in the game but it kinda suffers from dependancy on weapons. The game does have abilities for the survivors to use their own physical skills like punching and kicking to take out zombies, but they don't do much damage. You're basically forced to use a weapon, whether it be a melee weapon or a gun. But since finding a weapon is extremely easy, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Using guns also is a great experience. Each weapon feels distinctive and while some are weak like low caliber pistols, others make you feel like Rick Grimes from The Walking Dead. Guns also adhear to a noise system. If you fire a gun, you attract zombies from far and wide. However guns are extremely powerful against the special zombies in the game so the balance of when to and when not to use a gun is a constant concern. As said before, there are special zombies in the game. If you've played Left 4 Dead you probably know what to expect. The tank, the attracter, the predator, and the stunner. There are other special types, but they're basically just regular zombies that can't be killed by guns. And while it's starting to get annoying for zombie games to always have special zombie types, at least in State of Decay they're more rarer than in other games.Next is my most favorite part of the game, base and resource management. In the game, just like in real life, there's a constant need for materials. Whether it be food or construction materials or ammo, your community needs supplies in order to stay alive. If you don't keep up with the demand, your base will fall. There's no work around, you have to scavenge houses and buisnesses to find supplies. When you do find supply crates you have two options, you can carry the crate in a pack on your back and take it back to base for upkeep in your base or you can break it open and put whatever's inside into storage at base. You don't get upkeep on your base but you get what's inside, be it ammo or food or whatever it may have.Finally there's the story. The game takes place at the near beginning of the zombie apocalypse. You and your friends have to work together to survive as long as you can while trying to figure out a way out of the valley you're trapped in. Along the way you meet other survivors. Some you can recruit into your community to help you while others have their own thing going that you can be friends with, or enemies. Doing most of the side missions involving the other communities are optional but if you help them, they'll help you with all sorts of abilites. One for example can drop motars on a group of zombies while another can deliever a car wherever you need. The main storyline is also very well made with an end game challenge that actually made me want to rage quit, something that rarely happens anymore with games getting easier. The ending also is extremely great considering what's on the horizon for the developer that made the game, Undead Labs. I won't spoil it for you but let's just say if you love the game and want more when the sequel comes out, it may be worth it to get an Xbox ONE, assuming of course Microsoft keeps it's word and makes the sequel Xbox exclusive.Now for those bizzare design choices I mentioned. As I said before, base management is my favorite part of the game. But unfortunately the tutorial is a little lack luster and sometimes confusing. It sometimes explains too much in some areas without explaining enough in others. What's the benefit of having construction A in the base over construction B? Also the choice of allowing the safe zone to become so big through the establishment of outposts is kinda weird to me. Don't get me wrong, not having to worry about my base while I'm across the map is great, but it kinda takes away the fear of being overrun in a setting that's absolutely perfect for that kind of fear.  All in all, it's still worth buying just for the base game alone. Especially when it's on sale and even more especially if you decide to use some mods for the game.Breakdown DLC:This DLC alone is worth buying the game. It's basically the base game except there's no time constrictons and you're free to do whatever you want. The challenge is unlocking all the playable characters through certain actions. In the first playthrough you have to say, kill 5 special zombies to unlock a character. Overtime you'll unlock all the characters you can in that playthough and be allowed to move up to the next. In level 2, zombies are harder to kill and there's more special infected. But there's more challenges, unlocking better survivors. The constant challenge of an increasingly harder game is alone worth playing while unlocking the better newer characters is just a great cherry on top. While some have criticize the DLC for not doing much in terms of changing the game, I say it's perfect for those that want a long term challenge.Lifeline DLC:This DLC quite frankly will test everything you learned from the other parts of the game. This time it's an entirely new campaign you'll be playing. No old characters are rehashed and you even play in a new map. Quite possibly the worst case scenario map to play in a game like this, an urban city. Zombies are EVERYWHERE! Sneaking is now not just an option, it's a necessity in this densily populated area. The campaign is also surperb in delivery based on what characters you play as and the base building and maintaining is still my most favorite part. But the biggest challenge is, again the population of the map. Firing weapons is just a big no no on this map as every zombie within a mile is gonna hear it, even though ironically you start off with all the guns and ammo you could ask for. If you're looking for the ultimate challenge in urban zombie survival, this is the DLC for you. Just don't be surprised if you find yourself yelling in terror about all the zombies running at you.

												State of Decay.Now with its two DLCs Breakdown and Lifeline (at the time of this review's writing. Idk if they intend to release more dlcs)The base game is a fun, gritty experience at a post apocalyptic world where zombies overrun the world and you control survivors and try to tough it out and survive. Your decisions have weight and consequences, whether you choose to handle a situation as soon as you get into it or delay your decision, there are consequences that will affect your game in ways that amaze me. Though i really dislike the fact that the zombies themselves can run, there are mods for that. Sure the unmodded experience is fun too but i feel like mods tend to enhance gameplay. I myself installed several, mostly ones that make the zombie population a lot more dense and force them to shamble and walk towards you.Adds a lot of tension as you try to mow down zombies with a table leg you just found in a house you were scavenging. Every hit exhausts you, you run and hope they don't catch up. You panic as you keep running to avoid your death at the hands of the zeds.You get back to your home base, you build more improvements and go over your plans to hit the next few houses for supplies and maybe even radio other survivors. And for a moment, you feel safe and sound. Until a siege comes along.What i think that this game does best is make the player emotionally invest in the characters.You grow attached to a certain survivor and you want to see him/her make it out. You grow attached to some survivors and you do everything you can so that they survive. When i had to put down a few survivors because they were infected, that really hit me hard in the feels.and i was pretty bummed when my chosen survivor got torn in half by a horde during a scavenging mission gone terribly wrong. Good job Undead Labs. Though after my main survivor died, i kinda didn't touch the game again.:<			"

I've played it on both Console and PC and both times the game was enjoyable. That being said there was some design decisions that made sense for the game I guess, but just didn't sit well with me. Slight SPOILERS ahead I guess.The game is constantly forcing you to do things, there is never seems to be a break. There is always someone in trouble getting supplies, or someone missing or someone who wants to take out a zombie infestation. While you are doing those misssions there are also story missions that are happening and this game doesn't care what else you are doing, if you don't show up for that story mission someone is gonna die and that part of the storyline is gone. The problem with all these side/main quests happening ALL the time is it doesn't just let you explore the game. The map is a pretty decent size with some neat areas to find and explore. The problem is that you don't want to be on the northwest corner of the map when a story mission suddenly pops up on the southeast corner. Maybe I just failed at seeing the options to tell the people in my little fortification to just sit there and don't leave but it was annoying to have these quests pop up all the time. Made the game probably a little more of a realistic zombie game but from a guy who likes exploring, the way these side quests worked just didn't work for me.I did really enjoy the way the inventory worked in this game, it was really well done. You can get different sizes of backpack, though you'll pretty well get the biggest size pretty quickly and that is usually enough to get the job done. You also get the trunk of the vehilce that you're driving (if you use a vehicle to get around). In addition you can carry one bag of supplies (again the trunk of the vehicle can store multiple bags). Anything that you find can be stored into the community inventory which gives you influence points (instead of using money), so you can trade things you find for other things in the community inventory(either things that were there originally or things that other survivors have made). Finishing various side quests or main quests will also give you points to get additional items out of the inventory. If you get the big bag and use the vehicles trunks/box efficiently you'll have enough points for pretty well anything you'll ever need.The Zombies were pretty standard zombies, they moved at about the same pace as your characters but could be out run with sprinting, however you can only sprint for a limited amount of time. There are also several different types of zombies in addition to the average ones ranging from super large/strong to super fast/aggresive and more. But none of them felt over powering or cheesy in some way. The fit the game really well. As well they reacted decently to your actions for the most part. Driving, sprinting or shooting would all draw in zombies from surrounding areas, pretty standard zombie logic.You can play as a variety of characters from your base and level each one of them up. Each character is not exactly unique, they have some individual traits but are pretty interchangable. The amount of playable characters is decent as each of your characters may become tired/hungry/sick if they've done a lot of exploring or fighting and adds a bit of realisim to the game. You can either choose to use items to recharge them or switch out characters to let them rest. Only problem again with this is relating back to the questing point. One of the characters you use might decide to go off questing while you are playing as another character and then they won't recharge as well.The one thing I found lacking is that the story is pretty forgetable. There are some choices in there that will affect your game and the story but for the most part it's pretty standard zombie game. Survive for a while and then get the heck out of there.Controls are decent enough, Camera can be a little stupid at times but for the most part never really bothered me.			"

												State of Decay is a sandbox zombie game done right. Managing your survivors, gathering supplies, avoiding death and infection, doing missions to get to the bottom of what is going on - all are handled very well. This is especially worth checking out if you are very into The Walking Dead. The port from consoles is not perfect by any means, but continues to be worked on.The only complaint I have is the degree to which the game 'plays itself' when you aren't playing - constantly draining your supplies, having survivors go out on their own and getting wounded or sick, etc. You need to be able to give a lot of time to the game and play it daily. It would be nice if this could be switched off as an option (even if it gets classed as 'easy' mode).I checked the game out as part of my first impressions series and you can see more of the game to help you decide if it is for you by watching it here:

Now they have rereleased the game with some fixes, but they have decided those of us who SUPPORTED THESE WORTHLESS ♥♥♥♥♥♥ FROM THE START should pay them more money for the same game with those fixes mentioned previously. This game was OK when it first hit, but NOT a justification for them to rip us all off the way they are.*FUN FACT* Dying Light did a rerelease of their game and gave the game for FREE to all the people who had bought the previous version, as opposed to what undead labs did with this game.

												The game is really fun and teh concept is nice, entertaining and very engaging.But the game has one major problem. BUGS. Game crashing bugs. Sometimes you get to play for 1-2 hours sometimes its 1-2 minutes before the game crashes. Dump file error, ULLauncher error, random not responding errors all sorts of error. You dig about Steam community for help, NONE. Go to the Undead Lab forum, the admin there act like they are trying to help, but nothing they ever do helps solve the problem. As you can see with a quick Google search, its been years since the problem occur and there's still not patch or proper forum post for a fix to the problem. Everything, ""We will PM you about it""The game is fun but the bugs and crashes is too much to deal with and honestly, it doesn't feel like the developers give a damn after you pay them for the game.

												State of Decay is a fairly fun game, based on a mix of third person action, micromanagement, gathering quests and a great amount of repetitions, both visual (there is just a small textures and buildings core, the rest is a copy of it) and situational (there are like 3 or 4 different types of side quests, popping up a dozen every hour).All in all, I appreciated the ride for the most part, got bored every now and then doing always the same couple of things over and over again, kinda hated the performance issues (60 to 15 framerate drops during loadings are a tad too annoying while driving) and got absurdly underwhelmed by the ending (likely the worst thing of the entire game, and not because it's bad, but it's just so useless and badly realized that they could just have cut it out and settled for an infinite survival sim).It's clear Undead Labs were aiming extremely high, and I think it's also clear it was too high for them to actually pull off.

												Of the 130+ games in my Steam library, many of which I will never play the whole way through, this is the only game I actually regret spending money on.  The game lured me in with its promising use of survival mechanics (which may even be well done), but I simply cannot play because the graphics give me a splitting headache after the first 10 minutes of play.  Over-saturated colors with ridiculously high contrast turn everything into a colorful blur, and the game has almost zero configuration options.Add this to the fact that they are re-releasing the game with major patches and bug-fixes, and charging full price for another game rather than fixing what people already paid for?  Money-grubbing at its finest.			"

												I'd heard good things about this, and it surpassed my expectations to become my favourite new game in months. It's very close to what I always imagined the ideal zombie apocalypse survival game to be. And it's not just combat, combat, combat, this game makes you feel hunted and the moments of dramatic tension that arise naturally as you're sneaking around are great.There's an excellent balance between realism and action, a rich setting packed full of references and amusing little details, and clever use of noise as a gameplay element (loud noises can attract zombies from all over, which is often a risk, but also gives rise to tactics like the use of noise to lure or distract enemies). I also liked the combination of multiple playable characters and permanent death, if you get your character killed, it's final - they're dead and gone, and you'll have to play someone else from their group. It really feels like a loss when a survivor you've been building up into a badass gets torn apart in a raid gone horribly wrong.Owing to its small budget, it's a bit rough around the edges, but it has a heart of gold and a lot of ambition. At first I thought ""another zombie game?"" but this was a breath of fresh air to me.			"

												If anyone remembers the incomplete indie zombie survival game, Fort Zombie, State of Decay can be said to pretty much be its spiritual successor, and quite a successor it is. Its awesome! Like any game though, it has its ups and downs.- The game captures some incredible survival atmosphere. Scavenging to survive and keeping quiet while doing so is the key to gathering massive tons of precious loot. Such loot is not infinite, even if seemingly abundunt in the beginning, albiet difficult to get to sometimes with so many zombies on the prowl. The game tries to make it difficult but its quite easily beat once you learn the controls and how you manage your play. The minimap also makes it a little easier to spot zombies before they come for you.- Sound is your greatest enemy. The louder the sound, the more zombies you'll attract, and its almost impossible to come out of a running horde's charge unscathed (unless you're willing to waste precious ammo, or are smart enough to lure them into the radius of an outpost). This mechanic makes it that more fun and challenging to play around with, since almost everything you do will produce some kind of sound. That being said, its a good idea to be smart and patient. Sometimes, its better to walk than to drive a car, and better to melee than shooting a gun.- Guns are somehow easily obtainable from midgame onwards, although many dont account to anything unless you make headshots count. Missing or shooting without a silencer is almost a sure fire way of getting yourself swarmed. Two words that describe the ultimate in the late game finale: grenade launcher!- Every survivor is unique. Nobody looks the same as the other. Their initial skills and specialities also vary greatly, with some colourful extra skills to give that survivor their own unique flavour. You can switch to almost ANYBODY you pick up, as long as you take the time to earn their trust through missions and good deeds first. A number of the voiceovers for survivors are recycled, though, unless if its a major NPC with special dialogue. My other gripe is that its impossible to trade between characters. Stuff can only be traded through the stash and character switching.- Death is horrifyingly gruesome. When your health bar depletes, you go into a kind of button mashing recovery mode with all these zombies ripping at you. When you recover, your max health is reduced. Go down again and it will keep decreasing as they keep hitting you. When it reaches zero, your hapless survivor literally gets torn apart. Once you see it (for the achievement), you probably wont want to see it again. Its also a waste of a very precious resource. Your survivors are the ones that get things done, and losing them will make it a lot more difficult to play. Unlike loot, getting survivors to join you can also be quite difficult after a certain point. You'll also have to think about the amount of living space and food supply you have in your base. If you dont have enough, it will cause people to leave.- Missions can be repetitive, but its always fun to work out how to best tackle a situation without using too many meds or foods to boost health or stamina, or whether to stealth it or charge it. When you swing a melee weapon or perform executions on zombies, you use some stamina, which can quickly deplete if you're swarmed. No stamina almost always means a quick death if without food. Seriously. You wont even be able run away.- Although its already in a final build, there are still issues with clipping. Zombies and survivors get stuck in walls and in the ground. They wont be stuck for long, at least from what I have experianced. So far, its mostly tolerable.- After finishing the main storyline, you can purchase the DLC for a kind of endless sandbox game. The objective is to survive as long as possible. Moving bases will increase the difficulty, though Im not sure how. Im on the verge of completing the main campaign at this moment, and will be down for one of these soonish.Overall, I will give this game an 8/10. As far as single player zombie survival games go, I would think that this is what a proper one should look and play like. It would be interesting, however, to see how a game like this could fare as a multiplayer game. I would think that a number of player controlled communities, each competing for scavenged loot in an area, could make things even more interesting.			"

												In this game, you assume the role of an entire community where survivors of the apocalypse literally put their lives in your hands. This game gives you the choice between good and evil, and shows someone's true colors... when they play the game seriously.TL;DRI highly recommend this game. There's so many little details that you miss on you first dozen play through that when you see it you go ""Why didn't i notice that before?"". This game is aggravating. This game makes you feel like you are actually immersed into this world, and it's quite terrifying.Pros+Non Linear StorylineThis games storyline (For Base game and Lifeline- Breakdown does not have a storyline at all) is very unique, and you can fail missions to continue the story as well.+Every playthough is differentI have yet to find get the same playthough in my 40+ hours on steam.+You control a communityUnlike other zombie games, this one is more focused on the community aspect instead of a ""Lone Survivor"" type game.+Perma deathIf you lose a character, they are gone. (Until you start a new game)+You don't have to do every missionThere are consequences to not doing certain missions, but the choice is entirely yours.+Great communityI've been a member of Undead Labs' forums for a few years now, and it's one of my favorite places to be.Cons-Has it's slow pointsIf you don't know what you are doing, or have scavenged most of the map, there seems to be nothing to do.-Minor bugsThere's a few bugs that haven't been squashed due to the game's engine, like the erect truck glitch, where it literally stands your car straight up if you put it too close to specific objects.-Single player onlyWhile this game doesn't have multiplayer, it's still a great game, but later State of Decay titles will hopefully have multiplayer.Rating9.5/10This is by far one of the best single player zombie games you'll find out there.

												With abominations like The War Z, Nether and 7 Days to Die coming out recently, I'd almost given up on this genre. State of Decay has been sitting in my library for months untouched because I expected the worse. However I decided to start it up and oh my god, I'm annoyed for not doing it sooner.From the very beginning you're thrown into the open world and get taught the basic mechanics, before being given free roam and being able to approach the zombie apocalypse however you want. Want to stay with a group of survivors in a church? Go ahead, help them and earn their trust. Want to kill them all, loot their resources and start your own base? Go ahead, have fun!The combat itself is nowhere near as bad as I thought, it reminds me a lot of a basic version of the Assassin's Creed combat, with an option of using guns of course. The RPG elements are really cool, and I like not being anchored down with a 'main character' - you can play as whoever you want once you befriend them and level up their own skills.I see myself playing this a lot more in the future. It's honestly amazing.			"

												This game throws you in its world pretty much unprepared, explains only the most basic things. The graphic is mediocre (even for Xbox 360 standards), has sometimes odd graphic glitches, weird bugs (even after multiple patches), sometimes weird restrictions in gameplay (you cannot pass items to your companion) and a wonky AI.Yet it was one of the most enjoyable games I played in recent years. It balances wonderfully multiple activity's like base management, companion management, resources gathering, missions, exploring the map and the zombie killing without laying a heavy emphasis on any of it. Contains a rich atmosphere and fitting music/ambience. State of Decay - Main Game (9/10)It starts kinda slow, but after you leave the starting area heading to your first base it really gets interesting. Restarting the campaign multiple times trying something different.BreakDown - DLC (7/10)Basically the sandbox mode of main game without the story arc but with a few new playable characters and items. Has 10 levels which goes insanely hard with the last two levels, where you have pretty much no resources to work with, large strong zombie crowds and special infected everywhere.LifeLine - DLC (8/10)Plays near a infested city with a new story arc and characters. While it's not as big as it initially looks like (you cannot enter the city), it still has everything which made the main game fun, set in a new (even though smaller) environment. State of Decay is in my personal top 3 zombie games of all time with the very first Dead Rising and  Walking Dead Season 1.			"

												I really liked the concept of this open world zombie survival game, but it was let down a bit by mediocre execution. It really lacks polish, well..  that's being generous, it's just really rough around the edges.The good stuff:- You can control multiple characters - change between the survivors at home base. They have their own loadout and XP based skillset.- Permadeath - it REALLY intensifies the experience when you're on a mission, and all of a sudden you are low on health, exhausted and struggling to reach your car parked outside while a horde is on your heels.  I lost a couple of experienced survivors that way - I simply underestimated the danger and paid the cost. But learned to park close by, facing the right direction :)- Place outposts, and customize/upgrade your home base- Lots of different interesting weapons and items- Fairly diverse assortment of missions- Great atmosphere - loved the area/map. Really invited you to go explore searching for great lootThe bad:- Melee combat system too simple- Poor A.I.- The survivors are literally chronically exhausted pansies with no adrenaline glands..  GRR!- Camera getting obstructed by bushes/trees- Anti-climatic ending.Bugs/annoyances:- Zombies waist deep in.. FLOOR! You can't even melee them.- Zombies doing the running man against thigh high crates trying to reach you- Too few ""one liners"" - e.g. returning home with multiple rucksacks will often trigger the exact same ping-pong ""dialouge"" 4 times in close succession. - Cars getting relocated during cutscenes- Conversating characters during cutscenes not even remotely looking at eachother - Cars burning in the streets for weeks - energy crisis averted!-  Scavenger hunt progress increases while the ""scavenger"" is fighting outside..I could go on and on.After completing the last mission, I felt there were still so many things to try out, and achivements to accomplish. But at the same time I felt like waiting for a sequel which will hopefully have the refinement this game lacked, while retaining all the truly great things it did have. 73%			"

												It could be great game, but its UI is badly designed, player interaction is just irritating, it says its sandbox, but its more story driven than popular RPGs/adventure games, frustrating car driving mechanics, zombies spawning in walls (cant kill that one), zombies spawning inside safe guardposts, looots of zombies everywhere, you kill 20, theres plenty of them just near you spawning endlessly. While the last one trait someone could like, but for me its just frustrating. And whats more important its buggy. You cant save when you wish to. Game chooses when it automatically save, wheter its authors choosen as necessary. You dont have control of it.As of the pros :- beatiful graphics,- nice sights,- some very good gameplay ideas,- some very good game design and iteresting ideas are herebut... overall - its frustrating.

												The price is RIGHT! got this game and the expansion for approx. $15 on sale and NO REGRETS. Think GTA series meets Dead Rising. Social dynamics are interesting and the action/tension of exploring and accomplishing what it takes to make your enclave survive is really great fun. Some aspects aren't exactly intuitive, but nothing in the interface sticks out enough to detract from the main thing: Trying to survive in, and hopefully lead, a group of survivors in a zombie apocalypse. Stealth and melee and shooting? yup. Barricading and scouting from secure locations? Yup. Currying favor, stemming infighting and trying to bring in increasing numbers of divergent people under one banner? oh yes. The game delivers the goods on an aspect of the zombie genre that most games wish they could have -- that of building and guiding an enclave. RECOMMENDED.			"

YouTube™ Video: State of Decay Review 

			Views: 1,108		

			Cosmic takes a look at the zombie survival game State of Decay developed by Undead labs and published by Microsoft studios.		

 State of decay's core strengths lay within it's actual game play, it's clear early on in the game that undead labs wanted to ensure the game had a solid framework rather than just focusing on the cosmetic appeal of the genre. At its core state of decay is a survival game. I'll talk more about the games story later in the video but needless to say, you start the game and find yourself in the middle of a most unpleasant of zombie apocalypses.Stealth is key to survival in state of decay, and the game provides a variety of mechanics for you to utilize to make sure you don't find yourself surrounded by the undead hordes. Your bog standard zombie in SOD isn't the sharpest tool in the shed, their eyesight is very poor, out of sight really is out of mind in the game. The enemies do have an acute sense of hearing however, the game visually feedbacks how much noise your making, whether your searching through cupboards or breaking down locked doors, best to be as quiet as possible or you will literally have the unwashed masses at your front door in no time. Throughout the game it is often easier to kill the standard zombie by stealth kills or building yourself so very fine traps. Though noise is your worst enemy it can be your greatest ally, creating distractions with a variety of tools, can be a great way of getting out of a particularly sticky situation.One of the great things about state of decay is that its not just you versus the world. There are a lot of survivors out there and you'll eventually get to become part of a survivor community. Your community has its own base and number of people and these too things require attention. Lets start with bases, there are a number of locations in the game world that can be used as a base. You can only have one base at a time. Each base location varies in size and that’s important because as your community grows so too will the need for beds and space. Bases can be upgraded in a variety of ways, from self sustaining food gardens to guard towers, choosing what you need is crucial as space is limited. Upgrading your defences and keeping your base well stocked and guarded is important too, bases will get attacked frequently, they can be overrun and people can and will die.The survivors at your base also will need attention too. They need food, medical supplies and ammunition. Each survivor in your community has needs and desires, you wont please everyone, but its somewhat beneficial to at least try. Each survivor has an affection rating towards you, once you become friends with a survivor, that character becomes a player character meaning you can switch between characters at any time, especially useful when one becomes too fatigued to be any good in the field. The survivors in your community can be used to go out on computer controlled scavenging runs as well as used as companions to take out with you. Survivors have their own stories and ongoing lives, occasionally they will ask you to do something for them, whether it be deal with a zombie or a more side quest esc personal mission. Doing these side quests for your survivors improves your relationship with them and this is the way you will eventually be able to control them yourself.Other survivor communities populate the landscape too, you can interact with these in a variety of ways from doing missions for them to trading. Trading in state of decay works off an influence system, every-time you do missions, kill zombies etc etc your earn influence points, these influence points can then be used to purchase ammo, weapons and supplies from the survivor communities. You also need influence points to upgrade your base structures as well as a variety of scavenged resources. Sometimes you may even have the option to add some survivor communities to your own, but beware things might get a bit cramped if you don’t have the space and NPC's can have fall outs with each other, the walking dead style.One thing I really like about the game is in its RPG elements, each player character has four base skills, Cardio, wits, fighting and shooting. On top of that each individual character has a set of personal skills and traits. Take the fighting skill, this skill covers melee fighting and overall hit points. By using melee weapons on a character a lot of the time this skill will start to increase and unlock more stat bonuses. By doing certain actions a lot with a certain character this may also unlock personal traits, that add traits to that individual too, for example if you have a character that you use to scavenge a lot, you may develop a personal trait that adds a reduction to the time it takes to scavenge.The game world itself is pretty extensive for a smaller title, you have around 8 square kilometres of playable area to go explore at your will. The world ranges from very American mid west countryside to more urbanised areas. The game also features dynamic progression, meaning even when your not playing, the world is still changing, after all just because your sleeping doesn't mean those zombies are. Its important to leave your bases well stocked before you leave the game or you may load up to an abandoned base with a lot of bodies.There's a good enemy variety in the game to boot, not all zombies are brain dead walkers. There are a number of special zombies which are more of a challenge to take down. In some cases when facing specials it can be better to run to live to fight another day, especially if your low an ammo, especially if your facing the hulk esc beasts known as juggernauts. An interesting mechanic for the enemies in the game is the horde mechanic, if several average zombies converge on one area, they will start to attract others and a horde will form. These hordes can be very dangerous and are not to be taken on directly, its best to ensure the zombies around your base are as scattered as possible, keep that population down.Graphically while a eye pleasing game in most respects, state of decay does suffer from FPS drops, terrain clipping but even with some cosmetic issues it never loses that immersive feel, and because the core gameplay is so good, you actually end up forgiving its short comings. The game does a great job in the sound department, cracking zombie heads with baseball bats sounds as grim as you would expect it too, its certainly not lacking in aesthetic.Now lets talk story. The game starts you off as Marcus and your friend Ed coming back from a fishing trip in the mountain lakes, once you get back you quickly realize that all those 1980's horror movies have come true and your set off on your journey to find out what exactly is going on and how to get the hell out of there. While I don't want to spoil the games story there are some interesting plot mechanics that I do want to mention, specifically that certain story events can be missed if you ignore them too long. Spend too long wandering the world looking for supplies and some events can be missed and things will change. Not only this but certain story events can change the world around making survival increasingly difficult for you and your new found family.Even more recently the new downloadable content Breakdown has been released. Breakdown is a true sandbox mode, stripping the game of its main story allowing you to embark on a seemingly never ending quest for survival.In all Undead labs have succeeded in creating of the most enjoyable zombie survival games of recent years. The mix of solid mechanics, engaging characters and open world survival is a breath of fresh air in a genre where we seem to get a boat ton of below par games thrown at us non stop. State of decay is a must for any zombie survival fan and while its by no means perfect, you will get value for money.			"

												This game is pretty bad. It doesn't run as well as it should for looking as murky as it does. It has choppy animations and bad voice acting. The game constantly pesters you with side missions and punishes you for trying to have any fun. I promise you this game will bring you more stress than enjoyment. I bought it for the sale price and I seriously wish I didn't.			"

												State of Decay creates a potent mix of strategy, resource managament, open-world exploration, and zombie apolcalypse action in a brilliant concoction that is unlike any other single player game you've ever played. While the game is very rough around the edges and contains an assortment of glitches, State of Decay's excellent core mechanics remain interesting and incredibly enjoyable throughout the time you'll spend trying to surive in Trumball Valley. This is one of those games that will consume you once you get into the routine of survival, improving your community, and exploring the huge open world in search of survivors that may sometimes prove to be even more evil than the hordes of undead. A truly one-of-a-kind experience, and I can't wait to see what Undead Labs does next, especially if they decide to make a sequel. Highly recommended.			"

												I've finished campaign after 22 hours (I was doing every side-quest).If you like show The Walking Dead and playing games then this game is just for you!Game guides you through the simple story which is not bad as it is from this genre to be expected.Characters are lovely and combat system isn't bad.After campaign you have Breakdown and Lifetime DLC.Both are great and if you have full pack you will spend A LOT time at this game.I can recommend this game for 80% :)Edit:After chievements hunting, I can say that the game has some very bad pages in the form of bugs. So enjoy the story, but on a perfect game, find something else.			"

												So i liked this game, it has zombies, some action and open world elements, but it had some bugs. Didn't really care about the bugs it was fun enough to play, but then i saw that they released the year one survival thing not long after i bought this game, i thought hmm lets see if it isnt just a free upgrade for this game. But they had to dissapoint me it was a copy of this game with improved graphics and double the bugs, worst of all this game is completely abandoned and its impossible to get a refund for it even if you're thinking of buying the YOSE. So do i recommend this game? NO. Do i recommend the YOSE? Maybe, if you're willing to look past the bugs and if the game is on -95% or something....			"

												So I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into with this game when I got it. I had watched a couple of people play the first 20 minutes or so when it first turned up. I am really, completely and utterly pleasantly surprised. I loved every minute of playing it.I'm a scaredy cat & I normally coward out of things after a short while. Not so with this. It's not really scary at all even for me (though the noises a couple of the special mobs make gives me the creeps).It's certainly not a difficult game, and while I don't normally use that as a reason for critique it really could stand to be more difficult - though I know some people have said otherwise & I think that comes down to play-style. I lost one survivor but only because I was dumb and in a rush and switched survivors when I thought she was somewhere safe and she mysteriously died in that same spot. That's all. In amidst the pot luck of who will survive when you log back in it was my own lethargy that got her. You become strangely attached to a couple of the members of the group despite them being mostly ambiguous people - you really do feel that it's your responsibility to look after them.The thing with this game is it is a persistent world. Think animal crossing - if you leave for too long things happen. I played it every day over the holidays logging off each time only once everyone was safe & sound and morale was full. I never returned to any nasty surprises other than a couple of enclaves getting over-run but - that's their own fault ;P If you can dedicate the hours in a short enough time frame it's not a deal-breaker but if you want to put it down and pick it up where you left off a couple of weeks later you might just find it burning around your feet. If you still have feet.Using an X-box controller at least it was so smooth and satisfying to fight and running over zombies and hearing them pop when you run over them is just, satisfying. They don't really explain much to you but, I didn't find this off-putting but I did have to google what Fame & Influence really did.For me it really could have stood to be a longer game - to have had the next area open up and be able to move up into a larger home base. But then I was lucky enough to have the time to maintain morale & resources. The OCD in me loves searching buildings & seeing the little X's appear on buildings once you've cleared them.And finally the story - it's nothing ground breaking or complex but just enough to make me feel a little sick. And for a game that's just a little sick, that's not too bad to me.			"

												The limit to how much you can have in your base supply is stupid, there's 4 pickup trucks sitting outside my base that I'm just using for storage since turning supply packs in just makes them vanish when the base is full. You can break them open to get goodies based on what kind of supply it is, but its a total waste for materials supplies. You can also call in someone to come collect them, but they might only get like +4, when taking the supply to turn it in yourself you get 15, so... The max vehicle storage area is only 6 (That I know of), and the smallest is 4, so I don't get how a pickup truck could have the same storage size of a police car, but have 2 more places than a muscle car. The most useful supply is materials, for base upgrades, and theres only a handful of them to find without having radio girl tell you were some is. Ammo, food, fuel and medicine are just sitting in the pickups outfront till I might need some. Mashing LMB at zombies seems to be the safest bet in most combat situations, most of your survivers wont have a high enough skill level for special moves. This makes the first guy you play as much more useful than anyone else since he gets a huge xp boost in the starting tutorial. If you go out with someone who sucks overall, taking a budy pal with you will make it infinately easier since they dont seem to have health. Letting them get swarmed and using the previously described fighting style solves all problems when getting swarmed. Driving is crazy finicky, holding w in some cars launches you at lightspeed and you can stop on a dime if you let go of it, but getting out at highspeeds makes the car fly down the road from you. Ammo takes a rediculous amount of backpack space, 30 rounds being the stack cap for each ammo type and reloading takes a decade for every gun. I cant stand the suppressor shot limit, some being 10, the most I've seen is 50 I think, the UI is strange like that.			"

												I'm torn about whether or not to recommend this game. On one hand, it's fun, and has some pretty cool ideas. On the other hand, there are lots of bugs that cause some pretty big issues. It irritates me when devs make DLC for a game before fixing the base game first.Overall, I enjoyed the game. At least one game breaking bug happened while I was playing, that I was only able to solve by researching the problem online. Because there are still such major flaws, I cannot recommend State of Decay, in good faith, in its current condition.			"

												Almost 70 hours of single player game and still the game does not bore me. Though having pretty much big world, many ways of spending your time in the game and 2 dlcs, it's stll not enough, I want more. Can't help myself but think why there's no cooperative mode, considering that there are even way of expressing your attitude like TAUNT, CHEER and etc. It beats me. The game can have second wind if given the coop and a new story mode for multiplayer.State of decay is very addictive. Though the whole potential has not been developed. "

												I really want to love this game, but I can't. I love the idea of an open world game where you don't just have to survive, but you also have to build a community and make choices that make a difference in the end. And the game does an OK job of that, but it throughs these tiny wrenches that mess everything up and ruin the game.Pros: +High stakes- it saves just about everytime you do anything, so if you ♥♥♥♥ up, then you ♥♥♥♥ed up.+It gives personality to some of the characters, making them more enjoyable to play as+ You can play as any survivor you save ( I don't know, I think this is a really cool game mechanic)Cons: + like i said before, when you mess up there's no going back, and that creates tenssio, which is awesome.... until you die as your favorite character. Some of the characters have dialog that is so much better than others and when they die, it's frustrating.+ The controls are often unresponsive, especially when you go from interacting with something to moving+The most fun I had in this game had to be when I was running over zombies with a car, zombies fling left and right is just so satisfying. But after you hit around 20 zombies ( which will take you around 30 seconds to do) your car engine starts to smoke and if you kit more zombies, the engine catches on fire and the car explodes+The graphics arn't that good and when you turn your camera in any direction, this wierd bluring affect happens and it just makes the game annoying to look atI get that some that they're trying to make this game intense, where when your survivors die, the die for good and you have to live with that, and some people might love that ( I this is you, then you might want to get this game). But it's just frustrating to me. If I die as a character, chances are that it's my favorite character since i like to play as that character. It's annoying how I might get so far through a playthrough and then some bs happens and I die. Like I said I love the idea of a game like this, but it does so many tiny annoying things where I'v just gotten tired of plying it. I would much rather have a fun game where I can ♥♥♥♥ around, than a game where 1 ♥♥♥♥ up means inevitable death.TL;DR: If you like games like h1z1 or the farcry series, then I would just wait till a sale.

												This is a game with a few faults, bugs and glitches yet it's still one of the best zombie games. Survival is the main priority, find a home and upgrade it, build a storage or kitchen, medical center or workshop. Find other survivers to join you. Playing as different characters was fun, looking for supplies in buildings is a nice touch of realism. Melee combat is pretty good but i found the aiming with guns annoying and troublesome. The story was meh and could of been better but overall i'd say it's an awesome game, It focuses on survival and not just killing as many zombies you can which was a nice change.			"

												With so many Zombie Apocalypse Titles out there, the whole scene is getting boring rather fast, but I must honestly say that State of Decay is a great game. It's the same as most other zombie apocalypse game do everything you can to survive scavenge, fortify your base and so on and so forth but they did it a bit different.You start off with 2 friends Marcus and Ed at a campsite in the mountains where you meet up with a couple of other survivors who ask you to look around a bit to see if you can find any other survivors, the first person you meet is Maya, a soldier who was out by the lake with two of her friend, sadly her friends were overrun and killed by the zombies. Your little group of 3 then make your way back to the ranger station only to find everyone there has also been killed. You get hold of a two way radio and from there the actual fun begins when you head toward your first home base.Once at your new home base you need to make friends, you only have access to certain gear if you do your part and put in the leg work. Now you are going to do a lot of running in this game, a lot of button mashing fighting and you are going to get very upset at yourself for making stupid mistakes that get you killed, because if you die then you’re dead. That’s it that character that dies is gone forever, never to be seen again. SO DON'T DIE... Remember you are not super human.The game is not very hard but at the same time it's not very easy either at first you run up to every zombie you can find to beat up to see all the different cool moves your character has to take down zombies but as you progress you learn one very important thing, being overrun is dangerous, too many zombies in a small space could be fatal and so you find yourself avoiding contact later in the game.So what makes the game great? Well here's a list of why I think it's a great game.1. The story progresses if and when you want it to, though there are plenty missions available you don't have to do them all.2. If you scavenge supplies and you find more than you can carry you can call in for help. Leave the premises and a friend or two will go get the remainder of the supplies.3. Relocating your home base, as your circle grows you need more space, and different home bases give different ""Rewards""4. The Zombies are balanced out, it’s not like most other games where there are little or no zombies, or they are massively over populated and you have almost no chance of survival.5. The vehicle damage is very realistic, you hit a fence or a couple of zombies a few times and you are going to start getting radiator problems.But there are also a few bad things in the game.1. You find yourself doing the same thing over and over again a lot in the game. 2. The game has no manual save option, which makes it more realistic ( I actually like this ) but it's bad for when you make a stupid mistake and end up dead then you sit there afterwards and think why the hell did I do that.3. This is probably what bugs me the most, the whole time you are playing the game it feels like you are sitting behind a console, and I am a very big console Hater and I am not afraid to say it. The game feels like a cheap console port to PC and it's close to unplayable with a keyboard and mouse, if you want to enjoy the game you will need a controller.4. The gun mechanics doesn't work too well, due to the fact that the game is third person you often find yourself shooting at strange angles which in reality would be impossible to hit the target but in the game it works.This is by far one of my longest reviews ever, but a lot of words to describe a good game.My Rating - 8/10 - The Console port to PC is a big disappointment and makes the game difficult to play on a keyboard and mouse. Seriously a great game. Buy it..._+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_Breakdown DLC ReviewI played through State of Decay and really enjoyed the game but I did however find the game very short and was a little disappointed when I finished it was almost as if the game just got good and then it was finished. But a little while after I finished I saw that Breakdown was available and I must say If you love State of Decay as much as I do then this DLC is just for you. This DLC basically takes the game as we know and remove the whole story mode and turns it into a full on sandbox mode, your only goal is to survive and eventually when you want fix an old RV randomly located on the map and hop out of town with 5 of your best mates. Once you do that you start from scratch again, less loot, more zombies and stronger zombies. The map gets randomized but the idea stays the same SURVIVE! A lot of people complain saying this DLC wasn't added content but just removed content but I say good work, now the game can be enjoyed for much longer. I will definitely recommend this DLC. It also adds a few new achievements for achievement hunters as State of Decay is one of the very easy games to complete all the achievements but these however aren't as easy as the base game.Get it - Enjoy it - Rate itMy Rating 9/10Only bad thing in breakdown is that there are too many side missions going on at the same time, almost impossible to do them all and keep everyone happy and progress in the game. I find myself almost helping a stranger in trouble every 5 to 10 minutes.			"

												This is exactly how I imagine a Open World Zombie Survival Simulation game would be, In fact I'm surprised how good the game actually is, anyway here are my thoughts;Pros- Large Open World, I've only just explore the first two areas, there’s still so much more areas I need to discover. - Different Types of Zombie Enemies- Nice and Fluid Combat System, and Running Over Zombies with your car or door attack always feels great :D- Like an actual Simulator, there are limited amount of cars & fuel resources and they can blow up/get damaged, your weapons can break, and your character can get injured and tired, and It can be difficult to fight back large zombie hoards if you are alone when all of the above happens to you :P- You Can Establish Outposts around the Town, Create medical bays, gardens to grow your own food, radio tower for communication, shooting lookouts to improve your community overall shooting skills and defensive range of your Outpost.Your community can also expand larger by finding more suvivors.- You will need to go out for supply runs every so often to make sure you have enough Food, Medicine, Building materials, Ammo etc.- Controller Enabled! :D (I think the game feels better playing with a controller - Might just be my personal preference)- Countless of Hours PlaytimeCons - I noticed there were a few negative reviews saying this game can get repetitive, due to the quests which are given like random shortages/goods or trades with your fellow neighbours, with that being said players can get bored and stop playing. - When it gets dark you should be given the option to sleep.- Single Player Only.Suggestions/FeedbackI think if this game is already very good for what it is. Very fun and Enjoyable. Personally, i'd give it a 8/10 but if it wanted a 10/10. What i'd suggest is.. - Since there are already a few main characters you meet at the start of the game you could tell an in-depth story for each character like in GTA 5 you can switch characters and play through different characters story and learn more about them, also some good cut scenes would be quite great, perhaps with some conflict between two or more characters or even other groups.- New Expansion in the near future with a map extention, new weapons, cars, homes that go up to like 50-100 people to manage, go out in groups of 5-10 to do super dangerous missions, everything in big scale too :P Last but not least If this game was Online, Multiplayer, Co-op would be super awesome, simply cause playing with friends makes games even more enjoyable.Anyway those are my Pros, Cons and Suggestions. I Love this game and I recommend giving state of decay a shot if you enjoy games in this genre, Thanks for reading.- Chrono			"

												Too much hype for the intro video... Played this game for about 18 hours, which is not a lot of gameplay time for an open world that generates the same 4-6 types of side missions over and over again... I'm honestly 50-50 on this game, but what really caused me to choose to not recommend this game was the major cliff hanger at the end and being shocked at how short this game is and how much time I pretty much wasted on doing side missions not knowing which missions were progressive ones, so I spent probably 10 hours out of the 18 for doing almost pointless stuff.This game was fun, I enjoyed the side missions for the first 3 times they generated, and gathering supplies to progress in this game, but this game could have had more realism and more stuff to do. I don't suggest expecting lots out of this game and instead I suggest trying out DayZ (standalone&mod version). It's more realistic and you basically create your own adventure and story line if you are into making it seem like that. I'd give this game a 5/10. "

												Welcome to Trumbull Valley. Enjoy the skull smashing and decapitation, and don't worry about those red smudges on your clothes, it's perfectly normal in here!State of Decay, an arcade-ish zombie ""sandbox"" game by Undead Labs. ""Sandbox"" because you have the possibility to do what you want (in game limitations of course), without any time limits.There is a story, but it's not what you should buy this game for. It's the fun from killing zombies, and building a community to survive.""Building a community""? Yes. You have it in here. You start out small, with some people barely tying up an end with the other end, and you are supposed to help them survive. Or you can just ignore them completely and go kill some zombies. Up to you.The combat is pretty enjoyable. The game doesn't have any tutorials on to how to kill that walking corpse, but you will figure it out fairly quickly. Or just check the wiki. There are few types of zombies, from the normal shambling ones, through sprinting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and ending with a juggernaut that requires some effort to take out.Gameplay itself is also done well. You can get into nearly every building you see, you can look around for supplies to help your group survive, you can swap between characters. And there's character progression.Many people recommend playing on a pad, but I actually have no difficulties to play on a keyboard & mouse.Graphics are nice, even for a X360 game, made on CryEngine 3. AI is good enough (as for a zombie).If you are looking for a game where you kill zombies, run around and do stuff, and where it ""tries"" to simulate an apocalypse, then this is it.I got this for full price, and I am not disappointed. There's a living modding community going, so the game has at least some years of life more. Although, if you do not care about a story mode, and you prefer just a survival sandbox, you should also get Breakdown DLC.			"

I feel the storyline could of definately been continued, the character development was nice and once again could of been developed further. I feel the bases were a bit lacking, I could think of a dozen ways to improve them but modding wouldnt resolve those issues.

												State of Decay is a survival games that put you in a world full of zombies or zeds as the people in this game called them.The first thing i have to say about this game is this game isn't perfect, it got alot of bugs that sometimes can get you really angry at it. The most annoying bug that i encountered so far is when a zombie noclipping through the wall and when sometimes when you press up, your character when the opposite way, that is really frustrating when you try to help your follower from getting killed by a zombie. But, i still give it a thumbs up. Why ?? Because this game gave me some really unique experience that i can't get from any other games. It gave me absolute freedom in a world full of zombies, and many of the game mechanic really give me the impression that you are not a superhero, you are just a group of people that trying to survive this harsh world full with zombie, and you spend your day trying to find supplies in some of the abandoned building for your group so they can survive for another day. One of the game mechanic that i really like is the permadeath, When the character you controlled or other character in your community died, they died for good. No respawn, just death.Soo far, this game is really great. Buggy, but great. Do you ever wander what is like to surviving in the world full of zombie and still have fun ? Then, this is a truly awesome game for you ! It prove that what makes games good is not the graphic or how polished is the game, but how fun is the gameplay. Recommended !			"

												To begin, this game has shocked me. I watched probably the first 1 min of the game and decided not to try it out. Later on , it was on sale and I tried it out.It is addicting. Seriously.I wanted a zombie game where you can move around and scavenge. Surviving with other people is excellent, too.I will state the problems I had until now:1. No online. Multiplayer, co-op, whatever. It would be better if I DIDNT HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME. Also, there aren't a lot of places to go after you explored everything. 2. Game can be frustrating when you have to babysit everyone. Like seriously, every day one person is sad, or angry and I have to take them for a walk like a child. Seriously. Take it out. Or make it rare. I'm getting sick and tired of that.3. More DLCs and maps would be great. Seriously, this game needs to be continued. It is incredibly immersive and it should have more content added.4. Let us manually save. I don't want to continue with dead survivors. 5. Two reasons why the survivors died:A) Ever paused a game and alt-tabbed to quickly chat with someone or look something up? Well, doing that about 65% of the time, the game CONTINUES BY ITSELF. I died 2-3 time because of that. It is so stupid. B) Saving a downed survivor.....is hard. I managed to save one....but she blew up....literarily....Why? No idea.Other than that, I love the game. Cars and special zombies are excellent. Anyone who is a fan of zombie games and open world gameplay will absolutely love this game. I wish the developers will release more content which I will buy instantly. I am currently playing this till i feel like not playing it until DLCs come out. Which is usually over 50 hours. :)I recommend this game to anyone who is considering to get it. Hope they update it more in the future.Thank you. :)Btw, Just read the topic in the forum addressing the multiplayer. I can see why there will not be a multiplayer. There will never be which is sad since this game had potential.			"

												If you like hitting the undead with an array of melee weapons, Shooting round after round into advancing hoards.Or simply scavenging for supplies and rescuing survivors. Then you should absolutely check out State Of Decay.I enjoyed this game a lot. Searching for supplies never gets old and I think that is because the loot varies, from basic food supplies (coffee, snacks, ect) to medicine or ammo, melee weapons of all sorts and guns. Who doesn't love finding a stash of ammo for that one favourite gun of yours? Searching for supplies feels natural in this game. And it really adds to the survival element.State Of Decay is slow paced compared to a lot of other zombie games and a lot of the time you'll have to take your time to really assess your group of survivors and the base as even when you're not playing, the game itself is still active. I left off with good morale within the group and came back the next day to find one of the survivors had fallen sick and another had died. So the game really keeps you on your toes and is constantly changing.In the game you'll be able to complete a lot of missions, you'll pretty much always have something to do however if you ignore missions for long enough or simply get occupied doing other things within the game certain missions will solve themselves, not always in a good way either. Fail to help a fellow survivor kill a certain zombie, or find a lost survivor and they might die doing the mission on their own. So the game really encourages you to constantly be active. However this doesn't happen for every mission so if you prefer just exploring and doing supply runs, then do your thing. The game is far from perfect and there is honestly a few things that could have been polished further, the driving mechanics feel clunky and occasionally the AI will do a few silly things. However playing the game I found myself looking past those things and instead simply enjoying the world and gameplay and of course fretting over my survivors. Stop getting sick ya'll!!! Would recommend!  "

												This is just for Lifeline DLC, since Steam won't let me add it right there.Do not buy Lifeline. It's utterly broken. Not only that, but some of the game mechanisms have been adjusted to be downright ridiculous. Original State of Decay was filled with bugs, but I've managed to get to it when most of that was apparently fixed. Unfortunately, as it seems, developers learned nothing and same thing happened here.- Game hands down cheats. Zombie respawn is ridiculous - you clean a room, then you turn your back and few seconds later they're back. I think they've wanted to make this DLC more difficult, but there are better ways to do it without making the player feel cheated.- Also, when you make your game harder, make sure you'll also adjust survavability of the friendly AI. They were equally dumb in original, but there weren't many situations where AI gets surrounded by 10 zombies. AI doesn't know the term running away, they're mindless drones. I've lost several NPCs just because all they understand is to attack and when they get overrun, there is nothing you can do.- In fact, NPCs have problems doing even the simpliest things, like running through doors or getting in cars.- Car physics, if you can even call it that, makes them very easy to flip over, because we're apparently on moon. Two times I've been launched in the air with my car without doing anything else than getting close to some object (pathway, building).- Due to map design, lots of it happens in quite close quarters and corridors, which makes it excellent for your character to get stuck in group of zombies without any chance to get out. You can just watch your character glitch through them as you desperately mash buttons to no awail.- Reloading weapons sometimes doesn't work and works only when you zoom in.- When I say this ♥♥♥♥ is utterly broken, I mean it. When siege happens, if you're in middle of saving someone, you magically can't talk to them, which forces you to leave them and come for them again, if they manage to survive. I don't know how long have they tested this DLC, but there are huge issues that anyone has to run into after few minutes of playing...- Last but not least, you would think that soldiers will be a little more competent with firearms than civilians, but no, your teamates can't shoot for their life, and they're more than happy to let their fellow soldiers to die and continue shooting like it's 4th July.The home defence system just doesn't outweight so many problems this DLC has, and it's not so fun as it might seem at first, because sieges usually happen when you least need it. Overall, this piece of rotten meat has brough me a lot of frustration.. Avoid it like a plague it is, play original game. I have lost a lot of hope that Undead Labs will release something playable in future, if this is supposed to be their standard now.			"

												State of Decay is an amazing survival hardcore open world game, that could have been even better, yet unfortunatly it isn't, and let me explain. Your objective in the game is to survive. You need to gather supplies, make sure your home is safe and that there is always enough food, ammo and madicine. You start the game as a regular character who finds a house with his friends, and make your way to the top until you are pretty much in charge of the house. Once you have enough influence you can make big decitions, such as moving to a diffrent place and such.While this is good, the game has one big problem. The characters in the game are very boring and dont really tell a story. You can't really communicate with them, but only with basic commends like ""Hi, come and follow me"" and such. The game does a good job at keeping you busy and giving you new missions all the time.In overall, State of Decay is a very good game, that could have been even better, which I see as a very big miss. I give the game 8.5/10, and with deeper characters and a better storyline, I think it'd deserve a 10/10. Big miss, but still a good game.			"

												I loved this game... I shelved it after a full play through. I came back after some time to find it unsupported and a discussion thread from the developer asking us to buy the game again as a newly remastered one year edition. How about a free upgrade since I already gave you money? I could understand if the game was no longer supported because it was a decade old, but it was only 1 FRICKING YEAR OLD and now unsupported.The current state of the game is BROKEN and will not run properly with NVidia drivers. You literally have to disable your Nvidia card in your device manager and run the Intel card. There is not a patch or support.Just an FYI, Undead Labs has done a great job deflecting this whole debacle by blaming Microsoft Studios saying it was a contact obligation so the new Year One Survial Edition could be playable on XBox 1. However, a little research will show that aside from the DLC and YOSE, all of their games are unsupported and no longer sold, some less than a year old. PURE CASH GRAB!AVOID UNDEAD LABS. They are scam artists. They will never see another dollar of mine and I strongly suggest you keep your money as well.			"

It's an alright game too but such a ♥♥♥♥ing d!ck move by developer has made me give such a bad review.So basically they stopped development on this and still is buggy...I feel whoever purchased this game got RIPPED OFF.Do I recommend this game...HELL NO and do I recommend any future titles from UNDEAD LABS...HELL NO "

												9/10 !!!Probabbly the most enjoyable zombie open world game around ( at least for me ;p ) . yes its repetitive mission sometimes can make you bored to death also its too damn hard for casual or weekend warrior game but ..... the feeling and thrill of exploring and looting in this game is perfect for open world zombie killing rpg lover. Anyone who paid $60 for Dead Island or Left 4 Dead should feel pretty well ripped off by now. This game is $20 (sometimes 5$ on sale ) , .if you have $20 to spend on a zombie survival game, do yourself a favor and spend it here. but still the biggest dissapointment is the fact it has no CO-OP or multiplayer mode :( if  only they add it...... then its a dream come true....

												Update: Was able to finally finish the game, took a lot of restarts and manually going to areas that seemed to potentially trigger the conitnuation of the story. Never got any of the remaining side missions though, like for the Wilkersens...but honestly idc anymore. Still a thumbs down. Hope they actually make an effort with SoD 2.Sadly, I have to give this a thumbs down, because it's a buggy mess. The gameplay in itself is nice, the story is ok-ish, nothing crazy...the game is more about building up your home base and interacting with your neighbours. So it's a 3rd person zombie survival simulator with perma death for your poor people if they actually die. You go around scavenging stuff, helping people, upgrading or relocating your base, setting up outposts, exploring the world, killing zombies, etc.In between that stuff you have quite a few story missions (rather short usually) that advance the overall plot. The only ♥♥♥♥ing problem is: There is no telling whether any mission it seems will actually spawn or not. And it seems everyone has these issues, yet the devs never fixed that bs...maybe in the Year One edition, but that's not even any ♥♥♥♥ing excuse to not fix THIS version of the game. So, sometimes restarting the game works, sometimes not (at the moment). I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to finish it. Some missions won't spawn at all, while the final missions have after a restart, up until now. Extremely annoying and that's why it gets a thumbs down.   Apart from that the ""off-line continuing world"" is pretty annoying. It's a SP game, so when I'm not playing it, please don't advance the game...thanks. Just annoying to start up the game and have several rescue missions queued up, because your people are just too stupid to survive on their own.DLCs are rather boring. One has you playing an endless game on the same map as the original game without any story missions, the other puts you in the shoes of a soldier, but also almost exclusively spawns random search and rescue missions. You're kinda supposed to just hold out and survive Zombie sieges. Not that interesting. After every siege there is a new story development, but nothing ground breaking. My GOD this game gets SO ♥♥♥♥ing boring. The same missions over and over and over again, pitting you against tougher and tougher opposition. Can't be arsed to finish the DCL...			"

												I would reccomend to play this game, but I wouldn't buy the original if they are willing to charge for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t year-one copy. The game is somewhat fun but it gets boring after a few hours and has many bugs. The devs seem to never fix anything, instead of a free patch, the developers decide to resell the game as a new version. BAD MARKETING, This company will not do well in the future if this how they treat game owners.I think its unfair to charge someone who already owns the entire game and all its dlc's for the year one edition for better performance. Microsoft can go screw themselves with this cashcow methodology. I would rather play Dying Light then re-buy a game for better performance. I should get a free patch or something since I have already payed for the original game with all the DLC's.Update for 2017.I stand by my original review for this game.I will add that the game had great potential, and I did enjoy the game with hopes of getting free updates.For those considering to buy State of Decay 2, I would hold off for a year to see if they decidide to come out with another YOSE. Just avoid giving these developers any of your money until they can actually provide a finished product that reflects what they promise to the public.I love Zombie games and like to play them all at least once It just saddens me that this game never had multiplayer to begin with. To hear thats what they are doing for the second only makes me assume that they are using the same exact game engine, with just updated graphics and multiplayer added (like they said they would try for in the first installment).You need to purchase with extreme caution, or not purchase at all in my opinion.

												My initial impressians? This is shaping up to become the most satisfying zombie survival experience. . .EVER.This is where you will find gameplay elements that not only define the undead appocalypse, but are absent from any competing zombie titles. Excellent sandbox gameplay allow fellow survivors to die permanently and resting is achieved through closing the game and coming back to it, genius. The base building is also a great addition to this genre, and it is great to see it so successfully implemented here. Characters are well rounded and unique, they feel like they could respresent an actual human being, lending all the more to the sense of loss when one succumbs to death. This is a monumental title in the genre of zombie games.			"

												Was] not impressed with this game. I thought it was going to a little more free but I was bothered with the fact that every minute somebody needed help in some other town. Combat was not bad at all, I just felt over burdened with people needing help and supplies half way across the map, then by the time I get there they're dead or the mission is gone. Exploring and foraging for food was really cool and added a survival aspect, but gathering for the survivors was a bit of a annoyance to me. Left me doing too much for the Stronghold and not enough for myself. Felt like I couldn't enjoy the game and was forced to gather way too much. Some may enjoy this game but I didn't enjoy it alot.

												My favorite game in the zombie genre - 9/10It's got a lot going for it, I like the action combat and how ammo is scarce so you have to get good with the melee combat, but once you master it the melee is devestating and there are so many different weapons.  Plus there is RPG like advancement of your main character and the other 'party' members you recruit along the way as each has a variety of skills and each skill advances as it's used unlocking further skills and special attacks/abilities.  It also has a very nice open world which rewards exploration as pretty much any location you find out of the way will have some nice loot to scavenge (better weapons, backpacks, etc.).  You also build yourself a base/community and have to manage various resources and personalities.  Helping out strangers opens up trade options and if you help them enough they'll be friendly and ask to join your community, but it's still up to you whether you want to add them and support them through play or no.  There are also more things to do than you can possibly get done timewise so you have to choose who to help and what to put priority on; but I've found gives me that sense of just one more thing and then I'll quit... awww just one more...     If you like the game then the Breakdown DLC adds a new game type where instead of following the story of the main campaign you have a minor story just the framework of survival for the world but gives RPG like goals in accomplishing certain things like using certain weapon types, or other accomplishments which unlock hero characters you can recruit where they don't start with minimal skills but instead have special items and upgraded skills.The one complaint I have is that it's very hard to maintain a clear zombie free area.  Seems like more often than not you only get a few steps away from a building you've cleared and zombies are right back into since the zombies seem to mostly spawn right around where your current character is, and I wish I could just lock some of my party/community members in our home so they'd stop going off on their own and getting in trouble within minutes of my rescuing them from one thing they are back out looking for trouble again.  Also for some missions which have a limited time to respond it would be nice to know what those timeframes are or see some color scheme like green, yellow, red so that you'd better know which ones need to be prioritized without having to keep track of when they showed up relative to the other available missions.

												   State of Decay you say?   First thing's first. Let's get the bad out of the way.   The biggest issues I had with this game were frame rate drops in certain areas at high speeds, some texture pop-in here and there, a few times zombies getting stuck on fences, doors and such.   And now, the story.   The Story is nothing to get worked up about. 2 guys get back from a fishing trip to find themselves in a completely different world and it just sort of goes on from there. Nothing too spectacular or surprising really. I sort of figured where things were going before they actually happened. Let me be clear. I'm not saying it's bad. It's just nothing to write a bestseller or make a blockbuster movie about.   The graphics were not created to compete with Crysis or Metro. They did their job. It's not Borderlands 2, The Walking Dead or, as stated above Metro.    The gameplay is where the game shines. You get tossed in a bunch of small towns in Turnbull County. Minutes after you get past the whole this is what's happening and how you're supposed to play it part you make your way to the first safehouse. After that, it's all on you. To make it past that you have to break into houses all over the county to get what you need. Guns, materials to improve your house, meds, gas, guns, food, weapons, guns, ammo, other items and of course MORE guns to add to your storage and keep yourself alive and well.   Speaking of storage, State of Decay uses an interesting mechanic. You don't use money. I mean it is the end of the world basically. Instead, by completing story or side missions that pop up here and there once in a while you get to increase your fame. Fame is what limits the amount of influence you can get. Influence is won by looting items from said houses and dropping them in the storage unit and also by completing the said missions. The same influence is used to take items out of your households' or other survivors' storage. I know it sounds strange but I found out it works quite well.   The most important aspect of the gameplay is probably permadeath. In State of Decay you're not the hero. You start off with 2 characters of which one you control and quite soon you get to meet a 3rd which then makes the game reveal an important part of the game. Every person in the game has stamina and health, traits, skills based on traits and then unlockable skills once you get to a certain level. Your health goes down and die, you're done. Instead, if you have a good enough relationship with a character you get to select for that person to take charge and you get to play with the said person instead, in case you get hurt or get tired. You can't swap your charater if the relationship is too low, the game doesn't allow that in case of story-important characters or if that person is too tired or too injured. As such, even if you get over your loved (or skilled) charater dying, you need to keep your household happy, recruit other survivors to join your household by helping them stay alive long enough for your relantionship with that group to be high enough for them to want to join.   All in all, if I were to give this game a mark based on what it tried to achieve and what it actually achieved I would say a solid 8.5 / 10.			"

												There is some residual beta-like wonkiness this game never truly escapes, but I have to say, it is the closest anyone has ever gotten to the perfect zombie game. It's open world, you can pick among a variety of safehouses and fortify/upgrade them, and go rescue/recruit other survivors. The map is nice, the combat is fun, and the expansion pack adds a TON of replay value. Assuming it's on sale, as it so often is, and you can get both the base game and the DLC for $20 or less, it's a great deal, and you probably won't end up furious about the minor glitches you encounter along the way. It's also gotten fantastic support from its devs, with frequent updates and fixes, so it gets a little better every few weeks. I also give them points for having a lot of strong, fun, female characters, which far too many games ignore, considering it's now 2014, not the mid-1800s.			"

												Probably the most thrilling, suspensful, and eerie open world survivor game out! I've dreamed for a long time, about a game where you have to race against the clock and rely on your survival gaming skills, to hone the ability to progress in a game. Imagine how it would be for you in a zombie apocalypse. How you'd cope and contribute to the  community to ensure survival... how your actions influence whether the group lives another day, The feature of switching between different playable characters and how their varied personalities can affect the progress in the learning of skills, or emotional stability to see if they'll disrupt or benefit the morale of the group. Everything about this game is so realistic it really raises the question to the players-How would you survive in a State of Decay?			"

												I absolutely love this game as you can see from my hours played. I have the original and Breakdown. Breakdown really added a lot of replayability. There is a continuous amount of questing that can be done with consequences of ignoring them. There are several very nice mods available on their forums as well. If the game is too easy for you then you can make it more difficult, if it is too hard you can make it easier. I personally didn't like how you could just mow down everything with vehicles so I got a mod that makes vehicles more fagile. You are able to switch characters and get them higher in their skills of fighting, running, searching, etc. If you want to play the more sneaking around and avoiding zombies then you can very easily do that. It just really allows you to play the game the way you want to play it without locking you into one way of doing this. Highly recommend this game.			"

												State of Decay is a fun game, you get to experience how a community ""survives"" the zombie apocalypse.  You aren't just one person, once you've befriended others who you help or save, you can play as them and improve their abilities to further enhance your chances of survival.  Once your community is big enough you can strike out and take over larger bases (there's three base sizes, small medium and large) or keep it small and stay somewhere outside of the towns.It's not without its flaws, some zombies manage to clip through walls & doors either visually or physically, also executing them on stairs has issues and the vehicles are very floaty, it's amazing how high a truck can spin and flip.The end of the world is a dangerous place, mutant zombies and roaming hordes can seriously make a supply run turn into a really bad day.  Running is the best option or a car if you can to get out of there when tables turn badly.There have been two DLCs so far, Breakdown & Lifeline.  Breakdown is without story and you play till you're ready and have fixed up an RV to escape the valley.  This causes the game map to randomise & reset and also makes the game harder, you can also unlock heroes who can help turn the tide.Lifeline is a side story told around the same time as the base game, you follow a group of soldiers who have to hold onto their base camp while evacuating high value targets, usually those who have information/expertise with the ""virus"" and some civilians if you can.All in all for a console port of an xbox live arcade game, it's pretty good and fun, the melee combat can be quite fluid and ranged head shots are an instant kill for most zombies.  The game also has a permadeath system where if you die you're gone and have to move on without that person.  I'd give it a solid 8/10, you can play it many ways and the dlcs add a lot of different options.			"

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E20 State of Decay 

			Views: 376		

			A really great single player zombie survival game. With plenty to do and only $20, can't think of many reasons to not own this great title. Aside from the obvious.		

State of Decay: State of Decay is a very decent zombie survival game, you'll manage a base, take care of survivors, find supplies, fight zombies both regular and special and most importantly, survive and that's about it. The game never breaks out of the routine of surviving; you'll experience all the game has to offer within the first few hours of the game. The overall style of the game feels very ""realistic"" if you're smart about surviving you'll do just fine, maybe losing the occasional survivor to extreme circumstances. The game isn't some impressive graphical powerhouse but, honestly they are well above average and decent; lighting during the day and night cycles are great and the special zombies easily stand out from the regular ones and overall the details here and there are great, especially for a $20.00 title. Music is the game is subdued but really great; it’s fun to have a successful outing and have some music set the mood. Voice acting is... ok, it’s not laughably horrible but, not some of the greatest and you'll also end up hearing the same actor for multiple characters fairly quickly. The game is an open-world sandbox, once you're past the initial tutorial area you're free to roam about as you wish for the most part, with main story missions pushing you to new areas with a wealth of land to explore and plenty of side activities and main story missions. Beating the main story took me roughly about 15 or more hours not counting the side missions I did. You’re mileage will vary with State of Decay, but there is plenty of content here for a $20.00 purchase. TL/DR; State of Decay is a fun survival game and nails down that aspects really well, but it will soon get repetitive and if you don’t love the game within the first few hours, chances are you won’t change your mind after 15 but, for $20.00 it’s a pretty darn good video game. -Thumbs Up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork "

												It is hard for me to recommend or not recommend a game because I get the vast majority of my games on sale, and thus I weigh the recommendation on the price. Would I recommend State of Decay for full-price? No, but I would for a more reasonable one. Initially I had a great time with this game, but after a few hours hours its repetative nature is painfully obvious. You have everything down, the side-quests go in a circle, while you wait for the main-quest to advance. The looping AI voices become an annoyance. Unlike what the description said, you cannot decide what way the story goes. I still managed to sink quite a bit more hours into this because I enjoyed driving around and being in the world but the game kept trying to pull me back into the framework, and I tried a second time to see if I could change anything, but it was the same deal. If you have more money to spend than me and can't wait - buy it. Otherwise, I recommend waiting for another sale.			"

												This is a good zombie survival game.  You have to manage a community of survivors, scavenge for food, guns, ammo, fuel or materials to upgrade your main base or explore the map to find new places to establish. There are also storyline missions and secondary missions, like helping other survivors or one of your homies. But I can't recommend this version of the game.  The developers are making a new remastered version called ""State of Decay: Year-One Survival Edition"" that contains new missions, weapons and characters, graphics enhancements and includes both DLC.  So if you are looking for this game, just wait and check the new version, which is cheaper than buying this old version + the DLC.			"

												Couple of key things then a few thoughts.Its a cosole port to the PC, but its really good.It actually is pretty memory intensive, so if you may have a crash if your on an AMD card, exiting and returning often clears this up, also if you run in Big Picture mode it runs smoother.A really good Zombie game, with a need to balance resources and people. Bad thing is zombies spawn way to quick, you can clear a street and walk in a house and a zombie is looking in the window back at you. The real kicker is the missions come fast. You have to figure out what is important to you. They time out after a while to, and whatever happens happens, and you have to deal with it.  You can take a little while to decide, but again, they do expire.Overall a good fun to play Zombie setting, with some good replay ability, you will always start at the same place, but you can choose differnt things after the starting round and find differnt people and things to get into.EDIT: Also recommend Breakdown, the DLC. It adds long time playability to the game. Gives you the chance to unlock and play heroes and changing difficulties. As far as Lifeline, its OK. A good time to play once, but it didnt hold my interest beyond that.			"

												I saw high reviews for this game for how deep the situations you find yourself in can get and got suckered in.  The ideas are good but the execution is abysmal.  Potentially heavy moments are ruined by clunky programming that suck you right out of the moment.  When one of the survivors who have been with you from the beginning start to get sick and you have to take them to an isolated area to euthanize them, the stage is set for a gaming moment you'll remember for years.However, when you shoot that person, loot their corpse, and radio back home that you're bringing loot (really, that's the part you want to announce to your group?) and the reponse is, ""Get anything good?""  the moment is so ruined it's hard to forgive the game, particularly when this is how every moment in the game goes.  Nothing has any weight.  Do a Google search for a Would You Rather game because it's essentially the same thing.Tell someone in your current group that you looted her father's corpse, led her to believe her father might still be alive, and used the group's resources in the meantime.  Uh oh, she found out?  Time for a big conversation....or she'll just say she thought something might be wrong with her father, thank you calmly, and walk away.It's baffling to me that the creators of the game went through the trouble of setting up some interesting moments in the game and decided on zero follow through.  The combat is very much a stiff and awkward button-basher and the RPG elements play a minor role.   Every mission and every action feels weightless.  I'm leaving the game unfinished because there's just no substance here and I am truly disappointed in that.			"

												In the genre of Zombies/Zombie survival, there are a lot of duds. Games that don't really live up to the genre's hype. Infestation: Survivor Stories, Dead Island, several others. This indie title does what no game has really done, made a great game out of the genre. Made an amazing game out of the genre, in my opinion.In this game, you start out as some random guy in the beginnings of a zombie apocolypse. You find a group of people, then it turns into more of a survival management game. You have to deal with problems in your group, such as anger issues and fear, you have to befriend and keep the morale of your fellow comrades up. And, of course fight zombies. Now while the combat in this game isn't amazing, its actually really fun. Its simplistic, it doesn't try to over complicate things. You wanna smash a zombies head in, right? Of course you do, and you can do that easily. With a gun or with a blunt weapon. I enjoy the combat, but it is still in my opinion the weak point of the game. Managing your community, building new training facilities, sleeping areas and medical stations, and recruiting other survivors are a large part of the fun in this game. Its so satisfying to run through a zombie hoard and save a group of people, then have them befriend you so you can switch to them.I really enjoy that you can't just use the same character forever. They will get injured, sick, and tired. Eventually you'll need to switch to other characters. That's why it is important to do things like anger management missions and afraid missions, to befriend people in your group so you may switch to them.The visuals are fairly impressive, but nothing amazing. It runs perfectly fine on my GTX 660 with everything turned up. it definitely looks better than the xbox version, but it will not visually wow you in any way. Although the zombie design is quite impressive. My one bugbear with this game is the ammount of stuff it throws at you at once, then puts it on a time limit. I can understand why you need to do things quickly, but when i still need to gather food and medicine for my group, and then I recieve 5 other messages about missions I need to complete quickly, it can get frustraiting. Really frustrating, especially when it makes me lose influence with my tribe. I think they should either cut back on the ammount of missions you get at once, or eliminate the timer. The former sounds better in my opinion. Reguardless, this game is amazing. And even when it isn't discounted, its only 20 bucks. So incredibly cheep for a game this fun. This game has raised the bar in the Zombie genre.			"

												See my full review with screenshots at http://misstoxia.com/review-state-of-decay/State of Decay brings a new style of gameplay to the zombie game scene, incorporating third person action, RPG and community/resource management into a nice open-world zombie survival game.In the game, you control a single character at a time and can switch to others when you become friends with them. Each character has their own inventory and stats and traits that may help your community. For example, some survivors might of been a vet or doctor before the outbreak and can use the communities medical supplies more efficiently.Your community is a collection of survivors who have banded together and found a defendable home to live in, you can upgrade your home base using resources you scavenge in the world and find new survivors to recruit into your community as well as help other established communities and organize resource trades with them.The game is entirely single player but the developers have tried to give the game a more dynamic feel by making events happen in your game while you’re not playing it. I’m not too sure how I feel about this, it does make things more interesting but I don’t like having that lack of control in a single player game.Lily, your communities’ radio girl, will advise you about current events and distress signals that are happening in the world. These may include; nearby hordes that need to be wiped out, a survivor in trouble, a community member that needs help with a task, a sighting of an infestation that needs to be dealt with or even a friend at home base that needs help with their depression or anger issues.While not completing tasks and story missions you will usually find yourself exploring and looking for resources to take back home. Food tends to disappear the quickest, especially when you have a large home population, so building a garden at home or finding a reliable source of food and building an outpost there is a must.Characters can also specialize in certain fields such as blunt weapons, edged weapons or rifles, etc. Some characters will naturally be better at certain weapons or abilities depending on their traits… the main character I used was an alcoholic and she could not increase her ‘Wits’ stats at all because of that.Cars are also a big part of the game, after a while of gameplay you will notice that you eventually run out of cars if you don’t start returning them to your home base after you use them. Vehicles can be an amazing zombie killing tool but can get damaged easily after running down a few hordes, so it’s always good to build a proper workshop at home and have a mechanic to repair the good cars you find.When your community gets too large you will tend to have more problems with survivors not getting along with each other and various mental problems some survivors are having, offenders can be evicted if you don’t feel like having to deal with them and sick or dying people can even be mercy killed before they turn. Finding a bigger and better home is always something that should be on the smart survivalist’s mind when exploring.The currency of the game is influence and can be spent at community homes to buy items out of their supply locker as well as support while outside of home such as artillery strikes and car delivery. A community with well built facilities will tend to produce more items in their supply locker each day.When your character dies, you will have to play another character back at home whom you have made friends with – if you have no other player characters you respawn as a new recruit to the community with a few starting items.My biggest issue with the game would have to be the graphics. It’s not the overall quality that annoys me, but in certain locations with certain lightning I find it very hard to see which was really off-putting for me. I also had quite a few bugs that made my game’s story behave very weird, luckily I was still able to finish it.The game also has a DLC called ‘Breakdown’ which adds a never-ending gamemode that allows the player a bit more freedom than in the original game, however it should be played after you have finished the main story.I enjoyed the originality of State of Decay, I felt like I really got attached to the characters I found in the game as well as my own which is rare for a sandbox-type game and I enjoyed being able to play with a community/home management system while also getting to play in an immersive third person action RPG. Unfortunately the graphics were bad enough to make me feel ill at times.			"

												It's actually differed from the ""other"" zombie games. That is , because there's a character progression. You character evolves, will level his fighting if you fight alot of zombies or other traits... Also, there's a community which is actually where the whole game is based.For example, when you're searching for supplies in a house , you can choose to radio home for them back at camp to come there and take the items you selected IF you don't have room for more into your inventory. Also, When you find survivors and save them , they join your camp and grow stronger as a defense to the zombie apocalypse. In the beggining of the game , you're given a piece of wood and your kicking as your sole defense. Although it's enough for you to not die. You can choose to go out with 1 other person to help you.The noise mechanics are adequate. I would not expect anything less-more since it's good. Using cars is not safe because if you rev high, the zombies ( Zeds as they are called in SoD ) will hear it and come after you.Cars have a storage. You can store up to 5 or 6 items into it's trunk which is really useful.Also, you can hit zeds with your door.There can be different types of zeds except your normal-like zombies. Bleeehhh . ( zombie growl? )There are 2 dlc's for this game. HAve NOT bought them yet. The only major error i find is the color of the game. What i mean , is that the saturation is wrong. I dont know if its me , but... it either looks bright and strange or dark and shadow-y . It can be overlooked . "

												Certainly a game wprth buying, especially if you see it for a reduced price. ""State of Decay"" is one of the rare gems out there which seems to be made by intelligent, thinking gaming enthusiasts for gamers. It's not one of those highly polished productions you play but quickly forget afterwards, but one of the games which will keep you smiling because you just found another great detail you've been longing to see because it simply made sense to put it into such a game.Sate of Decay doesn't bore you with dumb ""game mechanics"", applied because some marketing director wanted it so. No, it delivers you an open world designed with sticking to common sense. Furthermore, the designers weren't shy to incorporate features known from gaming classics like Jagged Alliance i.e.: Every survivor you find will have some unique character traits, which will make her or him someone worth liking - or loathing. You'll quickly single out your favorite protagonists, screaming in dismay when you are ambushed by a juggernaut zombie while you are trying to run the heavy backpack home. Another detail which reminded me of Jagged Alliance is the myriad of different weapons and ammunitions you'll find. From a trusty .375 revolver to a AKMS submachine gun - you'll enjoy outfitting your favorite guy with the best gun available.The story focuses on the way people are trying to deal with the situation - including a powermongering, aims-justify-the-needs judge going slowly rogue. With people somewhere between despertion and hope the story makes the whole setting way more believable than you'd expect. It allows you to blend in, to feel the immersion a good game has to create to make it on my list of games...worth playing! The few cons I experienced are mainly of cosmetic value:The controls are a bit difficult to get into and the lack of a real manual is leaving you to guesswork. Especially moving your home confused me: Yes, you need to do a few story missions before you are allowed to move it. Good to know, better if the game would have explained it further on.At some point of the game you are spammed by a multitude of very, very similar missions: Rescue a survivor, kill a special zombie, clean out an infestation, etc. It can be annoying, but only because you are feverish about accomplishing the next ""home improvement"" and thus having no time to rescue the next jaywalking zombie apocalypse survivor.A few minor bugs are still in the game: Zombie getting stuck in porches, zombies banging their head against thin air, instead of the wall behind them, survivors running against an obstacle instead of going around. Luckily all these are not frequent and  / or easily solvable by giving  a gentle push.			"

												This game is a mix between many good things and many bad things. I like this game and the thing that it tries to achieve but so many bugs and unpolished things has mad me rage quit the game 2 times. I forget about how I feel and reinstall it. Pro:Solid zombie survival with ""Realistic"" needs bars.Cons:Flipped over cars despawn if you move 50-60 yards away from itAfter interacting with a container and exiting a menu you have to repress a movement button, so if you see a zombie out of the corner of your eye, you'll most likely be grabbed. The girl on the radio will remind you to do the timed objectives every time you aren't in combat, even if you are doing something like bringing very needed supplies to the settlement. 4/10			"

												State Of Decay is a superb, but sometimes buggy, game. You have to rescue survivors and provide them with food, gas, ammo and other stuff while finding new resources and completing (side)quests like killing hordes and special zombie enemies, and helping (fellow) survivors out, all in a big open world that allows you to go anywhere you'd like.The graphics are pretty, but it's all a bit dark so I think most of you will have to crank up the contrast in order to be able to see anything. A minor complaint that also conveniently hides some of the uglier graphics. The sounds get the job done, it's all bit minimal if you ask me, and the voice acting has plenty of variety and is all told in a convincing manner.Unfortunately I wasn't able to progress through the story because of a game breaking bug that stopped me from getting new story missions later on. I'm still waiting for a patch for this, because I desperately want to complete this game.And even with this bug still in the game I would still highly recommend it.[Rating: 86/100]			"

												State of Decay is an odd little game.Stnading alone in the wilderness, walking through the wheat fields towards your objective, moving towards a goal.And then you smack a horde of zombies with a shovel for five minutes because shovel noises are funny.This game has a lot going for it, a large diverse map, varied objectives, and fun ways to get around, from hiding on buildings and sniping, to ramming a sports car through a horde while playing La Cucaracha.But, it throws a few too many things at you, asking you to consistantly help your allies, who you keep in base, because every time they go out, their dumb ♥♥♥ gets stuck in a closet by a group of zombies because they walk around with tin cans strapped to their ankles. And the repeitive nature of the combat, with is mostly runny over and smashy the zimbie zambies, doesn't have much flow to it. You come, you smack, you get retard A, you walk away.In all honesty, this game could be great, but its dragged down by a combat engine thats just not that fun after 2 hours, and a grouping of AI who lick windows on a professional level.If you like to manage dumb ants, I recommend, if you prefer to enjoy your time running over zombies in peace without HEY FRANK GO GET THAT LADY OUT OF THE PHONE BOOTH every 10 minutes, you should look elsewhere.

												Apparently there's a $30 DLC for the game where all it does is increase the internal resolution of the game to 1080p?  You know, Dark Souls 2 did this and I guess these devs thought they could, too, except without putting any additional effort into remixing content, giving any discounts to owners of the original, or really any technical changes whatsoever.At least that's how it started.  By this point there have been some significant updates and patches to the new YOSE version.  Users that supported the original title and its continued development by purchasing DLC were apparently shafted, when the devs not only DIDN'T use that money for anything to fix the game, but they dumped it all into some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Free-to-Play puzzle game that has, by now, been completely shut down and failed as well as a graphical overhaul for an older game without any justification for purchase to those that have already completed the original.So now what?  What's next for Undead Labs, with their last two releases performing so miserably?  Their dev blog has been completely unrelated to game development for the past 9 months.  Probably nothing worth caring about, much like this game, which you can no longer buy and the DLC costs as much as the new game when it's on sale and doesn't support the game at all.  Who, in their right mind, could recommend a title you can even purchase?But let's extend this review to the company itself.  It has a track record of one really successful title that isn't sold anymore, an incredibly unsuccessful re-release of that same game, and a dead game.  What this only leads players to expect is either a game that isn't fun that they can't even play after some number of months or an actually good game that gets completely re-sold like a new product some time later with actual dev support behind it only the second time around.  Undead Labs is unreliable, skeevy, and unethical at best.  Watch from afar but don't touch.			"

												Great atmosphere but akward controls for me.  Getting better with floating camera while driving.The lack of save game points adds to the realism and gravity of the game, but makes it painful to play when survivors do stupid things.   If you only have a few hours a week to play, and make one mistake (always carry 3 melee weapons) I find the lack of save game points really ruins the game for me.

												This game is good but I dislike the model they used to pay for it. It really feels like they broke the end of the game and the missions off the game and are selling it as ""DLC."" The end is extremly abrupt, and the DLC came out a couple weeks after the game did. Seems like a cheesy way to get an extra 7 bucks. That said, its a good zombie game. I like the home base mechanic, it makes it feel like you have somewhat of a safe zone without ever being truly safe. I agree with some of the other posters that the cars make things far to easy. It would be nice if the cars or other loud noises put the zombies into a sort of 'frezy' mode, where they did more damage or something. Despite the warning not to use cars, I usually drove everywhere in one, because it was not only the fastest way but also the eaisiest way. The story is decent but nothing really new, but then you wouldn't be looking at a zombie game if you really wanted 'new"" now would you?			"

												Fantastic game for those looking for that certain zombie game style most other studios seem to just not quite get.  Obviously, it has its issues.  Between the many graphical glitches, zombies attacking through walls, and vehicle...usage in any capacity...it still manages to produce an overall fun experience.  Perma-death is not really a major concern and the difficulty seems to be a bit random at times (especially in the last few missions).  Also, the open world seems waaayyy too vast and empty.  But all that aside, at the end of the day, it was quite enjoyable and forced me to continue playing till the end (thanks to continuing resource consumption while not playing).			"

												It's a gem. Still a bit rough, covered in (some) dirt and might need some extra cutting and polishing but it is a gem nevertheless. It's not awesomely perfect on the technical side (could have used a little more effort on the controls/interface for the PC version, for instance) but Undead Labs delivered the almost-nearly-perfect Zombie Apocalypse experience you can have within a game world today. This is the zombie game I always wanted to play and to enjoy for countless hours. They tried to add everything the ""zombie genre"" has, cramming it all inside a gaming experience and they succeeded in that. In this game you have everything you want your zombie survival game to have: a persistent and open world (that keeps on going even when your computer is turned off!), facilities to build and manage, resources to gather, trust to gain, pep talks, scavenging, gossip, pills, vehicles to drive (and to break down to pieces), people to care for (or to abandon to their fate if you don't trust/like them or if you are that kind of survivor), a lot of zombie head-bashing, a wide array of melee and ranged weapons, skills to improve (including useless and funny ones!), tons (and I mean TONS) of inside jokes, easter eggs and homages to the genre (The Kirkman Residence? McDermott's Tavern?), and a (virtually) never ending experience if you play with the Breakdown DLC (in that case, you skip the main storyline but you go on as long as you have at least one character alive). Co-op is missing. Co-op would have been great but, even as a solo game, State of Decay is a lot of fun, which is reason enough to play it, but you also start to enjoy it a bit more and more as you discover all the little details that are revealed only with an extensive playthrough. You need food, sleep, meds, gas, ammo (and not just generic ammo, but the right ammo type for your gun) and you need to find a good place to call home. A defendable one. To be on the (relative) safe side you will also need at least a doctor or someone trained in medicine, tool experts, carpenters and someone who can cook a good meal once in a while! A workshop where to build homemade sound suppressors for your guns or molotov cocktails is a must! Keep an eye on the morale of your community too. Don't let them fall to their fears and always resolve their anger issues (shouting matches lower community's happyness!). You start with one character only (well, two, in the main storyline) but you can swap to other survivors as you bring them to your community and only if you earn their trust. Bear in mind: dead is dead. If your character dies, it's gone, no matter how much time you invested in him/her. No matter if he/she was the ""hero"". And they can die in a lot of ways, even when you are not controlling them. They can go missing on a supply run (but you are given a chance to go look for them), get sick or be eaten alive while you ask them to watch your back. And when you run out of characters... well... new game, I guess! If you love zombies and everything about zombie survival and that it's the end of the world feeling, this is the game for you.			"

												I don't know how to describe the AMAZING quality of this game. This is ALL i have EVER wanted in a zombie game. It kinda reminds me of fallout. Anyway, the reasons i love it is:1. Free roam.2. Huge map.3. Has missions which you can do but are not obligatory.4. I love the fact that alongside the missions, you also need to find and recruit survivors, go scavenging to survive and also just generally look after your community and main base.5. I love the fact that you can set up outposts as well as a main base,6. The NPC survivors that you play alongside with are not stupid. they will go out on missions and scavenge on their own without you doing ANYTHING. Some will fall sick and die. And a lot usually get injured or merely tired. I also like that you can switch survivors to give the other ones a rest. All the survivors also have different abilities.7. It has cars. So it's basically just GTA with zombies in it.8. It's not JUST zombies you are fighting. The army also comes in, sets up outposts, and kills anything that gets in their way, wether it is a survivor or a zombie, they kill it.9. I love the building feature. You can select empty spots in your home base and build different facilities ike guard towers, medical facilities, fighting arenas and even farms. Of course to do this you need to find building resources so again, you need to scavenge a lot.10. The NPCs are really stong. If you're are going out on a missions, you can ask a couple of people to come and help you out. A group of 4 survivors could easily take around 200-300 zombies.11. And there is SO many more features taht are awesome that it would take ages to write them down.Anyway, if you have 20$ and like zombie games, this is the absolute BEST place to spend those 20$ and I guarrantee you will not regret it.

												This is not a bad game. It is a pretty fun game. But nor is it a good game. It starts out in a camping resort of some sort. The starting area is of course very easy and helps you out to get the hand on the controls and mechanics. It is much more of a survival zombie game than for example Left 4 Dead or all those other FPS zombie games. It is not as hardcore as DayZ although. But I still liked it and I just finished it after restarting. From my understanding it is a smaller studio backed by Microsoft behind it and I say they made a good job. I did not notice many bugs or glitches. Graphics are decent and controls not bad -IF- you have a controller. It is also nice that you can avoid zombies and try sneaking (Which I didn't do much). As said the focus is more on survival and gathering resources and survivors for your home base instead of wildly shooting cause that will have you dead if you are ill prepared. And a dead character stays dead. The characters you gather all have diffrent traits and ""personalities"". Which is interesting at  first but later on proves to be shallow. Non the less the more you gather the more room you need, the more food you need and so on.  Sadly the game do become a bit of a rince and repeat after a while when every mission is ""Oh no we seen a special zombie out here"" ""Create noise to make the zombies do this while I plunder"" or ""Oh no scavengers in need of help"". Also we got the ""Sadness, anger, fear"" traits where you just tell your friends that you and him/her are going to smack some zombies the old fashion way. This is one of the more annoying missions since they just about killing zombies and put you at risk just to appease some of the idiots in your crew. There is also missions to save or help other survivor groups. These could be so much more if they deepended the social mechanics and maybe added in more of an RPG mindset to the game. The map is pretty damn big too and I did not scavenge much outside of any of the  three settlements. The country side is not that appealing since it is mostly wastes of land you drive through to g et to your next objective. But this adds to the atmosphere since it is supposed to be a small county with a large farming community. This is a clusterf*** of a review but I still think the strong parts is the survival part, the less focus on action. The tiny bit of social interaction and dialogue (even if the voice actors where like 3-4? Least it beats the 2  guys making the voices for Skyrim! Hue hue) The atmosphere can be great at times and some vistas are nice.BUT. The game is bit to much of a repeat, there could been more interaction with your group and the others. The Wilkerson have some interesting missions but not much more than them being a bit of the Merle of State of Decay and then nothing happens. The game also would be much much much better with co-op or multiplayer where each player runs their own group. The special zombies are also kinda a pain the ♥♥♥. This must be some kind of thing from L4D. To end it, yes I do recommend it if you want a open world zombie survivor game and zombie movie lovers will see many references. Also! ♥♥♥♥ you Ed for being such a cry baby. God damnit.			"

												Fans of the Zombie Apocalypse genre should not pass this one up.  It is a good game despite its flaws.To me, this game feels like what Dead Island should have been.  Things like having actual resource needs for your group and the ability to build and upgrade structures in your home base really help the game stand out from your generic zombie slaying fair.  Also the fact that events can happen while you are not playing, while it can be annoying, makes for a fairly unique game.I also really like the fact that you can be overwhelmed by zombies if you are by yourself and you aren't careful.  You can't just run out in the street and start mowing down zombies with an unsurpressed assault rifle.  For one, you'll quickly deplete your ammo supply.  And the other reason is because all the noise will draw out all the zombies in the surrounding area and you'll likely be overrun.  It really helps to add some tension when you are a long ways from home on a supply run and you're low on health and don't have a ride nearby.Unfortunately, the game is not perfect, and there are a few particular areas I feel the game is lacking.  The first of which to me is the camera.  The views for when you are executing zombies can sometimes make it impossible to see whats happening.  Also, the fact that you are encouraged to use foliage to hide from zombies, but the bushes/trees don't dim and go transparent when close to the screen makes for more times when you can't see anything.Another feature I think this game could sorely use is some sort of weapon modding feature.  Coming off of playing Payday 2 with its amazing amount of weapon mods available, this game has none other than applying one of a few types of suppressor to guns.  It would be awesome if you found a weapon expert survivor and you could then mod your stocks, optics, foregrips and such but, alas, its not possible.And finally, perhaps the biggest ommission that could have really made this game a gem is its lack of a multiplayer mode.  While you can ask other survivors to accompany you and help out, you can't get them to pick up supplies or give them any orders when they are with you.  They also have a tendancy to follow you right up your butt and then block doorways behind you.  The AI just isn't a good substitute for a few good buddies.Still, despite lacking in some areas, this game is a fun single-player experience.  To me, it did a decent job of capturing the spirit of zombie apocalypse survival.  I'm hoping the game has a sequel with a bit more polish to put it into GOTY territory.			"

												This game preface, idea, and game play is all cool. What can be uncool though is when you lose a character and you've invested so much time in them, you begin wondering how to turn off the auto save. Just a heads up before I start I couldn't believe when I was playing that this game isn't multiplayer - and that the idea of working with other people (or friends) would be awesome. I repeat : THIS GAME IS NOT MULTIPLAYER. Does that mean don't play it? Depends...The story goes you are a man who stumbled into town and upon exploring you find a church full of survivors. A bit later into the story, you hear the military has also set up an outpost in the town but on the other side. You go see them, and you find out that they really couldn't care less, and that they recommend you leave immediately. The gameplay itself is pretty good - consisting of a 3rd person view and being capable to control more than 1 character... but you can only control one at a time. You can tell other characters to follow you and assist you or you can tell them to come search a location that you've cleared. There are times though where you are faced against this giant zombie boss and all you have is two bullets and a broken machete hoping to take this guy out (so FYI if you hate a bit of grinding in games you may dislike this). The repairing can become a nuisance, but building repair shops or first aid centers (of a few things that you can do) add a bit of depth to the game and really make it feel like it's yours. Another cool feature is when you clear out zombies you are able to set up another ""home-base"". Cars, weapons, items and so forth are found while you free-roam the map. Look-out points can be discovered and climbed which makes identifying what's in the surrounding environment a little easier.I like this game, I would like it even more if it had multiplayer. I enjoy playing it but some would put it as a time killer. Either way though if your looking for an open world zombie game this may be for you. RATING : 7.25/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B Replay-ability C Overall  B-EDIT : Just beat the game... once it's beat it's sort of bland. Yes there's DLC but if your like me and do not like DLC this game is a good 14-15 hour run. There's also those who like to run around in an open world and just shoot zombies. If you like that then go nuts. I found the game to be worth the purchase on sale, sort of found it short.			"

												The very first zombie free roam survival game. Every car you take and break wont ever spawn again. Food and items you loot from places wont ever spawn in the same building again. This is how you make a true survival game. Zombies can whoop your butt depending if you know how to handle a group. Get to control your base and say yes or no to people that want to join your group. Only thing you have to watchout for is if you dont talk to the your group members they will dislike you or become depressedTHIS IS A MUST HAVE GAME!!			"

												State of Decay is one of the most realistic zombie games I've played, the game itself is a Sand box, role, third person. It is that you are a survivor and you have to find a ""community"" where fit, difficulty itself is already hard but that's what makes it so desirable, seeking supplies (materials, food, medicine, gasoline), but lacks this cooperative touch. In my opinion if you want to know how serious a zombie apocalypse (as it is also considered as a simulator) and want a game that will charge you many hours (which are well worth) I would buy this game.State of Decay es uno de los juegos de zombies más realistas que he visto, en si el juego es un Sand box, rol, tercera persona. Se trata de que eres un sobreviviente y tienes que encontrar una ""comunidad"" donde encajar, la dificultad en si ya es difícil pero es lo que lo hace tan deseable, el encontrar suministros (materiales, comida, medicinas, gasolina), pero le falta ese toque cooperativo. en mi opinión si quieren saber como seria un apocalipsis zombie (ya que también se consideraría como simulador) y quieren un juego que les cobrara varias horas (que valen la pena) yo compraría este juego.

												This is probably the best game I have ever played. It's a mix of GTA, action rpg and house building/management. Feels like your in 'The walking Dead'. Micro management, Permanent character deaths (important because you can switch to these people) permanent vehicle loss. You have to maintain everything. Little missions constantly pop up to distract you from the main incentive (pursuing these can save playable characters lives)Setting up a camp- deciding what buildings to develop (med, ammo, sniper nests etc)Talking to people that are depressed/have issues helps more than you realiseIf you send someone on a mission to collect resources they will physically go across the map and attempt to collect and return. You must kit them out well if you dont want them to die. If they die, any resources they collected will drop at the place of death.Few details like this make this game special.LOADS of weapons/ammo types/items. Shooting is perfect, the lighting is beautiful. Its a reminder of why we play games and where the medium is going.There's still a few bugs with the zeds. sometimes it can go through the walls and able to dmg the characters throught itThe start of this game does not do it justice.

What can be uncool though is when you lose a character and you've invested so much time in them, you begin wondering how to turn off the auto save. Just a heads up before I start I couldn't believe when I was playing that this game isn't multiplayer - and that the idea of working with other people (or friends) would be awesome. I repeat : THIS GAME IS NOT MULTIPLAYER. Does that mean don't play it? Depends...The story goes you are a man who stumbled into town and upon exploring you find a church full of survivors. A bit later into the story, you hear the military has also set up an outpost in the town but on the other side. You go see them, and you find out that they really couldn't care less, and that they recommend you leave immediately. The gameplay itself is pretty good - consisting of a 3rd person view and being capable to control more than 1 character... but you can only control one at a time. You can tell other characters to follow you and assist you or you can tell them to come search a location that you've cleared. There are times though where you are faced against this giant zombie boss and all you have is two bullets and a broken machete hoping to take this guy out (so FYI if you hate a bit of grinding in games you may dislike this). The repairing can become a nuisance, but building repair shops or first aid centers (of a few things that you can do) add a bit of depth to the game and really make it feel like it's yours. Another cool feature is when you clear out zombies you are able to set up another ""home-base"". Cars, weapons, items and so forth are found while you free-roam the map. Look-out points can be discovered and climbed which makes identifying what's in the surrounding environment a little easier.I like this game, I would like it even more if it had multiplayer. I enjoy playing it but some would put it as a time killer. Either way though if your looking for an open world zombie game this may be for you. RATING : 7.25/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B Replay-ability C Overall  B-EDIT : Just beat the game... once it's beat it's sort of bland. Yes there's DLC but if your like me and do not like DLC this game is a good 14-15 hour run. There's also those who like to run around in an open world and just shoot zombies. If you like that then go nuts. I found the game to be worth the purchase on sale, sort of found it short.			"

												This is possibly the best zombie game I have ever played!I know I know... Walking Dead from Telltale studios has great story, Killing Floor is fun zombie smashing, survival, co-op game, Left 4 Dead gives you the opportunity to challange your strategies against other players in versus games. Dead Island is fun co-op storyline game with skill tree and weapons crafting. etc... But this one ... It's such a shame it is not a co-op game. It's everything you ever wanted in a game that puts you inside of zombie apocalypse (maybe not everything, didn't find out yet if you also fight other survivors, but I wouldn't miss that anyway). Things you gonna do in this game:Gather supplies, fortify (upgrade) your safehouse, help other survivors, kill special zombies, train your survivors community, make the areas safe (by killing zombies), drive cars (kill zombie hordes with cars), play more than one character (get eaten by zombies)...Despite the lil bit oldish graphics and the absence of co-op mode I recommend State Of Decay for every zombie games fan out there. ps. the absence of co-op is the main thing that upsets me about this game, 2 or 4 players co-op would put this game on the TOP of zombie games charts.  score: 8/10edit: if you have any questions about this game, feel free to ask in the comments below			"

												Above average to good game. Reasonable mechanics, but gets repetitive. Textures are pretty pathetic by PC standards; probably because the developers were too busy licking the boots of Micro$oft and kept things the same as (lame ♥♥♥) X-Box.Sad lack of competitors in the genre makes it slightly more acceptable than it should be.DLCs are a rip-off. Breakdown is what SHOULD have been in the original gam. Lifeline is simply crap and boring.			"

												State of Decay makes a lot of fun, it reminds me of The Walking Dead series with a touch of Dayz. but dont expect a creepy horror game and I think that it should not be.

												I was a little put off that this game is 3rd person and the screen shots but I quickly found it to be an absolute joy.  Between scouting for resources, building your home (base) and helping / recruiting other survivors it is a zombie genre fans dream.   My only issue with it is that the main story is short but it can be replayed numerous times as it changes each game.  Breakdown isn't worth the price tag, although it is a good add-on to just have a pure sandbox mode.			"

												State of Decay is a open world survival game that will please fans of the genre with its own unique ideas and a focus on character permadeath.   --------Final Thoughts at the bottom--------GameplayThe gameplay is all about survival, it really makes you feel like you want to live. This is mainly due to the fact that if the character you are playing at the time is somehow killed, then they are dead for the rest of the game. Their is no way to bring them back to life, this makes you think twice about just trying to hack your way through hordes of zombies. Throughout the game their are moments, such as events or story missions that will pop up, about other survivors in trouble, completing these missions brings more survivors to your base. The higher your populations the more well defended you are and the more characters you have to switch out with to play. Each survivor has its owns traits and sets of skills. These skill levels can be raised by performing the activity related to the skill. For example your shooting goes up the more you use weapons, or stamina will increase the more you use the character to run around and loot with that character. However the more survivors you have at your base, the more supplies you will need to take care of them all. This means you need to go out and collect more loot.You collect resources such as medical, building and weapon supplies, by entering abondoned buildings and searching for cuboards, draws, boxes etc.. that are highlighted white. When a supply stash is found you put it into a dufflebag and take it back to base. This however limits how much you can take at a time, if you have a vehicle you can store duffle bags in the back but if you are without a vehicle you may also radio back to base and have another runner come out to get the rest. However doing this will put that runner at risk of attack by zombies and if they run into trouble you may need to go out to save them. You may also loot various other things in buildings such as weapons, medical supplies, and food. Different weapons have different strengths and weaknesses. The weight of some weapons will also effect how some characters can swing them depending on thier strength. The controls feel very well done and accurate, whether its swinging a weapon, shooting a gun or driving a vehicle, it all feels smooth. GraphicsThe graphics are nice, I wouldn't say they are amazing or anything, although their are some breathtaking areas within the game world. The zombies look well done and their are a decent amount of models that are used so it doesnt feel like your killing the same thing over and over, however their is only one model for each special infected. The animation is good and feels lively. Although sometimes I did feel like, for how fast my character was running I wasnt going very far distance wise. The swinging and shooting looks good and my framerate never dropped even while fighting multipul zombies and Im only on a medium spec PC.AudioThe sound in the game is good. When out in the woods you can hear the birds and crickets around you. When in town the lumbering steps of zombies can be heard all around you. The foot steps sound realistic for the type of platform your character is on at the time. Guns sound good and hitting zombies with melee weapons sounds satisfying.The voice over work is good, nothing fabulous or game changing, but its good. Their are multipul different characters taht are all voiced however some of them sound like they were voiced by the same person and didnt even try to sound different.StoryThier is not much to say story wise. There is a story that will eventually lead you out of the city and end the game. However the story plot is basic and it seems like it was just shoved in their to appease some people who want to complete it, but it is not neccesary. Final thoughtsOverall, State of Decay is a great game that is definetly worth the time for anyone whos a fan of survival or zombie games. It is a large world to explore and loot with many different survivors to save and add to your community. The game has some fresh ideas from other zombie survival games, and these ideas are portrayed very well. The visuals are nice and the animation is good. The permadeath may set some people off from this game, also if you are looking for a story, this may not be the game for you.In my opinion this is one of my favourite PC games and is fully worth the full price, however be aware that their is a remastered HD version coming out soon so you may want to hold onto your money for that one. (EDIT: After the release of the remastered version I would still recommend this version over the newer one. The new one just spruced the visuals up a bit but change very little in terms of gameplay. If you want to save some money, just get this version.)			"

												state of decay is an amazing game and a fresh addition to the zombie genre. this game is comparable to GTA but with zombies in it. the gameplay is very fun and the game can be unforgiving at times since your main characters can die and end up losing all their stats. the story is good however most of the time i just found myself roaming and trying to get supplies for my crew. another unique thing about this game is that it still keeps going afte yous top playing it. so you can stop anytime you want and come back and see youre population has increased or see you're almost running out of supplies.The DLC for this game is pretty good as well however not for everyone. while the main state of decay can be enough if youre looking for a more challenging experience Breakdown DLC is a must have since it takes place in the same map however each playtrhough makes the zombies tougher and the game becomes harder with scarce resources and more frequent zombie encounters.LIfeline DLC is another storyline and it takes place in a different location offering new characters, weapons, and map. again i would recommend this one since its very fun as well as Trumbull Valley was.overall i would definitely recommend this game. 8.5/10			"

												Gotta be one of the funnest zombie survival games! The only thing missing is coop play.Give a feeling of really surviving and making decisions that can cost lives of people in the group. Can kick people from the group as well as allow people to join. Most people I had was 28 but could have easily went higher. managing food and other resources works well without being too much like a chore. if you build outposts around/near homebase and space them out right then you can make a safezone that keeps the home area pretty clear. if you want more of a challenge then move to a urban environment and leave unprotected areas near homebase. Ive had infestations right across the street from home and it made for a lot of activity to always clean or have it spill into he homebase. there are small issues with ai blocking doors sometimes and getting in the way of firebombs and traps but its not a huge deal.when you have looted an area items do not respawn so after a while you have to keep going farther and farther from home to get supplies. so it makes you feel like you really need to move to a different area to make things easier.

												It doesn't bode well when the first thing you see on loading a game is a screen trying to sell you other stuff.I found the controls and interface to be clunky. The third-person perspective was far worse than a first-person one - sometimes I couldn't even see my character because a bush was between him and the camera. They also made continuous inane comments to tell me if a room was empty or not. There are bizarre and overly-complicated systems. The best example of that - normally you might climb to a high point and look around. You don't need to make it more complex than that. But in this game there are special ""high points"" which then circle things all around - even if your character can't see them because the view is blocked by trees. Oh, I came to a locked car. I had a huge piece of wood, but couldn't break the windscreen to get in.I'm sure many could enjoy this, but I felt like the game was pushing me away right from the start. Hope you enjoy it more than I did.			"

												A ambitious survival game unfinished, like a beta version. Has good graphics and a wonderful sandbox mechanics but important glitches too: sometimes crush to desktop and every play one or two keys stop respond, among other programing bugs, as generate corrupted dump files. No solutions, only exit and restart the last saved game. Also, third person camera works really badly in close combat, little places and vehicles: a view in first person would be essential. Has a lot of good concepts but not fine implemented. You can develop structures, but not objects; items non exist out of containers. The inventories are based in slots more than the space and weight. The hand weapons wear out fast and the vehicles are weak and deteriorate quickly by outrages and collisions. There are ways to automatic repairing but are slow because depend on daily cycles.You cannot sleep ingame and act by night has more contras than pros, specially when sometimes foes can pass through walls or doors or appear in the air, all by graphics glitches.The survivors react very slowly against the most amazing zombies ever seen: are fast, strong and resistant. The close combats against a dozen or less are lethal, even if they do not attack at once, just by the loss of endurance. They have a great hearing capacity that restricts use of fire weapons, the sound attracts them quickly, with accuracy and in increasing numbers. They can open doors without breaking them and climb fences. Usually they appear by surprising just at side or behind the player, or only when exits the car. They attack the vehicles fiercely, smashing the bodywork and doors to push the people off. Definitelly are much more than zombies or infected.A downloable content lets to play infinite times with a increasing levels of challenge, but the difficultly soon becomes into exaggerated and game turns repetitive after few levels because always is the same map and way to survive to next level is same. Anyway, when characters reach max skills levels and have a lot of items, there is no motivation to continue, like an arcade game, but this is more complicated, generating a bad sense of frustration and waste of time.And after all, when runs fine proves to be very addictive for the most perseverant fans, but never advisable to normal players by the amount of bugs and defects of finished. A good oportunity lost, maybe by time exigencies and budget problems of an indie study based on crowdfunding. The result, a sum of mixed ideas from several mithical games, sure would have been wonderfull a decade ago, but lacks the technical finish and a adaptation of those concepts to the requeriments of nowdays. A pitty, but a second part will be better, if designers learn of their errors.			"

												This is one of those games that, when you think about it objectively is kinda monotonous but when you're playing it feels compelling and somehow manages to hit your reward centers. The problem is that it has bugs and general shoddiness coming out the ♥♥♥. It's a shame because the thought of a good open world zombie/survival game gives me chubbs.The main reason I recommend you don't buy this game at the moment is that it suffers from a serious but common bug where you stop getting new missions and so cannot progress through the game, you are relegated to just doing random side missions. Apparently this problem has existed since the middle of last year and still hasn't been fixed.			"

												I'm completely done with this game.  It changes the rules on you at random, it perma-kills characters basically out of nowhere, and it does that god-awful thing where if you don't play it for several days, you come back to find the NPCs have used up your stuff off-screen.That aside, the engine is buggy and inconsistant.  Zombies can jump fences that players can't, and only take damage sometimes.  Hit detection is mediocre at best and completely bonkers at worst, explosion radius' don't always take cover into account (which will absolutely punish you sometimes), and the meandering, mindless directions the game keeps trying to pull you relentlessly towards only serve to irritate.All in all, the execution is infuriatingly under-thought.  Never, ever, EVER punish a player right off the bat for not knowing rules that haven't been stated or shown.  Permakilling characters out of nowhere is the worst possible thing you can do, and these guys seem to love doing it repeatedly.There will never be anything that fixes this game.  Drop it, uninstall it, and avoid it forever.			"

												One of the better realistic zombie survival games I have played. Everything is auto saved as you play so if that lone scavenger get ripped apart by zombies, sad day. This game uses the ""guns attract zombies in a 1 mile radius rule"" so you have to get silencers to use guns effectively otherwise you shoot two zombies and four more show up. This game also uses a base system for survivors so you can choose what modules for your base you'll need like beds for people to sleep and/or a medical tent for injuries. My negative experiences are when meleeing something the auto target will expose my back to other zombies who happily latch on and deal a lot of damage and the game won't let up with the missions most of which are time based as a survivor will need help. In addition, this game tracks your out of game time and reduces resources accordingly. Why? Why does this game need to function like ♥♥♥♥ing farmville in this regard? You're telling me unless the survivors have the player as their motivation they just ♥♥♥♥ around waiting to die? Totally unneeded mechanic.			"

												Zombies are NOT why I play State of Decay. The undead trope is wearing thin, but the reason to play this game is found in the group dynamics of the random survivors you encounter. For me, the draw was wondering who I'd meet next, and what skill they'd bring to my camp. In this way, State of Decay manages to foster a real sense of loss when a survivor dies. You'll genuinely miss what they brought to the table as all of their upgraded parish with them. That the combat, stealth and exploration are above serviceable is just extras on top of a great foundation.			"

												Probably one of the best zombie games around, usually they're bland, boring, uninteractive and just the same thing over and over. Not to mention completely and horribly broken with poor voice acting, animations, movement, controls and optimisation (I'm looking at you, Dead Island)This, however, is the opposite. It's not only got a bit of uniqueness to it but it's actually good. Rather than write a wall of text I guess I'll do a list of pros and cons.Pros:- Well optimised- Nice, balanced combat- Not a zombie game that concentrates on firearms, rather a sensible mix of both melee and ranged- Makes the player use their brain, strategy is important in this game, going scavenging without a plan is a death wish- The AI is actually helpful- Pretty nice graphics and sound- RPG-like elements which're good for levelling each of your combat-able survivors at camp for different roles- Always something going on to keep you busy- There's other survivors in the world that you can get friendly with, the friendlier you are the more likely they are to help- No intrusive HUD, leaves the screen wide open for players to see everything they need- 3rd person games aren't usually terrifying, however this is. If you're stuck alone outside at night with hordes surrounding you, you'll be scared to move just in case they hear you. - The survivor you're playing as gets tired as they explore, or they get injured the more fights they get into, it adds realism to the game- Building on the above pro, character switching is seamless and easy.- It's just an awesome gameCons:- Voice acting isn't fantastic, but it isn't as bad as some. You'll hear everything survivors say after a few lines of dialogue before they start repeating themselves. However, this is an indie game and the gameplay more than makes up for it- An unfortunate lack of co-op play, I'm not sure whether or not the devs are looking into it for the 2nd expansion, I hope so because it would be a lot of fun!- It seems as though you're made to play round the clock, as one survivors goes to rest or heal up, you have to play as another and go out to explore. Whilst it does add more gameplay value, I'd prefer to run around in daytime more often- The addon - Breakdown - removes the storyline element from SoD, allowing you to do whatever you want to. You can do that in the base game, just don't complete the last story mission, however it's still worth getting- Sometimes zombies like to get stuck under things, making it impossible to kill them. It's especially irritating when they're an enemy you need to kill for a mission.I'm sure I've forgotten some things, but overall it's an awesome game, it's worth the £15 I paid for it.			"

												If you only have 20 dollars to your name, open this game's store page and willfully become penniless. Take part in a small town's Hell on Earth in from the perspective of a cast of haggard baddasses and wheezing lunatics. Learn how to pickle and can all the gummy worms you can handle. Repair weapons, bases, vehicles, and zombie teeth with a mouthful of monkeywrench. Level up your mind by digging through garbage, level up your body by focusing your chi for a no-holds-barred corpse confetti beatdown, or level up your heart by fleeing from every glow-eyed shambler who dares try to menace you.This game doesn't care if you have other things to do, and it will kill your friends while you're not looking.

												=-=-=-=-=TL;DR=-=-=-=-=• Single Player only, no Co-Op or Multi-player mode, still a great 1-player game• Good gfx, lighting and atmosphere. Spooky when looting houses• Play stealthy or reckless; Smash zombies with Car Doors!!• Addictive: I spent 12 hours with the game on first day of purchase!• Google x360ce if you want to use a controller other than the x360 controller. You'll be glad you did.=-=-=-=-=-=-=So addictive, State of Decay will keep you hooked if you are into stealthy survival, gathering goods, managing a community, zombie combat/survival-horror or just about anything else this game offers.Play with reckless abandon, charing into the fray with your Guns or Melee weapons, to achieve your goals, or stealthily sneak around the walking dead to search houses for food, water, ammo, building materials or other people for a greater chance of survival.My favorite things about this game are the gathering aspects, the building of the base-camp, building a community with NPCs and managing Food, Medicine, Building materials, Ammo and vehicles.My number one favorite thing about this game, in terms of play-mechanics, is quite simply; The awesome option of smashing zombies with your car door as you go careening by (or repeatedly slamming your car door into a zombie who fell over).The biggest and most obvious gripe about this game, is the complete lack of any co-op or multiplayer modes. This game is wonderful as it is, but it would be amazing as an MMO or at least LAN Co-Op. *** This Game is NOT Co-Op or Multiplayer: SIngle Player ONLY. ***Thankfully, the developer, Undead Labs, has another game in the works (currently known as Class 4) based around the ideas of State of Decay. State of Decay can even be viewed as a testing game for their Online version of State of Decay/MMO Survival horror.The graphics, spooky lighting and atmosphere are all in line with a game of this type and are done well. Many times I found myself turning off the flashlight becasue it kept attracting Zombies, so searching through abandoned houses for supplies in the dark (while hearing zombie moans ...somewhere close by) is a pretty creepy feeling and really adds to the suspense of the game.The audio sounds a bit quiet, on my rig anyways. I have to turn my speakers up a bit to hear the game at better sound levels, even with the audio sliders at max in the settings. As long as you don't expect any other sounds from your system while playing this game, it works just fine. If you get a message from a friend on steam (or other service) while creeping around a house being stealthy, with the audio up to hear this game, expect to jump in your seat!Overall, this game is really enjoyable to me. Open world Survival-horror with many RPG-style elements, building of communnities/outposts and NPC interactions just really help this game along. Again, it's not multi-player, but its a damn good game, in my opinion.			"

												All in all,State of Decay is a really nice zombie-survived,sandbox,free-choice,third-person fighting&shooting game existing on the steam market for open selling.Maybe it has some obvious drawbacks,such as lacking multiplayer which can bring players extensive and various ways of fun like what the Day'Z did,only game controller plugged but no keyboard functioned during the very first pre-released period can get you feel annoyed,and not satisfied first-hand game experience cuz this is a transplanted  game originly from Xbox,not PC.BUT,after we rule out these disappointed or unfinished aspects,we would find many shining spots on this unique game which is full of creative and inspiring.First and the most crucial point I wanna talk about is the different characteristics and abilities for each unique person portrayed in the game.Every person appeared shows his differernt and outstanding parts from others,someone's good at combat skills and another's fond of life skills like cooking,etc.This helps them look like fresh creatures wanna stay alive during this unexpected chaos and interact with other people,environment and situation naturally.These's gonna have happiness and sadness,luck and misery,hesitation and resolution among devastated people.I have to admit this setting is awesome.Personally,I think the graphics and sound are good,too.It also contains highly freedom,open map,sandbox.You can consider it as a zombie version of GTA.Meanwhile,the cost for this game is comparably low.You have to spend more the twice money to buy Day'Z.I mean when you have extra money and dont wanna play with other players in zombie types.State of Decay is a good choice for you.

												Unpolished yet enjoyable arpg take on Zafehouse Diaries.  The biggest design flaw is the focus on a storyline/campaign versus a sandbox/roguelike approach.  Yes, there's a sandbox DLC (which quite frankly should have come with the base game) but ultimately the developers would have been better off fleshing out the core mechanics of scavenging, community recruitment, and base building rather than tacking on a campaign.Visually the game is an eyesore with incomprehensible levels of post processing and warped constrast filters -- fortunately there are some handy mods and configuration files out there that make it more presentable.  Overall a great concept with slightly above mediocre execution.			"

												A great entry to the zombie game market. Game doesn't focus on any single one character (As your encouredged to take out diffrent people from your camp via a fatguie system). Game does continue while your not playing, resources are consumed, events might be missed and so on. Though the effect of this decreses as time goes on. So missing a few months, is about the same as not playing for a week or so. Gameplay is alot of search, loot, return, run over a horde of zombies in your pickup truck going backwards. A good deal of fun. Breakdown (DLC) adds some replayability, but not too much new too the overall gameplay.			"

												I enjoy this game quite a bit. Its an open sandbox but its limited by the fact that resources do not respawn. You can Run out of resources but you should be able to beat the game well before that point. Fights can quickly go from your favor to HOLY ♥♥♥♥ A HORD JUST TUNRED THE BLOCK AND SAW ME!! Stealth plays its part quite well. Sure sometimes you wanna run and gun but you will quickly find out that sometimes its better not to fight. The random Events give it a very nice feel but they do not become problems later on. I would give this game a 7.5/10. Nothing higher because could have done more with it the game but what is here is well done. Also more outpost options. I would like to see the ability for outposts to be used as mini-forts not just resource points and Anti Hord landmine zones.			"

A great zombie game to an already familiar genre; possibly tied for 1st place in my favorite zombie games of all time (Left 4 Dead is the other one)!  Unlike L4D, this isn't a first person shooter.  This is an action/survival RPG.  But the best part is the open world concept.  You can go where you please and scavenge the environment for resources to stay alive.  Worth every bit for $20!

Its like a GTA with zombies and over 30+ playable characters all with different skill set. You can build a home base and outpost and upgrade your home base, you can search for other survivors which u can play after u saved them, you can search for supplies and weapons.

												One of the better realistic zombie survival games I have played. Everything is auto saved as you play so if that lone scavenger get ripped apart by zombies, sad day. This game uses the ""guns attract zombies in a 1 mile radius rule"" so you have to get silencers to use guns effectively otherwise you shoot two zombies and four more show up. This game also uses a base system for survivors so you can choose what modules for your base you'll need like beds for people to sleep and/or a medical tent for injuries. My negative experiences are when meleeing something the auto target will expose my back to other zombies who happily latch on and deal a lot of damage and the game won't let up with the missions most of which are time based as a survivor will need help. In addition, this game tracks your out of game time and reduces resources accordingly. Why? Why does this game need to function like ♥♥♥♥ing farmville in this regard? You're telling me unless the survivors have the player as their motivation they just ♥♥♥♥ around waiting to die? Totally unneeded mechanic.			"

												If you're a fan of zombies, exploration, some community management, violence, and survival, State of Decay will scratch a powerful itch. You're always on the edge of death and the one stupid mistake you make will be the one that does you in. It's not a hardcore simulation like Day-Z, nor is it at all multiplayer; nevertheless, the primary game is compellingly open-ended and you will make decisions  that allow some characters a chance to live and guarantee others will die. Sometimes, you'll have to make those decisions when your stamina is all gone, there's no cars to escape in, you're at half health because you haven't rested in days, you have 3 bullets, a damaged baseball bat, and a horde of biters moving to your position. Maybe you pop a morphine and hide in a bush until they pass, but you still have a long way to go to get home. While I am positively bullish on this game, temper your expectations. State of Decay is an indie game ported from XBLA. The controls are not tight, especially for mouse and keyboard. They are a little off-putting at first and you'll require time to adjust. The graphic style is fitting, but the graphic quality itself is not above average for 2013. It runs well enough, but you will not see a perfectly smooth framerate throughout; it'll drop at odd moments. Sometimes you hit a zombie with a finishing move and it'll be in slo-mo, but other times you wonder if the game is stuttering or if you're supposed to be seeing something awesome, but you don't know what it is. However, I predict that none of these presentation deficits will stop you from seeing the vision behind the game and getting immersed in it.This is a game that I would like to see a sequel for in about two years. I have not played the Breakdown DLC which removes the guiding storyline of the primary game and lets you just play the map. Though I look forward to trying it out next Steam sale. The developers had initially planned for the game to go multiplayer, but that effort has been canceled. Although, the developers promised that the sequel will focus on that feature. However, there are a lot of ways I could see the multiplayer game not being as compelling for me since I might lose the power to make decisions for my people. The comparison to Tell Tale's The Walking Dead are unavoidable and as with that game, I see this game gaining little from a full on multiplayer experience. Maybe if they made multiple maps and severely limited the number of players on each one so that each player could recruit their fair share of NPC survivors. Bottom line, if you see the game on sale, you might as well pick it up. State of Decay is all about risks and the ""fun"" you have taking them.			"

												What can I say about this one? Other than it may well be the best zombie-survival I've ever had the pleasure to play. Especially when combined with some improvement mods available at the SoD Nexus. For example the possibility to transport supply-dufflebags in any pickup (thanks to modders adding physics to the said dufflebags), removing the zombies glowing eyes, and to top it off; only walking zombies, and a special infected-remover. Because let's face it... all zombie games with special infected is getting tiresome. What's wrong with a classic zombie experience?At any rate, I've spent a good chunk of hours in it. And the Breakdown DLC only improves with the new sandbox-mode. All in all... should you hesitate. Check out some gameplay in Youtube. I'm more than convinced that I'll be spending countless hours in this game in the coming year (if not years).			"

												Aka ""Grand Theft Zombie"", plays like an interactive The Walking Dead episode. The lacklustre story, graphical & gameplay bugs, lack of first person camera, b-grade animations, sub-par voice acting and poorly constructed pacing are fortunately all outshone by the engaging atmosphere and scavenge-based economy which engage the player in base building and tower defense gameplay, along with character permadeath which elicits a real sense of risk versus reward.- Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link) "

												From the moment I saw the trailer and game footage for the Xbox version I really wanted this game to come to PC, and it did!This game, for me, has everything a good zombie survival game needs, zombies, a story, settlements/camps, a openworld, playable characters who you can train/level up, zombie types that make you want to be carefull, like the feral zombies.From the moment you start the game you get into action, the controls feel good to me and are easy to get used to.So, did this game disapoint? Not at all!I played through this game, loved and I would play through it again, I just wish they would make a sequel to this, since it's so good and I would love to know how my group would survive in the next chapter. However, I shall look forward to other projects from this company.Pro's: open world, nice enviroment, goals/quests, camps, likable characters (marcus, maya)con's: no sequel to the story, no co-op ( I personally don't mind this as much, but I know a lot of people do) "

												  Rarely have I experienced a game that is by turns so engrossing and yet also frustrating as State of Decay.    These designers at Undead Labs undeniably share the vision I've always had for the ideal zombie apocalypse survival RPG.  For all the potential this game offers however, it falls a bit short of perfection due in part to limited optimization for PC, minor design flaws and a hundred little moments that will have you doing /facepalm.  The primary features like base building & upkeep, character progression and the constant need to scavenge while fending off hordes are highly engaging.  The dynamic mission system, the relationship system for playable and NPC survivors and the decent pacing of the story guarantee that you'll always have more to do than time to do it in.  Decisions like 24/7 near-real time progression and permanent character deaths enhance immersion and tension.  Gameplay goes back and forth between pursuit of the main quest line and addressing challenges to your (and others) survival.  Smart choices and hustle are rewarded with a secure base and (relatively speaking) happy community while poor ones are compounded by a variety of repercussions.  Combat is fun once you develop skills enough to unlock handy special abilities and acquire some slightly higher quality weaponry.  State of Decay is a PC port, and in short it feels and looks like what it is.  The combination of features here is awesome but I'm left wanting more depth, quality and variety in them.  They should also do a careful pass of the experience from start to finish for convenience and user interface.  I'd also like to see a more robust story, more unique survivors with their own side quests, a vast improvement of zombie AI/pathing and an effort to balance special zombies a bit more.  In other words, bring all of the people and zombies to life more convincingly.  This game is destined to divide players into:1) A hardcore group who want a higher level of difficulty and realism and,2) A more general group of zombie and RPG fans who get riled up over that first death and the coming to grips with permanent loss of a useful character (who you're emotionally attached to, to boot).  I highly recommend State of Decay to any genre fan.  Temper your expectations reasonably and you will be thrilled with this fun game; I loved it.  I have not yet tried the Breakdown or Lifeline DLC's but reportedly the former provides a satisfying level of difficulty from the getgo and in the end a serious challenge.  Any sequel to this has huge potential and I will be keeping an eye on the future developments by Undead Labs.  Any successor needs a Cooperative mode.  Demands it.TIP: Don't let yourself feel safe or secure, because this game has a nasty way of either suddenly hitting you with a new mechanic or simply bugging out and getting you killed with some form of glitch.TIP: Cultivate more than one survivor so that when your starter gets tired or dies you have solid options to fall back on.TIP: Respect the Juggernaut, he needs his personal space.

												Where do I begin? How do I write an honest positive review for such an imperfect game, that has brought me so many hours of fun?! Well Ill start by saying yes the game is very glitchy, however the devs, while working on sequel continously patch and bugfix this game, and Ill warn you right now like everyone else if you play this you will beg for the co-op this game should have been released with! Wow that was one hell of run on sentence!If you love just killing zombies and hordeing resources buy the DLC (Breakdown) and go nuts, The story in this game is pretty good, You become very atteched to what at first seem to be disposable community members, and when they die they die!. No save and reload kiddies. Graphics mediocre, controls average, But it has a lot to offer in a (hopefully) upcoming sequel WITH co-op. And this is the Devs first title and they are listening and trying to fix this buggy super fun zombie survival adventure game. When it boils down to it we all still play videogames to have fun right?			"

If you are calm running around building searching houses and big buildings in the day light, wait until the night falls then you are gonna get some good heartbeating moments from not trying to get caught.

												Pros: You rarely have a chance to be bored, and the interactions are great.UI is easy enough to use with only a few things I'd fix on it's current functioning.Gets you invested in several characters, leaving room for you to ""lose"" someone, yet still get to play since you -are- anyone you play.The Juggernauts... lets just say you don't get used to them enough to not pee just a bit when they roar near you. Some of the realistic take-downs still make you cringe no matter how long you play (may be a con for some, but it's supposed to keep you cringing, well done here).I enjoyed that the missions weren't all time sensitive, nor were all urgent to your gameplay. But still enough were to keep you on your toes.Vehicles offered to choose from all varied in handling, speed and passenger capacity. Making it necessary for you to find the right vehicle for the right job at times.Large enough map for the time-frame it takes to make this game happen.Cons: I felt there was more that could have been done before ending as quickly as it did, though there wasn't any forced ending really, if you didn't know what was coming, you would just wind up with it ended. I suppose it had to get there some time. State of Decay Breakdown addresses this by giving you a choice as to when you want to boggie out however. UI: needs a search function, or a filter when faced with finding characters in your group to choose from. At 40+ to choose from it's tougher to find who you need relatively quickly.The tutorial could have been a tad more interactive. In-game tuts irritate me, but only if I've seen them already. So in-game tut plus a toggle wouldn't hurt. Though learning hands-on is doable.Game function itself was great. Absolutely nothing mentioned in the ""cons"" was game breaking by any means. Well worth the price for what you get. Def a recommended play if you enjoy the jump-scares and immersive style games.			"

												This game IMHO is way better than TWD Game. I had so much fun killing zombies and ♥♥♥♥, Although at times repetitive... But at times it felt like Grand Theft Auto: Zombieland. I had lots of fun, Cars are easily flipped over with the handbrake, You get rushed a lot and when you're carrying too many things your stamina goes down fast as heck, Which may lead to being taken over by zombies as you attack way slower. Weapons break after a while, Tons of mini-missions although most of them are based on the same thing over and over. Had fun driving the sports cars though! One of the greatest features for me :)! Although I haven't passed the game, I greatly recommend this game based on the time I have played it so far.			"

Game playability and overall enjoyment would have been much higher with a cooperative mode.-Smaller map. Yes I know it was ported over from Xbox, but a larger map maybe with 2 more towns or so would have added a lot more. As of now, I feel like I am stuck wandering the same small little part of the world. JUst from town A to Town B and back.These are the main things that got me.

												This game is a great step in the right direction for Zombie survival, with its fortifications and reasource hunting. Even management of fellow NPC's.  The controls are barely servicable and even with my Xbox controller are not that great ether. You will often find yourself stuck on minor pixels and run into objects you cannot see due to the third person camera. You will also encounter a sluggish camera system so you do not have a responvie feedback when you need to turn to see something.Also the saving system is terrible. In my recent save I left the game with 25 ammo points in my safe-location, I load the save up again and it was set to only 1 point. And saving during the game appears crippled at best, I'm unsure if its from the BS console savepoint system or if its flawed by design to limit you from going through with-out mistakes. Thus encouraging failure. I realize this might be a thing for this game but leaving a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ saving system in place doesn't help the game or anybody. I still recommend this game though its fun as it is, but do not bother pouring much effort into it, just leads to disapointment.			"

												At first: someone told me it IS a MUST HAVE for everys zombie survival fan. Well ... he was right.You have to scavange for weapons, suply and other survivor. Every time you travel is the question: ""loud car or sneaky shoes?"" and every freaking time a zombie horde or one of the deadly special is running to you - the ""f*ck"" moment where you have to choose between fight, run and/or shoot. Really great is: every new game means every item/suply will obviously somewhere else (or with really big luck at the same place) and even the ""tutorial"" place has not the same items at every start.  The Z's are pretty dumb but still clever enough to atack you whenever you won't like it plus there are some really special and great (sometimes totally funny) sayings.The story is really nice and ""SPOILER:"" the ending of the normal story is suprising.

State of decay makes every recource worth more than Gold and makes every supply scarce because there is a limited amount of cars food and ammo which all eventually run out forever which makes this game golden it hits open world survival right on the head.

There is a lot of bugs in this game example: Zombies walking through walls, zombies stuck in the ground, npcs just looking at you like nothing is wrong when they are getting eaten by zombies, npcs getting stuck in place after getting knocked down a bunch of time,etc. I don't know why they decided to make it Singleplayer when it should be Co-Op because, you need to go and explore a huge world, you're gonna need help and the npcs are not always gonna help you, sometimes they will just dissapear when you're getting attacked.5/10			"

												This is the game that defines modern day zombie games, this game has set the standard for other zombie survival games to come. The fact that you get to explore a world with so many options makes the game worth it.The replay value of this game is amazing, trying to get all the bases at least once to see which base is the largest, choosing what kind of things you get in the base and get to choose lots of facilities like Infirmarys and Librarys.Going out to explore the vast world is also awesome, going into a house to get food for your people, or going somewhere to kill a ""special"" zombie to boost morale, it's just amazing.but there are also a lot of things still missing, the new dlc ""Lifeline"" still has a lot of glitches. but those will be worked out. and it's still an awesome game because the glitches aren't gamebreaking, they just kill the mood sometimes.The game feels dark and agressive some times and that makes it even more worth it.i'll give this game a 9/10 for now because of the glitches, but as soon as those are worked out this game will surely be worth a 10/10			"

												After hearing a lot of positive chatter around this game i was quite looking forward for a different take on zombie survial. For me this was a great disappointment.The game was clunky, glitchy and very much the same worn out open world idea that ubisoft ran into the ground.Since most of the feedback already tells you what's nice about it here a couple points you might like to know about to go in with better expectations than i did:- It's your run of the mill open world game. You go places, numbers go up. Don't expect it to be more.- It's really really ugly. I don't care much for graphics but not even ""we're open world"" can brace you for graphics of this. The screenshots look ok, a bit better than the game on max settings, but what really kills it is the abhorent animation quality. - You will die randomly in fights and zombies will teleport and spot you through walls. Just happens. It won't ruin your day but it really can bug you if you think you're save and randomly a zombie walks through a wall.It's a shame as the interface design is quite indeering and reminded me of a couple zombie survial flash games.

For me this was a great disappointment.The game was clunky, glitchy and very much the same worn out open world idea that ubisoft ran into the ground.Since most of the feedback already tells you what's nice about it here a couple points you might like to know about to go in with better expectations than i did:- It's your run of the mill open world game. You go places, numbers go up. Don't expect it to be more.- It's really really ugly. I don't care much for graphics but not even ""we're open world"" can brace you for graphics of this. The screenshots look ok, a bit better than the game on max settings, but what really kills it is the abhorent animation quality. - You will die randomly in fights and zombies will teleport and spot you through walls. Just happens. It won't ruin your day but it really can bug you if you think you're save and randomly a zombie walks through a wall.It's a shame as the interface design is quite indeering and reminded me of a couple zombie survial flash games.

												I've been playing this game for a few days now. I have quite a few zombie games. State of Decay's outstanding quality it has the best aspects of all the other games I played before. Basebuilding, resource management, great graphics, storyline, a map that's bigger than it looks and gobs of hidden loot. The fact the game persists whether you're there or not is quite a twist. I've failed a number of times already and am on my 3rd restart. While that's kind of tedious, particulurly with cut scenes, it proves this game isn't a pushover. You also notice that while the map may be the same the contents are not. Replayability is a plus, especially when you blow it often early on being a clueless clumbsy noob like I at first, one with a tendancy to overturn trucks into riverbeds causing a firey zombie-attracting clusterflub.

												This is the long awaited sequel to the hit game, State of Emergency. Although it veers strongly from the establish plotline of the State of Emergency series, it manages to stay connected, and even throws out oblique references. For example, the main character of the story mode is black. So was one of the main characters in State of Emergency, and they were both similarly named. Many parallels can be drawn to State of Emergency, such as The Law mission. However, this is where the review becomes negative. I was disappointed at how different the game felt and played from the original. The forumla for the first game worked pretty well, and there wasn't much of a reason to change it. This seems to be a total redesign in the wrong direction.Although open-world, there is now a resource-collecting and base-building sidegame, which adds to the confusion. Most of the additions seem tacked-on, and pointless. Zombies, while a welcome addition, provide nothing more than cannon fodder. Although cops served a similar purpose in the first game, in that game their A.I. was more advanced, and were generally more interesting to fight.Overall, I can't really recommend this game for State of Emergency fans. I was disappointed.			"

												From what I had seen in trailers and the sales page, I wasn't convinced that this was a good game; one of those 'meh' feelings. Bought it for 5 euro's in the sale and I'd say it's well worth that money. Graphicswise it's not the best out there, but it has all elements that makes a good (zombie survival) game. It's basically a SinglePlayer, working version version of The WarZ (survivor stories: investation). Don't expect any replay value though; the scaveging get's quite boring fast (just like the boat stuff in Assassin's Creed 4) but stays fun just enough to finish the game.7/10			"

												I played all kinds of zombie games but no game is like this one. In first days of early beta it was really bad full of bugs and didn't even had keyboard and mouse support. Now 1 year later it is like another game. Gameplay mehanichs are good but controls sometimes get unresponsive but nothing serious. As everyone know this game 2 DLC-s that are must need. And if anyone want to buy good open world zombie game he should buy this game. Hope to see more updates			"

												State of Decay é um jogo difícil de descrever. É mais fácil imaginá-lo como um grande simulador de apocalipse - no caso, de zumbis. A função do jogador é controlar não apenas um, mas vários membros de um grupo de sobreviventes com a missão de formar uma comunidade segura e funcional, garantindo os recursos necessários pra ficar de pé.É preciso lutar contra hordas de zumbis, revirar cidades desertas em busca de suprimentos, evoluir seus personagens, melhorar sua base improvisada, salvar aliados em apuros, fazer ""comércio"" com comunidades vizinhas e resolver conflitos internos. Parece bastante coisa, mas logo as mesmas ""quests"" começam a se repetir e o jogo cai na mesmisse. O pior: na tentativa de se tornar mais dinâmico, o jogo exagera na quantidade de missões que exigem a sua atenção por vez, muitas vezes anulando a aparente liberdade que o título oferece.Sem falar que não há quase nenhuma explicação sobre suas mecânicas, o que obriga a jogador a passar algumas horas tentando adivinhar como alguns elementos funcionam. (procure tutoriais na internet!). A jogabilidade em terceira pessoa é divertida e responde bem aos comandos. Jogar com um joystick é mandatório. Os gráficos são bons, especialmente os efeitos de iluminação. Porém, a resolução baixa das texturas (por ser um port direto da versão de X360) é notável, além de que as animações deixam bastante a desejar em alguns momentos.Mesmo com a mesmisse das quests, a falta de um enredo consistente para estimular o jogador, e a ausência de um tutorial melhor, State of Decay é um ótimo open-world, viciante e divertido (até certo ponto), servindo especialmente bem a quem gosta de jogos de zumbi.7,5/10			"

												State of Decay is one of the best zombie games in recent memory. However, I wouldn't call it perfection. In fact, this game has plenty of flaws.In the graphics section, I found it to be pretty nice for the most part. However, in the beginning of the game, the lighting is absolutely terrible and hurt my eyes a bit. Despite that, the visuals were extremely nice and I was itching to take a few nice screenshots. However, I can't call it the #1 best part. It's still very well done.The gameplay is heated, difficult, and in some ways, realistic. The gameplay is probably the best part to the game. When you think of zombie games, I assume that you would imagine some dude with a six-pack running around shirtless with shades on dual wielding sub-machine guns, right? State of Decay is NOT like that. These are just human beings we're talking about, not supersoldiers. In fact, if there's anyone people would consider cheap in this game, it would be the Army. But hey, we're talking about the Army here. Did you really think a soldier would be running around and getting tired quick and having a miserable aim? Anyway, running away from hordes IS NOT a good idea. I've tried to run several times, but I've only gotten out alive once or twice. The people who did survive had severe injuries, were extremely tired, or have no useful items left on them. The vehicles are simple enough to drive, and making them limited just makes the game even harder. Very good gameplay.The story is cliche, no doubt. Survivors are holed up in a certian place (In State of Decay, Trumbull County) and the Army refuses to help. However, it seems rather difficult to actually come up with a decent plot for a zombie survival game without realizing someone else did that already. The audio is above average at most. The voice acting is fine, at times weak. It sometimes sounds sarcastic or the mic is far away. However, some of the actors do provide some emotion. The music is great for a zombie survival game, and I usually rely on the music to tell me if the zeds are nearby. Although again, the music is a bit cliche since several zombie survival games (and even shows) use guitars or things like that for their soundtrack. But, the soundtrack is very good in this game and is better than lots of other games and shows that use the soundtrack like this.The replayability is very strong in this game. If you beat the game, you can play through it again once or twice. There's also the two DLC packs that were very critically acclaimed you can buy, too. I didn't get either one yet, but Breakdown looks extremely fun. It's actually number one on my wishlist right now.State of Decay does have a few other major flaws I'd like to point out: The AI in this game is absolutely HORRIBLE. One of my survivors stood there doing ABSOLUTELY nothing while getting eaten by a horde of zombies. Since my guy was tired, I had to run the zombies over. And because usually the survivors dodge the car, he just stood there, doing absolutely nothing. When I hit him, he stood there and I lost trust with him. It was even one of the trust missions where someone is feeling angry, sad, or whatever. He also took like half an hour to get all of his things while the houses next to him were infested when we rescued him. Still though, BAD AI. The dialogue is repetitive and there's not many stories when you're bringing survivors back home. That's probably about it in terms of major flaws.In the end, State of Decay is quite fun and there's lots to do, but the game has some very major flaws that can ruin your experience. Either way, this is a game I'd recommend for any zombie survival fan.Graphics- 8.0/10Gameplay- 9.0/10Story- 4.0/10Audio- 7.5/10Replayability- 9.0/10.:7.5/10:.+Great gameplay+Large world+Awesome soundtrack+Impressive job by some of the voice actors-Awful AI-Repetitive dialogue-Weak lighting early game			"

												If someone created a tetrahedron (just roll with it) of zombie apocalypse entertainment with Left 4 Dead at one corner, No More Room in Hell at another corner, The Walking Dead at a third corner, and DayZ in the final corner, State of Decay would be somewhere near the gooey, festering, dead center of such a divine tetralogy of terror. This is my first enduring impression upon completion of the main storyline after marathoning 26 hours game time over the course of about 36 hours from point of purchase. I have yet to try the DLC, so my review covers the basic game only. I will try to keep spoilers to a minimum.You and a buddy have gone camping and are on your way back to civilization only to find that the campgrounds have become picnic at the park for zed. Your job is simply to survive and learn to survive more successfully and efficiently. As you make your way in the world, you find yourself essentially trapped within a large valley of small communities and farms with a few souls and a whole lot of folks who’ve no longer any use for theirs. You’ll see a lot of tropes and types that are standard for the genre, but most of them are written in a way that downplays their commonness and gives them the dignity of a measure of individual identity and unique situations. You’ll find that vehicles work pretty much as you’d expect them to—often to your advantage and, now and then, to your sorrow. You’ll learn quickly that the world reacts to your decisions in mostly logical ways and that, among the precious assets that will remain largely too sparse for your tastes, human beings matter greatly to you and your prospects for survival. Influence will become your currency. Interactions will become your keys to more currency, technology, and even more assets. Your chances will depend solely upon your actions and choices, but your outcomes will almost always depend upon how your actions and choices affect others. For a relatively small solo game, I never felt that the world was hollow or empty, or that I was truly playing alone the way you feel if you solo some games. The Good: Options. High degree of player interaction with environment and characters which carries lasting impacts. Ambitious design. Homage to the genre. Moments of pleasant surprise and genuine anxiety. Humor that is often subtle. You will roam a mostly open world with some depth of detail that I think may pleasantly surprise you at times. You choose how you will play, where you will go, and what you will do. If you play smart, the game will reward you. If you take foolish risks, you may find yourself sorely punished—likely, but not a guaranteed always. On a single run through from beginning to end, I found myself still trying to figure out certain triggers for various spawns and events, and that’s a good thing. It promises a level of continued interest for future game sessions. If you tear up a vehicle, it will break down, and even possibly explode. If you toss a flare or firecrackers in the night, you will attract a lot of unwanted attention, but you will also be able, if you’re quick and quiet enough, to take advantage of the diversion to make an escape. There’s a lot more I’d love to share, but some things are more pleasurable discovered on your own. If you’re paying attention as you go, you may notice a good number of locales or situations clearly intended as tributes to the genre greats, both to creators and to the works they created, and it comes off not simply as a checklist but as an honest homage. If you get the game, take time to revel in the sensation of racing down a country road in the night with your headlights off while swerving slightly to the side and opening your driver’s side door to take out an entire horde of zombies and freaks. Take a moment in the twilight to look out over a field of crops to see shambling silhouettes against the outline of a rolling landscape under an open country sky. Savor the tremor in the dark as you explore a quiet shed only to discover that you aren’t alone in there after all. Thrill to the delighted frustration of attempting to run down that creepy thing that moves just too darn fast and vaguely spider-like along the edge of the road. Regret smacking indiscriminately into that just-one-more batch of zed that somehow left such a foul aftertaste.The Bad: First, the downside to being such an ambitious game that aims to honor and do so much is that it has its limitations. I found myself in a few spots just wishing the game would go farther in a certain way to take things further in certain options that just weren’t available sometimes. I wanted more management options for people. I wanted a better explanation at times for certain things, though I think that the hands-off approach to this game actually improved the experience overall for me. I found other limitations, which I won’t share because I don’t want to spoil the fun but you are free to discover them for yourself.  Second, there were some moments when I felt the actions or dialogue of characters in the game were completely transparent as vehicles for forcing my attention in some direction. I didn’t like that at all, but thankfully this did not happen too often. Third, while we’re talking about dialogue and actions of characters and game limitations, I found it strange that a game that places such a high emphasis on influence would present me with so few opportunities for deep interpersonal interactions. Conversations, too often, are limited to, “Hey, what’s the sitch?” and that’s it. Not even an option given to answer that question. Fourth, a few persistent glitches in the game. I noticed a change in the condition of vehicles where you pass by one time and it’s in good shape and the next time it’s dinged up, but then the very next time you pass by it looks perfectly fine. Some people showed up as having run away from my compound, but were actually still living there and were still available as controllable characters. Fifth, companions hit some trigger point where a mission, a conversation, or some other key like stamina tells them it’s time to go home, and they run off. Even if you’re on the opposite side of the map with a perfectly good vehicle and getting ready to get in and drive home, they will run off across the countryside full of wandering hordes and freaks, sometimes creating a hazard where you have to rescue them in the process. I think this is a result of the game’s having been developed to emphasize stealth over combat. However, I played using reserved force and stealth, and all-out Car Wars/Death Race 2000 driving mentality, and found I did quite well.The Ugly: The game is a PC port from console and it shows. It’s not nearly as bad as some games I could mention, but the console history of the game makes certain things awkward for PC players at best. Playing with keyboard and mouse worked just fine, but sometimes I would discover a move that I couldn’t quite easily reproduce and it makes me wonder if it was supposed to be triggered by a combo that I just haven’t figured out on K&M control. That being said, mostly, to anyone who didn’t know it was a console port or had familiarity with the differences in play and feel, I don’t think anything more than the autosave function and a few other clues give it away. That’s not too bad a complaint for the ugly. Also, and this is my biggest beef with the game, I found the best compound for my strategies in the game broken or nerfed (I couldn’t tell which) in an incredibly stupid way: The rest of my review (you're getting very near the end of it) appears in the comments section below because I've run out of room again.

												State of decay is one of the best third person survival horror open world game. Graphics is good enough, story is fine. SoD is not a brainless zombie killing game, you are a member of a community stucked in Thumbull county. Player have to manage the community which includes doing favoures for survivors to gain trust to become friends later; scavenging for vital supplies such as food, medicine, building materials. In the game you have a ""home base"" which can be upgraded with 9 facilities, and also has  space for outpost to build. Outposts extends the safe area and have supply cache to restock your equipment. The game can be played id different ways, someone likes playing stealthy, others prefer brute force to complete missions. Ah, the missions; i found side missions a bit repetitive, but they are okay. Driving cars is useful but makes a lot of noise which attracts zombies. When you are at your base you can change the character you are playing if the other character is your friend. Changing is adviseable to let the used character rest to get their vitality and stamina back to maximum value. SoD is beyond my expectations, i recommended everyone who loves zombie games 9/10.			"

												So here's the deal: a stealth-oriented game where the stealth kill option doesn't friggin' work half the time. Boy, aren't we off to a good start.The plot doesn't exist, the writing is so-so at best.Gameplay is convoluted. This whole affair with stealth kills not executing properly half the time really messes up the game when you're torn apart by the friggin' horde.This also has a gimmick where stuff happens to your base while you're not playing, which is unpleasant for those of us who have a life to live apart from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games.Dunno. It had some promise, but I'm still to see a decent open-world zombie apocalypse game.3 TORN APART MARCUSES OUT OF 10			"

 In my opinion, one the difinitive zombie survival games. I'd take this over DayZ anyday!State of Decay is basically at its core is a single player, third person 'Zombie Survival' action game, with sim like management elements. When you start off you're in control of one guy who, with his chum, gets lost while hiking. If, by some miracle you dont die, you'll never see the more interesting mechanics of 'State of Decay', which is that when you die, you take control of a different character instead. You dont respawn. This makes choices matter a whole lot more than in most games, as you always have something to lose when going out to get supplies with a band of survivers.You also have to manage the survivers health, morale, supplies (and inherantly, the shortages that will occur) and generally look after them. Characters will get tired over time, and you'll have to swap out the playable character for a bit while they regain thier energy. This brings me to one of the games more annoying mechanics. Even when you're not there, the game world is still moving, albiet at a slower pace. Survivors can die, run away, starve, and generally things can go bad fast when you arn't there. While it's a cool idea, I found it just became annoying to patch up the band of survivors, turn off the game, only to find that someone had been killed off when I came back. Gameplay:Controls are reasonably responsive. Sometime it feels a little sluggish and the jumping mechanics are a little floaty, but it's all servisable, and doesn't impact the game a whole lot. You have the options of melee weapons, or guns when dealing with the undead. Combat is passable; nothing more. You'll find yourself spamming the attack button as your character losing stamina while the zombie you're wailing on continues to suck the durability from your weapon. The game really punishes you (which I love!) for trying to take on large groups of Zombies, as you'll find you'll be quickly overwelmed. Guns are also an option, but are loud, crude and are in limited supply. Usually a last resort unless you have a silencer. In conclusion: One of the better surval sim games out there.			"

Im glad I can still play it because I have both dlcs and everything but still, the GOTY Edition is so heavy and pricey and what does it do? Some nicer textures. Screw you :)No thanks.I really love this game. If it had multiplayer even 2 Player Coop It would be the best zombie game Ive ever touched and I touched and played a few and saw some come and go. I love the action, the combat, the loot...oh god the loot.Whoever had a truck filled with 6 bags worth of materials and then drive a bit too fast, turn the car upside down and watch it explode and burn knows my pain...Having a car is great but when its gone.. its dangerous, creepy at night even and you really need to stealth or run out of breathe.I loved this game I will keep playing it but Since no one can buy it anyway, this negative review doesnt do ♥♥♥♥, since no one will read it :)Even if it sucks I still want to see State of Decay 2 with multiplayer...If it ever comes and doesnt ♥♥♥♥ on the players again.Overall, awesome game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ production team and poor choices on the cost of the community.

												I dreaded to play this game. I was watching the alpha/beta development of this game for a little while, and while I liked a lot of what I read about it, looking at the content didn't look 'refined' enough.The gameplay is not anywhere as smooth as I had hoped and it's hard for me to get past the pre-rendered animations for literally every action. In the beginning I was watching my npc friend attack a zombie and you could see when each attack animation would create a 'stutter' between the next attack.Right in the beginning I watched a zombie trap it self climbing up a ledge, clipping back down, then repeating over and over again.The controls as a whole feel awkward to command and execute, with a lot of fine mouse sensitivity just to execute bulky, long animation sequences.The camera doesn't zoom out very far at all either. For an open world zombie game, your field of view  feels kind of narrow and your character takes up a good size on the screen.The gameplay is nothing like Left 4 Dead, but more like a more arcade gamestyle of Dead Rising with  a Dead Island feel.You do get vehicles in this game though, and they handle really nice. They drive with a good weight to them, rather than the sometimes glidy feel of running around in the game.My biggest gripe about the game is all the heavily scripted actions, which doesn't work when the combat generally tends to be just button mashing, making your character attack at nothing a few times to catch up with all the times you mashed the attack button.I don't know how much can be improved upon with patches and this first game is rather bumpy in a lot of ways and would only recommend to buy on sale, I could definitely see this turning into a worthwhile series. The gameplay is unique and interesting enough that it can definitely be worth expanding on.			"

Is it another zombie game? Well yes. But that doesn't mean it's more of the same. I think State of Decay tries to do what games like DayZ cannot which is a survival zombie experience without the threat of being killed by a real player.It's not as agressive as DayZ in terms of surviving but the fact that you have to explore, scavenge and find ways of progressing makes it very compelling. You also take part as the guy in charge so whatever happens is on your own hands.			"

												Just for irony's sake, remember all horror films on the last 30 years while reading this. this actually is what happened to me:-Swapped to the black guy on a nighttime Neighbor Protection mission-Brought a shotgun, forgot I was low on shells-Wrench broke halfway through, no melee weapons nearby-Got black guy ripped in half by Zeds-Never lost another survivor again.10/10 would play again.No, seriously, I would. This game is awesome, I just wanted to put that up for irony's sake.			"

												Ok so after about 30 hours I think I know enough to rate this one.   My first experience with this game was while it was an alpha and I am happy I waited to play for real until it was ""finished"".  For the most part the game is finished there are still some bugs that are silly and gamebrakeing.  (minor)   However what is broken in this game isnt really the game but the concept.  If you want your game to be hard as hell thats fine.  In fact its actually a really good thing as long as you follow a simple rule.  Either you allow the user to adjust the difficulty with silders, or if you still want hardcore to be the only mode you need to make sure that mode doesnt interefere with the fun.  And holy crap does that mode interfere with the fun.   Lets remember you cant really save in this game, you make a bad decision and too bad you now need to start over the WHOLE GAME!!  I could go on attacking this feature but I guess the fan boys would not understand.   If you buy this you will need to download the hack that helps to balance fun.  Even with that the game still kicks your butt with sending you on mandatory missions every minute or two.  Problem is that it can take 30 minutes or so to finish the first mission, so you are guaranteed to get screwed.   This isnt a game, its an attempt to **** with everyone who buys it.   There are good things about SOD, the game makes you care about the survivors and you can get into the game.   There is fun to be had here its just so impossibly hard to find and enjoy.   Graphics and color must be altered to create a look because otherwise it would be a crime.   I REALLY hope some moders get ahold of this one and make it playable.    My Score   30/100  Horrible			"

												If you use Steam on a regular basis, chances are you came across State of Decay on the frontpage, offering its tender body up to you, promising more ZOMBIES.If you think the gaming-world has had enough zombies as of late you're absolutely right. What is lacking, though, is an innovative approach to the zombie-genre. Something with more depth than your average Resident Evil. State of Decay (SoD) might just be exactly that.SoD starts you off in medias res, with only you and your buddy stranded in the midst of an already ongoing zombie-apocalypse. The gameplay comes along feeling a lot like Dead Rising at first, but quickly shows it tries to take on more than just that. As you hack and slash your way through Northern American forests and farmlands (on a fairly large, open map) you will meet other survivors (not actual people, mind you - this is a singleplayer-title). Some might not be too fond of you and avoid contact, others might be willing to join up. Soon, you will have a quaint little base to call your (temporary) home and you will quickly realise that not everything evolves around YOU and the character YOU play.SoD claims to be a Zombie-Survival-Simulator - and this goes beyond simulating how to best dismember the undead. You will have to keep an eye on all of your ""group"", as all of them have roles to play. There will be relations between characters, tensions, scarcity of resources and so on. Maybe most importantly of all: No one is safe. Every character can die, yet in return you also get to play as anyone who has joined you.Plan your adventures carefully, take only what you need, call for scavengers, answer the calls of your fellow survivors and occasionally plow through a zombie-horde with a car. This should sum up SoD in essence.All this glory does have its shortcomings, though. Missions will start to get repetetive due to their interchangable nature, many houses will look similar and the stuff you find in them is not very interesting. Being an Xbox-title originally, the game also looks a bit outdated and struggles with controls. An Xbox-controller is REQUIRED (quote from the store-page) to play this game, at least until they finish the mouse and keyboard controls in a patch.Speaking about patches, this game still is in early development, so a lot of changes will be made in the future. It certainly is promising, just not quite the Next Big Thing.--UPDATE (Aug 2014): SoD does no longer REQUIRE a controller to be played, it now supports mouse and keyboard controls, HOWEVER I still recommend playing with pad as using your mouse will give you some rather twitchy controls.

												Im going to review this game. Not the fact that I put it away for a while to allow for the many many bugs...including the lack of screen support making the guns fire to the left of the target, be fixed. I come back to find this mess has been abandoned and ""remastered"". More likely they realized what a mess it was and just decided to cash in their chips. Heres the deal. Core gameplay problems is what I will concentrate on. Nothing about the developers screwing the fanbase over because there are a thousand of those rants right now.To start with. This is not a survival game. Its a resource collection game with arcade physics thrown in to give you something to do while youre trying to keep your little base alive. You WILL spend most of your time wondering why you can just carry a damn bag in the trunk of your car. See....the game mechanic is this. Break into house. Random loot is in random places. Lets say food. You pack it up into a bag and carry it on your back.....to the car....that you drove there in. Now. Common sense says ""Hey. Ill throw a bag in the trunk or the passenger seat."", or ""Hey, I got a truck. Ill throw the bag in the bed of the truck and I can bring more stuff so I can play the game a bit and not worry about the food situation."" Now we cant have that can we? 1 bag at a time sir. Regardless if you brought a pickup truck or a muscle car. The method of delivery is 1 bag at a time. While youre collecting those bags youll come across radio traffic in the form of side missions. usually its ""Survivor X located at Y, go save them."" That sounds simple but when youre literally in the middle of a mission and carrying a pack of supplies...its pretty much impossible to get there in time. Innevitabley they die and because of the ""I hate your decisions"" system built into the game, your damned squad gets MAD AT YOU FOR FAILING TO SAVE PEOPLE YOU HAVE NO TIME TO SAVE!!!! So you say forget them. Ill just go back to base and turn these supplies in. All will be forgivien. Just about right. Except now that youre back the base is under seige. Right about the time that you come back. You have very little time to run back and forth, nailing boards to windows while your NPC buddies fire away, destroying the boards and....not really damaging any zombies that are crawling through. Eventually you get a few hits and some damage. Then survive the night. The ""Seige"" is what its called. Oh...but dont forget to kill ALL THE ZOMBIES!!! If you forget just one...anywhere...they will not stop the seige mode and more will come. I had a zombie stuck in a staircase that I couldnt kill and the seige just kept on until...well....I lost all my crew and myself. Lets assume for the sake of brevity that you manage to save the idiots standing around...I mean, your team mates. You have a broken leg. How? Zombie punched you in the arm maybe...who knows. Now we come to....Tired and worn characters. Not only are your resources limited the characters you get to control are also depressive, unskilled, and sometimes just better off holding a grenade and running toward the largest hoard you can find. So here you are. Youve had the black dude with the vest or the military chick the whole time. Theyre the starting characters and quite frankly the best ones Ive found. LOVE the black dude in the vest. He weilds a sledgehammer like an anime warrior swings a mystic too big to hold sword at demons to split them in half! However...here you are. Unable to walk very far and tired. So you have to trade in. Cool...cool. Ill just use someone else. Its here that the game reveals just how hard it can push when it takes a dump all over you. See...the other characters in the game arent really all that useful. There are a few here and there that are ok but theyre all random when you get them. The way you mainly get them? Remember earlier when I said you gotta rescue people? Yeah. So anyways. Youre now forced to use some old lady thats an alcoholic chain smoker and has ""A general knack for cleaning""........great.Well you use the old bag lady who clans house. You kill zombies and raid houses. Every 12 minutes a call comes through to ""Return to base. We have a horde incoming!"" Yay.......another siege. Its only been like....10 minutes and you just got to the actual story mission area. Nope. Head home and battle more zombies. Well now that youre finally here and collecting supplies while playing through a mission....boss fight. Great. Your bag lady just got killed. Now its back to the wounded guy from earlier. You use him and...well....you were too slow and now hes dead. You decide....Ill take a break.You come back from said break, unaware that while youre gone...the game keeps on. So you come back to a game where some survivors took supplies to trade with other survivors, they didnt get back because they were trapped by a zombie horde, theyve lost your supplies, and now youve got to take ""Jim Boscoe"" to save them. Jim is a derelict, chronic alcoholic, that wheezes like an old school bus muffler and coughs up just as much when you rev the engine. Hes armed with a pole that he picked up and smells like a bag of feet. Go get em Jim! Thats the biggest issue, The character ""story"" is generic as all get out. The intricat relation you thought you had between the military chick, black dude in the vest, and white dude in ugly shrt? Yeah...thats all for nothing as the dialogue is written in such a way that not only is it not changed....its CONTINUED IN EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER AS IF NO ONE EVER DIED!!! The story just chugs along like an Austrailian land train convoy! No impact. No repercussion , except that now instead of having an actual ""hero"" character...youre in control of a useless whino. Yeah...because thats what I want to be in a game. A whino with a length of rebar!Lets just say for the sake of things you decide to run with this....you should consider getting tested at this point...youve had warning and I didnt. By the way...at this point can you tell this is  100 percent MY ACTUAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE GAME?!?! So youre Jim...the whino savior of the badlands. You climb into your muscle car and you just want to do a mission. You find the location is on the other side of the map and go. Because youve got no skills you decide to just use the car. Doing so destroys the car and when you get out to switch you find the ""stealth"" element to Jim is severly lacking. There is NO DAMNED STEALTH ELEMENT! You are either behind a wall or you are seen. End of. The people who claim there is a stealth element are lying. Period. There is a stealth element attempted but not implemented all the way. So what you get is guess work instead of applied skill. I guess it adds to the ""intensity"" but at this point the ""intensity"" is annoyance. You get to the mission area....youve thus far ignored at least 2 cries for help, a person trapped in a siege building, and a siege at your own base...because screw it you just want to plod on with the mission! Final problem. Joe is underpowered. Yeah. See. Games like Da-Z, Project Zomboid, H1Z1, The Dead linger...theyre all like this game in some ways. Theyre all worse and better so Im not advocating any of them individually, however, they did get one thing right. See. State of Decay has zombies that ar at different difficulty to kill. The Big'uns are FAR harder to kill and the Shrieker is the highest priority to kill. Well. The characters that are capable, the ones you worked on to get to that level, the ones you spent the last 6 hours of gameplay on....theyre all dead. Jim has a lenght of rebar to fight 2 armored zombies, a Big'un, and a shrieker....who are all in front of the mission building. You say ""Screw this. Im running these cats over!"" Then you find out that hitting the Big'un destroys the car. Now your car explodes and Jim is dead.This, unfortunately, is the game.			"

												Got nostalgic and decided to play some state of decay.  Oh, what's this?  My screen is doing funny things, that's odd, maybe it's some of the mods I used to play with being outdated...*Uninstalls mods*  Hmm, that didn't fix it, and what's with these black box things where the text should be?  Guess I'll check the games forums to see if I missed an update of if there's a fix.  *finds nothing that works*  *sees the ""new"" version of the game*  Oh, so it's one of THOSE things.  Game itself gets a positive score, I give it 9/10.  But don't buy it, because it doesn't work, and apparently the developers just stole the game from all of us original players libraries, so I wouldn't buy any more of there games either.     Guess I'll go back to playing this on my Xbox 360 like the good old days.  These guys at Undead Labs are going to have to seriously work to convince me if they want me to buy their second State of Decay.			"

												1/5 года ожиданий, наконец то оправдались.Пусть  State of Decay на данном этапе еще сырая, пусть в ней еще нет должного перевода,и  как скажут многие адекватного управления без геймпада. (хотя у меня лично проблем не возникло при использовании клавиатуры и мыши ) но после 20 минут проведенных в ней - я убедился что ролики не лгали .Незабываемая атмосфера суровых реалей в эпоху зомби апокалипсиса, насыщенный и глубокий мир в духе лучших лент зомбихоррора, и главное - непередаваемые ощущения присутствия в этом мире - где нужно бороться за каждую минуту проведенную на своих двух в вертикальном положении, а  больше всего  вышеперечисленного радует  - наличие выборана тему -того как это сделать ! потому лично для меня State of Decay это - игра о которой раньше можно было только мечтать, и видеть в несбыточных снах.. Выживание -за счет логики и выбранных решений, а не только за счет ловкого раша !Твердая 10 ! А вот когда появиться мультиплеер ........эта рецензия увеличиться в двое XD ну вы поняли !;)			"

												This is the game I have been looking for since the Zombie Hype following ""DayZ"". It combines a Survival Game with fun fights (nothing beats fighting zombies with wrestling moves), several home bases, which can be upgraded and customized for your way of playing and rudimentary role-playing elements. And it is all completely Single Player. For some this might be a reason not to buy, but for this player it was the argument that sold the game. The game has a permadeath system and adapted it perfectly for a SP game. The player does not start with ""his own"" character. You rather start the story join a group of survivor, all playable for the character. All the characters in the game get exhausted and get debuffs through this. The player than has to return to the home base and choose another survivor to continue. This system is extremely fun as you can develop several different characters and ways of playing the game within one playthrough.Another mechanic which makes this game great is the resource management. The survivors don't spend all day with slaying zombies and driving around town. Most of the time cabinets, crates and all kinds of storage stuff is searched and looted. The player has to do this as the home base needs four resources. Food, to keep everyone well fed; Ammo, with a lot ammo in stock the home base has a decent supply of ammo for every firearm; Materials, to build and upgrade the home base and outposts, and medicine, this act the same way as ammo does a lot of supply equals lots of drugs at the home base. The most fun part of the game is the fighting. The player can either fight with blunt, sharp or heavy melee weapons or several firearms. The range of melee weapons goes from table legs to sledgehammers to cavalry sabres. Melee combat is mostly used in the game as guns are loud and the zombies react to sounds. This review just touches the surface of the game but I really hope that it helped you in any way. With best regards Invisiblo			"

												1. Too small map to explore for anything. If it is an open world then better be a world at least. also everywhere seems so similar and anyplace you make a basecamp, it is almost impossible to stretch out after you reached certain point. I really look forward to see some other types of environments in bigger size.2. Max stamina or stamina itself is way too limited so you can't really have any fun. Yes, it meant to be a realistic game but it's rediculously SHORT as if the Z-virus in game clogged half lung of every characters in this game.3. The resources are way too short... also even when you found a bag of something, the actual contents in the bag is almost nothing. Hand full stuffs when you break the bag. You are forced to keep on scavenging resources all the time makes you worried about them even when you are on a mission and never have a fun of hitting a jackpot. NEVER.4. No story what so ever. Well, some of you may say the entire purpose of this game is only surviving... I know that but it could've been something more, something even better than TLOU.. who knows?5. Lack of vehicles, vehicle space for bags... and they are... made of soft cheese cakes. pretty sure.6. Scavenging noise = fire arm noise... really? of is that also part of the ""reallity"" part?7. lack of ammo.. really...awww... I thought the game takes place in US but the amount of ammo makes me feel like I'm in somewhere else.. it's f**** zombie game! I want to enjoy shooting at zombies...8. The size of inventory is too small... and only 2 kinds of bags???? R U ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me??? Well, I'm not even expecting some kind of... magic pockets but even Farcry you can carry more stuffs. And to some of you saying ""oh, you need to learn using more than one character"" ♥♥♥♥, listen, can you even play them when they all fuc*** dying on beds all the time???9. Overall contents are too small... after playing about 5 hours, there are pretty much nothing more to do... really. all just... repeating over and over and over again...10. Even though they have a character level systems and stuff but players can't really enjoy.... why? you will never really get much reward of making your character stronger.. just... too small...11. If you want to spend your time and money, well I would recommend you to play some other cool, fun games not like player-torturing Japanese ♥♥♥♥ (Japanese game makers love to torture players with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ level systems and ♥♥♥♥ and they think player's love them too, so I said that) like this one.Last - I would probably think about buying later version of this game in the future BUT I will check out reviews, videos, player articles very carefully.

 Note: I deleted my initial popular review (March 30, 2014), in order re-write it and make sure the EDITED one (this one) re-appears again in the review section page.  Original Review (Short Version)  If you are obsessed with open-world zombie survival horror games, 'State of Decay' will give you an erection.  New Review based on the fiasco with the Year-One Edition I've become sick with the gaming industry, and this is perhaps one of the games that I'd never expect would go 'stealing' mode for a couple of extra bucks from people who ALREADY own their game.With their new edition of the game, they've added a 1080p quality with an extra car  (no fix for the ridiculous car physics though)  and an air-drop mission that sounds like a simple  grab-and-return-the supplies-home  feature and ask for customers who already own the original game and both DLC's to pay an extra 20 euro (with the -33% discount included) for this 'upgrade'. An 'upgrade' that  SHOULD BE FREE for owners  of the game, as is the case with all games out there (and especially the Indie titles). THIS IS A PATCH at best. It should be a PATCH. NOT A FREAKIN' FULL PRICE RE-RELEASE OF THE GAME.Moreover, the endless bugs of the original game were left unfixed, to be partly fixed in this new version, completely abandoning the ORIGINAL version... Funny enough, new bugs emerged so although some were fixed, the game STILL remains as buggy as it was, if not even more... Microsoft Studios  and  Undead Labs  are literally asking customers: ""You want some of  the bugs we abandoned fixing in the original game fixed? Pay 20 euro for them!""My answer to that is clear:  'NO'. I've paid around 30 euro for the base game along with the two DLCs. I am not paying an extra 20 euro for a 'remake'. And an  unecessary remake, to be precise, since the game was released no more than 1,5 years ago. Certainly, I'd understand such a visual upgrade if the game was a 2000's title, but doing so for a game released in 2013 is preposterous - clearly a quick cash-grab from the owners of the original game if you ask me. Why  Microsoft Studios ? Why?To me, unless owners of the game with BOTH DLC's have AT LEAST a -70% discount for this minor upgrade of the game, there is no way I am recommending this, and I'd advise you withhold purchasing  (especially if you already own the game)  because by supporting such moves from developers will only make things worst for  us  gamers... Just imagine every title, every game out there, after one year of the initial release, coming up with a hypothetical 'remastered' version of the game with slightly better visual quality and an extra 'car' or 'mission' that should be there in the first place and asking for almost the full price of the game AGAIN, from people who ALREADY own the full game. And above all, you are FORCED to buy it since the company no longer cares about the original (older) version, but rather ""focuses"" on the new one. Trust me, that would be a disaster... People are upset and this shows from the huge drop on the game's ratings (from 94% positive to 89% positive in two days), and the numbers keep dropping... Honestly, it pains me, because I used to like State of Decay. Unfortunately it's yet another game that fell in the pitfall of 'greed'.EDIT: As it turns out, YOSE is out and it is a complete disaster. People claim that they can barely tell the visual quality difference between the ""new"" and the ""old"" version and the new 'additions' are MODS at best and some of them already exist on the NEXUS!! I do NOT recommend it any longer   "

												Excellent and fun game. Unfortunately it's too short, but I enjoy games that go on forever. You'll have lots of fun collecting junk if that's fun to you, trying different weapons, and driving some fun vehicles. (Though not too many choices). It's open world (on a small map) so you can go where you want to with some urgency to submissions. Explosives and exploding environmental objects are fun too. Very few glitches and lots of hours to mess around with, esp if you buy the add on games.			"

												So lets start off with saying whats good about this game first. The gameplay is okay not to bad and not perfect but enjoyable. the graphics are nice and the driving is easy with a nice selection of cars.Now thats the good stuff out the way lets start with the bad stuff. The story doesnt really make sense as there is no real story as far as i can tell since you just get chucked in with endless missions. You end up doing the same mission pretty much all the time and gets kinda boring. The game feels broken as in some missions where there should be a cutscene there isnt, for expample someone dies who is important and theres no care about it at all its just like oh she died, how are you. Another thing is when the person is talking they always say the same thing like ""yeah whatever"" and other stuff and it just feels plain lazy.One last thing the zombies in this game just feels like its been ripped out of left for dead and retextured and dumped into the game, really dissapointed in this.

												Spent quite a long time before giving up on this game. It had a lot of potential but I found it ultimately frustrating. Not hundred per cent stable, sometimes crashing mid mission . Apart from the early stages the game lacks continuity and development. Good setting good characters but overall clumsy and unforgiving. I was never confident that stuff done in one session was being carried on to the next.			"

												Grind rgp characters with non of the skill nor story of traditional rpgs, button mashing ""open world"" consolification game. Ride around doing meaningless missions from one side of the map the the other. Didnt get any choices in my 9h of play apart from simple location changes, base building and characters are all basic and flat. No real impact anywhere.If you have nothing else to do and have played all the other zombi games maybe try but i am dissappointed, this was promising to be much better.If you are an Epoch player, this might be more amusing as a joke than a game.

												Let me just say this. I really wanted to enjoy this game. But after hours of playing it, I just can't.When it was announced, I was really hyped up and wanted to play it so bad. But once it got released and then I played it for hours, I was filled with nothing but boredom and disappointment.I'll start with the positives since good reviewers should always start with the good and then the bad. There's a lot of fun to be had here. The intense feeling of being chased by zombie hordes, finding supplies to keep yourself alive and fighting zombies. All whilst leveling yourself up so you can take on the hardest of things.Not only that, but there's quests that you get to do as well and some of these quests can repeat themselves too. So you're never short on never having anything to do except just running around.Unfortunately, here's where the bad comes in.The game plays like I'm playing a game on Facebook. If you had a stash of 35 food and then you quit the game to go do something else. Guess what? Once you come back to the game, you find out that your stash of food is only 10 and you'll have to spend all your hard work to go get some more. It ticks me off just to see a game that can play all by itself and then I come back to it, only to find that I'm doing worse than before once I come back on to play it. So it's either play this game after you get done with anything else or just stop playing it forever. Hey Undead Labs. This is Steam. Not freaking Facebook.Also, this is just personal opinion, but I hate the special infected in this. I encountered a big muscular zombie and then once I got too close to him, he grabbed my survivor with his huge hand and ripped him in two. This is an instant kill as well and it doesn't matter if you have full or near full health. I wouldn't have a problem with this if they would only appear AFTER I got a bunch of stuff and survivors. But they seem to appear too early in the game and it's just flat out unfair to the player in my eyes.This game can be unfair at times as well. For example, you'll be in a house with someone and you're trying to fight a few zombies that are attacking you. You are doing so great and you managed to beat them all. But then another zombie comes in and you're already out of stamina like you got freaking asthma. Hence, you can't fight as well if you don't have the stamina in order to swing a weapon. But the stamina drains like you're swinging a freaking sledgehammer when you're not even using one and it regenerates so slow as well if you don't level it up early in the game. The difficulty in this game can either be flat out frustratingly annoying or just total cheapness. Even so, they even promised and announced multiplayer on certain websites on this game too. But boy we're we disappointed when this game got released. This is another big issue to me. I hate developers who don't bring something they promise to their games. Undead Labs, if you needed more time to implement multiplayer into your games, I wouldn't mind. Just re-schedule the release date. I'm a patient man. But no, instead they decided to scrap the idea and just release the game anyway.Listen Undead Labs, you got a good game here. But unless you bring out a good game that doesn't play like a Facebook game, has challenge but, not at the very beginning and has something that you promised like multiplayer, I can't guarentee you're going to succeed as a video game making company. I'm talking to you as a gamer that knows what's best for the video gaming industry.Thank you and good bye. But please don't let this review take you away from buying this game. If you can handle this game playing it by itself when you're not playing it and if you don't mind it being singleplayer, go ahead at buy this. But I recommend buying it when it's on sale like it is now.			"

												One of the best zombie games I have ever played. It has everything from slashing/shooting zombies to collecting materials to upgrade your base. You can build and upgrade existing structures in your base, which is very awesome. There are also real-time side-missions, for example if you sent one of your survivors to collect stuff from a place, he could get overwhelmed by zombies and request your help. And if you don't help him, he could die. So it's really realistic. And with perma-death it makes it the most realistic zombie game I have played.			"

												What it does is very interesting and well done.  I can't help but feel though that it's almost like a facebook game where it keeps drawing you back with bonuses you recieve over time.  It's pretty addicting, however, and allows for quite a bit of micromanagment in your home base which is where you'll spend most of your later hours in the game.  It's a sandbox zombie survival that delivers what it promises and keeps you coming back for at least 15 hours if not more.  Not for everyone but quite a bit of fun when you get into it.			"

												It has a lot of the good parts of DayZ without the difficulty of having to deal with other players. The way you manage your safe-house is well done, not too much micro. I've heard it compared to a single-player version of Left4Dead but that's not accurate at all. The map is extensive and the game is more about exploring and hoarding than it is about story. Speaking of story, just when it was getting a little bit tedious... the game ended. A little bit anti-climatic and predictable, but still good.The price was worth it at 20.			"

												This game may not be the prettiest or the most polished and is full of glitches but if you look past that it is a real gem. I had so much fun with State of Decay, more than I thought I would. Looking past the imperfections is easy. When there is a great experience just below the surface. The world is large and open and I have never felt the sense of freedom this game offers before. The very fact that you don’t have to be the same character or build the same way every time you play is very refreshing.The developer basically gave you a sandbox well worth exploring and told you to do just that. Get this game and you will not be disappointed. The story is not too long but even so just for the emersion of trying to keep your little community alive and not eaten this game is well worth your time and money. Have fun ^_^			"

I played this game when it first came out on xbox live & many hours later & after sharing my addiction to a couple friends who fell victim to the SoD fever i heard that the PC version finally launched on steam and it was totally worth the wait!(and the extra dough for fellow SoD vets) The mouse & keyboard controls are very easy to use and the increased resolution is a beautiful upgrade aslong as your pc and monitor can handle it.

												This game is definately one of the best zombie-based survival games I've played. Along with your standard goal of not dying, Stated of Decay goes further by implementing emotion and character attachment. Two of the main protagonists are brother and sister, and if you let something happen to either one of them, the other will chew your ♥♥♥ up and generally just make you feel like a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.I also love the immersion in this game (though currently it still needs some polishing). Zombies here are a THREAT. Not just something that you kill help level up your character, but a huge_♥♥♥♥ing_threat. I don't think I've ever faced more than 4 zombies at once without getting some major and sometimes irrecoverable scars.Guns, the most sought-after thing in any zombie game save for the first Dead Island (where they were so weak and ammo was so scarce that they pretty much weren't worth it). In State of Decay, if you shoot as much as a .22 cal round without a suppressor, a horde of at least half a dozen zombies (read: 4 zombies gave me near-fatal wounds, your irresponsible shot will attract a minimum of 6). Ammo is also very scarce and valuable. You better make damn sure that every shot you make, silenced or not, is a headshot or at least enough to stun the zombie you shot at. Currently I haven't tried automatic guns such as the LMG and SMG (yes this game has a light machine gun), but I know for damn sure that I'm never gonna shoot anything with them without backup.Scavenging. The heart and soul of survival games. Without scavenging you have a mediocre shoot-em-up game. State of Decay makes scavenging very important with the use of random occurences where some food might go bad, a wall might crack, or someone getting critically ill. It's also sometimes dangerous to scavenge alone or in an infected area, and I can say that it's pretty damn nerve-racking when a zombie comes out of nowhere and bites the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.In State of Decay, you will have the opportunity to kill off members of your survival group. Sometimes it's a show of mercy, like if they've become infected (note: bites from zombies do not infect you), or they're so sick that they can't recover. Sometimes it's out of spite, like if the survivor facing death contaminated food supplies, or killed another survivor. And sometimes you can kill someone for generally just being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Finaly, let's talk about character skills. You can control several different characters in State of Decay, and they each level up differently according to how you play as them. You can max out general shooting and rifle skills to get them near-military level marksman training, or max out their fighting skills to let them smash every zombie head they see. You can max out their cardio (""#1: if you run out of stamina, that's it. Can't fight, can't run away, you're done."" - description of Cardio skill) to let them endure longer fights and still have the stamina to run away.Overall, State of Decay is amazing, and currently seems to be underrated.10/10 zombie heads.--Note--This game progresses even when you leave the game, so if you leave your party with low morale and supplies, when you get back ♥♥♥♥ is gonna hit the fan.--Note2--This game does not have multiplayer, and it is uncertain if the developers will eventually implement it.

												State of Decay is the stand-out game of the Summer Sale so far.  It is an open world zombie game that does a lot of things right. In each expansion you control a community who is trying to survive the zombie apocalypse.  You are collecting supplies, upgrading your home, and trying to stay alive.  You control one character at a time but can switch freely between the other members of your community.  Easily worth the price of the Steam Sale.  The expansions are stand-alone scenarios so if you are wary about buying the game then you can just start with the base.  The only negative points I'd give it are for technical issues.  I was crashing semi-frequently but I was able to sort the issues out and hasn't happened much since.			"

												Great zombie survival game. I love how you can grow your survivor community and fortify your areas. When I first bought this game I played it non-stop through the story and then bought the expansion and have since kind of stopped playing as much. As fun as it is, it gets repititious after awhile and you begin to feel the shallowness of the characters. Don't get me wrong, I love the game, but I think it would be nice if the developer would add more of a backstory on the characters, more events and missions, and more safehouses/upgrade/fortification options as that is the best part of the game in my opinion.I kind of burnt myself out on this game for a bit but then started watching AMC's The Walking Dead and got back in the mood for it. It's a good simple game that you can pick up where you left off and play off and on as you wish.All in all I think SoD is worth $20. I just hope to see better expansions in the future. The current expansion, SoD- Breakdown, is just more of the same original game. Same locations, safehouses and zombies. Not worth the money.			"

												For a zombie post-apocalyptic game this rates very high on my list, because it touches base on strategic survival rather than running-and-gunning. Supplies must be used wisely and overuse of a single character is costly. The game forces you to balance out decisions in order to survive. This game is one of the better single-player zombies games without a doubt.			"

												It has a lot of the good parts of DayZ without the difficulty of having to deal with other players. The way you manage your safe-house is well done, not too much micro. I've heard it compared to a single-player version of Left4Dead but that's not accurate at all. The map is extensive and the game is more about exploring and hoarding than it is about story. Speaking of story, just when it was getting a little bit tedious... the game ended. A little bit anti-climatic and predictable, but still good.The price was worth it at 20.			"

												This game may not be the prettiest or the most polished and is full of glitches but if you look past that it is a real gem. I had so much fun with State of Decay, more than I thought I would. Looking past the imperfections is easy. When there is a great experience just below the surface. The world is large and open and I have never felt the sense of freedom this game offers before. The very fact that you don’t have to be the same character or build the same way every time you play is very refreshing.The developer basically gave you a sandbox well worth exploring and told you to do just that. Get this game and you will not be disappointed. The story is not too long but even so just for the emersion of trying to keep your little community alive and not eaten this game is well worth your time and money. Have fun ^_^			"

												For a zombie post-apocalyptic game this rates very high on my list, because it touches base on strategic survival rather than running-and-gunning. Supplies must be used wisely and overuse of a single character is costly. The game forces you to balance out decisions in order to survive. This game is one of the better single-player zombies games without a doubt.			"

												Just finished the campaign and i love this game, it adds very interesting features found in few zombie games, like building an actual base and surviving instead of shooting your way through hondreds of zombies with big guns. After a while it gets weary though and with other or even randomized maps(which would be awesome) this would end up in my top ten but unfortunately the map is set and building and upgrading your base which sometimes takes a ridiculous amount of real time and especially the scavenging gets weary after a while. Luckily the dlc are a good bargain for their money add that extra fun to keep you playing.The bad pc optimization which forces me to play on low settings with a very good rig, the awful campaign which takes way too little time and isn't worked out and the sad fact that there is sadly no random gen which makes replay kinda dull since you end up in the same places ruin the fun a bit.7/10 definitely worth to buy,you get what you pay for and Good and cheap dlc.

												State of Decay is probably on of the best Zombie simulators i have ever played.You have to manage a group of survivors, by scavenging houses, send them on missions and build your base to an extent where you do not have to worry about your survivors dying.The combat is very simple and satisfying when you get kills, not killed.Once a survivor is dead, they are DEAD, the game will then put you in control of another survivor.You have to watch carefully at your missions, before it is too late to save someone, get supplies or complete a mission.Alot of fun little things in this game which will leave you addicted for quite some hours.

												State of Decay is a very good solo zombie-survival simulation. You spend your time building a community of survivors, managing resources, fortifying your hide-out and dealing with the groups interpersonal conflicts. Though it plays more akin to Dead Rising than DayZ the main draw of this game is exploring an immersive open-world, having to trek further and further each day to gather resources, deciding whether to drop your plans at a moments notice because someone on your radio is in trouble. The plot is bare-bones, you make your own emergent stories as you move around the world, having good and bad days, developing an XCom-like attachment to your characters because of the games permadeath system. Get past it's jankier elements in the early-game then it is a compelling experience and a lot of fun. Well worth a try.			"

												With over 900 hours logged on this game, I can honestly say that State of Decay, and it's add-ons, is one of my all-time favorite games.  My wife, who isa casual gamer, kind of fell in love with this game, too.  From the brutal, Savini-esque gore, to the to the heart-breaking decisions of having to put a community member down, this zombie game has just about everything.  A character can climb into a vehicle and plow through a horde of zombies (which will ultimately destroy your vehicle), toss a pipe bomb over the shoulder into a window and clear out a zombie infestation, build structures in your base to aid your community, gather resources, call in artillery fire...for a game that only encompasses about 12 square miles, it is quite epic.  Add on the Breakdown DLC for some sandbox play with ever escalating difficulty levels and loads of heroes to unlock and you've got a LOT of fun.  If you're lucky enough to have the Lifeline DLC, you'll be introduced to a whole new set of characters, with new mission types, and a larger city that isn't Trumball Valley.Pros: Variety of zombie typesUseable vehiclesLarge assortment of melee and ranged weaponsRPG-style elements like leveling up skills, large areas to explore, character backgrounds to discoverExcellent graphics, very usefull 3rd person POVWell-made, moody soundtrack and eerie sound effects, especially in 5.1 surroundModableGamepad friendly (I recommend X-Box 36 controller)Cons:Missions can become repetitive, especially in sandbox (Breakdown) modeSteep system requirements for the highest quality settingsDialog can become monotonous, could use more custom linesWould benefit greatly from co-op, especially local co-op, modeOverall, I highly recommend this game, 4.5/5			"

												This is the best zombie apocalypse game I could ever dream of. I am f*cking serious. Seems like developers took all the best from lots of games and made an ultimate zombie survival sandbox. This game reminds me so much of GTA, Left 4 Dead, The Walking Dead, Dead Rising and even the old Jagged Alliance (probably because of team management and it's color spectrum lol)- open world (area is not that big, but you can enter and scavenge any place or building you want);- tons of weapons ranged from melee (from baseball bats and shovels to wakizashi and braid) to heavy guns and grenade launchers etc.;- tons of different combat skills and perks, which really bring diversity into a simple fight;- random character generation (apart from plot characters);- character leveling;- plot missions which lead you through the game but are not annoying and you can play them whenever you want (I've played nearly 30 hours until I decided to get through the story);- base and team management, building of different facilities for survivors, upgrading them;- great soundtrack (COUNTRY ♥♥♥♥ YEAH) and ambient which makes already thick atmosphere even stronger;And of course, dat feel when you slam passing by zombies with your car's side door – OMG 10 out of 10 GOTYP.S. I didn’t expect this game to be so cool when I first heard of it. Some say (especially the ones who haven’t played it or played on youtube) that it is too casual, arcade and console-like, but it’s not true. This game has great atmosphere which overcomes everything. Seriously, just give it a try. Yes, graphics is not that good, but it is not that important. Plus, the developers have fixed lots of bugs and problems with controls, thank God I didn’t play this game during the early access, it would kill the first impression for sure.P.P.S. This game does not need multiplayer or co-op of any kind. It would kill all the atmosphere.			"

												Before I brought this game I looked at the screenshots which reminds me of WarZ :S But after looking at the reviews it seems the game is worth the money :) I brought the complete game with all the DLC for 10 bucks and I wasn't dissapointed! It was a steal for this price. I was blown away from the Survivor/Zombie AI and all the things you can do in State of Decay which is really unique and refreshing. The survival aspect is amazing! You can get tired, sick and infected! You have to shoot your buddy in the head if he is infected...duh! cruel but realistic lol :S Ammo, materials, food, medicine and other resources are necessary for survival. You can create outpost in abandoned buildings against zombie hordes and choose your own base which is limited but there are quite a few spots that can be used as base and upgrade it with more buildings. You can let other npc survivors join your base if you earned enough trust. The combat system is solid and fun, depending on the characters you can choose different skills and try new things out so you don't really get bored if you are choosing other survivors to play. The world is big and looks quite good. Some cars lying around in the world are driveable. It feels great! A little like GTA if you drive around :D What can I say more. If you want to play an open world without storyline buy the dlc breakdown which is really fun and challenging. The are almost no bugs in the game and the archivements aren't broken which is good! Buy this game if you like survival! Thx for reading :3			"

												Not bad when it's on offer; quite simular to Dead Island only third person. You find groups, you build resouces to protect etc as you move through the story.On my version for some reason the graphics were set to low, easily adjustable. Not amazingly designed; you'll notice a few graphical flaws here and there but if you catch the game on offer for around 7.49 then you will get your moneys worth. There isn't much of an introduction upon staring a new game and you are thrown straight into it with a journal to read to gain information on who you are, what you were doing up until the apparant zombie apocalypes.  The controls are pretty simple, nothing strenious i've found. No multiplayer which I found surprising at first but thinking about it; what's the point in paying out for servers when the top dogs are going to be the Left for Dead series and now Dayz for the forseeable future. If Microsoft Studios were realistic about this then possibly a wise move; and a little more investment into the game itself. I think the idea of this is more to game play; the graphics and charactor models themselves are not amazing. In fact if I was being over picky one could say the actual graphics and AI are somewhat terrible. I'd class it as the sensible soccer of zombie games,  it'll never beat the top dogs like fifa (or in this case left for dead and dayz) but does offer a fun alternative.Wait for the sale.			"

												One word. Actual survival. This isn't a standard ""Left for dead"" or even ""Dead Island."" you have to upkeep your home base as well as expanding. You can take over other areas. You have to keep your team's morale up. It actually has guns that you can get ammo for! Dead Island was a great game except the fact that there was no ammo. You found guns but never wanted to use them because all you have is 6 shots in the entire game. This game you have to manage resources as well. I have not played ""Dying Light"" because my computer cannot run it but this game beats all of other zombie survival games out there. I 500% recommend this. It is a great value for the price.			"

												Nowadays, you haven't seen alot of unique zombie simulation games... these are one of them (including the upcoming Dying Light video game) the fact that it combines all of the survivor needs, community support, and trading shows you a different survivor perspective that other zombies games before did not give you. It is also changes that perspective by not only making one protagonist, but if you were to befriend a survivor enough, you could control them as well. So it has the same aspects of L4D but your working with not just your group, but with the world and other survivors as well...           In my opinion this is one of the best games in the zombie genre i've ever played			"

												Probably one of the best Zombie games put out in the last few years.The best way to describe this really is It's San Andreas with zombies, an easy, lesser focus on maintaing your base/resource management and some decent writing. Just don't expect TellTale's The Walking Dead here, as while it's not a game with a tongue in cheek tone, it's not exactly the most serious game in town. Think Dead Island at face value but a tad more serious. It's a bit of a rough game, it's not exactly the prettiest looking, the controls may feel a little wonky at first, but if you're up for a game about scavenging through areas infested with zombies, dealing with problems within your group, and every once and a while having some emergent moments like watching in horror as a runner gets litterally torn in half captain rhodes day of the dead style in the middle of the street after getting surrounded and downed by a horde. The melee combat is a bit like a stripped down superpower-less Arkham Asylum that makes fighting hordes feel just as difficult and tiring as it reasonably should. While guns are by nature as much of a liability as they are a reward, the gunplay's fine, it's just that the crosshair is a bit too large to be reliable on higher resolutions for which i'd REALLY reccomend the Widescreen Crosshair Fix mod found here: http://www.nexusmods.com/stateofdecay/mods/15/? . Cars are similarily very useful and a bit of a risk, although they are the best way to get around the map, the game does throw some roadblocks every once and a while on roads to make driving a bit more difficult, although you can use mods to remove those if they annoy you.There are a few mechanics that might ""tick you off"" a bit if you have seething hatred for them and so I'll list them below:-Character Permadeath, if a character dies/Goes down three times, they're dead. No getting them back. Even story relevant characters can die but it will never make the game unbeatable.-A persistent World aspect a bit like Animal Crossing although don't worry, you won't not play for a week to find everything in shambles. The longer you're not playing, the slower time moves and if I recall it caps at 3 hours. -A level of repetition very late into the game, and light annoyance at times. I've seen the game be criticized for this, but at some point parts of the tasks might start to feel a bit repetitive, but this is mostly stuff related to scavenging necessary items and helping characters through emotional states. The annoyance part I mentioned relates to stuff like having to deal with stuff rather constantly, there will very rarely be a moment that something won't need to be done for someone or around the safehouse. Someone might need saving(Outposts reduce the chances of this happening, increasing the area zombies won't spawn in.), someone might need help with their anxiety (Which always results in you killing zombies with them. It's a bit lazy and repetitive but with the amount of ♥♥♥♥ in this game already I can forgive it.), there's story missions to do all while you're trying to keep the safehouse running, everyone healthy and also trying to make towards your next goal and trying not to screw yourself further down the line.The story itself is nothing special really, but it is written competently and while not every character feels like more than just an NPC, it does it's job fleshing most of them out. I can't think of a main character I could really call ""bland and lifeless"".One last thing, but this game isn't amazingly well optimized for lower end systems. You should be fine if you have a moderate or high end rig, but if your computer lands more on the ""toaster"" end, you probably won't be able to tweak the settings too heavily to save your performance. Honstly, if something irks you about the game, look through the mods there's probably going to be something there to fix it. If you like zombie games just about at all, or what I described interests you, grab this game.			"

												Lets start this off by saying this game is one of those surprises, My first time playing it I will be honest I hated it. The gameplay was just not for me, but the more time I have spent with this game the more I am loving it. Its like that annoying friend that you love yet want to strangle at the same time, What I mean by that is the survial aspect of this game is wonderful. And the gameplay ended up opening up past what I saw in my first play through. While other zombie games focus more on the killing or maybe the looting this game focuses on a group dynamic. It will make you consider putting your character in danger in order to bring back supplies for a sick group member, or maybe searching a market for more food to feed the group, buy doing so putting yourself at risk to being torn apart and having your character being gone for good. Yes there is perma death meaning if you level up a character and make one mistake they are gone forever all that time you invested in them gone in a blink of an eye. It really changes your mentality on how you go about day to day things in this game, Not only are you wanting to put yourself at risk to better your group but by doing so you risk your own character and these struggles really start getting to you. You can of course ease the struggle buy leveling your character, traveling with a partner which will cost influnce or calling in favors like back up from a swat team or you can set up outpost to protect them more allowing them a better chance at survial on supply runs they will make.This game does have some glitches and bugs let me be clear I am by no means gonna say it doesnt this is not a perfect game by the hardware standpoint but for me none of them are game breaking or really upset me annoying yes and that is what I ment by that friend you want to strangle, but by no means are they bad enough for me to rage out and want to never play again. Not once did a bug hinder my ability to play the game or did it effect a mission for me up to this point.This game is a wonderful refreshing take on zombie survial and at the end of the day that is what this game is and survial game where you try your best to hold out as long as possible with what you can scavenge or with the people you meet its not all that spectacular in the terms of story but at the heart of it you have a real to earth hardcore zombie survial game and that is all it claims to be and it delivers with great gameplay and new take on the genre that I really enjoyed.

However, after playing for an entire 12 hours straight, i will say they were wrong and it is an awesome, and unfortunately very addicting game. The game does tend to pester you with a lot of missions you dont really care about at once, and there is no real upgrades for your home encampments ( I raided a warehouse and invited one group of survivors and i was able to move to the best Base available an Snyder Trucking) It is extremely fun and definitely an improvement over a lot of the zombie games ive been playing.

I was actually prepared for a prologue or something like that you know, and the character you play at the start doesnt have really a detailed story cause you can change into another character after a short period of gameplay.Gameplay:You make your own choices which have their own consequences, for example: More survivors you save brings you to make you travel more to find food medicine etc. the less survivors you save the less ""reputation"" you get.What I personally dont like is that the gun itself has it's own amount of uses you can for example shoot only 100 bullets and it's broken... Same to the attachments to it like the silencer, if you dont pay attention on the ""status"" of the silencer trying to sneak and suddently after 1 shot it breaks. But the overall game experience which is based on exploring scravenging and surviving is very interesting.-------------------------------------------------Alright I rate this game 8/10It still has some bugs which surely will get patched in the future.I recommend this game to all who like RPG and Zombie Apocalypse games.Have fun at surviving ;) "

The gods have anwsered our prayers!)-Control Glitches (Only encountered a couple)-Sleep & Fatigue needs work-Arent really any hostile survivors (Closest ive come is 2 dudes demanding ammo from another guy)			"

												So, originally i heard bad things about SoD. However, after playing for an entire 12 hours straight, i will say they were wrong and it is an awesome, and unfortunately very addicting game. The game does tend to pester you with a lot of missions you dont really care about at once, and there is no real upgrades for your home encampments ( I raided a warehouse and invited one group of survivors and i was able to move to the best Base available an Snyder Trucking) It is extremely fun and definitely an improvement over a lot of the zombie games ive been playing. If you want one thats more authentic survival experience, I would try Project Zomboid, although it is a completely different style of game.9/10			"

												I really enjoy(ed) this sandbox game. It's a super great, funny and enjoyable strategy/action game, total timeconsumer. Just don't expect there to be rhyme or reason, cause there is no real plot per se, but then again, who ever needed a plot in a zombie apocalypse survival game? A lot of people gave it a hard time because of technical stuff, I have personally not met anything but lame animation glitches which can be fixed with going out into the menu and back.			"

												With over 900 hours logged on this game, I can honestly say that State of Decay, and it's add-ons, is one of my all-time favorite games.  My wife, who isa casual gamer, kind of fell in love with this game, too.  From the brutal, Savini-esque gore, to the to the heart-breaking decisions of having to put a community member down, this zombie game has just about everything.  A character can climb into a vehicle and plow through a horde of zombies (which will ultimately destroy your vehicle), toss a pipe bomb over the shoulder into a window and clear out a zombie infestation, build structures in your base to aid your community, gather resources, call in artillery fire...for a game that only encompasses about 12 square miles, it is quite epic.  Add on the Breakdown DLC for some sandbox play with ever escalating difficulty levels and loads of heroes to unlock and you've got a LOT of fun.  If you're lucky enough to have the Lifeline DLC, you'll be introduced to a whole new set of characters, with new mission types, and a larger city that isn't Trumball Valley.Pros: Variety of zombie typesUseable vehiclesLarge assortment of melee and ranged weaponsRPG-style elements like leveling up skills, large areas to explore, character backgrounds to discoverExcellent graphics, very usefull 3rd person POVWell-made, moody soundtrack and eerie sound effects, especially in 5.1 surroundModableGamepad friendly (I recommend X-Box 36 controller)Cons:Missions can become repetitive, especially in sandbox (Breakdown) modeSteep system requirements for the highest quality settingsDialog can become monotonous, could use more custom linesWould benefit greatly from co-op, especially local co-op, modeOverall, I highly recommend this game, 4.5/5			"

												Lets start this off by saying this game is one of those surprises, My first time playing it I will be honest I hated it. The gameplay was just not for me, but the more time I have spent with this game the more I am loving it. Its like that annoying friend that you love yet want to strangle at the same time, What I mean by that is the survial aspect of this game is wonderful. And the gameplay ended up opening up past what I saw in my first play through. While other zombie games focus more on the killing or maybe the looting this game focuses on a group dynamic. It will make you consider putting your character in danger in order to bring back supplies for a sick group member, or maybe searching a market for more food to feed the group, buy doing so putting yourself at risk to being torn apart and having your character being gone for good. Yes there is perma death meaning if you level up a character and make one mistake they are gone forever all that time you invested in them gone in a blink of an eye. It really changes your mentality on how you go about day to day things in this game, Not only are you wanting to put yourself at risk to better your group but by doing so you risk your own character and these struggles really start getting to you. You can of course ease the struggle buy leveling your character, traveling with a partner which will cost influnce or calling in favors like back up from a swat team or you can set up outpost to protect them more allowing them a better chance at survial on supply runs they will make.This game does have some glitches and bugs let me be clear I am by no means gonna say it doesnt this is not a perfect game by the hardware standpoint but for me none of them are game breaking or really upset me annoying yes and that is what I ment by that friend you want to strangle, but by no means are they bad enough for me to rage out and want to never play again. Not once did a bug hinder my ability to play the game or did it effect a mission for me up to this point.This game is a wonderful refreshing take on zombie survial and at the end of the day that is what this game is and survial game where you try your best to hold out as long as possible with what you can scavenge or with the people you meet its not all that spectacular in the terms of story but at the heart of it you have a real to earth hardcore zombie survial game and that is all it claims to be and it delivers with great gameplay and new take on the genre that I really enjoyed.

												I was skeptical at first what with all the horrible zombie games coming out lately, but this one is pretty great. I especially enjoy the base building and character development aspects. The DLC is also very much worth buying as it gives you an 'endless' game mode, which allows you to pack up and head to a totally new town when you've picked an area clean of resources and survivors.

												State of Decay: One of the greatest - if not THE greatest - single player zombie survival games.Here's a short summary:-Several NPCs, who you can eventually play as         -Various characters         -Short and sweet backstories-Zombie killing by hand, by gun, or by car. Blood everywhere.         -While driving, you can open your door as a 'door attack'. Hilarity and bloodsplatters.-Stealth kills and sneaking away from hoardes: intense-Loot all the things!-An abundance of missions in a fairly expansive world-Build-A-Base mechanic makes your survival a changeable experience-Don't die! Hardcore lives. You die, you can't come back. Only play as another character. The autosave feature enhances this, as you can't just go and select a save file. Be safe out there.The game, in my opinion, is fantastic. I've had so much fun in the short time I've played it, and it looks like I have a way to go.There are a few problems, though, but not any that ruin anything.-Small glitches in fighting, grounded zombie can suddenly stand up and attack you from behind-Some repitition (though wouldn't surviving like this be repetitive?)-Dialog repeating (can get annoying)-Very easy sometimes. The difficulty should be toggleable, as right now some 'hard'-type missions can be done easily.If you're on edge about getting this game, I nudge you towards buying it. This game is full of moments, which is something I look for. Sometimes you'll be barely sneaking back to your base through zombies, other times you'll be driving down the road in a rusted up pickup truck, opening your doors to whack a couple of hitchiking zombies. Absolutely marvelous as far as zombie games go.			"

												If you like offline survival zombie game, this game is perfect for you. The feeling of building a community, making allies and convincing people to join your shelter just make this game more realistic in a post apocaliptic world, as you also have to make sure your own people don't get depressed or turned into zombies if they get bitten.

												It has a lot of the good parts of DayZ without the difficulty of having to deal with other players. The way you manage your safe-house is well done, not too much micro. I've heard it compared to a single-player version of Left4Dead but that's not accurate at all. The map is extensive and the game is more about exploring and hoarding than it is about story. Speaking of story, just when it was getting a little bit tedious... the game ended. A little bit anti-climatic and predictable, but still good.The price was worth it at 20.			"

												State of Decay is the stand-out game of the Summer Sale so far.  It is an open world zombie game that does a lot of things right. In each expansion you control a community who is trying to survive the zombie apocalypse.  You are collecting supplies, upgrading your home, and trying to stay alive.  You control one character at a time but can switch freely between the other members of your community.  Easily worth the price of the Steam Sale.  The expansions are stand-alone scenarios so if you are wary about buying the game then you can just start with the base.  The only negative points I'd give it are for technical issues.  I was crashing semi-frequently but I was able to sort the issues out and hasn't happened much since.			"

												Great zombie survival game. I love how you can grow your survivor community and fortify your areas. When I first bought this game I played it non-stop through the story and then bought the expansion and have since kind of stopped playing as much. As fun as it is, it gets repititious after awhile and you begin to feel the shallowness of the characters. Don't get me wrong, I love the game, but I think it would be nice if the developer would add more of a backstory on the characters, more events and missions, and more safehouses/upgrade/fortification options as that is the best part of the game in my opinion.I kind of burnt myself out on this game for a bit but then started watching AMC's The Walking Dead and got back in the mood for it. It's a good simple game that you can pick up where you left off and play off and on as you wish.All in all I think SoD is worth $20. I just hope to see better expansions in the future. The current expansion, SoD- Breakdown, is just more of the same original game. Same locations, safehouses and zombies. Not worth the money.			"

												Surival horror with ressource gathering, base building and exploration - thats pretty much describe this game.There's some pretty cool features and new mechanics in this game, like sending people out to scavenge for materials, food or meds; improving your home base (or even set it up a new place); different traits in characters witch you can change between (provided that you have helped them so much that they trust you); trading and helping out other groups of survivors; zombies reactiong to sounds like gunshot, cars and even the noise you make going through a closet looking for items; and more.. There are clearly some new ideas here (for the most obvious, just never really done before in zombiegames) and for the most they are conducted good, so you really get the feeling that your choices influences the game. In the basebuilding there are some explanations to what impact the improvements will have to the game, but for most parts  you really just take a chance and hope for the best. There are some serious issues though, for the most related to basic controls, like viewpoint being a totally messed up in close quarters (and some times even in open spaces too..), small hills being impossible to climb some times, a very (to me at least) confusing menu and inventory that doesnt make much sense + a inventory system that doesnt allow you to do anything else but destroy items to make space if your bag is filled (not very locigal in a game, where ressource gathering are a constant theme!) but at the same time allowing you to put down and pick up your WHOLE bag (???)You get the feeling that most of the issues are due to a rush job, a month or 2 more polishing would definately had payed of.. It allso seems pretty strange to put out the first DLC only a few days after release, without attending to the technical problems but I gues thats just due to the business model of gamecompanies today (greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!)What it all comes down to though is gameplay and the game clearly delivers here. Its fun and engaging and even though many missions are the same thing over and over, just in new places, it never gets to be a dealbreaker. As said, some good new ideas and features that helps the gameplay in a positive way. Definately worth its price in entertainment.7/10(reviewed after 9½ hours gametime) "

												State of Decay is one of the best zombie related games I've played. It has a strong focus on the survival aspect of the zombie apocalypse, but also includes plenty of action. I actually felt like I was part of the Walking Dead TV show.You are in charge of a group of survivors, although you don't play as one specific character. When you find and rescue people, they will often join your community, eventually becoming your friend. You can take direct control of any friendly character at any time. This is essentially a ""lives"" system, because if you die, that character is permanently dead, but you can continue playing as someone else. Characters also become tired after performing a few missions, so you need to switch control to a fresh character while the other one rests.Each survivor can endure a lot of damage. I only lost two people to zombie attacks, and only one of those was when I was in direct control. As long as you're sensible with the number of zombies you take on, and keep your inventory well stocked with weapons, ammo and health, the difficulty is reasonable.Combat is quite basic. You can use melee or guns, and there are different types of both, but they don't really feel different to use. Gunshots will draw more zombies from the surrounding area, so you only use them as a last resort. Melee is simply a case of bashing zombies till they fall over, then using a finishing move to destroy the head. There are some special zombies, very similar to Left 4 Dead's hunter and tank, plus Killing Floor's bloat and siren, but only the tank is difficult to kill, due to its high health.As you fight zombies, your melee and gun skills will automatically level up giving you passive buffs, which means its best to focus on playing as a couple of survivors, and getting them levelled up high. But if you lose a high ranked character and have to start again with a newbie, its not as punishing as, for example, Xcom.You also need to manage your community's home base. You start in a church, but have the option to relocate to one of several larger sites. You can upgrade the sleeping area, kitchen, storage, workshop and more, to support a growing population.You then have to scavenge houses and other buildings in the large open world, for supplies such as food, medicine, ammo, fuel, weapons and construction materials. The larger your community, the more supplies you need. You can carry resources back to base yourself, summon friendlies to assist, or set up outposts, which gives you ownership of the building and its contents. Fortunately there are plenty of cars available to help you travel around the map quickly. They're also very useful for running over zombie hordes.There are plenty of missions involving interactions with other groups of survivors. The story is pretty good, although nothing you haven't seen before in the zombie genre. Dialogue is well written and fully voice acted. I finished in just under 12 hours, which is pretty good value for money. Controls work great with mouse and keyboard, and most commands are fully rebindable. You can save at any time but only have one save file per game, so you can't reload to undo a death.The main reason I waited until now to play was because every time I checked the forum there were lots of bug complaints. It would appear that most of the major problems have been patched now, because my experience was very stable. I didn't crash at all, and although some aspects are a little rough around the edges, there was nothing that spoiled my enjoyment. I didn't have any framerate issues on high settings but I did get the occasional brief stutter while driving, which I assume was loading in the next area. The most common problem I had was I sometimes saw zombies and NPCs clipping through a building's door texture when the door is open. But I can forgive that because the rest of the game is fantastic.I very strongly recommend State of Decay, and a full price purchase is absolutely worth it.			"

												Probably one of the best zombie type games I have played in a long time. Picture GTA with zombies but with more complex gameplay. Build up your homesite the way you want. Make sure you have a medical area and enough beds for everyone to sleep. Create a workshop for crafting and repairing. Upgrade it and find a mechanic survivor and he/she can work on cars for you. Want to turn your canned goods into a feast make sure you have a chef survivor. When this place gets too small move to another area with a bigger site to call home. Missions go on even while you are not playing.. your other survivors are always active. The current state of the beta is still very much playable. A little buggy at some points but there is no reason you cant fully enjoy it. Oh and I just found out that while you are playing as X survivor they do have the ability to die but the game goes on. You can switch and play as any of the survivors that have a high enough firend/trust relationship with you.			"

												If you like offline survival zombie game, this game is perfect for you. The feeling of building a community, making allies and convincing people to join your shelter just make this game more realistic in a post apocaliptic world, as you also have to make sure your own people don't get depressed or turned into zombies if they get bitten.

												Finally a zombie game that actually gets the point of zombies! It's not about shooting zombies - they're slow and stupid! No, it's all about the base - you know I'm right. You and your friends already know where your base is going to be if a Zombie Apocalypse happens - you've planned it in detail, worked out who you'd take, what to loot first.Yet Zombie games are all about wandering around on your own, shooting them. Until now. State of Decay places you in the midst of the Zombie Apocalypse and your onjective is primal - survive, by pulling together a team of other survivors with the skills you need, finding and modifying a base to fill your needs and keeping it supplied. To make this somewhat more difficult, you have zombies trying to eat you. You have your basic Ready Salted Zombie, slow, stupid, endlessly hungry and more than a little squishy, especially around the head. But just to make things a little more tricky, you have a cavalcade of Freaks - mutant zombies with different patterns of behaviour to normal. And they are NASTY.In any game about survival, it's important that however skilled you become, there is something that can kill you unless it screws up or you don't, and State of Decay provides these in a plethora of different ways. Zombies are attracted to noise, so fire your gun without a silencer, crash your car or have a companion who dies screaming and they will start homing in on you from miles away. The more zombies you're fighting, the louder things get and the more zombies come. The endless numbers can wear you down and as exhaustion takes its toll, the end is often close behind.If not through a steady trickle of reinforcements, you might instead fall afoul of a full-fledged zombie horde, wandering the streets looking for warm-blooded food. Your location might be surrounded by them and fall under siege and yes, you do get to board up the windows. It keeps you safe for a while, until some gigantic redneck farmchild too large to fit through the door punches it through, drags you out and tears you in two. Flee and you might be run down by a speeding deceased member of the armed forces or a SWAT team agent in full body-armour and helmet, or pounced on from out of the blue by the swift and deadly animalistic Ferals.Successfully combine your fighting and running and get clear and back to base? Don't worry, you'll probably still die from the Black Fever carried by bloated, ancient corpses in the mob - and by your companions, once they're exposed. Medicine is in short supply and medical know-how, even shorter - you either recover, or you die... and then come back for your friends.If all that's not enough, you have the armed forces up to dubious things in the area, a former judge attempting to enforce the rules of civilized society in a world where there isn't one, a redneck family one banjo short of Deliverance, a doomed love affair and a passel of mis-matched survivors steadily driving each other insane. Suicide, murder and run-aways are all risks you'll run, along with drug addiction from the amphetamines you're jamming down your throat and up your nose just to stay on your feet. Oh, and one of you might just be a serial killer. State of Decay gives a proper nod to all the tropes of the genre. I haven't found any chainsaws, which seems a grotesque oversight, but you can spot the zombies who've been chewed through the chest by a lawnmower a la ""Braindead"". Look closely enough at the magazine racks and grocery packaging and see the order to OBEY from ""They Live"", Hedge trimmers? Check. Oar? Yup. The faithful rusty pipe of Silent Hill? Aw hells, yeah. Can you knock a Zed's head off by opening the car door as you drive past it at speed? Of course!The base locations are also classics - a shipping warehouse, a posh walled manor, the local Church, a barricaded farmhouse out of town, an amusement park... all have their pros and cons and on the whole, are very well-balanced.The main weak point of the game is characterization, with little more than a few lines of insight into one motivation of some of the characters, which appears in a dialogue when the character is getting to know you. In a game where you're expected to lose a few characters and switch to playing others, a measure of emotional attachment would really add to the atmosphere. Game mechanics, however, provide a surrogate reason to get attached to characters - after all that time training their skills, the loss of a character can bring a chilling feeling of doom, especially if they were the only one in your band of survivors with an essential skill, and the moods of your fellow survivors crash drastically after any loss.While vanilla State of Decay's story mode is great fun, where it really comes into its own is with the Breakdown DLC. Breakdown sets the game to sandbox mode. You start with only your character (and Lily, your non-combatant radio operator) and build up a group and a base, accomplish certain objectives to unlock new characters or recruit other groups of survivors, play the level for as long as you wish, however you wish, then pick your six favourite characters, bundle them onto an RV with all your remaining gear and start the level again... only this time it's harder. And then you do it again, and again, and again. Your characters can become pretty experienced like this, but only if they survive. The ratio of difficulty to character skill is very well judged, so no matter how well you survived the last x levels and how godly your characters are, there is always a definite sense that you are in much more trouble this time... without it ever quite feeling impossible.The game has a few bugs, but they are mostly minor and don't crop up repeatedly, so they're not game breaking but you might lose a character or two to teleporting Freaks or your car suddenly flipping and exploding for no reason.If you're looking for a Zombie Apocalypse simulator, this is the one you've been waiting for while you plot your survival strategies in the pub with friends. Don't forget to buy Breakdown, because the story mode will have you aching for the sandbox during those moments when the plot is demanding your attention and you want to ransack just one... more.. cupboard.

												State of Decay is one of my favourite Zombies games of all times. The focus on this game is not just to kill zombies, but to survive. Undead Labs have made an incredible game where it fills out every little thing that makes a great zombie game. There are Frame Rate drops and bugs, but that evens out with the perfect playstyle and great atmosphere. If you're looking for more freedom for your game, try and buy the Breakdown DLC. It is definietly worth every Zombie gamers while.			"

Customize your survivors how you want, at least in terms of skills.

												If you like bashing some undead skulls in while exploring a huge dynamic enviroment keeping yourself and other playable surivivors safe at the same time, this is one helluva ride with vehicles for travel and even home bases to fortify against the onslaught, however depsite the great fun and action, like all other games, it has some annoying bugs but nothing game-breaking and the devs can hopefully smooth out later on. The camera motion takes some getting use to though. The dlc gives it great replay ability and even supports modding, which I personally would love to see more of from those amazing modders out there! :) If your a zombie-♥♥♥ kicker or just  like to take your time with their play-through then this is one to grab, just don't let the Zees grab you alone in the dark...

												Never played DayZ but i guess this is comparable to offline DayZ with base-building and character leveling.Zombies happened so you set up camp, get dudes and stuff and avoid dying. It does an interesting thing in that it sorta separates available resources into items your current character uses - stashed in a locker which dont get touched by npcs at all and ""community resources"" (food, ammo, meds). As long as you play you use the locker items (weapons, ammo, stamina/health items etc), when you log off the game does a simulation spanning a certain amount of time and when you relog stuff will have gone to ♥♥♥♥ or not depending on how well stocked you are on those community resources and the general state of the community when you left the game. Kind of an Animal Crossing thing but less mafia badgers and more gore.The currency you use to take stuff out of your own (makes sense kinda) aswell as other survior groups lockers which is also used for stuff like base building - called ""influence"" - is barter based in that putting stuff into lockers will earn you points but the bulk of it comes thru doing side missions. Its also modified by a trust value (e.g how much have you done for someone you wanna trade with), taking stuff from home is the cheapest, taking stuff from neighbors you did some missions for will be so-so and then taking all the bullets off some doomed bozo enclave you just found is most expensive.To find items you scavenge, community resources are again abit different in that you can take them home for a fixed one time amount (might not be that easy since theyre quite heavy) or you can set up an outpost in the building theyre in which generates a smaller quantity daily - in most cases preferable since those also serve as forward bases with their own locker and a safe-ish zone and also have a defensive function in that they blow up the especially large roaming zombie mobs the game generates regulary with traps. The common way to find new dudes is to build trust with an enclave until they wanna join you, hopefully before they inevitably are wiped out the next time you log in.As for home bases, when you eventually get storypushed from the beginner base you select from fixed sites. Once set up depending on the location theres fixed facilities and a varying amount of free space you can choose to build whatever on. Stuff like a watchtower, extra beds, infirmary, garden etc. Not having or having certain ones will impact the simulation aswell as actual gameplay. To label the most important ones, with no beds everybody will be ♥♥♥♥ tired reducing max stamina, and next time you log in without an infirmary somebody coulda died from the coughs and ingame healing will take longer.Apart from these technicalities, you level your current dude you run around with (youre not bound to a main character) in a variety of stats ranging from stamina to weapon skills - some have extra plus good ones enabling them to wrestle zombies Frank West style at high levels, some might be relatively useless in the field but have skills like cooking or mechanic which make them invaluable at base.One thing to bear in mind is that in order to give you something to do outside of the story missions the game essentially makes everybody but the character you currently play stupid (or more stupid ohoho). Productivity rests entirely on you, everybody else produces babysitting tasks like ""HALP im sitting in a barn lead me home"" or ""I saw this totally nonthreathening thing i could kill myself easily/extremely dangerous and normally best avoided thing lets kill it"" among others. All sidequests are on a timer but generally all but one will end up lethal for the involved if ignored. You can prioritize based on morale/influence needs aswell as trust gain with the npc which is important if you wanna play as them. Character skills seem to factor in somewhat so its likely that youll have to get the same lowbies out of ♥♥♥♥ over and over again - tempting to boot the worst offenders sometimes. Opposed to that are the rare calls from the combat veterans which almost autocomplete on arrival because theyre already standing on a pile of corpses. Thanks for calling me to watch, braggart.In conclusion to this huge wall of text, in terms of a zombie apocalypse survival sim this is prolly the best you can get at the moment (that i know of). If youre on the fence or got a backlog of other games i would hold off until the next patch (december 2013) or so since there are avoidable but pretty annoying bugs, otherwise go for it, good stuff.

												This is still one of my all time favourite zombie survivial games. Why? I hear you ask. To put it simply none of the other zombie survival games I have played quite give you the same apocalyptic atmosphere. In state of decay you really are outnumbered and are constantly surrounded by a feeling of impending doom. Survivors are thinly spread out so when you do come across them its a battle to keep everyone together. Death comes swiftly for the unwary and the zombies vary from slow to fast. They also pick up on any noise you make very easily making it truly scary if you accidently smash or hit something near a building full of the things. Rest assured they will waste no time pouring out and homing in on you. Fortunately there are vehicles dotted around which really can be life savers when you are cornered. Its not always possible to outrun a horde once you get spotted. You either have to try and find somewhere they can't reach or literally fight for your life. Also being in a vehicle just buys you time as the hordes in this game are more than capable of trashing your ride including ripping off doors! The map is fairly big with a ton of buildings to explore. Some just contain zombies while other may have useful gear, other survivors or can be turned into a base. The game does have a day / night cycle and believe me when I tell you its not a good idea to be lost in the woods just as darkness falls. You can hear the zombies but you can't see them. Terrifying stuff.Each survivor has their own story and personality. They won't sit around idle either and each day they will do something.The graphics aren't too bad but the controls and interface can be a bit of pain at times. The game does have flaws but they are minor and in no way break the game.I give this game 8/10 but only because of the minor faults. Perfection would have got it a 10.			"

												This is a fun game, especially for Zombie fans.  It starts out with a pretty unique atmosphere and interesting challenges.  The characters though are mostly not memorable except for their names.As you progress through the main story, you kill a lot of zombies.  I'm talking in the thousands!  For a small country town setting it doesnt make much sense.  Personally It got boring to me after a while.  After a little break before the final missions, I came back to it because it was interesting enough still just to see what happens in the end.I would have much rather seen a lower yet more dangerous Zombie population instead of the infinite amount literally all over the map. In the end though its fun and worth the money especially if on sale.  I recommend this for zombie fans and if you like open world games.7/10			"

												State of Decay, and it's accompanying DLCs make up the best zombie survival game I've ever played, bar none.  Does it have it's issues?  Of course it does, just like every other game in existance.  Little things you'd change if you were in charge.  However, with easily the friendliest, most helpful and involved player community I've ever encountered, you can get a mod to make just about any tweak you can imagine.  The game has all the elements you'd expect from the genre  - thrills and chills - action - scavenging -  a bit of base building - and plenty of those moments where you're left panting with a huge grin on your face asking yourself the question, ""Holy crap!  Did I really just survive that!?!""  Breakdown is basically a replay of the main game, without most of the story, but with increasingly difficult parameters.  You'd think doing the same thing over and over again would get boring.  It doesn't.  At least not for me.  I've got many hours logged on this game so far, and I've never even tried Lifeline yet, although I've owned it for months.  I'm still just so engaged with the Breakdown challange.  You can't beat the price on this game, and after playing it for a bit, I'm sure you'll feel, just as I did, that it's easily among the best bargains I've ever received through Steam.  You honestly can't go wrong with this game.			"

												After 3 hours I couldn't take it anymore.- The control is extremely sluggish- Voice acting & writing is some of the worst I have ever experienced.- Clipping issues allow zombies to walk through walls.- UI and menu system is a mess.The concept for the game is sound, unfortunately it is terribly executed.They apparently released a ""Year One"" edition for $30.  Maybe it's better.  However, I'm not paying $5, let alone $30 for what is essentially a large patch.			"

												I'm going to keep it short and sweet. The game has a lot of potential, but it just isn't for me. I'm limited in investment time, and considering how often you need to play this game in a short period time in order to advance or lose your progress, I cannot recommend it.It's a lot of fun, but the controls aren't super impressive, feel super clunky, and cause and lot of mi♥♥♥♥♥ when attempting actions. Feels like a console port that just didn't quite make it over, and now that they've released a ""Year One Edition"" and don't support this version, I'm pretty much done with State of Decay.			"

												There are so many zombie games and so many open-world games coming out these days that it can be disorienting.  This is a rare gem among zombie games in terms of its openness, realism, and immerion.  That's not saying much, though.  Most zombie games are either empty bloodbaths or are stiflingly linear rpg or puzzle games.  In this game violence comes in short, ultra-intense bursts and can easily be deadly if you aren't playing the right character for that particular situation.  And though I really wanted a sandbox game, the linearity in this game doesn't seem quite as opressive as in other zombie games, and the level of player choice in problem-solving and resource control technique is impressive.7/10I am dissapointed by the lack of multiplayer.Then again, if the devs took these mechanics and put them into a procedural sandbox mmo, my life would end.Edit: If you don't play for a few days you lose resources.  Having these mechanics in a non-online game is ridiculous.  I don't appreciate feeling pressured to play every day.  Almost enough for me to take back my recommendation.  Buyer beware!			"

												State of Decay, and it's accompanying DLCs make up the best zombie survival game I've ever played, bar none.  Does it have it's issues?  Of course it does, just like every other game in existance.  Little things you'd change if you were in charge.  However, with easily the friendliest, most helpful and involved player community I've ever encountered, you can get a mod to make just about any tweak you can imagine.  The game has all the elements you'd expect from the genre  - thrills and chills - action - scavenging -  a bit of base building - and plenty of those moments where you're left panting with a huge grin on your face asking yourself the question, ""Holy crap!  Did I really just survive that!?!""  Breakdown is basically a replay of the main game, without most of the story, but with increasingly difficult parameters.  You'd think doing the same thing over and over again would get boring.  It doesn't.  At least not for me.  I've got many hours logged on this game so far, and I've never even tried Lifeline yet, although I've owned it for months.  I'm still just so engaged with the Breakdown challange.  You can't beat the price on this game, and after playing it for a bit, I'm sure you'll feel, just as I did, that it's easily among the best bargains I've ever received through Steam.  You honestly can't go wrong with this game.			"

												This is a very good game with zombies added to it.  You could replace the zombies with wild animals and the game would play the same. You could slap it around and turn it into Rise of the Planet of the Apes: The Game and it would still be fun. Every system working in this game works well, and comes together in a fine stew. Character growth? Natural and instinctive, no arbitrary levels and XPEnvironment? No painted on walls and doors. You see structure, you enter structure, you hope you can loot structure.Combat? Melee feels right, aiming feels right, I've never had a bad fight that made me feel the game was to blame.Structure? I've lost three characters on my most recent game and it hurt, badly.  They were different, they had unique skills, voices, clothes, it didn't feel like loosing a grunt in XCOM, it felt like loosing a real character. You know how on game of thrones, you know people are going to die but it still hurts, even though its just a story? Yeah, that's how I feel.  Except its usually my fault in tihs game.			"

												SUMMARY: Its really fun and something no zombie and RPG fan should be without. I'm glad someone finally did a decent open-world zombie apocalypse RPG. (Red Dead Redemption's DLC doesnt count, although it was fun) However, the game seems a bit rough around the edges and unpolished. Ive encountered many minor-but-annoying graphical glitches such as clipping, pop-ins, twitching enemies, and weapons disappearing when wielded. I'm hoping that will be cleaned up in a patch or something. Overall, its a great game and I can see myself playing this one for hours.MAIN:Ok so where to start. This game is everything a single player zombie apocalypse RPG should be, although it is definitely not perfect. Ive been looking at it for a long time, but it was early access, and I generally don't buy e. a. games. I saw the e. a. tag was gone and it was extremely reduced for the summer sale, so I figured why the hell not.You start the game as a guy named Marcus on a fishing trip in the remote wilderness with his buddy, but later you get the option to play as others in your group of survivors. There are two aspects to this game, one is the open world run around doing random missions, story missions, collecting supplies and fighting zombies, the other (and what makes this game more than just an open world zombie-smash-fest) is managing your base's supplies and rooms and survivor's morale and trust. The base needs supplies such as food, ammo and medicine, which you can only get from raiding places. You can also build different areas inside your base, and upgrade them. Also, you can turn various outside areas into outposts which help you with the supplies, create safe zones, and set traps. Your survivors can go off on their own too, so you may have to rescue them. Random events happen, that can make survivors angry, or happy. The more stuff you bring back, the more you can ask for favors such as friends following you, radioing for certain supply caches, taking stuff out of the supply crate and so on (the mechanic in the game is your ""reputation points"").Personally, I think it sucks that even if you were the one who braved the zombie hordes to bring back gear, once you put it in the base's supply chest, it costs MORE rep points to pull it out then you earned putting it in. I understand why the devs did it from a gameplay standpoint, but it only makes me want to put items I am probably not going to need in there.Theres a LOT of stuff to do, just running around causes you to get random radio requests from your base. Things like clearing an infested house, helping a survivor (both strangers and ones in your group), hunting a dangerous type of zombie, raiding a certain building and many more. Helping people builds up trust, morale, and rep points, while ignoring requests for a certain amount of real-world time can fail the mission with negative consequences.Thats another interesting fact. The game is run off of a real world timer. So say a character gets ""hurt"" (worse than just injured, their health permanently goes down until they rest and heal) or tired (max stamina goes down), you have to take them back to base and let them rest. Also, the in-game clock and date is the first day you start. So say you started playing on June 9th. Your diary would start that day as well.The combat is simple to master and very fluid. It feels great to smash zombie heads with a lead pipe or other blunt object. There are various attacks you can do, as well as dodges(absolutely a must to master), finishing moves, and stealth kills. There is also many different types of firearms, with firing being relatively realistic. Not as much as a reality-based FPS army game, but more so then a typical 3rd person shooting game like GTA. The game also tries to be realistic with the sound of a shot drawing a crowd, so except for certain situations, sneaking up and bashing away seems a much better idea. The standard zombies are the running/jumping type for the most part, but generally go down easy as long as you arent swarmed. Not so for some of the rarer types, such as one bloated with poison gas and one that seems to act more like a werewolf.Sound is a major part of the game. As your character walks, a little blue circle surrounds him/her getting bigger or smaller the more or less noise you make. The zombies are attracted to sound, so things like banging around while searching, driving a car (always fun to plow through a horde) and shooting draw them. The zombies also make noise, and it is very important to make sure you dont walk up on one lurching around where you cant see it by listening for the sounds it makes.So, whats the bad points? Well. The graphics are glitchy as all hell for starters. Expect plently of pop-ins, clipping, disappearing weapons (even though your character still is rendered as if s/he is swinging away with it), enemies suddenly being on top of your car when you go to smash them and so on. The weirdest one I saw so far is a zombie laying down (some lay, then stand up and go after you when you alert them). I walked up and was about 5 feet away, and instead of getting to his feet, the zombie model laying on the ground did a jittery complete horizontal 360, and then suddenly disappeared, then popped-in standing and right in my character's face, where he bit me. Fun.Another is it doesnt seem to be optimized very well. It jacks my core temp up by 20c or so no matter what graphics setting its on. And its not pushing my gpu/cpu very hard at all. Its not a big deal, though, just smacks of a rushed finish.But even though its a bit glitchy and has rough edges, its still fun as hell. Anyone whose an RPG and zombie apocalypse fan should check this out.			"

Not even quitting the game before saving when you die will bring back a dead 'un, you just end up playing as another character in your community.Each character has unique emotions and can display fear and depression and anger.There are aload of missions to do and places to explore.Like every zombie game there's the normal dopey, ""eat yo brainnnns"" and then other ""Freak"" zombies.One Freak zombie is like the jockey from L4D2 and one is a giant fat f**ker.The map is so vast and the characters all so different.

												The way the tutorials during the game's opening hours lull you into a false sense of security while glossing over crucial gameplay mechanics is kind of a wonderful parralel to suddenly having to survive in a collapsed society and/or a Stanley Parable type commentary on gamers doing whatever you tell them to even when it makes no sense (I took my survivor out completely unarmed because a box popped up saying 'GO HERE!', with results that would be predictable in any situation other than the tutorial-heavy opening hour of a commercial videogame in the year 2014).Game's pretty good too! Way more management and procedural sandbox craziness in there than you'd initially expect. There are some rough edges like WHY WON'T MY CHARACTER JUST LIE DOWN AND SLEEP IN THIS BED INSTEAD OF STANDING THERE COMPLAINING HE'S TIRED (I have no idea, but exiting the game and then reopening it works) but with this much freedom and stuff to do it's definitely worth putting up with.

												Game gives me mixed feelings. It's a good concept with poor execution.Things happen way, way, way too fast in the game for having it simulate itself when you're not playing. The survivors you rescue are basically like children and randomly wander off and get lost and die. Okay, I can buy getting sick. But these idiots deliberately seek out dangerous zombies on the auspices of making things ""safer"" It's no wonder people quit and come back and half their home place's population is gone. It's far less about foraging than about babysitting because of this and it's a real shame because it makes it feel more like grinding than survival.It's not particularly a bad game but it's not something I would recommend to my friends or anyone with a full-time job for that matter. It just needs to be fleshed out a lot more.			"

												State of Decay is thrilling. You're dropped into a zombie infestation and forced to manage your resources and survivors. There are various missions that pop up alongside to main story and if you ignore them your survivors can get injured or die. The zombies are easy enough to deal with, but if you're out on your own and you make too much noise you can find yourself being swarmed by all sides. A few lucky grapples by the zombies can leave you in an undead dogpile, slowly being torn to shreds. Once a character is dead it is gone forever.There have been times where I find myself surrounded and being beat down, and after barely knocking them off I stumble towards a car out o breath, zombies running after me and trying to grab me. One bite away from death I get into the car and drive off with several zombies hanging on banging at the doors. I can't remember the last time a game has made my heart race so much. There is so much character development and macro management in this game that you really feel like you're ""surviving"" rather than adventuring.Now for the flaws. The game is riddled with bugs. It's annoying to be heading into a dangerous area only to have your partner teleport back to base for an ""Angry resident"" mission. The zombies often clip through walls and into the floor. Sounds don't always play and cars can get damaged on invisible bumps. But none of the bugs are really gamebreaking and they're easy to shrug off. The resource management part of the game is too simple. There's supposed to be some sort of resource usage where some of your food/ammo/medicine are used up each day, but it seems like I'm always at max resources and the only thing I ever NEED to gather is building supplies for more upgrades at base. Because of this there's always more than enough time to do every side mission and there's no sense of urgency in the game.A few minor tweaks could make the game so much more difficult and so much more exciting. Side missions should force you to choose between saving a survivor or gathering necessary resources (think XCOM). Outposts should require a person there to be useful (instead of giving resources and killing zombies as an autonomous house), making you trade labor for safety. Resources should decay faster so you actually have to spend time scavenging inbetween or during missions. There are a limited amount of resources on the map but I haven't even come close to depleting them all. Before I moved my base to a new town I still had unsearched houses a two minute walk away.Overall the mechanics of the game are solid. THe game is enjoyable and exciting. With a few tweaks to make it harder could make it a game of the year. If you're thinking about buying it, buy it. If you'e not, buy it anyway.			"

												So, so disappointed. I was very excited about this game; I don't have a lot of money for games and usually only buy them on offer, sub-£5, but I couldn't wait for this game and all the hype I read sounded great.So I bought it full price and played it through. Whilst I can't deny having some enjoyable times - I was a fan of the way the game seemed to persist when you weren't playing, making a base was enjoyable and some of the missions were fun - I was overall very disappointed and felt kind of cheated by the critic reviews and the game developers. The game was just too easy; it felt as though there were no real challenges and that the game was designed so that everyone could finish it without too much trouble. I don't feel as though I am some elitist gamer; I'm happy that the game can be accessed and enjoyed by players of all skill levels but there really is no reason in the world why a game developer should choose not to include a difficulty setting in the game menu.. unless of course they were selling an expansion pack shortly after release which would advertise 'increased difficulty' as one of its selling points. I haven't bought the expansion pack out of principle and I stopped playing the game shortly after completion, which really does not take very long at all. I delayed finishing the game until I had completed all the side missions but the main story finishes very quickly - another selling point for the expansion. This feels like a rant, but one of the aspects of reviews which made me most interested was the idea of character permadeath. This turned out to be a huge exaggeration and I didn't lose a single character that wasn't scripted (one). To be fair, I was being careful at first, but before long I was wading into hordes with a golf club and coming out unfazed. There really seemed little need for stealth, which took away much of the gravity and tension of the game.Aside from that rant, another criticism of the game was the zombies themselves - it felt as though effort had been made to aim the game at a younger audience with cartoony zombies with glowing green eyes. In all, maybe buy it on offer but don't pay more than a fiver for it. Don't expect much and you might have a bit of fun.Tl;dr: can be fun but purposely designed way too short and way too easy, with no option to adjust difficulty. Also cartoon zombies. "

This game has everything. Guns, zombies, gore, guns, zombies, and survival. This game really hits the bullseye when it comes to survival instinct, since it's solely based on gathering materials in order for the group to survive. The graphics in this game are a definite step up from the XBLA version, with resolutions up to 1080p ultra, this game sure packs a punch. Get it.			"

												I don't generally care for zombie games, but this one is a real gem.You control a group of survivors of a zombie apocalypse, and are free to wander the (fairly large) map, killing zombies, looting building, setting up outposts, interacting with other survivors, etc. The kicker being that most resources are finite. Once you loot a building, it'll stay empty forever. When your trusty melee weapon wears down, it'll permanently break. And once a member of your group dies, he or she will stay dead. No going back: the game autosaves, and it keeps only the last one. While never being particularly hard, the game very effectively makes you feel that you are in a bad situation that can only get worse in the long run.To me, this game feels like a cross between Mount & Blade and The Walking Dead. If that sounds like a good thing to you, then definitely check it out!			"

												This is a very good game with zombies added to it.  You could replace the zombies with wild animals and the game would play the same. You could slap it around and turn it into Rise of the Planet of the Apes: The Game and it would still be fun. Every system working in this game works well, and comes together in a fine stew. Character growth? Natural and instinctive, no arbitrary levels and XPEnvironment? No painted on walls and doors. You see structure, you enter structure, you hope you can loot structure.Combat? Melee feels right, aiming feels right, I've never had a bad fight that made me feel the game was to blame.Structure? I've lost three characters on my most recent game and it hurt, badly.  They were different, they had unique skills, voices, clothes, it didn't feel like loosing a grunt in XCOM, it felt like loosing a real character. You know how on game of thrones, you know people are going to die but it still hurts, even though its just a story? Yeah, that's how I feel.  Except its usually my fault in tihs game.			"

												I bought this game for 5 dollars during a steam sale, and bought all the dlc almost immediately after. This game is amazing at what it does; it's a zombie survival game, where scavenging and leveling up your character are the most important things you can do.I'll say this much, however; the game is poorly optimized (though not watch_dogs level, it still screams of poor coding) and it's hard to maintain a constant 60. The graphics options are lazy, and there's little more than draw distance that changes with the settings. The game is really awkward and clunky sometimes as well, especially in fine mouse control when shooting. You may actually want to plug in your controller for this one.All in all, I say buy it, and play it, especially if it goes on sale again. It's not worth 20 dollars when there are so many other games out there that offer similar ideas, but it's worth 15 with all the DLC included.I give this a solid 7/10, and wish they would bring a sequel.

												""Do you recommend this game?""Oh  sweet zombie Lordy, of course I do!Your're in a zombie apocolypse.The graphics are savage, you can enter almost every building in the game, you can use any car you see and you build skills and make a small community during a zombie apocolapyse.State of Decay is about survival.If you die in the game, you ARE dead, there's no coming back! Not even quitting the game before saving when you die will bring back a dead 'un, you just end up playing as another character in your community.Each character has unique emotions and can display fear and depression and anger.There are aload of missions to do and places to explore.Like every zombie game there's the normal dopey, ""eat yo brainnnns"" and then other ""Freak"" zombies.One Freak zombie is like the jockey from L4D2 and one is a giant fat f**ker.The map is so vast and the characters all so different. You begin to care for your character and will enjoy the satyisfying sound effects of brains being smashed in.Fair price for such a great game,.  "

												Really interesting and well-done survival game. Just enough difficulty, a lot of things to consider while planning your survival. You really get into it fast and once you're in it, you can play for hours. Gameplay: Quite nice, you have to watch your stamina bar, pay attention to zombie hordes, and your fellow survivors. Just one thing: Your car will do flips. And you'll get stuck on little rocks. Driving sucks. The fact that each of your character can be diferent and have diferent skills or personnality is really interesting: you could have a cop who is trained in firearms and cardio, but you also can have an asmathic geek. And also, you can die. Like, definitly. Your move, player.  9/10Graphics: Well, it's far from being the most beautiful game I've ever played, but it's not bad at all. Weather effects are cool, landscapes are cool, and they match the ambiance of the game. 8/10Ambiance: Let's be honest: this is the best. You're truly into the game, because the ambiant suspense and stressing is well-made. You're constantly afraid of hordes or big zombies. Death is permanent, so you don't want to rush your way through hordes of Zeds. Relationship with other survivors is also really important and bring even more immersion. Everything is working together. 10/10Sound effects: MEEEH. Weapons sounds kinda bad, and running too, and driving too, and... This is really far from perfect. It's not horrible, but the sound my rifle made the first I fired it... *sigh* 5/10""Lastability"": Nearly infinite. It depends on you. If you play well, you can survive for really long time, and play again to start over with other choices, other survivors, etc... 9.5/10Enjoyment: Dit I enjoyed playing State of Decay? Well my answer will be short: HELL YES. This game is really enjoyable and you can have loads and loads of fun playing it. Believe me. Even if you'll be stressed, anxious, angry sometimes when you'll die, you'll enjoy it. Because this game is really COOL. 9.5/10FINAL NOTE: This game is really awesome. Even if a lot of bugs are really annoying, and driving is really bad, you'll enjoy playing State of Decay, you'll enjoy the frustration of loosing your character forever because you falled from a cliff. The ambiance is so damn perfect that you'll get on the ""survival mood"". You can't do otherwise. Just get along with it. TOTAL: 85/100: REALLY GOOD [/b] "

												I have waited for this game since I first found out about it in 2012. I bought it with it's release June 2013 for XBLA, and instantly  bought it when it came out for PC. This game has everything. Guns, zombies, gore, guns, zombies, and survival. This game really hits the bullseye when it comes to survival instinct, since it's solely based on gathering materials in order for the group to survive. The graphics in this game are a definite step up from the XBLA version, with resolutions up to 1080p ultra, this game sure packs a punch. Get it.			"

												Buy this game if you like killing zombies, dynamic open world environments, don't mind sub-par graphics, and enjoy resource management.The game starts off shoddy and pretty awkward. I quit the game after 25 minutes, but after a few days I picked it out of my steam library to give it another shot. I don't regret that in the slightest.There is no main character really. You're going to be swapping through characters very often. There is a story and a plot but it's somehwat minor. It doesn't tell the details from just one characters perspective, and many dynamic set of characters cause the game to focus on the plot of other people around you, such as the various factions you can help or hinder, rather than the set of characters that you can have on your team.You might dislike the same voice acting from several characters, but their lines were voiced very well and it didn't bother me. The cast seems to have a unique design for the set of characters save for the voice acting.If Microsoft invested a bit more money to give it more polish, it could have recieved universal acclaim.

												This game mixes part zombie horror/survival with some city building and people management.  The game starts with you taking control of a couple guys coming back from a remote fishing trip to find out that the area they are in is now in the middle of a zombie outbreak.  You meet up with other survivors and try to get enough supplies and weapons to survive long enough to..... well I'm not sure to what end cause I'm pretty sure I screwed up somehow and wasn't sure what happened but I got to the end game screen.I recommend this game because it was fun to play.  I've played it on both Console and PC and both times the game was enjoyable.  That being said there was some design decisions that made sense for the game I guess, but just didn't sit well with me.  Slight SPOILERS ahead I guess.The game is constantly forcing you to do things, there is never seems to be a break.  There is always someone in trouble getting supplies, or someone missing or someone who wants to take out a zombie infestation.  While you are doing those misssions there are also story missions that are happening and this game doesn't care what else you are doing, if you don't show up for that story mission someone is gonna die and that part of the storyline is gone.  The problem with all these side/main quests happening ALL the time is it doesn't just let you explore the game.  The map is a pretty decent size with some neat areas to find and explore.  The problem is that you don't want to be on the northwest corner of the map when a story mission suddenly pops up on the southeast corner.  Maybe I just failed at seeing the options to tell the people in my little fortification to just sit there and don't leave but it was annoying to have these quests pop up all the time.  Made the game probably a little more of a realistic zombie game but from a guy who likes exploring, the way these  side quests worked just didn't work for me.I did really enjoy the way the inventory worked in this game, it was really well done.  You can get different sizes of backpack, though you'll pretty well get the biggest size pretty quickly and that is usually enough to get the job done.  You also get the trunk of the vehilce that you're driving (if you use a vehicle to get around).  In addition you can carry one bag of supplies (again the trunk of the vehicle can store multiple bags).  Anything that you find can be stored into the community inventory which gives you influence points (instead of using money), so you can trade things you find for other things in the community inventory(either things that were there originally or things that other survivors have made).  Finishing various side quests or main quests will also give you points to get additional items out of the inventory.  If you get the big bag and use the vehicles trunks/box efficiently you'll have enough points for pretty well anything you'll ever need.The Zombies were pretty standard zombies, they moved at about the same pace as your characters but could be out run with sprinting, however you can only sprint for a limited amount of time.  There are also several different types of zombies in addition to the average ones ranging from super large/strong to super fast/aggresive and more.  But none of them felt over powering or cheesy in some way.  The fit the game really well.  As well they reacted decently to your actions for the most part.  Driving, sprinting or shooting would all draw in zombies from surrounding areas, pretty standard zombie logic.You can play as a variety of characters from your base and level each one of them up.  Each character is not exactly unique, they have some individual traits but are pretty interchangable.  The amount of playable characters is decent as each of your characters may become tired/hungry/sick if they've done a lot of exploring or fighting and adds a bit of realisim to the game.  You can either choose to use items to recharge them or switch out characters to let them rest.  Only problem again with this is relating back to the questing point.  One of the characters you use might decide to go off questing while you are playing as another character and then they won't recharge as well.The one thing I found lacking is that the story is pretty forgetable.  There are some choices in there that will affect your game and the story but for the most part it's pretty standard zombie game.  Survive for a while and then get the heck out of there.Controls are decent enough, Camera can be a little stupid at times but for the most part never really bothered me.			"

												Based on Early Access build 24/10.  This is a singleplayer storydriven zombie survival game.  It is a good, fun, if sometimes flawed and frustrating game.  If you want to play something akin Walking Dead in a early Resident Evil/Tombraider console style then get this.  However be warned that its far from a polished game.  Some mechanics will have you scratching your head and the graphics are of console quality.  Probably the worst aspect is the story based missions that force you to attempt missions even if you arent ready for them.  Combat is can also be unrewarding and repetitive.Best bits are the party and base management.  Driving cars into hordes and exploration is fun, while searching & finding loot is the most rewarding aspect of the game.  Probably better than killing the zeds.  In addition to searching buildings and loot equipment and weapons, you can establish outposts and setup bases which can be upgraded which adds to the immersion.There is some character customization and they can level in certain perks so that keeps things interesting.  Voice acting and music is also good and the dialogue exchanged between party members is well done.Replayability is fair through the use of randomized minor missions and party/base events that affect key resources such as food, medicine, ammo, materials, fuel and morale and influence which allow you to do things such as take out different equipment and people.  Of which there are loads of.After my initial reservations Id say this could be a fantastic game in time, esp. if the devs tackle the console-y stuff that remains: poor control system (for PC), inferior graphics and resolution and pace the story missions a little better.All in all not my dream game... but not far off.

												Another Zombie game? Yes, one of the BEST zombie games that has ever been crafted.State of Decay kind of reminds me of what Fort Zombie was aiming to be... but didn't quite get there.This game will have you playing for so many hours, you'll be wondering where the daylight went every single time you wake up and go on your computer to play this.This game has base management, character development, skills, levelling up, driving, shooting, melee fighting, zombies, special zombies, walking zombies, running zombies, fat zombies, exploding zombies, different bases to live in, item management, resource management and MORE.When you first start the game up you'll find yourself wondering what is going on, but after a very brief tutorial you'll understand what happened to the land and you can now play however you wish to play.You'll start in your first (or only if you want) base where you'll need to scavenge supplies such as food, medicine, materials, fuel and ammo from nearby locations such as houses, businesses, farms, factories, ruins etc. The game has permanent death, so if your character dies, he's gone forever, no reloading of saves will bring him back. But you can play as other NPC's in your base, so all is not lost, you can continue playing, just you'll have lost a character you may have put a lot of time into training.All bases consume resources, you'll find that in the menu how much it uses a day and it's up to you to make sure you have enough. If you don't have enough resources or the right facilities in your base then people will start to get sick, die or leave.You can upgrade bases by adding facilities to them such as a shooting platform to keep the place safe, more beds to invite more people to join you and all sorts of other facilties. Certain facilities offer a variety of services, such as storage for more resources to be stored there, Munitions shops to build better and more fun weapons, Farms to grow food and machine shops to repair your cars.Because cars can be damaged and they do explode when they catch fire. You need to correct facilities to repair them and cars don't grow on trees, if you blow them all up, you'll have no cars to use and will have to go on foot everywhere.There's a stealth system in the game too, you can sneak around and kill zombies without being detected, it's a very handy skill to master. Noise is VERY important in this game, be too loud and you'll attract every zombie in the area, fire a gun without a surpressor and you'll also attract them all to you.Sometimes hordes appear and if you attract the attention of just one zombie in the horde, all of them will come after you, so always approach them with caution or avoid them completely.The combat system in this game is very fleshed out, a variety of weapons can also be mastered such as blunt (bats, hammers etc), edged (knives, swords etc) and heavy (microphone stands! sledgehammers etc) and even guns such as rifles, pistols, revolvers, smg's and more. You can do so much in this game.There's also an awesome DLC called Breakdown which expands greatly on the original game and instead of the game just ending when you get across the final bridge to escape like it does in the main game, you can play sandbox mode, where the resources are randomly generated and you can play as long as you like, however you like, no main quest missions or anything like that.I really recommend this game because this is how a zombie survival game SHOULD BE!Zombie game developers take note from this game, you could learn a thing or two about making a fantastic zombie game that people want.The only downsides to this game is that it's single player only, it's designed in a way that makes it look like it should be co-op or multiplayer, but it never came and will never be added. So get the sequel when it comes out if you want to play online. Another downside would be that the options aren't very fleshed out, mostly because this is a port from an xbox 360 game, so your favourite video resolution may not be supported or if the game runs bad on medium but plays fine but looks bad on low graphics then you'll have to look online for workarounds to that.Anyway, I recommend the game, I give it 9/10 because it really is a fantastic zombie survival game, even if it can make you angry when your favourite character is ""unfairly"" killed by a zombie (mostly because you weren't prepared for that one horde or big fat zombie).Get it, get it now and have fun! You'll enjoy it!			"

They also bait their customers in with promises that they will release bigger better products (See online State of Decay) but they never come to realization. They have stopped selling this title and are trying to get you to purchase the ""remastered"" edition. Undead Labs recently put out an early access title that was a pokemon clone of sorts, it had a lot of backing and the CEO basically said it wouldn be profitable enough and they bailed on it. Star far away from Undead Labs. Shame too, this game could have been better.			"

												Based on Early Access build 24/10.  This is a singleplayer storydriven zombie survival game.  It is a good, fun, if sometimes flawed and frustrating game.  If you want to play something akin Walking Dead in a early Resident Evil/Tombraider console style then get this.  However be warned that its far from a polished game.  Some mechanics will have you scratching your head and the graphics are of console quality.  Probably the worst aspect is the story based missions that force you to attempt missions even if you arent ready for them.  Combat is can also be unrewarding and repetitive.Best bits are the party and base management.  Driving cars into hordes and exploration is fun, while searching & finding loot is the most rewarding aspect of the game.  Probably better than killing the zeds.  In addition to searching buildings and loot equipment and weapons, you can establish outposts and setup bases which can be upgraded which adds to the immersion.There is some character customization and they can level in certain perks so that keeps things interesting.  Voice acting and music is also good and the dialogue exchanged between party members is well done.Replayability is fair through the use of randomized minor missions and party/base events that affect key resources such as food, medicine, ammo, materials, fuel and morale and influence which allow you to do things such as take out different equipment and people.  Of which there are loads of.After my initial reservations Id say this could be a fantastic game in time, esp. if the devs tackle the console-y stuff that remains: poor control system (for PC), inferior graphics and resolution and pace the story missions a little better.All in all not my dream game... but not far off.

												Another Zombie game? Yes, one of the BEST zombie games that has ever been crafted.State of Decay kind of reminds me of what Fort Zombie was aiming to be... but didn't quite get there.This game will have you playing for so many hours, you'll be wondering where the daylight went every single time you wake up and go on your computer to play this.This game has base management, character development, skills, levelling up, driving, shooting, melee fighting, zombies, special zombies, walking zombies, running zombies, fat zombies, exploding zombies, different bases to live in, item management, resource management and MORE.When you first start the game up you'll find yourself wondering what is going on, but after a very brief tutorial you'll understand what happened to the land and you can now play however you wish to play.You'll start in your first (or only if you want) base where you'll need to scavenge supplies such as food, medicine, materials, fuel and ammo from nearby locations such as houses, businesses, farms, factories, ruins etc. The game has permanent death, so if your character dies, he's gone forever, no reloading of saves will bring him back. But you can play as other NPC's in your base, so all is not lost, you can continue playing, just you'll have lost a character you may have put a lot of time into training.All bases consume resources, you'll find that in the menu how much it uses a day and it's up to you to make sure you have enough. If you don't have enough resources or the right facilities in your base then people will start to get sick, die or leave.You can upgrade bases by adding facilities to them such as a shooting platform to keep the place safe, more beds to invite more people to join you and all sorts of other facilties. Certain facilities offer a variety of services, such as storage for more resources to be stored there, Munitions shops to build better and more fun weapons, Farms to grow food and machine shops to repair your cars.Because cars can be damaged and they do explode when they catch fire. You need to correct facilities to repair them and cars don't grow on trees, if you blow them all up, you'll have no cars to use and will have to go on foot everywhere.There's a stealth system in the game too, you can sneak around and kill zombies without being detected, it's a very handy skill to master. Noise is VERY important in this game, be too loud and you'll attract every zombie in the area, fire a gun without a surpressor and you'll also attract them all to you.Sometimes hordes appear and if you attract the attention of just one zombie in the horde, all of them will come after you, so always approach them with caution or avoid them completely.The combat system in this game is very fleshed out, a variety of weapons can also be mastered such as blunt (bats, hammers etc), edged (knives, swords etc) and heavy (microphone stands! sledgehammers etc) and even guns such as rifles, pistols, revolvers, smg's and more. You can do so much in this game.There's also an awesome DLC called Breakdown which expands greatly on the original game and instead of the game just ending when you get across the final bridge to escape like it does in the main game, you can play sandbox mode, where the resources are randomly generated and you can play as long as you like, however you like, no main quest missions or anything like that.I really recommend this game because this is how a zombie survival game SHOULD BE!Zombie game developers take note from this game, you could learn a thing or two about making a fantastic zombie game that people want.The only downsides to this game is that it's single player only, it's designed in a way that makes it look like it should be co-op or multiplayer, but it never came and will never be added. So get the sequel when it comes out if you want to play online. Another downside would be that the options aren't very fleshed out, mostly because this is a port from an xbox 360 game, so your favourite video resolution may not be supported or if the game runs bad on medium but plays fine but looks bad on low graphics then you'll have to look online for workarounds to that.Anyway, I recommend the game, I give it 9/10 because it really is a fantastic zombie survival game, even if it can make you angry when your favourite character is ""unfairly"" killed by a zombie (mostly because you weren't prepared for that one horde or big fat zombie).Get it, get it now and have fun! You'll enjoy it!			"

												State of Decay is, without doubt, the ultimate zombie experience. You start the game with a pair of survivors and you get more as you advance through the game. You can switch between them with ease and at will, there's no main character here. There's also permadeath, so whenever a survivor falls to the zombie hordes you keep playing... as one of the other survivors, therefore losing the game whenever your whole group gets eradicated.Then, there's the resource factor: you need to gather food, ammo, construction materials, medicine and fuel in order to keep your base up and running - yes, you have a base, and you can settle in other places if you feel like those might turn out better - , so you spend a lot of time doing scavenging and looting all over Trumbull County: houses, drugstores, grocery stores, mini marts, offices, warehouses, factories and so on and so forth, are all ripe for the looting. Aside from the aforementioned resources you obviously get also some handy items, such as weapons, medicine for yourself, food to recover stamina and some other miscellaneous items, such as cooking clocks and fireworks, to attract zombies to some location. I would like to add that all of these, both resources and items, are FINITE. So you would do well in progressing through the storyline every now and then.True to the game's spirit, vehicles are, while not in short supply, not infinite. That alone is an extra incentive to get your smoldering vehicle to your base, so as to give it some needed repairs.Finally, the only downside to the game is that the game world keeps going on even when you are not playing. So it may be that if you don't check on your survivors every now and then you may find upon returning that some have left the base due to lack of resources, while others might be in a hurry, being ovverrun by zombies... and others downright dead. Therefore, my advice is for you to check on the game on a daily basis until you accomplish whatever goal you have in mind, be it the storyline or some other.On the technical side, graphics are alright, but the framerate is not what you'd expect. Getting the game on Ultra settings takes its toll on my rig when I'm in the city, and I have a GeForce 660 GTX, which runs Battlefield 4 as smooth as silk on high. Voice acting and sound is downright lacklustre. The AI is OK, both for other survivors and zombies. They may bump into minor obstacles every now and then and may show some inconsistencies when in a fight, but nothing big here.All in all, this is a 8.5 for me, it's deeply immersive and a must buy for any zombie and sandbox games lovers out there. The only cons I can think of is the 'still running when you are not playing-world' and the framerate.REVIEW UPDATE:Having played both Breakdown and Lifeline, and especially that god-sent update that lets you store stuff in the boot of your car, I must say this game has improved, and by that I mean a LOT: while Breakdown does not offer much in terms of replayability, being essentially the same wave after wave, Lifeline does truly revamp the experience.  It is an absolutely different take on the State of Decay formula, where scavenging and lone survival make way for relentless zombie action on a scale you've never seen or fathomed, as you fend off wave after wave of Ferals and Juggernauts using a vast array of military-grade equipment, such as state of the art weaponry, drone strikes, air strikes and whatnot. Also, while I cannot confirm this, I do believe that Lifeline does not keep going while you're not playing, as vanilla did, which is an excellent change. Only qualms I may have with Lifeline is not being to explore the more urban part of the city depicted.With the addition of the fabulous Lifeline DLC - and even Breakdown is kinda enjoyable for a while - and the car storage, I would safely give the game a 9/10. Zombie games just don't get any better than this.			"

												How do you imagine the perfect zombie apocalypse game? For me it's storyline from The Last of Us, characters and dialogues from Telltale's The Walking Dead, weapon crafting and time expiring events from Dead Rising, many side quests from Dead Island (ignore the one where the drunk guy asks you for alcohol), the real survival from Project Zomboid, horror mood from Resident Evil, open world from most of them and the multiplayer combining the best from Left 4 Dead and DayZ.State of Decay ads to that managing your own base and group of survivors. Game draws you in its world very quickly and is very addictive. There is always something more to do in it. But it lacks a good story and multiplayer. I can stand no multiplayer in it, but the good plot? Not so easy.What i mean is not that the game has no storyline at all. It has, but after a few missions the story of your survivor crew breaks off and you have to witness boring stories of army and some other groups. Most of people that joins your crew is generated randomly. They have no personality so it is hard to become acquainted with them. Death in State of Decay is permanent and hurts very bad, but it would hurt even more if you would knew these people.State of Decay is not an ultimate zombie survival game but it's really, really close. So i recommend it to all of you looking for a good zombie apocalypse game. Developers - Undead Labs have a name that obliges and they are already making their new game so I keep my fingers crossed.

												I played through the single-player campaign and found the game to be a pretty enjoyable experience overall, even if whoever decided to not make constant zombie spawns toggleable (or to make ""persistent world continues even when you are not playing"" toggleable) obviously did not realize how much more versatile a game it could have been for less-skilled action gamers if those were included.  The fighting is usually pretty fun, the base management is simple enough to be enjoyable without overly hindering the rest of the game, scavenging runs feel useful, the vehicles are lots of fun to use--overall, lots of little fun elements working together as a cohesive whole.Interestingly, while I played and LOVED ""Lifeline"" (possibly because I am apparently so much better with guns than with melee that I found it surprisingly easy), I think ""Breakdown"" is about the least compelling possible version of this game, as there is no longer an actual end goal.  With ""Breakdown"" the game feels more like you are playing a 1980s arcade game to get the highest score, and, well, I think we have moved beyond that as a gaming goal by now, surely?  Ha.  But obviously plenty of people love it, as it sounds like the most fun version of the game for many.  But ""run around the base game map and do all the same stuff as the base game, and your reward in the end is to do it all over again on a harder map until you die and lose your save"" does not exactly sound appealing to me.BUT!  This is still a -spectacular- zombie game, and a pretty great game by any standards.			"

												This game is brilliant and addicting, but whatever you do, don't die. Once your character is dead you won't get it back unless you start a new game. As such, if a Juggernaut gets a hold of you, just exit out of the game, unless it was your goal to get ripped in half and get ♥♥♥♥ed. Best to just go back to the start of the mission than lose your character. In any case, brilliant game, great time, and completely worth the hours lost in the abyss to this beauty.			"

I went to check if any updates have been made, and they've completely removed this game from the Steam store, and replaced it with a ""Remastered"" version. And of course Steam won't give me a refund for this THEFT because it's more than two weeks old.I will never touch another game from this developer, EVER.(Previous review below.)The game is promising, but was nothing like I was expecting when I bought it.  The biggest issues I have are related to game mechanics that waste the player's time:If you have to quit the game in the middle of a mission, when you reload your save you will end up back at your base.  For missions with a time limit, this likely means you will fail because A) you can't get back out to the location and finish it before time is up, and B) something else will come up to prevent you from getting back out there, like another damn horde attack as soon as you load your game.Good luck taking care of a horde attack early in the game.  Gunfire just attracts MORE zombies, and melee weapons break too fast to do much good.  Zombies scale walls instantly even if barbed wire is on top, and barriers on doors and windows DISAPPEAR after an attack.  This makes reinforcement useless and stupid.			"

												State of Decay offers a fun GTA-zombie style of gameplay, yet it feels incomplete. The AI is straight up dumb. Zombies will run around houses to crawl in windows if you open a door in front of them, your teamates only seem to be competent at getting left behind or wacking a zombie a few times, but only a good time after you start attacking or they get attacked. It lacks many features I would expect, and has many small annoyances, such as the lack of team-features. The only time a character is worth anything to anyone is when you control them. Virtually all of the cars are the same. Maybe 2 skins each on 5 types of cars. Leaving about 10 total different vehicles. The driving also seems incomplete, like some of the physics are just a little wacky. There seems to also be an overall lack of content. after playing it, I actually thought it was another alpha-stage zombie game like Rust or Dayz.			"

												Probably one of the best openworld zombie games to come out in a long time. A very satisfying combat system, unlike most other DayZ-esque games out there, which has more of a Dead Rising feel to it. State of Decay also has a lot of great features, such as switching between survivors throughout the whole game, all in which you can level up and progress individually. Each survivor has a unique story behind them, as well. Your safehouse is a base that you can upgrade with more defenses as well as things like weapon and vehicle repairs. Yes, this game has open-world vehicle driving.

Supplies are limited, some people don't like each other (seriously? It's the end of the world and people gotta be all drama queenin' it up...). It's a good game with good depth. Cars are limited. Weapons break down, ammo is scarce. People have specialties and can suck at other things. People perma-die. You gather supplies and allies and build up your outpost. You survive, you look for help and other survivors and supplies. Oh and cars break down too. Plough through too many zombie hordes and your car will eventually quit from all the abuse. Feral zombies are evil. They'll tear your charcter in half. Literally. One of my survivors lost a fight and had his upper body torn off from his lower body. Yeah, brutal.Recommend? Yes.			"

												This game had a lot of potential but really fell short. The biggest issue for me were the bugs/mechanics. I was scavenging for supplies after having killed all the zombies around than out of the corner of my eye I saw a zombie appear out of thinn air. The other issue I had were the rucksacks, which you could only cary one of even if you had a car! This makes material gathering long and tedious. Also a big thing for me was how road signs respawned after you destroyed them, things shouldn't rebuild after you leave the game! I wish that this game was more like its name and you eventually start to worry about the lack of supplies and you need to be careful with cars because their are a finite amount of them. Also I wish you could have attacked other survivors for supplies. This game was okay but really was reppetitive and had major imersion issues for me.			"

												Amazing, if you like zombie survival games, then get this.I was so impressed with how much this game offered. You scavenge supplies, find survivors, help out locals, find bases and move to other bases, create items needed to survive, and have resources you need to keep stocked.The two other additions to the game, were also fun, Lifeline offers a new map and a new persona as you play the military who are trying to clear out the city before leaving it to the zombies to overrun.

												I would not recommend this game anymore, the reason being- the developers STOPPED caring, updates do not roll out fast at all, and when they do they are pointless updates. This game concept and idea are spot on and perfect and i feel that its the way some game producers should go, its just disapointing that these guys came up with it. It has much much more potential and even more potential for a sequel or even more DLC (breakdown by the way added another 20+ hours of gameplay).Overall don't spend your money unless its on sale.

												State of Decay is by far one of my all favourite zombie games.It's centered around zombies and not like alot of other zombie games these days where you must also fight humans. The main story of SoD is decent but nothing amazing. Don't buy this game if you're only in it for the storyline. You'll only be left very dissapointed as there isn't much meat on the story. The gameplay on the other hand is what makes this game so addicting and entertaining.The graphics are quite well and there is alot to explore. Ever wanted a zombie game with Sims elements? SoD is what you want. You and your community must survive and gather resources, with small events randomly being triggered around the community and game world. Each new community member that joins you is another someone you can play as. If your character dies you will reappear back at your base as one of your current members. The game itself is only in thirdperson, not that it's an issue, the characters are very detailed and interesting to play as and you almost never feel like playing the same one.As for DLC, Breakdown offers alot of new content such as weapons and unlockable hero's, characters from the main storyline and a few bonuses. Breakdown also makes the game less storydriven and more focused on sandbox style. Surviving or doing whatever it is you wish. Breakdown also has a level stage system. You can fix a RV and eventually, if you desire, leave Trumbull Valley only to reappear somewhere randomly in the game again, just on a new, reset game world with your previous survivors. Going an level up, surviving becomes harder in alot of factors. There are less items to be found, more zombies, harder to kill etc.If you've always wanted a zombie sandbox game with minor, sims elements, just in this case, community overall, SoD and Breakdown is defently a must buy for you.

												Although the game is supposed to be more of a simulation (compared to typical zombie shooting games), the almost constant limiting of the camera angles seems like a forced attempt at a cinematic experience. This frequently makes it hard to glance around and get a proper view of things, leaving you open to attack from places that you can't see--places you could easily look if the game would let you turn your head or body.[Update 2014-10-07: When playing with an Xbox360-compatible controller, there seems to be much more control of the camera angle than with the mouse. This removes my primary irritation with the game.] [Update 2014-10-12: When playin with controller, shortly after I got two people following me instead of one, the game very frequently popped up a prompt to Taunt/Cheer/Agree/Disagree. Nobody had said anything, so the last two don't even apply! The buttons to answer the prompt are the same as buttons you need to do melée, finishing strokes, searches, open/close doors. This means that I randomly was unabled to attack, defend, or close a door in time. Sometimes I could work around it be quickly pausing, unpausing, and immediately pressing the desired key before the Taunt/Cheer/Agree/Disagree prompt got in the way again.]You can control many different characters and improve their skills, such as with a particular weapon. However, they all seem completely unable to handle themselves without you present, regardless of purported skills. Keep in mind that when you close the game you are not considered present, so the next time you open it you may find that a nice situation has become dire, or that a desperate one has already been turned into failure. This is not a game you can play ""from time to time"", but rather one that requires you to frequently come back to make sure that things haven't collapsed while you weren't playing. And if you have to exit the game during an in-game crisis to deal with real life, you may have to do a lot of rebuilding, healing, and recruiting of new characters when you return. You may even have to start over.[More Update 2014-10-07: Although they did eat all the food and use all the other supplies in the months that I left this title alone (and the window barricades mysteriously disappeared without the window glass being broken), nobody died--not even the one supposedly in critical condition. Now wishing I could change my ""Not Recommended"" mark to ""Don't know if want"".]			"

												State Of Decay is brilliant! It's like Dead Rising in a large, open world, but with a more serious tone. It's also like The Walking Dead (TV series) with permanent character death, viscious and numerous zombies and a strong emphasis on survival.Set up an outpost, then venture out into towns and forests in search of food, weapons, vehicles, guns, ammunition, building materials and medicine to improve your home-base and keep your survivors alive. Lots of drivable vehicles, and every building is enterable to scavenge.Every character you find is fully voice-acted and can be played at any time. If they die, they're gone for good and you simply switch to another character. Very good, tense, addictive fun!			"

												State of Decay is a polished single-player open world zombie survival game. It requires you to take on the mindset of a survivor than just another player. After slowly taking my time and beating the single player campaign in about 25 hours (100%), here are some highlights from the game..Pros:- The game is not actually hard BUT the consequences are tremendous if you do ♥♥♥♥ up (you'll be instilled with a feeling of loss)- Resources are finite. It can be counterbalanced with resource investment into sustainability (for survival).- You don't just play one character. You raise up a community. The more time to take into building up the group as a whole, the greater your chances of survival.- Vehicles are considered a resource. If you take better care of them, you'll find that they can do more than just get you from point A to B.- 25 hours worth of content (main story and side quest included).- For a single player game, the NPC companions are quite capable. They don't take the lead but they don't fall behind either.Cons:- The story is quite average.- Vehicles are overpowered. They can kill everything except for one special infected.			"

												Dull and lifeless gameplay, not only do you repeat the same basic type of missions over and over. The way you complete them is the exactly the same as the mission before. While this game has some interesting concepts like permadeath of characters, the absolutely repetitive style of gameplay wears thin rather fast. I didn't bother finishing the game after playing for awhile and realizing I wasn't enjoying it anymore.			"

												It is quite hard to write a review on a game like State of Decay, every run you make can be a tiny bit different, which makes it near impossible to write a review that is useful to someone who is looking to buy.Therefore I will do the next illogical thing...I'll tell you a story. [spoiler free]Once upon a time, in a forest far far away. There were two redshirts, who magically plopped into a campsite with no reason to be there.Generic redshirt one was very good at leadership!Generic redshirt two was very good at...well...nothing.Generic redshirt one and two both stumbled upon a small campsite, however the campsite had been designed and developed by the Call of Duty school of object interaction. And therefore redshirt one could only take items from BRIGHT AND PULSING ILLUMINATED PILES OR OBJECTS, redshirt one and two blissfully walked past the obvious packets of food around the barbecue as well as the backpacks laying around.Later they stumbled upon a park ranger station where they met many other redshirts, all who were as clueless and redshirted as them. They were then guided to a gunshot in the distance, where they recruited redshirt three. They all joyfully hopped back to the ranger station and found their fellow redshirts had lived up to their names and died.They all decided to leave on a suspiciously empty road that covered a good quarter of the map. Entering an American sedan with wood exterior. There was enough of them to turn on the radio to ""what is love"" and nod their heads in unison. But they didn't.After a while Redshirt one, two and three found another group, full of more redshirts. They were all sent on varying missions, taking it in turns to go out into the towns nearby and eventually as their kill count increased they began to become less redshirt-ish.I finally had a Picard, a Data and a Seven-of-nine.**The rest I never bothered with, my 3 main character choices were enough to keep me going for the whole gameThe rest of the group just sat about, complaining and taking resources while each of my characters in turn broke their backs bringing back mountains of supplies in their trucks each run. Aside from each character starting out a redshirt, there is no customization. So you are dumped with what are basically blank slates with a smiley face drawn on. Hell, where can I make my own face with a smiley face on?Maybe I would become more attached to my character and actually care if they got seriously wounded or sick?Soon after my band of redshirts moved to a bigger location, where was like the old location but I kept getting harassed to move by a fellow redshirt****State of Decay tries to make this atmosphere of ""you are doomed, panic!"". But it never fully achieves this. One example was when my group had one day of food left, everyone was panicking and harassing me about it. I casually walked across the street, found a rucksack of food from a store and walked back...Crisis averted in less than 2 hours in game, about 30 minutes in real time.Speaking of which, the majority of work you do in this game is simply busywork. It is ""go here"" ""help this guy"" ""look here"" etc. If you don't pull time out of the important stuff you are doing and go help this one guy in a group you never talk to then they will be angry when they return.I had to refuse a quest from a fellow redshirt because I was too busy to follow up on hunting a mutated zombie, since I was more concerned about starving to death. Naturally did the logical thing and decided we were no longer friends, simply telling me to ""get lost"" every time I went near them.******It is a lose-lose scenario where you grip and control slowly slips away and you can't do anything to stop it. It quickly becomes frustrating.Eventually all my redshirts survived, with only a few scripted deaths along the wayHooray and suchConclusionIn essence State of Decay isn't a game I would call ""bad"" or ""poor"", but more ""rough"". It has plenty of problems such as the logic behind the world it shows you. One NPC was talking about rioting in the streets and looting, yet in this town I could only count 4 looted buildings out of around 50. Many of them were untouched.Great attention to detail has been made for this game, if you are sprinting towards a window and press the action button ""E"", you will throw yourself out of the window to safety. Also the scavenging system is quite unique because you can ""rush"" a scavenge and make more noise, or maybe create a lot of noise that will draw zombies from everywhere to your location, a good risk-reward system in my opinion.There is no casual dialogue with anyone unless they have a mission, which combined with the lack of character customization makes the game quite shallow.However characters do comment on things such as zombies flanking you or meeting some NPCS.The skills are done D&D style. The more you use them, the better they get.After a while you can pick additional perks to enhance your combat ability. However many of these special moves require the use of the left shift/left control + another key, which you can imagine is very difficult on a keyboard. I strongly advise using a controller.As I said. Rough. But not bad. Get it on sale			"

												This game is garbage.It's in a beta state AT BEST.  Despite the reports of mouse/keyboard being implemented (it's utterly ridiculous that this had to be patched into a ♥♥♥♥ing PC game and still allowed to be sold), it's in an unusable garbage state.  For all intents and purposes, it still isn't implemented due to how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a state it's currently in.No graphics options, you have to edit configs which need to be extracted first, to actually turn off garbage like motion blur.Utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera control, with no way to disable things like camera auto-'correct', so you're constantly fighting the controls.  Oh and don't forget mouse acceleration, it would be silly to expect to be able to disable that crap.The utter audacity of the devs to be working on DLC right now before they even get the game into a releasable state is just the icing on the cake.Avoid this steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥, and this developer.

												Awful. Not worth the money even though I got it on sale. Keep looking for a good game and don't trust good reviews, not even totalbiscuit.pc optimization and graphics: Can't max the game at 1080p 60 fps on an overclocked r9 290. Turning the settings down I still see dips below 60 fps. The game also seems to want to lock itself to 50fps at certain points for no reason. The menu screens still have xbox buttons on them. This is the worst console port I have ever played. The worst. They didn't even add anti aliasing, just a quality slider and shadows options and that's it. I had to force AA with radeon pro because catalyst control center doesn't work for this game. The graphics are awful. I'm no professional artist, but I could make a better looking game than this. I would never have the audacity to sell a  product that looks like this. The graphics could have been for the original xbox. Actually, halo 2 looked better. The shadows/shading had to be fixed with mods so I could see during daylight. Tried other mods but held off because I read mods like the sweet Fx ones made the game even more buggy than it already is. The screen shots you see on the store page are BULL SHOTS, and even from the bull shots you can tell the game looks a bit dated. The game doesn't look as good as the store page screen shots  at all. It looks like they downsampled and added better shading or something. Sad how bad steam's quality control on games is. soundtrack: Forgettable is all I can say. I can't even hum one song off the top of my head. Once looking up some music on youtube, it was alright and set a decent tone.story: Hardly there, and not worth paying attention to any real progression. More of a survival game I guess. ♥♥♥♥ that, I want  a good story driven, open world zombie game. Instead I got this garbage.gameplay: A little better on this front but still nothing special. The pros include open world with some missions that pop up along side the ""main missions"" to keep things interesting. However, that's where it ends. The cons are plentiful and make the game worthless even if you are someone who can look past the bad graphics. The management is no fun. The resources are limited with unlimited zombies. Haven't run into the problem of people getting killed off while not even playing the game like some have reported, but I have had to deal with the infuriating save system. The saves are auto save only with no loading previous saves. The inventory system is dumb, with the largest backpack barely holding anything. Looked for a fast travel mod so I could atleast drop stuff off at base and couldn't find one. Half the time I can't even switch to another character or get another character to follow me, and there seems to be no reason.(glitch/bug not a matter of team liking me) As soon as the fact that  its open world wears off, which will be within an hour or two considering how small the world is, you'll just see the game as repetitive: go here, clear area/loot house/ hold off incoming zombies mission over and over. The world sucks to explore. Like really sucks. More shallow than an ubisoft open world game. If you're someone who thought skyrim was shallow, stop reading this review, cancel all thoughts about this game, and do something else. Guns are unsatisfying (probably due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mouse support) and all feel about the same except for maybe the shotguns having spread and less range. Silencers were poorly implemented and break for no reason after a set number of shots. The decision to include no human enemies with guns was a terrible idea. Look at a game like dead island, which I also thought was pretty bad, but atleast had decent gameplay pacing with the mix between zombie and human enemies. The AI of your team and zombies is horrible and makes the game even more horrible to play. Overall, this game is bad, even for an indie game. It won't hold your interest if you have some sort of standards for games, even if you are a zombie fanatic.			"

												The game is very fun at first. The idea of being thrown in a zombie infested city and building your own fort/gathering resources is pretty awesome. After about ~7 hours or so the game begins to show its flaws. Missions are repetitive/annoying, resources are abundant, game combat is questionable. And although there's permadeath, an eager supply of victims are always ready to join your cause. This game is great for a short tryst; but for those who look for a longer, more immersive world should look elsewhere.			"

												I admit that I am coming in as a disatisfied customer in this review, but ultimately I feel it has to be said. From a larger developer, I would be just as angry- but the game's store page has no reference to any incompatibilities it might have had or anything like that. After buying it, and being super psyched to play it after seeing a few let's plays; I downloaded it and waited until everything was done; only to find that when I finally booted the game I was greeted iwht a message 'This game is incompatible with your graphics card, the game was not built to support onboard graphics cards' referencing the model my computer uses. All the while, I can play Skyrim or Xcom on medium settings just fine; but I got to see the menu of the game and if I tried to start a game was greeted with a black screen. I wouldn't have ended up upset or irritated at the game at all, which now just taunts me in my library view; if I hadn't picked it up and spent 15$ (Thankfully it was on sale) only to end up finding that it's paying that much for a game that functionally works; less than even a coaster. I'm glad the game is successful, but one thing I can only hope of indie developers, especially those who have went past the 'bug-testing stage' of their games; is that they follow the method of Paradox Interactive, and actually give support on these matters. While I want to believe in this game, I've basically been shanked for the belief.			"

												Though this game is very fun to play and the way you have to manage resources and survive is unique, there are just too many bugs in the game to enjoy properly, for instance military personell standing around doing nothing while your base is being seiged.  Also the NPC's in this are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, for instance when they have had enough they will just start running home in the most direct route, even if that is through the middle of a horde and end up getting themselves killed.

												This game does not only incorporate zombie killing action, it allows the players to create a survival group just like the walking dead. If you are in love with the Walking Dead TV series, this game is for you! It has the ability to not only go out and scout for supplies for your home base but it also has a drama system inside and outside your home. The home is used for safety so save and quit and also to heal up and repair weapons. Melee weapons is the key to the survival of the game. The game has a sound system, zombies can see you but it is very rare and difficult, the sound is what drives them crazy and makes them run straight at you. I find for a early access game, this game has rarely any glitches but the screen is a little wobbly but you will adjust to it after awhile. Day Z and War Z are just no compare to this game. If you really want to experience a true zombie apocalypse this game has it all!			"

The pc ports fairly solid, Watch out if you start a new game in the Dlc which is worth picking up you will erase your progress in the original game.

												So i was looking for a game thats a bit different from the ""kill as many zombies as you can"" game and more like a duck and dive, try to survive the zombies sort of game. i was not dissapointed. From the start it is clear that this game isnt about zombie death count, its about surviving the Zombie apocolopse by gathering resources, befriending the local population and securing the best territory to enable to to live and survive in relative comfort.Firstly the bad bits about gameplay. there are quite a few bugs, casually looting some food and a zed decides to come through the wall and mall me. luckily only the one! the graphics are in no way next gen, which i kind of like in a way, it gives it a retro zombie authenticity lacking from some apocoliptic games. loss of stamina is annoying, especially when a horde of zeds decides to turn up! but in truth it adds a little more dynamic to the game, making you think about exit stratagies before searching a property, worth noting, check rooms and close doors behind you!I've found using vehicles to draw enemies out and run them over was a good strategy but you'll go through a fair few vehicles this way so ensure you are able to repair them, and also dont ram a juggernaught at full speed, nasty consequences as i found out when i lost one of the games first notable characters. Yes when someone dies they stay dead, no continues or respawns, there gone! Gonna wrap this up now by saying if you want something a bit different from the normal zombie game, this could probably be for you, with a price tag thats not too bad considering the other titles out there. not quite completed this yet but i'm around 10 hours in and im still hooked, i'll be downloading the dlc once the games complete for more action!

All I'm saying is if they added more of an RPG influence to it while being a Walking Dead in GTA type of game, it would have been perfect, plus First Person View XD			"

But people, if you like zombie games, and you like survival games, this is really something you wanna buy!

												Over all I freaking love this game, it is great. Having said that, there are a few ideas to be add to this awesome game that would make it, in my personal opinion, just that much better. Such as being able to place two extra ruck sacks of supplies you find into the trunk of a car for transport or four in the bed of a truck so that it isn't such a mind numbing task to drive half way across the map back and forth three or four times just to get all the supplies out of one house and back to your area of opereations. Also, maybe have the vehicles run out of fuel and have to be filled up by the use of gas cans you find around the world, so you can fill up on the go or use your fuel reserves you have stored up at your base. Maybe even have it so some of the gas stations still have a good amount of gas that you could take but say the power is out and you need to start up a generator to start the pumps but will also attract any nearby zombies, making the game more challenging so you don't just drive a car around the world just searching for supplies making you strategize how you use your precious fuel. But all and all this is one of the best zombie games I have ever played and I love it. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME if you love zombie survival games as much as I do.			"

												This game starts out strong, but fizzles for me as the hours roll by.     It was a good start though, and I hope it inspires a successor.   Pick it up if it's on sale, and you like the genre.In the first 20 or so hours of play, I enjoyed the drama and challenge of trying to find survivors and keep them alive.  I also enjoyed relocating my home site, and playing the various storyline missions.    The map is realistic, immersive and desolately beautiful  in it's zombie soaked way.However, after arriving at my final home site, i found that the games mechanics started to become more and more tedious.   I would need to spend lots of time running out to find building materials, which for some reason, I couldn't pile up in the back of my huge pickup truck.   Also, bringing people with you tended to be a waste of time, since they were both too lazy to carry anything, and would often book it home at random.(there is a way to trick the game into letting you stack multiple rucksacks in the back of a truck, but it's a kluge)The random, and highly repetitive task of trying to keep your survivors happy gets old fast too.   It can also be a pain in the ♥♥♥ to find the survivor you want to play, why aren't they on the mini map!?Finally, I think, like may console ports, the control just isn't up to snuff.    The combat has complexity that you can just totally ignore, and I find the combat sloppy and frustratingly random at times.Getting stuck behind NPCs in houses is also a bit annoying.  MOVE OUT THE WAY! "

												If you ever wanted Telltale Game's The Walking Dead to be more interactive and less focused on adventuring, this is the game for you. This isn't a DayZ ripoff at all, but rather a whole new entity taking little more than inspiration from Dean Hall's critically acclaimed zombie survival game, among heaping elements of Dead Rising and a whole open world to explore that is unparalleled in the genre; fully explorable buildings and the only true zombie game apart from Project Zomboid to feature URBAN AREAS. ALL of which are fully realized and designed. It's not as deep in individual character survival as Project Zomboid or DayZ, but it is unrivalled in community management in the genre.Highly recommended, preferably purchased together with the (ridiculously overpriced) Breakdown DLC for a cheaper price due to Sandbox mode being pretty much a necessity with this genre and the DLC adding little more than removing the story mode and adding ""tiers"" for replay value.

												This game is pretty good. I mean I never liked too much the idea of a zombie survival with a party of friends. Making it Single player it's much more about survival. the game mechanics are also pretty solid making you scarvenge for everything and building shelters,homes and finding cars. The Campaign is also pretty well made taking you right into the fray and dangers of the game and by helping you out if you feel lost and don't know what to do. A real good pick up and will get you more than 50 hours of playtime so it's pretty cheap... Recommended			"

												State of Decay is what I had hoped Day Z was before playing it. I prefer single player games for some concepts and this fit the bill nicely. The game is basically a ""build your zombie survival base and make it a functional community"" game. You start off with very little and build up to some formidable equipment. I like how the game is effectively open world exploration combined with resource management. Once I started playing, I couldn't really stop. Pros: combat system - guns or melee, they are both pretty solid ways of handling the hordes!- dynamic environment- wide range of weaponry- simple and rewarding character development- open world exploration- Handle a zombie apocalypse in your own wayCons: Resolution capped at 1280.....a shame!-perma-death! If your juiced up character dies....its gone forever with its developed stats!! (realism?)-A little bit too much micro management with side quests (repetition)			"

												One of the best zombie survival games there is, State Of Decay is an extremely well-made game and when I found out about it I realized I had finally found ""The Game."" ""The Game"" I had been searching for but could never find. ""The Game"" that doesn't force you to restart missions if they fail, where failed missions effect the storyline. ""The Game"" that requires you to battle waves of zombies for resources needed for your own survival. ""The Game"" where you aren't just one linear character, but where instead at any instant your favorite character can die and death is permanent. In State of Decay, it is necessary to scavenge for resources and every single character has their own needs. Every character in State of Decay has their own unique personality and (not including the main story's characters and Lily) have randomly generated names. Every step you take could be your last, one mistake and you become zombie-chow, never to be seen again. But don't worry, that isn't the end of your game! You can earn the friendship of other survivors and recruit them to join your community, and they will become playable if you earn enough trust with them. Nobody is safe and at any minute, any second, the zombies could breach your defenses and you can be left with nothing. Unless you're well prepared. It's fairly easy to prevent total devestation of your community. All you have to do is stay well supplied, and keep your community healthy. Sometimes you'll have to make life-or-death choices. If your favorite character gets infected, will you kill them to protect the community, or will you take the chance of them turning and let them live? Every choice is yours in State of Decay, but it doesn't always work out for you.PROSExtremely Well-ThoughtWorth The MoneyEndless FunRealistic NeedsDay/Night CycleRPG FactorsRequires a Good Strategy to SurviveCONSSeveral bugs (EX: Zombies can sometimes phase through walls)Overall I recommend State of Decay and although there are tons of bugs, Undead Labs is always working to fix them and even add new content now and then! The two DLC: Breakdown and Lifeline are more than worth their inexpensive cost, as they are presented like a whole other game. I give State of Decay a 20/10, but that's my opinion. I feel that if you can afford it, and you're thinking of buying it, (and you're into zombie survival games) then State of Decay is the game for you!			"

												Awesome apocalyptic-survival game. This game focuses more on gathering ressources, having good relations with other communities, survive as a group, than kill every zombie you see, and scavenge everything. For some, this is what they don't like, and other, what they prefer. In my case, I fall in love with the open world, the different communities all over the map, and the fact that you actually have to survive in GROUP. Anyone that liked The Walking Dead series on TV should love this piece of art. The only concern are the graphics (no advanced settings), and some zombies issues (they go through walls sometimes, they fall under porch, etc). Out of 10, I'd give it a 8.5. Recommended for any post-apocalyptic game fan.			"

												Probably one of the best survival Games up to now. You really could say that they've packed ""The walking Dead"" in here as far as i see it. There are X main Factors in the game which will keep you running:Character Developement: The character you play increases only stats you use (run for cardio, shoot for guns etc.) and several traits make a good difference in a fight between an experienced and an inexperienced survivor. And interactions between with other Characters sometimes let you ""discover"" that they can do more than just what in the Character sheet tells.Looting: LOOT! Exactly what a zombie survival game is about. Search for houses worth a run, loot it, curse it because it takes ages for you to find something, get nervous because there is a friggin big Zombie horde nearby an stay low because they will         kill you, even if you are good. Base management: Wanted to make some Molotov Cocktails? Build yourself a workshop. But having a garden would even keep you surviving...

												I had high hopes for an open world zombie game and State of Decay delivers. The survival aspect is fun, because once you use up items they don't respawn making you think about everything you take and do. The combat is satisfying once you know which weapon abilities you choose to use and there are plenty of weapons to boot. I wish the story was longer and hopefully in the future more new areas and cities will be added as well as steam workshop support. All in all it's a very good time and the bugs aren't numerous which is a plus. Would 100% reccommend.			"

												State of decay is definitely an interesting and addicting game. Which says a lot for a game in a genre that's been beaten to death. What sold it for me was definitely the surviving and recruiting aspect, mixed in with the chance of perma-death. For the surviving aspect, you need to go out and collect supplies like weapons, food, and building material. Most of that can be found in the neighborhood/town, however at some point those supplies can run out and you'll have to scavenge in farther places. Don't feel like going back and fourth? You can move your base/group, somewhere else! It feels very Walking Dead(kinda).Recruiting is also neat. Every survivor has their own set of traits that make them shine, or make them poop. Some might be doctors who boost your infirmary strength, some are athletes who can go for long distances, and there's even some with asthma! I think something that's a little tedious(in a fun way for me) is that you can train people up(some easier than others). Knowing that this game is persistent, even when your not playing, it feels good to set your crew up for success, so you don't come back to a dead camp.Then we got the death aspect. If someone dies, they are gone for good! This includes ""story"" characters. People in your group can randomly get sick and die if you don't have proper treatment at the time(or act fast enough), I've seen characters mercy kill the sick/wounded(that may just be story though), and sometimes they want you to mercy kill them. Depression and fear can instill fights and suicides. People can go on missions and not come back. If you like to get attached to characters, keeping them alive will be a treat!I think what mostly sold this for me, is that it feels like a much more developed version of an flash game called The Last Stand. I used to love that as a kid, and this game brings it back 10x more. You might like it, you might hate it. But I recommend it!			"

												Really good game of basebuilding, survival, zombie bashing, adventure, horror and an ok story, despite being a bit buggy (NPCs getting stuck that sort of thing). With the DLC it gets even better because you never know what you will get. Well worth the cost. Want a zombiegame this is the one to get. Though I wish basebuilding was better (a bit too simplistic now) and that there would be more room to build stuff, there's still free space in the bases not used which is a bit sad, also that the razorwire would stop the zombies.

												I personally really enjoyed this game. The game has some bugs and glitches here and there but from my experience ive had nothing game-breaking. If you are to get the game just to kill zombies and just explore I recomend getting the Breakdown DLC. I spent most of my time on that. The story is alright but nothing too great. A small list of some pros and cons.Pro- Some what classic zombie, they run but can only be killed by damaging the brain.Pro- Great mechanics such as building up a base with survivors and gear to survive the hordes, a rouge like system that has you play as multiable characters but if he/she dies you can no longer play as him/her, cars will never respawn after you destroy them. Pro. Different types of zombie found all over the map.Pro- A large map that has many places to settle in and explore.Pro- Many different types of weapons from melee to guns.Con- Zombies will glitch that causes them to not load in correctly so its just their head and arms.Con- (personal con) I dislike the survivor walking animation. Con- Survivor AI can glitch causes them to just stand still and die. Con- Sadly no co-op or multiplayer. I deeply wish they added that in. State of Decay is a pretty fun game, when your done with the base game you can always get the Breakdown DLC that makes the game harder and it ends when you die or the Lifeline DLC that ands a new map and a new story. :D			"

												I heard of this game in a Cracked article a few weeks ago, downloaded it immediately and it blew me away. It's basically exactly what I've wanted out of a video game; the Breakdown DLC in particular. It's a hopeless struggle in which the only destination is failure and death. But it still makes you want to struggle and fight and survive as long as you possibly can. The campaign is a bit crap, but Breakdown more than makes up for it. Highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't shy away from a challenge.			"

												State of decay is an amazing zombie survival game. It doesn't rely heavily on the ""jumpscare"" which I love. The game isn't soley built on fighting zombies. It's about surviving the long game. In order to succeed you need to scavange, set up outposts, upgrade your home base. You need to look for weapons for yourself, but also buidling, medical, food, and ammo supplies for your group to survive.You need to manage relationships with other groups of survivors by rescuing them, or ignoring the pleas for help so you can run another mission that you need for supplies. You need to manage your folks as well, playing as one character can hurt you in the long run, you need to play multiple folks and level them up as well. If your singlely played character dies you're in for a long tough road ahead.  The game does a great job reminding you of this as each player will fatigue when they've been outside the safe zone for too long, so you are reminded that you need to swap characters.The best part is for a zombie survival game you dont' need to kill zombies. There are no drops, no added bonus to offing them, other than keeping you and your home safe, so hiding in bushes, or staying quiet to save ammo and mele weapons isn't peanized one bit. I'm 10 hours in and only feel like I""ve started. but I can't stop playing, everything else in my library sits idle while I contine to fight for the living.			"

In this game you don't play as a single character, you play as a comunity and that is such a great idea!

												One of very few games that capture ""survival"" within its gameplay, State of Decay is an ambitious take on building and maintaining a community in a world with danger around every corner. Starvation, sickness, and death due to failure to recover from injuries are all present. Additionally, among the survivors, they may run away from home, or go missing (sometimes permanently), all while the resource pool you have is drained every (real world) day. There are a lot of scary moments in the game that come about in a completely organic fashion. Stealth works as intended, and the enemy AI acts as it should when you're sneaking around. Action in the game is very competent and exciting. It seems like the ideal survival game. Of course, there is a ""but"" that follows. The game is buggy. Not just a little buggy, either - the game is very buggy. You can't go five whole minutes without seeing a zombie clip through a fence or get stuck on a piece of the landscape. However, most of the bugs have little effect on gameplay, and thankfully, stealth is in no way negatively effected by said bugs, and combat rarely is either. However, if you do come across a bug that nips you in the butt, there is no way to undo it, which leads me to my next point, which is saving. Saving your progress in this game sucks. It just does. There's four files you can use, but you can only save one playthrough to each, and the game autosaves, with no hard saving at all. As a result, you can be screwed over for the entire playthrough if you make a simple mistake, such as falling from a height, which leads me to my next point - controls. Controls aren't necessarily bad, but they're definitely in need of improvement, especially for when you're in melee combat. The controls do a servicable job otherwise though. Another problem is the quest system. You receive quests through somebody at home communicating with you over a radio. Its a good system, or at least, it would be if she wasn't contacting you every single minute about one quest or another. Its so bad that there are mods that do away with it that are actually called ""Nag be gone!"" and ""The 'Stop Harassing Me Lily!' Mod"", both of which work by the way. The game lacks any multiplayer, which is both a good thing (nobody destroying your community overnight) and a bad thing (game experience feels very lonely, and most players would benefit from cooperating), and there is not going to be any multiplayer added to the game. The game also persists while you're not playing, which can severely damage the experience of some people. There are mods that address this too, and even allow you to shut it off, so those with little time to play the game on a regular basis can still play (although the game requires such a large time investment that I would honestly recommend another type of game instead). There's no conflict against humans in the games - its entirely cooperation with fellow survivors, which will probably be disappointing for some, but I feel that the game is better for such an exclusion. State of Decay can also get quite dull and repetitive over time, which, again, can be solved, if only temporarily, with mods, which I suppose should bring me to my next point.For many of the faults of the game, there's mod support out there that addresses a lot of it, and some mods overhaul the game with drastic changes that alter the dynamic. Mod support won't keep the game alive forever, but the current ones out there can definitely extend the life of the game and rectify many major problems with the game.All in all, State of Decay is one of three survival games I've played that seem to actually capture the essence of what ""survival"" really means, and doesn't simply slap on ""survival"" because there are zombies in the game like some people actually do with games like Dead Rising and Left 4 Dead. If you have a survival itch that won't go away, or have any interest in the genre, I highly recommend getting State of Decay, and its DLC ""Breakdown"", on a Steam sale. Otherwise, honestly, you might be better off playing something else.tl;dr 6/10, buy this game if you're interested in or enjoy the survival genre, and check out mod support for the game as well.

												This game is amazing. For a smaller studio this is really a very worthwile venture. The game puts you into a familiar zombie apocalypse. Only this time, you not only work with your team to kill zombies... but together to survive for the long haul. Killing zombies may be a necessity at times but it is no way a major goal of this game. If you can collect food, fuel, materials, medicine and/or ammo without combat, more power to you. Build your base. Place strategic outposts. Then Outlast.The game has a fresh experience to a very familiar genre. I actually felt anxiety at the prospect of losing a favored character. (damn ferals!) For when they die, the are G.O.N.E. to great beyond. It's the ""one more turn"" sort of action that makes 4 hrs go by in a blink. The only major drawbacks is that to some the action may be to similiar sometimes. However, different characters can be affected by your decisions and the challenges you choose. Secondly, there is a big lack of a in game guide/help screen. This is the real short coming of the developer as this would be simple enough to fix.Overall, worth it's full price in my mind. This is what the Walking Dead should have put out as their game (aside from the TellTale which was amazing, this should have been Survival Instinct) I can't wait for a new map.			"

												State of Decay is a great game. There is a great, open-world to explore, a church to upgrade, and yes, plenty of zombies to kill.  However, there are a few issues in the game, primarily the frame rate and zombie teleporting. The frame rate drops out of nowhere, stooping to rates of 5-10, though only for a second (long enough for you to get your neck chewed off).  Also, zombies to teleport and respawn almost instantainously, without your realizing. One for instance, popped right in front of me when I was barricaiding a room. Finally for the issues, there is perma-death.  That means, when you dead, YOU DEAD!!! But, none of these minor problems should stop you from playing one of the best zombie games in history.  Combat is fluid, and the ground take-downs are sick.  The amount of blood and gore also makes each swing of a spiked bat murderous and powerful.  Probably one of the game's highest strong points is the sound.  Each moan of a zombie and the shuffiling of the footsteps make your heart skip a beat and wonder where the heck that one (or two, or three) zombie is at.  All and all, State of Decay is an amazing game and an even better zombie survival RPG, witch shouldn't be passed up because of a few minor bugs.			"

												This game is amazingly well done, whil experience is gained per character fighting zombies (leadership if with followers) or guns and melee when using those weapons it's like a real zombie game, guns attract hordes without siliencers and mostly? it's pointless to fight zombies if they can be avoided, equipment breaks so make a workshop; people gt hurt so build a medicall center, a garage to fix cas etc. It's very unique and vey well done. When you find supply cCHES BE SURE TO EQUIP IT TO TAKE IT BACK YOURSELF OR CALL A RUNNER TO GET IT, breaking it down for supplies only serves you.

It takes a similar concept to Dead Rising when it comes to ""Oh there are various survivors around and if you ignore them they'll die"", but it's got a much more serious approach.  Noise matters, there are hordes that roam and wander, you have a base to upgrade/maintain.It's a blast to play, the story is nothing phenomenal but it is fairly interesting.

												Possibly the best Zombie Survival sandbox game on the market (well not so many games are like this). You need to manage your own survivals and produce, scavange resources to stay alive in the world.Try to keep alive your fellow survivors and make sure they dont go insane. Hard to jugde the game but its ambitous for an indie dev. The game has bugs here and there but not gamebreaking, mostly visual glitches. The game was an XBLA premiere game but finally here on the pc with added visual options and mouse keyboard support (still i recommend the X360 controller). Sadly the game is too easy but you can purchase the Breakdown DLC and amass the no story 100% survival  with increased difficulty and replayablility.So Im recommanding if you wan to speand some hours in your persoanl zombie apocalypse :) "

												SoD stands out in a sea of mediocre zombie games. Going in, I really didn't expect to like this game as much as I eventually did. Though a little rough around the edges it still offers up some solid and, often exhilarating, gameplay. Most of your time will be spent sneaking around scavenging for supplies (food, ammo, fuel, & medicine), managing/saving/assisting other survivors, improving your base with various facilities related to your survival (workshops, medical tents, sleeping quarters, etc.) and...running for your life. Zombies can be quite challenging in groups especially if there are a few 'special' infected mixed in. It's a good idea to always bring a battle buddy.  As for complaints; I would like to see more story/character depth, more and/or improved graphics options, and polished up combat. Long range gun play can be dodgy. Missions can become a bit repetitive, especially after several levels of Breakdown, but even an average mission can turn heart pumping if you find yourself surrounded, wounded, and on the run. Altogether, State of Decay is a fun mix of elements from the zombie genre that does a lot of things right, if not deeply. Well worth picking up when you can catch it on a Steam sale.			"

												I totally recommend the game....the game is having the most similar gameplay to the famous game The Last of Us the way that you are using the weapons and the skills tree.... so only for this, I can recommend the game is the only similar game to last of us for pc... of course we are talking about a small/indie company so... the game have less storyline and the characters are more regular but instead of last of us... you have an open world game to explore, wich is giving to the game an a really interesting looking. For the graph engine the game runs perfect on Cryengine 3, the graphics are great. We are talking about an open world game with Cryengine 3 and a similar kind of gameplay to Last Of Us so.... what I can tell..... I totally recommend, if you like this kind of games.			"

												While the game has lots of flaws, and monocyclic gameplay, it still provides replayability.I rightout bought it on Autumn Sale and have been hooked ever since.I went onto this games with not too high expectations, despite seeing its price and other critics.Some of the + :-RNG characters (except for few core ones)-Interesting RPG elements-Catching gameplay-A decent amount of new ideas-High Replayability due to the high amount of bases and RNG Events-Different and interesting story branches-You can choose to be the good, or the bad guy and your decisions have high impactSome of the - :-The quests are oddly repetitive ( Kill a Bloater, Kill a Feral Dude, Find this survivor, Inspect this Area since there COULD be a Scavenger in trouble)-The game suffers from very dull technics and Engine problems -The fighting system is very one-sided and does´nt provide much change even though there are 3 types of weapons-The game reaches its peek of interest too fast, after about 3 hours of gameplay it gets broken down to a few steps that you repeat until the next storyline-quest pops up-The DLC isn´t really worthwhile as it is basically copypasting the whole map and shrugs you into a new group of survivors which you need to carry on for a few lvlsI would give the game a 6/10 which is still in the recommendable Area, If you enjoy playing Zombie Hack & Slay with a few Strategic and RPG influences, go ahead, its basically Day-Z with bases.The game would get a 10/10 if the guys over at Undead Labs would have actually kept it in development for longer to implement and polish up already existing features, to make the game even deeper and overall a better experience.

												This game has to be one of the best zombie games I've played. First off you have a free roam open world to go and do as you please. All locations are accessible, you can enter any building and have a rumage around for supplies. it's third person so none of that confusing twirling around trying to see who's sneaking up on you. throw into this vehicles and you can do what we've all dreamed of, hurtle into a hoard of zeds in a car and play zombie skittles. Such a satisfying past time. There is a lot to explore though it can become repetative once you've clocked up a good many hours though!  They've added the safe zones upgrades too which means you can add workshops and gyms and such like to your safe zones allowing you to fix weapons or vehicles and gain extra stamina. The characters are all playable once you've gained their trust and can be levelled up, but bear in mind once they die that is it they are gone, run out of survivors that you've befriended and it's game over.  Yes I love this game, hope they can continue to bring out more DLC.			"

												It's fun for a while, but begins getting repetitive.The story is fairly uninteresting (of what little there is) and the characters are pretty void of actual character. Running over zombies and shooting them with a sniper is, and always will be a blast, which is ideally the only reason I found this game enjoyable.Scavanging and looking for supplies to upgrade your base is also kind of cool, but while doing this you're often forced to go do something to make sure your incompetent fellow survivors don't get killed.All in all, it's good. I liked it, and I'll reccomend it. Most of the game is pretty well done, and if zombies are you kind of thing then go for it, but if you're on the fence maybe look at some gameplay before making the decision. Oh, and obligatory complaint about it not having multiplayer. The game is begging for it, but the developers have clearly stated their disinterest in adding multiplayer to the game.			"

												One of the better Zombie games I have played in awhile! Everything from the combat system to having to avoid large groups instead of trying to be a tank is what a post apocalyptic zombie survival is about. The game has cars loads of different items from wrenches to even kantas (one of my faves). there is skill progression so as you combat the zeds, your characters level up skill to help with running, combat, stamina, etc. The only thing that sucks is making sure to balance out characters because perma-death is a real thing in this game. build in character too much and rest will suffer when trying to scavange on their own and such. Overall, best game to simulate a survival zombie apocalypse!			"

The feeling is there and the basic game play is mostly enjoyable, after the slightly stiff start.The only things, that I think, could be improved, are the lack of placing supplies to a vehicle, so you always have to carry them on your back. You can't seem to give supplies to your fellow survivals either, so that they could carry them. A co-op atleast would be a nice addition and it would solve these problems, when you and your friend could carry their own stuff. Other than that, SoD is a nicely done game, which is pretty loyal to the Zombie genre (except for the special zombies). And so far (I have only played the game about 7 hours), I haven't met any hostile survivals, which is a nice change for the typical ""trust no one"" attitutude, what you would usually see in these games.

												Great game done RIGHT! The open-world zombie survival game you really wanted that also has a manageable base with facility upgrades, random misfortunes, and scavenging for stuff. Persistent world feature caught me off guard, but it was still fun knowing the world goes on without you. And a bonus! zombie references everywhere in this world. Have fun finding them c:The only glaring gripe I have for this game is that if you have a partner tagging along with you (from your base, not a story mission), you can't exchange items or anything really while they're standing a foot away from you outside of combat.I would love to see some multiplayer similar to what Left4Dead has done, with friends or something ""taking over"" a random non-storybased character from your base that isn't injured, on an optional  side mission, and/or past a certain community population (like 10 to 16 people or something).Otherwise this is an awesome game, go buy it if DayZ or Nether isn't to your particular taste.

												The game, while fun and enjoyable, does still lack some of the polish that is typically expected by a casual gamer. It can be buggy at times and some areas of the game, namely the missions, are in some need of clarification. The difficulty of the game is fairly balanced aside from the occasional buggy encounter with a zombie horde. Companion AI is decent, but if you're planning for your allies to not walk into molotov fires... well... then you'll have a problem. Also, as a pc port of a xbox game, the graphics are pretty painful if you're used to pretty sparkly scenery. Assuming a graphics enhancement comes out that point is negligible, currently though the biggest hurdle you will encounter is seeing whats going on. Still, it's a pretty solid game.  10/10 for concept and game elements, 5/10 for execution.   If they had more money/time to polish this game then it would have been perfect.			"

												Reasonably good zombie survival game.  I'd say the most exciting moments in it are not as good as the best moments in Dead Island or Left 4 Dead 2, but the whole base building and team management thing is a great spin on this genre that makes it different from either of those two games.  I had fun playing it, but it does It have some annoyances such as camp members who run off at random times, so even after you rescue and make friends with them they aren't available to switch to most of the time when you want to.  The length of the campaign is about 15-20 hours probably and that seems about right.  I liked Dead Island's action better than this one, but that game's campaign ended up lasting much too long so by the end of the game it was just tedious.			"

The game makes you constantly with you could stay out to get more, or come home and switch characters.  You can add more people to your community through gaining their trust or helping them to your home.  The fighting is done well, frantic to not let them grab you, which is perfect.  A loose open rpg story lets you roam around and build up your home until you've exhausted the map's supplies.  The game is good, let's just leave it at that.			"

												State of Decay is a delightful game to play. It does have replay value when it comes to the main story, Lifeline, and Breakdown. Now I do have a few complaints, however, but my overall view on the game is still good.The first and foremost complaint would be that there is no co-op. Of course what they did do for it as a substitute is use the in-game AI characters as your partners (the player can ask another member from the home base/community to come watch your back). I do like that idea, but they could have had the option to also have 2-4 player co-op.My second reason would be that there's not really any sort of dynamic weather system in the game. It would of course add to the atmosphere a little and make it seem slightly more like a realistic world, but the overall game is, of course, not a simulator. I just think that, in my opinion, dynamic weather would make the game a little more interesting in a way. Like the rain could affect the zombies somehow or the rain could cause some flooding down in Marshall. Or perhaps some snowy, cold weather that affects everyone. And fog which affects how far you see, so you can't see your enemies (zombies) coming as soon as you want.And the final reason would be a gas system. You know, for the vehicles. And I know in Lifeline there is a gas system for the generator, but that's only until you upgrade it into a solar powered generator. You, as the player, probably will use cars a lot throughout the game, so why not add in a gas system? Because how I see it, gas looks like the last resource you'll have left over that you'll have the most of. Now that's all I have to say about this game. And those reasons above don't really ruin the game for me and make me hate it, I just think it'll add to the experience and make it better. (Well, perhaps not the co-op for some because some people might have some troll-ish friends that'll like.... bring hordes to you, or leave you to battle with the mutated zombies, or even make sure you have to go a long distance just to get a car.)

												There are a few good ideas in this game, but that won't save it.Good:-Zombie Survival, with an emphasis on survival (food/supply hunting)-Scouting ahead for camps/points of interest and planning where to go is fun!Bad:-Rough combat. It's just not fun or engaging. Hit zombie with board, board eventually breaks, rinse repeat, nothing new here.-Terrible story (To be fair, I didn't play for very long, but you feel nothing for these characters aside from the feeling that the game will be harder without them)-Pretty bad UI. Like, pre-mod Skyrim on PC with keyboard and mouse bad. I hear it's designed with a controller in mind though, so that may help.-Zombies feel too weak. They only pose a slight threat when there is a group, and even then you can outrun them with ease, or just smack them a few times with no real issue. While in the later game, this may change, but I don't want to stick around and find out.I feel bad because I didn't play too long to get a full feel for the game, but when the start of the game is so cookie-cutter and by-the-books, I'm pretty sure I'm not missing out on the rest. Hopefully a sequel will expand on their good ideas.			"

												Truly one of the best value for money games I have ever bought. If you want to go on a zombie killing spree, you'll actually have to plan escape routes, bring supplies and be very mindful of what's going on around you, because if you go ahead and facetank the horde, you're gonna get murdered pretty quick!It incorporates what I don't see enough of in general zombie survival games, the SURVIVAL factor. You need to gather and store supplies in order to keep everything running correctly. Strength is in numbers, but the more people you recruit, the more supplies you have to dish out to everyone. If you don't meet your daily quota of supplies, then your camp can fall ill, or your defences can be weakened, etc. However, supplies are not in such a high demand that you'll find it a chore to go and find them, they balanced the feature very well.All in all, this is one of the most perfect zombie games that I've ever seen, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's up for a survival game, and not just a mindless hack & slash.

												Intense zombie fun!  You can play as any of the characters that you interact with (once you are friends) and each has a back story and specific skills that can help the community that you create.  Scouting for resources is time consuming but an intrigal part of the game as that is how you meet new people and find new items.  Well made game with an engaging story and characters you actually can care about.  At times the situations can become so intense that I have found myself all tensed up that my shoulders actually hurt.I recommend this game if you are into story driven, challenging games.  You don't need to be a zombie fan to enjoy this game.The best part is driving around taking out hordes.  There is something gratefying about body parts flung through the air and your car covered in goo.  :)			"

												State of decay is definitely an interesting and addicting game. Which says a lot for a game in a genre that's been beaten to death. What sold it for me was definitely the surviving and recruiting aspect, mixed in with the chance of perma-death. For the surviving aspect, you need to go out and collect supplies like weapons, food, and building material. Most of that can be found in the neighborhood/town, however at some point those supplies can run out and you'll have to scavenge in farther places. Don't feel like going back and fourth? You can move your base/group, somewhere else! It feels very Walking Dead(kinda).Recruiting is also neat. Every survivor has their own set of traits that make them shine, or make them poop. Some might be doctors who boost your infirmary strength, some are athletes who can go for long distances, and there's even some with asthma! I think something that's a little tedious(in a fun way for me) is that you can train people up(some easier than others). Knowing that this game is persistent, even when your not playing, it feels good to set your crew up for success, so you don't come back to a dead camp.Then we got the death aspect. If someone dies, they are gone for good! This includes ""story"" characters. People in your group can randomly get sick and die if you don't have proper treatment at the time(or act fast enough), I've seen characters mercy kill the sick/wounded(that may just be story though), and sometimes they want you to mercy kill them. Depression and fear can instill fights and suicides. People can go on missions and not come back. If you like to get attached to characters, keeping them alive will be a treat!I think what mostly sold this for me, is that it feels like a much more developed version of an flash game called The Last Stand. I used to love that as a kid, and this game brings it back 10x more. You might like it, you might hate it. But I recommend it!			"

												I love this game it is really good and is a cool take on the zombie survival genre when it came out its difficult. However even though it isn't easy it doesn't mean that is this not a fun game. That it the opposite of the truth, you need to plan, manage and stratigize  for the survival of you group. This game is already great I only wish that there was a co-op feature not multiplayer, just co-op so me and my friend could play together. I mean we still do we sit down and play but, I would love for co-op to have been a part of the game. However this is still a great game definately worth it especially for SoD and SoD: Breakdown.

												Lets start by saying a known name on t.v. hit series The Walking Dead. Any fan of the walking dead series will love this game. Describing it with the hit name series is much simplier for me than to explain what State of Decay is about, but, lets get to it anyways. :)State of Decay brings you to a world with set objectives and has a storyline. Breakdown and Lifeline add's more of a open freedem make and survive you're choices. Everything from searching for loot, key objectives, survivors, cars, homes & forts. Infection is everywhere and the spawn system on the zombies can be you're dieing breath. Minor bugs do happen but overall the gameplay makes up for it. The game is updated every 3 months or so since I've got it. & sure everyone agree's, multiplayer or coop support would have made this game bigger news.SoundFX: 7.0Graphics: 8.0Gameplay: 8.0Fun Factor: 7.5Overall rating: 7.5			"

												Seeing i poured more hours into this game than the average review-writing player, i figured i should write my own review as well. There might be spoilers.So here goes:I'm not a fan of most zombie games, which seem to revolve around ""shoot millions of zombies to win"". There is no ""winning"" State of decay. The zombies are everywhere and the horde is endless. The base game ends when your survivors manage to leave Trumbull Valley and you are left wondering ""How long will they last without my help?""And this is exactly what i love about State of Decay.The game & DLC's in a nutshell:State of Decay:You and your buddy went on your annual fishing trip, while you were gone large swaths of the US have been overrun by zombies. You get attacked as soon as you tie off your boat. Fighting them off is easy enough but now need to figure out what happened and where you can find a safe place to stay. Jump in the nearest car and meet up with fellow survivors holed up at a church. Then the game begins for real and answers are gradually given.Breakdown:Same map, alternate storyline. Several weeks after the outbreak, you and Lily are the last 2 survivors of an enclave and you know you wont last much longer on your own. While you look for another enclave to join, Lily packs up and will meet you there with whatever supplies are left. Once settled it's back to basics: survive for as long as you can. You quickly realize resources are dwindling while zombie numbers increase. Eventually it's time to move on: you pack all equipment in the RV, load up your most important survivors and look for a new home. Your new home is on the exact same map, but with fresh resources and.. more zombies.Lifeline:New map. You are in command of the last military outpost in the overrun city of Danforth. You must secure your base, shore up your defenses and start the search for various survivors. The brass will direct you to high-value assets: scientists, doctors and their families whose expertise might be crucial to find an eventual cure. Along the way stranded survivors cry out for help and you're the only one with the means to respond. Your actions will decide the fate of not only Danforth, but possibly the whole world.I'll do a short pros and cons but there are a few things i should really point out first. State of Decay is not about killing lots of zombies. It is about people trying to survive the zombie apocalypse. There are endless zombies but finite resources. Sure, it is great fun to smash your truck into a few zombie hordes or grab a machine gun and go on a killing spree, but that's not the intention of the game. When you're done a good truck will be broken, perhaps beyond repair. Or a lot of bullets will have been wasted on ever respawning zombies. So when you clear an area of zombies, you damn better scavenge as much as you can.When you scavenge you may find resources you can use to improve your base or tools for zombie killing. Food and various painkillers/stimulants are also often found. There are a few possible home sites (bases) in the game for you to eventually choose from. Each of them has certain requisites and advantages/disadvantages, but larger is better :). Always you have to make tough choices: will i go for a workshop to repair weapons & cars, or rather a field hospital to aid the people who will inevitably fall sick? No one wants to go down with Black Fever.. trust me. Maybe i can have both IF i sacrifice room for the workout area, but then all survivors will have less stamina and fighting skills.. Choices.Over the course of the game missions will pop up: help scavenging, clear out an infestation, save a survivor, trade resources with your neighbours, kill a freak zombie.Unfortunately most of these missions can be boiled down to a simple fact: your fellow survivors have the mental capacity and survival skill of a baked potato. You are the only one who's good at it, and it's up to you to do ALL the work. I found this annoying when i first played the game and put it aside for a few weeks for that reason only. However, if you accept that's just how it is, embrace it, and you'll still have a most enjoyable game.A few other points of light irritation:- Graphics: good enough for a game of this price, but definately not top notch.- Controls: especially car controls feel sluggish.- Clipping: zombies occasionally clip trough solid objects. Not a problem if it's just a regular zombie, a bit more annoying when it's a Big Un or Feral in an enclosed space.- Useless survivors: Plenty of them and no ""clean"" way to get rid of them.The pros:Open world game: You go where you want, when you want.Permadeath: Your survivor got ambushed and killed? He's dead, no reloading an earlier save.Stamina & carry capacity: The game's way of saying you're just an average Joe, not Rambo.Traits and Skills: The game's way of taking the ""average"" out of ""average Joe""Soundtrack: Composed by Jesper Kyd. 'Nuff said.Mods: Don't like this or that? Maybe want to see more of that other stuff? Check out the modding community, or find out how to do it yourself. Besides tweaking Breakdown to make it more enjoyable, i also added myself as a playable character. Much fun was had.All in all i found this a very enjoyable game and the DLC's are definately worth it. Has been on sale several times @ -66% orso. Even grabbed back to it a few months after i finished it.			"

												Standing atop a water tower, the survivor scouts out areas that may contain much needed supplies while also making note of where the nearby zombie activity lies. This is Undead Labs’ “State of Decay,” and day to day life inside the zombie title constantly involves the search for materials to survive. It’s not just about getting the goods necessary for living another day as much as the situations gamers encounter while out scavenging for them.“State of Decay” may feel like several other tiles. It’s easy for gamers to look at the title and see that it’s an open-world game with vehicles and think it must be like “Grand Theft Auto.” Others may hear that it involves rescuing survivors from a zombie outbreak and think it might be similar to “Dead Rising,” or that the act of searching for supplies in order to outlive the undead must make the game some kind of single-player “DayZ.”The truth is, even though “State of Decay” may seem like all of these on paper, it all blends together to create a unique experience that gamers can’t find anywhere else.The survivors of Trumbull ValleyPlayers don’t have a single character to control inside “State of Decay.” In order to survive in the safest and most effective way possible, gamers must bring together a community of people. Rather than playing as a single survivor, the player represents an entire group.After earning any character's trust to become their friend, players gain the option to take control of that survivor and thus use them to go out and gather supplies or do missions.In Fact, “State of Decay” requires gamers to switch out which survivor they are playing as doing too much on one person will make them fatigued and much more likely to die. Speaking of death, when a character dies it is permanent. That person is forever removed from the group and loading a previous save isn’t an option as “State of Decay’s” auto-save feature ensures that both risk and choice matter in the game.Basically, gamers should get use to the idea that survivors will die. This is the zombie apocalypse after all.It’s the supplies that keep the group aliveTrumbull Valley features a rural setting that includes small town settlements as they would exist today if an uncontrollable zombie outbreak occurred. As such, the landscape is filled with houses, stores, storage sheds, warehouses, and more to scavenge through.In addition to finding weapons and other items that are for active use on a character, players must find packs of materials that are necessary for the home base. The group needs food, medicine, and fuel for obvious reasons. Ammunition helps keep the survivors at home alive as it gives them the means to defend themselves while the player is away.Another important resource the community requires comes in the form of building materials. These are necessary for the group to make repairs and additions to their home base by building watch towers, sleeping areas, workshops, medical tents, and more.The new structures allow the group to improve their base so that it can provide better protection, house more survivors, repair tools and vehicles, treat the injured, and even grow a daily source of food via outdoor gardens.There’s no place like HomeSince the home base houses all the survivors together, they will occasionally get in fights with one another. This will prompt players to escort these troubled individuals away from the base so that they can have a private talk in hopes of calming the situation down. Occasionally, members of the group will also end up in distress or turn up missing. Gamers are then tasked to come to their aid and help them back to safety.To help everyone out in the field, players may establish outposts away from the home base which provide relative safety while separated from home. Outposts allow missing survivors to find their way back, and create a safe perimeter around the structure which can be expanded by placing traps.This land belongs to the deadThe 16 square kilometer map of “State of Decay” features a couple of small towns, wooded areas, rivers, farms houses complete with fields, and even some lakes. Basically the game’s environments provide all the ingredients for a classic horror setting after scores of the undead are thrown into the mix.The living dead themselves are both varied and plentiful. There are standard shambling zombies, which travel either alone and in large wandering hordes that work as a single unit which can easily overwhelm lone survivors.“State of Decay” also features a few special zombie units that are more of a threat than the average walking corpse. These range from bloated zeds who leave a deadly toxic fume in their wake to armless zombies whose only attack comes in the form of a stunning scream which lets the nearby undead swarm the defenseless survivor.Most of these special units bear a resemblance to a figure that was once believably human with the exception of the lumbering Juggernaut. This behemoth towers as a giant above the other dead and bears the strength to send cars flying with a single swipe that would suggest that they aren’t merely the reanimated corpse of a deceased human being.An enjoyable harmony‘State of Decay” weaves elements of several genres together to create a new gaming recipe for fun. On their own merits, the game’s combat, resource gathering, survivor micro-management, and other systems are decent. When they are put together, however, they become much greater than the sum of their parts. Everything blends together in such a way that players won’t even care about the game’s few minor issues such as graphical tears, clipping, and framerate dips.When looked at as a full-title, “State of Decay” is remarkable. Considering the fact that this is an Xbox Live Arcade game, the results are phenomenal. This is definitely a must buy for any fan of either zombies or sandbox gaming, but this is the kind of experience that every gamer should at least try.			"

If you do not have the video card it wants you to have it will give you a warning everytime you launch the game. I think it this game is good for ages 13+. Otherwise you will be be encountering parts that do not make sense or other things. For example, it has drugs that you use that have a lot of different names that could confuse the young mind. This game has ALOT of swearing and cussing. If you dont know what that means, here's a couple of examples of what they say. THESE ARE ONLY EXAPMLES. DO NOT FLAG. ""BREAK IT'S FU*KING SKULL!!!.

I personally loved the project from the start and that gives me some bias, but the game really is amazing. I look forward to any more projects by Undead Labs and highly reccomend this game for anyone looking for a very surreal and fun zombie apocalypse themed rpg.			"

												Got this game recommended by a friend. And I have to say that this game has a great general idea, but developers absolutely failed to actually realize this idea in the games. When a character dies because of a bug or flaws in mechanics - this completely defeats the purpose of the game. And there is absolutely no way to fix this - its permanent death and you are forced to switch to another character. I don't need this kind of game, cause it gives you no fun, just makes you mad.

												When it comes to great story telling and a great post apocalyptic point and click action/adventure game, Telltale's The Walking Dead series beats the rest hands down.  However, when it comes to a third person action game that relies on survival instincts, sim like community building, and hours upon hours of gameplay value, State of Decay is one of the top post apocayptic zombie games out at the moment.  The only thing some may not like about the game is it isn't a multiplayer, and while I actually prefer non multiplayer games, it would have been cool if other communities and neighbors were other actual players. But maybe they'll do that in the sequel? Another big plus in my opinion is the size of the game.  Even with Breakdown installed, the game only takes up about 2-3 gigs of hdd space because it doesn't waste space on pointless FMV's.			"

												If you ever wanted Telltale Game's The Walking Dead to be more interactive and less focused on adventuring, this is the game for you. This isn't a DayZ ripoff at all, but rather a whole new entity taking little more than inspiration from Dean Hall's critically acclaimed zombie survival game, among heaping elements of Dead Rising and a whole open world to explore that is unparalleled in the genre; fully explorable buildings and the only true zombie game apart from Project Zomboid to feature URBAN AREAS. ALL of which are fully realized and designed. It's not as deep in individual character survival as Project Zomboid or DayZ, but it is unrivalled in community management in the genre.Highly recommended, preferably purchased together with the (ridiculously overpriced) Breakdown DLC for a cheaper price due to Sandbox mode being pretty much a necessity with this genre and the DLC adding little more than removing the story mode and adding ""tiers"" for replay value.

												This game starts out strong, but fizzles for me as the hours roll by.     It was a good start though, and I hope it inspires a successor.   Pick it up if it's on sale, and you like the genre.In the first 20 or so hours of play, I enjoyed the drama and challenge of trying to find survivors and keep them alive.  I also enjoyed relocating my home site, and playing the various storyline missions.    The map is realistic, immersive and desolately beautiful  in it's zombie soaked way.However, after arriving at my final home site, i found that the games mechanics started to become more and more tedious.   I would need to spend lots of time running out to find building materials, which for some reason, I couldn't pile up in the back of my huge pickup truck.   Also, bringing people with you tended to be a waste of time, since they were both too lazy to carry anything, and would often book it home at random.(there is a way to trick the game into letting you stack multiple rucksacks in the back of a truck, but it's a kluge)The random, and highly repetitive task of trying to keep your survivors happy gets old fast too.   It can also be a pain in the ♥♥♥ to find the survivor you want to play, why aren't they on the mini map!?Finally, I think, like may console ports, the control just isn't up to snuff.    The combat has complexity that you can just totally ignore, and I find the combat sloppy and frustratingly random at times.Getting stuck behind NPCs in houses is also a bit annoying.  MOVE OUT THE WAY! "

												This game is pretty good. I mean I never liked too much the idea of a zombie survival with a party of friends. Making it Single player it's much more about survival. the game mechanics are also pretty solid making you scarvenge for everything and building shelters,homes and finding cars. The Campaign is also pretty well made taking you right into the fray and dangers of the game and by helping you out if you feel lost and don't know what to do. A real good pick up and will get you more than 50 hours of playtime so it's pretty cheap... Recommended			"

												If you're a fan of zombie games even in the slightest, then this is the game for you. This game really hits home on how living in a zombie infested world should feel. If you don't forage for supplies, you die. If you don't keep up on your weapons, you die. If you are not meticulous about getting that last supply crate into the truck before the charging horde reaches you... You die. State of Decay is a wonderfully done game in the way that it doesn't quite feel like anything else. The idea is that you're on vacation when SHTF and you have to rally other survivors you find to build an encampment to combat the infected. You have to make sure it has good walls, ample food and shelter, and most important of all.. Quick, easy access to nearby supplies. Everything in this game is Finite. You WILL run out of supplies eventually. Blow up too many cars, and you won't have any left to drive. You really have to want to survive in order to get anywhere in this world and this game couldn't have done it any better. There were moments where I had a horde just behind me. I'm 50 yards from the truck. Do I run for it or dart off into a nearby building to try and lose them? Do I drop the bag of supplies I just collected, or hope for the best? Fire off some rounds at the risk of attracting more undead? The choice is yours. This game is entirely open world and completely non-linear. Play how you want. But you've been warned. How long will you fend off the State of Decay?			"

												A nice, relaxing zombie survival game compared to other unforgiving games like Day Z. Sometimes you want to go out for a stroll with your fellow survivors in the single-player game without real player looters popping in on your fun and busting a cap, leaving you for the dead to feed on. In this game, you can bash a few zombie heads into the ground and explore, bring a little something, something back, make everybody happy. If you happen to  die, there is always another survivor waiting back at camp to take out . The DLC looks pretty interesting, can't wait for it to come out just to see how long I can outlast a zombie apocalypse.			"

												One of the better Zombie games I have played in awhile! Everything from the combat system to having to avoid large groups instead of trying to be a tank is what a post apocalyptic zombie survival is about. The game has cars loads of different items from wrenches to even kantas (one of my faves). there is skill progression so as you combat the zeds, your characters level up skill to help with running, combat, stamina, etc. The only thing that sucks is making sure to balance out characters because perma-death is a real thing in this game. build in character too much and rest will suffer when trying to scavange on their own and such.

That being said I still think it is a pretty decent zombie survival game and would recommend this to anyone who likes the genre.  You can upgrade your bases and play as many different characters adding variety to the game.  Learning how to stealth is pretty critical, bushes are your friend.  So poor optimization, some bugs and a lack of co op are the negatives.  I do not understand why this game does not have co op.

												A very entertaining zombie-survival game with a big area to explore. All buildings are explorable as well as most vehicles you can see so they are stuff to do. The gameplay is about handling your survival in this hostile environment by managing your homebase and your crew, getting differents ressources to improve the basement, feed your people and heal them.. You can perform tasks for other groups of survivors (sidequests) and follow the main quest.This game is easy to learn, it's not hardcore as Day-z (e.g: no personal hunger/thirst management) and you get things done pretty fast. The survival feeling is really there and enjoyable. I played it for around 25 hours before getting bored by doing the same stuff over and over, something i would have come over if there was a multiplayer mode!You got to consider State of Decay as the first step of a concept that is supposed to evolve to a multiplayer game in an upcoming title. It's buggy and does not have a high end graphic engine, but from early access to now things evolved in the right way and that does not influence the gameplay.So yeah, if you can overcome those elements, get it!

												Absolutly splendid gameplay, a little rough around the edges, but any roughness can be refined nearly instantly.I do, however, feel that the story is, well, short. Alright, alright. It's a good 20-some hours when you first play the game, but once you know how to do everything, the story just becomes shorter. My second run and I only spent about 13 hours, and I was already where I was in 19. I personally think that they did that for DLC purposes, but then again, I'm a nutter that thinks all people want to do is make a quick buck until proven otherwise.The story is, however, interactive and you gain a love for all the characters, even the survivors who just joined you. However, be warned, there is permadeath. You will feel for those who die...So, Semper Fi boys and girls, becuase we leave no one behind!			"

												Fun single-player romp through the country infested with zombies.What I liked:Zombies are very satisfying to kill because of their crunchinessThe story has that certain sense of plausibility (the cause of the outbreak)Your characters aren't immortal and can die horribly if you make mistakes or aren't cautious enoughWhat I didn't like:Your community is very needy and will often pester you for helpThere are times where you're just waiting for the next plot mission to pop up and have nothing else to do "

												This game has to be one of the best zombie games I've played. First off you have a free roam open world to go and do as you please. All locations are accessible, you can enter any building and have a rumage around for supplies. it's third person so none of that confusing twirling around trying to see who's sneaking up on you. throw into this vehicles and you can do what we've all dreamed of, hurtle into a hoard of zeds in a car and play zombie skittles. Such a satisfying past time. There is a lot to explore though it can become repetative once you've clocked up a good many hours though!  They've added the safe zones upgrades too which means you can add workshops and gyms and such like to your safe zones allowing you to fix weapons or vehicles and gain extra stamina. The characters are all playable once you've gained their trust and can be levelled up, but bear in mind once they die that is it they are gone, run out of survivors that you've befriended and it's game over.  Yes I love this game, hope they can continue to bring out more DLC.			"

												this is my thoughts on the base game!a GTA,Saints Row... like 3rd person view zombie survivor game! its only single player which i have no problem and its very fun to play.there is almost no story but game has its depth in building a community, base layout and working on your members skills builds. i find it very addictive and love it.The game has lots of weapons! and many characters with different traits. the variation is so high that you will not see all weapons and characters in one playthrough which adds a replayability to the game.I find the art style of the game unique, specially the zombies and characters! i would love to have more customization options but there are mods which just do that for you.the game has a learning curve, its not hard to learn but need play time to master it and become badass.there are 1 or 2 minor issues which really doesn't worth mentioning! nothing game breaking at all. like sometimes very rarely it happens a zombie glitches through a wall but very rarely.i absolutely ""recommend"" this game further to everybody who can handle the gore and blood. and i wish to see a sequal to this game.best single player zombie game out yet. Awesome!9.5/10			"

												wow, guys this is really awesome :) if you like 3rd person shooters and zombies, this game will be your favourite :)my only problem is that once your hero's died - he possibly will, sorry :) - you have to continue the game, with another of your peoples, who is usually a 'noob'. no weapons, no nothing... and the autosave is a bit irritating as well, of course it saves when you have finished a mission, so bb save game IN the mission at all.apart from these, one of the best game of 2013, so let's go kill zombies :)			"

												This is a really fun zombie game. There's so many ones out there, but instead of a FPS, this one is all about group survival.

												Loved this game and lost more than a few weekeds to it. Tension, plot and difficulty and perma-death! It definitely hooked me into a ""just one more supply run"" mentality. The story was enough to develop the characters, but did not interfere when I just wanted to run missions. I refused to start the final mission, always wanting to clear out one more infestation and scout out the next building. All that said, there are so many ways I'd love to see this franchise expanded upon-  co-op multiplayer, more advanced base building, for instance. The zombie AI is just average and melee combat can be a bit repetitive (I'm too much of an ammo conservationist apparently).			"

												Core game - Good as long as devs don't break something with each patch. Breakdown DLC - Ok, poor execution of added features like the motorhome.Lifeline- This DLC plays like a game still in beta phase and the main reason for the negative review. The devs did not test this DLC very well before releasing it,Lifeline DLC issuesBroken missions - First mission spawns zeds in inaccessible area that needed to be cleared, unable to complete since it was armored zeds that could not be reached and had to fail it.Zombies(zeds) respawn on top of you in a bunch, moments after clearing an area. (Destroys any realism). Far worse than anything you'd see in the core game.Zombies(zeds) walk/run through windowless walls to attack. They previously got stuck on doors in the core game. Now the code the devs used to fix that allows Zombies to run through windowless walls without issue to reach you. Not constant but regularly happens and looks sloppy for a DLC release.On certain mssions in lifeline, your car will drive through zeds like you were a ghost(phasing trhough all ofthem for an extended period of time), not killing them. You have to drive away from them and come back for the code/AI to figure out you're driving a car into the zeds to kill them. I did not see this in the core game.Cars in lifeline now roll over quite easily in slow motion on the slightest bump when compared to the core game.In a lifeline seige a soldier kept hitting the same prone zombie(zed) over and over again with his shovel, never killing it and this went on for 5 minutes. I had to go over to him and kill it myself with one hit to bring in the next wave.There's the Illusion of exploring a city when actually you are only exploring highway off ramps and the few buildings near them. Very linear and claustrophobic compared to the core game. The core game takes place in a small town, but the town is very large and is fun to explore.Lifeline forces you to repetitively stay on a cluttered narrow highway with off ramps as your ""minimal"" access to a destroyed city. Inaccessible areas are common place in lifeline and frustrate to no end.And the last thing in lifeline to takes the reaslism and fun away. ""Danger"" zones that are filled with an endless supply of zombies that can not be stopped. You can not clear these danger zones no matter how much artillery you use on them. The devs even put one of these ""danger"" zones right next to the poorly setup base that you have to constantly defend. It appears the devs wanted to make lifeline more challenging for the player, but to do that they had to throw realism out the window that would be seen in a zombie survival situation/experience and put the player in ludicrous situations they would not allow themselves to be in.I suggest only getting the core game if you like zombie survival. Stay far away from lifeline, you've been warned.			"

												State of Decay is quite a fun game if you like somewhat repative game play and less we forget killing zombies! Can't forget the zombies, lots of zombies! The game takes place in the fictional Trumbull Valley which consists of 4 mainish areas and some farmland etc which are all connected in an open world concept. You have a campsite lake where you start of at, and 3 small towns: Spencer's Mill, Marshall City, and Fairfield, the last being the smallest. So at the off set you and a buddy are at the campgrounds and are attacked by some ""crazy people""  aka zombies and have no idea what's going on. From there, after some gameplay which includes killing and fending off zombies of course heh, you end up joining a small community at a church in Spencer's Mill. This becomes your first home base. You will now get some missions and objectives to survive the zombies and advance the storyline. Things to do include gathering various supplies like food, ammo, fuel, medicine..very important if you don't want to die or have your fellows turn on you haha. As well as build various structures at your home base in the slots provided, these of course require different supplies previously mentioned and some special items you have to go get. All the while zombies are roming the streets, attacking you wherever you go ^^			"

												Great game. Definately a different touch to the whole Zombie genre. You have to worry about meds, guns, ammo, materials, food and more. You can actually build up a base and have to worry about survivor morale. I've spent countless hours on this game and highly recommend it if you're looking for something different than your average ""kill the zombies and proceed to next level"" then this is it. There are a few glitches that still exist that give hiccups to your game play but based on the fun, you can easily look past it. Now for the new expansion Lifeline, I'm not exactly sold on its concept. If they could only take the ""horde siege"" from lifeline and put it in breakdown (which is a non-story oriented gameplay that goes to lvl 10) it would be awesome!! Def a 9/10			"

												Very fun zombie game. Deals with the logistics of survival as much as the combat. You build up a group of survivors, scavenge supplies from the area, and build up a stronghold. Then, move to a different area and do it again. It's low on production quality. The story isn't particularly strong, there are some difficulties with controls (though they're making a patch to address some of them), and it doesn't feel like a AAA title. On the other hand, it's a lot of fun if you like zombie survival.			"

												This review was posted on 5/31/2014.Now, I wanted to make this post about Lifeline but it wouldn't be fair to talk about only the DLC. I decided to include the game in general.State of Decay is absolutely a must have for those who enjoy Zombie Apocalypse Simulators. The gameplay is fun, suspenseful and sometimes risks need to be taken to survive. When you have to fight zombies it's best to avoid the large groups because you WILL die, it's a problem you may have to deal with and sometimes you'll lose your favorite guy in the group. You will constantly need to restock on supplies especially after you come back, Things will happen even when you're not playing. I know because when I came back the next day there was three to five missions on my map and my supplies went down a couple digits.I enjoyed the campaign, it was interesting and it kept my imagination trying to figure out what was going on. There were times when the game deviated from the main plot but it wasn't too bad. There was also the deal with expendable cars, if you blow up a car it's gone for good. No reparing a dead car so if you can you should make the effort to avoid hitting large crowds of zombies or your vehicle will get bent out of shape.In the Breakdown DLC you are basically playing in sandbox mode, at the start you pick a settlement with what little supplies you have and start where you want in a small area with very few survivors. You can just focus on survival, and there is also the part where if you are able to perform certain tasks you can gain special survivors. But when you're moving on to a higher difficulty in Breakdown you can only bring a handful of your survivors so choose carefully.I don't know much about Lifeline but I will say this, it's a refreshing change of scenery, literally. A whole new map, with a whole new storyline. It may be the same gameplay but I was surprised by how much was changed. There are some bugs but they're not game-breaking.I personally believe this game has alot of potential and with the new DLC I certainly believe Undead Labs is in the process of something great. Take my word for it when I say, if your a fan of Zombie games this one is a must. "

												State of Decay has some rough edges. There are some unpolished elements, some AI and glitch and design issues that could use some work. But with that disclaimer out of the way, it is essentially a hugely ambitious game that actuall pulls off so much of its goals that it makes up for its own flaws.Sewing together so many gameplay elements isn't easy - there's combat, character development, base building, resource collection, resource management, territory control, missions, more missions, side missions, auto-generated missions, plot missions, and all sorts of things you can do that will eventually become a mission if you just happen to keep busy long enough that they become important. So what, some of these many elements kind of get lost in the shuffle. I realized that if I just did my own thing, I never had to worry about resources. In fact, the biggest complaint over the radio was that I was always out of stockpile space. So, I ignored resources. And that's kind of the biggest problem with the game as well as its greatest success - it packs so much gameplay in, you simply don't have the time or the consciousness to DO everything. So I finished it in 24 hours, and it felt way to soon... after struggling for that many hours to reach the end, you relized that thtere as still so much left to do. So many things left to build, so many homes to try out, so many infestations left to clear... and I was left, in the end, wanting more. Is it a perfect game? No. But its flaws are compensated, the acting is solid, the gameplay is balanced, and it all works together to keep you having fun. I'll be looking at the DLC very soon, because I WANT MORE State of Decay.			"

												A REVIEW BASED ON HOW MUCH GAME MONEY YOU HAVE AND THE GENRES YOU LIKEI could give you a long complicated review of the pros and cons, wheather this is a good game etc etc, but there are already hundreds of those ( and yes it is a good game). Here is am going to tell you wheather or not you should buy it based on your favourite genres and the amount of money you have free for games. I have picked the 3 genres/ tags that will help you decide. So, first pick the genre or genres of games you like the most then read on from there:IF YOUR FAVOURITE GENRE IS ZOMBIES: This is a great zombie game that i really enjoyed. This will be one of your favourites that will go on your list of true zombie survival games. Note: all these prices are based on the presumption you are buying the game on saleSo if you have $ free:                          $20+: Definatly grab this                          $10-20: Grab this                          $5: As long as you are not saving up for anything grab this                          $0: I would suggest getting some more steam credit and buying thisIF YOUR FAVOURITE GENRE IS SURVIVAL:This will be a decent surival game that you will remember. It lacks the basic functions such as a hunger and a food bar. However it makes up in the fact that it requires you to gather neccasary resources, and has fatigue and sickness ( as well as a few others). Note: all these prices are based on the presumption you are buying the game on saleSo if you have $ free:                          $20+: Grab this, you will enjoy it                           $10-20: Nothing to run out for, only grab this if you have already played the major surivivals such as                           dayz, dont starve etc.                          $0- 5 If you are getting more game money soon then grab it, but dont go out of your way for just thisIF YOU ENJOY BOTH SURVIVAL AND AND ZOMBIE GAMES:Chuck what you were playing out the window and grab this! IF YOUR FAVOURITE GENRE IS SHOOTERSThis is not a shooting game! Dont think that for one second. It has guns however you wont be using them much and they have a very slow progression. If you want to try out the other 2 listed genres then grab this but not if your looking for a shooting game!IF YOU PLAY NONE OF THESE GENRES:This is a good taste test for a zombie and survival game. It includes solid but not everwhelming gameplay, and should give you a good idea of wheather or not you like the genre. However if you have no urge to start playing zombie/ survival games then move on.I hope this different type of review helped, and give it a thumbs up if it did :)			"

												state of decay delivers an amazing story driven survival experience in the vein of tv-show ""the walking dead"". i was very sceptical about it, i heard about this console port gta-like zombie survival single player game. to be honest, wasnt expecting much, because i normaly play and enjoy online games, like arma, dayz, the dead linger, infestation, rust, etc.... man, was i wrong. this game brings us survival dilemas at its best.goal is similar to gta games, explore huge open world maps, play side and main missions, plus you have big group to take care about (feelings, interactions) and your shelter. you need to provide for your group many things, like securing shelter from zombies, food, workshops, guard towers, sleeping space. sometimes it gets rough, so you can try play it hero style trying to keep everyone satisfied and fed and secure, or you can try ""governor"" style, getting rid of ""dead wood"" in the group :)also, you can swith main characters, if your current one is tired or hurt much, you can go to shelter and ask someone else to take over for a while... every character has its own skills, depending what and how many actions you performed with it.survival group realism is amazing, and no bull**** there. for example my main character (group leader) died trying to help other survivor in danger. he's gone forever now, dead as dodo. no respawning or any other funny business. group keeps on surviving. play on without him, with other characters. come back and grab usefull stuff from his dead corpse, keep gruop alive.i am really amazed by concept of this game. now i am so glad this is only sp game, it has it's own thing, without all pvp and kos thing like in every other game (and we have planty of those to play that way). just try to survive and provide for your group. 10/10 (graphics could be a bit better though, and more non-console-like)			"

												**This review is about the original game and the first dlc Breakdown**That game? Yeah...  This game is different from other zombie games like DayZ, TWD and Deadlight because State of Decay has a different opinion on Zombie Apocalypse at all. It says other survivors are friendly, let's see what will happen. And, after awhile you start to think like: Oh sweet! Another Enclave there. Every character can become a part of your group and every one of them has traits and funny story behind. It's better to say not funny but maybe more human-like. After a lot of heroic stuff here and there it feels soo good to hear some stories about a guy that came to a bar and called everyone old dogs and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and something like that.  You can play SoD whatever you want - like a silent ninja, a crazy maniac, a pirate, a driver with only one pedal, a hero, a runner, a sniper..... or you can take three guys with you and kill every zombie out there.  Crafting, Skills, Resourse management, base building... this game has everything and I enjoyed researching everything as well.  Soo I will recommend this game to pretty much everyone except Brad Pitt. He experienced it in World War Z so there's nothing new for him, sorry. If you like relaxed and fun gameplay after work - check this out. If you prefer hardcore - get the game and try to hit breakdown level 99. Or maybe you're genious who likes to push limits - go out there and enjoy your wild experiments! RECOMMENDED FOR ALL			"

												I really enjoyed this game, bugs aside. This was a great survival game, about collecting resources, survivors and fending off hordes of zombies. Although, the original and the DLC Lifeline have a general storyline, the game is fairly open world. You can choose who you want to recruit and how you want to train them. You can design your own home base, or select from different locations around the map. The bugs at time can be a little frustrating, most irritating is how the AI will stand around and do nothing while you get pulled apart by zombies. Sometimes AI quests won't trigger, or when they do, the AI will run off into oblivion. This is where I get frustrated with the no-save aspect of this game. I don't mind losing a crew member if I honestly did something stupid, however, I hate losing a crew member due to the lack of AI intelligence.			"

Get pulled into the vast gorgeous atmosphere, learn about the different quirks and backstories of your fellow survivors, uncover the mystery behind the zombie outbreak!  You can play the way YOU want, hand to hand, firearms, blunt weapons...it's all up to YOU.  Gather resources to strengthen your community, decide what's most important to your survival from a kitchen area to a library, customize your safe haven however you see fit, and GOOD LUCK in this world where everyone is expendable!

												Another zombie game, this time it's an FPS, and has a few interesting mechanics. It revolves around you surviving the apocalypse, creating a community of survivors, and setting up your own outposts etc to defend against the hordes.While it sounds good, it ends up being fairly bland, and annoyingly repetitive. I feel like it tried so hard to make a big game, when they could have done wonders with a smaller, tighter game that revolved around the 1 interesting mechanic it has.			"

												I waited until the early access phase had ended and until the game was in full release. I have to say; this is by far the most polished and refined zombie survival sandbox experience I've ever had. The only limitations I belive it had was its budget; things such as amazing graphics -not that they're bad -I'm just used to high end AAA titles which boast amazing visuals. Knowing that the budget wasn't massive; Undead labs have reached for something quite ambitious. Have they pulled it off? I belive they have. This game is immersive and has enough variety between missions and sidemissions for it not to feel like a 'grinding' or 'mechanical' use of your time but an meaningful and deeply engaging experience.The great thing about it is you get the hoard fighting feel of L4D2 without the sense that you're just passing through but actually warding off hoards to defend yourself or your home. And when people die -espcially characters you put a good deal of time into; well it's meaningful; not in a tear to the eye way the Walking Dead boasts but in a way which means something to you because you played through the experience of the game, trained that character, equpped them, knew their skills and hobbies, had seen them interact with others and that's why it sucks when they die -not just because the narrative told you it was sad but because of the time you invested in that character. Thankfully the permadeath system does not halt your gaming experience but reverts you to alternate characters within your home base. Every decision you make and even to an extent, the WAY you carry out that decision (eg: reckless driving, putting things off too long or even friendly fire) can really make a difference to how the characters in the game react to you and the situation. Ammo is fairly rare and weapons arn't that common themselves, so you have to really mean it when you choose to draw your weapon instead of using melee combat -which makes the guns feel so much more desirable and your persona far more secure when you use them. Thankfully they're not too rare so if you miss a shot or decide to shoot a zombie that you'll fell bad.It isn't a complete sandbox like DayZ, there are missions and randomly generated side missions which keep coming so while you're free to prioritize hunting ammo or supplies you'll never have a sense of aimlessness.There is an element of stratergy invovled with SOD when it comes to upgrading and deligating resources for differrent things; do you want to prioritize defences around the perimiter of your homebase? Or is putting resources into a family dining arrangement to avoid discord within the walls of your base more important to you? There are many other decisions you can make with the investment of your resources which will directly impact on the readiness of your characters, weapons and vehicles when they are called upon.It's a pretty slow start and will initially require some more patience than the opening segments of most games but by the time you're 2 hours in you won't want to stop playing. It's managed to even pull me away from the latest release in my favourite game frachise ever within a month of it's release -the game I built this high end machine to play. And yet I find myself perfectly content lobbing off zombie's heads, or jumping in a car and running over zombies hordes at a time.SOD is an immersive, meaningful and addictive gaming experience which gives back so much more than what you pay for it by the gaming industry's standards today. Having said that I'm the kind of gamer who will persevere with what others consider to be punishing and sometimes repetitive games which demand persistence and patience such as Metro 2033, Far Cry 2 and the original Assasin's Creed. All things considered (including the liklely budget for the developers) I can not fault State of Decay. Personally; I'd give it a 10/10.			"

												  I have found myself getting more indulged with this game than I had originally thought I would. Yeah, it doesn't look like much at first but once you get deeper into things, it all flows smoothly with this game.  Let me start off by saying that this game has some different character development compared to other games. You find survivors and have them join your group where you find out who they were before the apocalypse. Characters have real world personalities and traits such as ""natural born leader"" or ""idol fan"" or ""practiced photography"" and this helps decide who is good at what and good where. Once you lose a survivor, in some morbid gore-tastic way, your ""community"" feels the loss and demands more attention on the home front. This was a really nice spin on the survival genre.  Next, the world itself is always reacting to the things you do or do not do (aside from the main storyline missions). You have to choose between what is vital or what is time pressing. Also, the world keeps going after you've quit the game, so building projects are finished in real time instead of waiting around for it to be done, and your community's morality fluctuates while you are away too along with supplies being gathered and/or side missions being completed.  Oh, and there are plenty of good zombie killing weapons for the taking! Sure, it isn't a Dead Rising sort of diversity, but it is good and diverse for the most part!  Sure, it isn't in first person, but it still gives poetic justice to the survival genre and still gives that personal edge fans desire.   Now for a few of the game's cons:  -The hit reaction is sometimes off at vital points.  -NPC's do not help much when it is really needed and often times get themselves killed.  -The Dialouge is extremely repetitive... every character uses the same sentences as other characters.  -Gameplay can get dull at times.  -PC controls can be frustrating as well.  All in all, this game is an amazing take on the whole ""Zombie, Survival"" genre (that is sadly overdone) and is a great buy for any fans of the genre.8/10			"

												When I first heard of State of Decay, it sounded amazing. A zombie game where I have detailed survival requirements that require me to scavenge nearby areas for supplies, giving me access to an open world where there are multiple areas to explore and find useful stuff in, challenges presented in the form of large groups of zombies and special ones, and best of all no other people to worry about ruining my fun by randomly coming by and shooting me in the face for no reason. The scavenging and community management elements of the game are spot on. Sneaking into abandoned buildings and picking them dry quickly while trying to keep the zombies away is so rewarding when you finally find the materials you need or the items you want. Making sure that everyone in the community is happy, healthy, and doing their part was quite fun. Story is pretty standard, zombie outbreak, you have to survive it, the Army did stupid stuff, and now we have to find a way out. This game falls into a similar category as Papers, Please wherein the gameplay itself can turn rather tedious but the implications and outcomes of your actions in the game are what's interesting. I spent a large portion of the game watching videos on youtube while just scavenging and it was extremely fun. The game is more about scavenging than it is about fighting zombies, which I suppose is more realistic for a zombie apocalypse. However, my biggest only real complaint about the game is that there are some missions that you need to do for story completion and they are locked off by a certain amount of in game time. For example, once you complete the mission Insubordination you have to wait about 3 in game days, which is about 6 hours, before you get access to the next bit of story. The idea is that you're supposed to do those missions first then do side-quests and scavenging  while waiting for the next mission to pop up. I tend to do side-quests first then the main quest so I don't end up missing any content. Unfortunately this meant that the last 8-9 hours of the game were just mindless scavenging while waiting for the missions to pop up. It didn't bother me too much because I enjoyed the scavenging and because I was watching videos but that sort of game design doesn't sit well with me. It's artificial game lengthening and I don't feel it's necessary or warranted. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed State of Decay as it played like a simpler, less brutal, and solo version of DayZ, which is something I've been waiting for.			"

												I’m completely enamored with this game. Put simply this is a fun game to jump into casually. It does however have its quirks albeit random such as driving into a horde only to have your car suddenly flip high into the sky. Character then tossed from the car only to land back down again amongst the horde and devoured…. Hmmm sad day, sad day. But this is a rarity and the regular updates help keep things balanced.The randomness however equally appeals prolonging it’s game play from the immediate main quest. If I can make an extra recommendation, grab the DLC Breakdown. The DLC is essentially for those wanting more of a challenge after fleshing out the main game. It essentially jumps in after the prolog from the main game. In part it almost feels like a prequel minus the main quests. But it’s the DLC's infinite play that gets progressively harder that has its main appeal.			"

Open world makes it fun.-Lots of melee, guns, and items to be found, you are rewarded for exploring and can actually load up a vehicle!-Upgrading and customizing character adds a lot to the game.-Upgrading your safehouse and choosing what to put in it is a good touch.Cons:-Buggy at times, have had zombies climb through walls and fences.-Seems a little un-realistic how many zombies are found in what I would consider secluded areas.-Easy for the most part,  you can clear out most places by getting a durable truck and backing over swarms.-Blah story for the most part, really didn't care too much about any of the characters.Very fun game that fits well into the zombie survival-horror genre.

												Reasonably good zombie survival game.  I'd say the most exciting moments in it are not as good as the best moments in Dead Island or Left 4 Dead 2, but the whole base building and team management thing is a great spin on this genre that makes it different from either of those two games.  I had fun playing it, but it does It have some annoyances such as camp members who run off at random times, so even after you rescue and make friends with them they aren't available to switch to most of the time when you want to.  The length of the campaign is about 15-20 hours probably and that seems about right.  I liked Dead Island's action better than this one, but that game's campaign ended up lasting much too long so by the end of the game it was just tedious.			"

												In many ways this is the beginnings of the zombie game I have been waiting for. A zombie survival game with an ""end game"" - survivor communities.As it stands I enjoyed what State of Decay offers, but perhaps I have enjoyed it more as a proof of concept than anything else. The world of State of Decay is well realised, and the scale is spot on - the map is full of various points of interest without being too cluttered. The story elements are decent enough as you are guided through the game world - although you do have to fill in a lot of the blanks yourself.There is a lot missing, most notably human enemies / survivor wars - one group in particular I swear was leading up to this... nope. Why am I watching a zombie climb over a barbed wire fence? Hmm. There are some oddities found throughout the game like this.Beyond the survivor communities mechanic, vehicles add a joyous experience to the ""zombie murdering"" genre (if I can call it that). State of Decay's animations are mostly great (if jerky at times) and the graphics, while dated, are charming. The way zombies move and you combat them is much better realised here than in other zombie survival games. Melee combat is nicely played too.All in all I recommend this game, if only to support Undead Labs' future work. If State of Decay is any indication, we're in good hands.UPDATE: Lifeline DLC was quite fun - great to get a new map to explore, and a few new characters. Definitely worth a few dollars if you'd like to journey back into the world of State of Decay. Some welcome enhancements, too: vehicle storage and automatic unloading of supplies are awesome.			"

												I had my doubts about State of Decay, suspecting yet another shark hunting the blood of Day Z fans.  I was wrong, and I am very happy to be wrong.  I enjoy this.  It's a fair bit strategic, and a fair bit luck based.  It's all built around survival, maintaining and upgrading a base and outposts, as well as recruiting survivors to your group and keeping them happy.  Oh, and there's zombies too, and they're ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  This game is punishing, even on the easiest difficulty.  Sometimes it's downright unfair, BUT you can learn from your mistakes, learn the game, and get better.  My #1 gripe here is that there's no coop, and I hear a sequel with coop is already in the works, so we'll see.  Great buy for me.			"

												I would definately recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing zombie killing games, I loved it!A brief summary about this game: - Its singleplayer and has a great main story (it also has plenty of side missions) - It has a large open world so you can run off to explore and scavenge for resourcres when you want - During the story more new bases become available that you can move to (and upgrade to add different types of rooms eg library, garden, repairshop, etc all with different benefits) if you choose- You meet new survivors and they can join your group and you can change to control each one when you are friendly enough- Each survivor has different traits and you can choose different fight styles to level up - You can use vehicles to move around the map quickly but noise attracts zeds- There are different types of zombies to fight (eg: ones that explode) - When you exit the game real time continues ingame and so depending on how many days it is before you login different things can happen without you, usually resoucres used for different events so you need to build them up again or you need to talk to another survivor who is upset/angry and not coping well.Although there are so many alpha zombie games right now and state of decay is older and only singleplayer, I still believe its a classic and worth grabbing in a sale :)			"

												It's a decent game, but I'm still giving this one as well as the Breakdown DLC a thumbs down.The game starts out quite promising, but turns out to be repetitive and boring as soon as you've established a decent home base. The zombie sandbox seems vast at first, but excitement fades when you realize that the houses are pretty much the same everywhere. There aren't that many interesting items or people to find. And even though Breakdown seemingly adds more challenge to the game, things get pretty easy as soon as you've established a home base and started upgrading your characters. Your neighbors are super needy, you constantly need new equipment for your home base and there's always some shmuck that has to be saved or a zombie horde that has to be mowed down. In the end you just drive repetitively from one waypoint to another until you've helped everyone with their needy needs and the game is over.At worst the zombies are mildly annoying. The fight system doesn't offer much immersion. You just keep clicking and ""smash spacebar not to die"". The game would have benefited from a more hands on fight system like they had in Condemned.State of Decay had some redeeming qualities, mainly the way you're able to earn people's trust and create a community of survivors. The scripted events breathe life into the characters who are actually able to do some useful stuff on their own while you're completing missions. And if they die you can't bring them back. The graphics are pretty okay and there's a satisfying POK sound when your baseball bat hits an armored zombie's helmet.The game is very ambitious, and while it doesn't suck horribly, I still feel it falls short.

												Short Version Review:""Crashed a pickup truck into a guard rail, got stuck, got beset my 20 zombies pouring out of the nearest house and lived !  Thank you, sledge hammer!  Then rammed a junky little sports car into the truck over and over until it was off the rail.  Got the truck back, left the burning car .... Thumbs Up !!!""Slightly Lengthier Review:So far, so good !  To start, I'll begin with the disclaimer of ""I've never played a zombie apocalypse game before this one.""  Unless you count some of the Fallout Games ( mmmm ... a lot of those mutants were pretty similar to zombies ).  Anyways, after a couple of crash n' burns both figurative and literal, I'm on my 3rd run of this game and it's a pretty fun romp.  There's a whole steamin' pile of paranoia to be had exploring in the towns, trying to keep one eye on the stuff you're trying to scavenge, and another eye out the window for things that might be jumping through it, trying to eat you.  An ear to the ground also helps.  Screamers are no picnic.  And it also might help to drive a little better than me, b/c when I see a mass of zombies coming down the street at me, my gas pedal foot gets a mind of its own.  I've dented enough hoods, lost enough car doors, and blown up enough vehicles to fill a modest junkyard already.  Hmmm, and I'm still just barely into the storyline itself, b/c the act of survival from day to day is a story all on its own.Of course, no game's complete without at least a few gripes.  I wish some of the NPCs weren't so petty or inherently stupid.  Nothing says "" HEY, WE'RE OVER HERE !!! "" quite like the sentry on the tower wielding a shotgun instead of a high powered rifle and shooting multiple times at zombies on the fringe of shotgun range.  There used to be an ornery guy with a hat on the tower - he was a jerk, but at least he had a rifle - can't figure out how to get the girl with the shotgun to come down and put the sniper guy back up there .... or convince her to swap weapons ...The other gripes are fairly mild in comparison.  It's been a bit of a trick for me trying to figure out where the main storyline wandered off to after my original party stumbled half-chewed into this church compound.  We've been fighting to keep our sanity and our skins ever since.  Having a whole lotta fun, though - $5 well spent.			"

												""Puts the survival back in Survival Horror.""Honestly, if you are a fan of new experiences. Buy this game. If you have been waiting for a game in which allows you to fully experience a zombie apocalypse, exlpore a vast and intricate world, and survive by gathering a community and working together, buy this game. It's not just about death and carnage, it's about living.As for Compatibility, port, graphics, and etc, it is honestly not the best. The game is aesthetically beautiful and the lighting is fantastic, but don't go in expecting Crysis or Metro because remember, this was originally exclusive to Xbox 360. It runs pretty smoothly, but has noticable framerate issue when driving occaisionally and seems to have processing issues when you are fighting inordinate amounts of zombies towards the end.After playing so many Zombie games in my lifetime, I can honestly say that State Of Decay is the most unique. What I mean by that is that it's not simply a zombie killing simulator. This game allows you to build a community however you want, and spend your time making the community a better place and gathering resources for survival, all while a zombie apocalypse threatens to take everything you have. It's cheap, will give you a good 20 hours of satisfying gameplay during the main story, and has magnificent replay value. You won't regret buying this game.			"

												The pinnacle of zombie games, State of Decay has raised the bar for any future zombie games. The mix of base building, driving simulator, and fighting comes together to bring a satisfying experience. My favorite, is the fact that zombies can only be killed with headshots. Add to that the fact that your gunshots will bring more zombies and you have a very finite amount of ammunition and you will end up slugging it out with a 2x4 and golf club. There are no such thing as electrified machetes or goofy weapons. The game has a good mixture of realism without forgetting it is a game. Another aspect is that you dont just play as one character. You can play as any of the survivors that are in your community. Each has there own set of skills and abilities. In the end, this is the zombie game we have been waiting for.			"

												I had been following State of Decay, when it was known as Class 3. There was just a snippet of an announcement back in like 2010 or 2011.I was extremely glad the game to PC. Anways on to the review. I'll keep it short and sweet.The game is very, very fun. It offers something you really can't find in other Zombie games. The open world and the ability to do what you want, when you want, is fantastic. Graphics are alright, nothing spectacular but are still good. Story is pretty decent, as this iteration of the game is mainly story. The DLC Breakdown, will allow full sandbox, and it will get progressively harder. Gameplay mechanics are not bad. The game can be arcadey with driving which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it can be very entertaining to mow hordes of zombies down. Probably one of the most important aspects of the game is saving survivors and building a community. You'll have preset locations where you can set up your base. You'll be able to build building modules into for example: Kitchen, Watchtower, Storage, Infirmary, Bunks, Workshop. They modules will you give you bonuses for various things.You'll need to go out and collect supplies to get the community running, and the game keeps track of time, so if you come back the next day, there might have been some developments. However, if that's a turn off, there are ways to shunt it so you don't have to worry about losing everything you worked for.I've spent nearly a hundred hours in the game even though my review won't reflect it, but I can say there is a lot of replay value in the game! In my humble opinion, this is the best Zombie game I've ever played. It scratches an itch that I had for so long!			"

												Imagine Walking Dead Survivgal instinct if it was good and didn't have the Walking Dead IP.Story.Story wise this game is a bit lacking, there doesn't seem to be much going on besides the zombies an some quests here and there, but that's what expected from the game and i won't hold it against it.Presentation.State of Deacay looks really great and the animation looks good, although there isn't much music in this game it's really ambient and is only there when it needs to.Gameplay.The gameplay in State of Decay is great, not perfect but not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ down 3rd aisle.most of the game you are either scavaging for weapons and reasorces, doing a quest for someone or both, the time you aren't doing that is usually spend getting to the places where you can scavage or as a part of a quest.Weapons are common especially melee weapons and finding ammo isn't too hard but finding stuff like health and food can be a bit more tricky.There are also cars in this game, some that works and others that don't and the handeling feels realistic and works well so it's your fault if the car goes boom, not the games.This game also features a perma death system, once your character dies he/she is gone for good and you get a random bloke/lass and continue playing from the safehouse, you can you go back and pick up what he/she had on him/her when he/she died, but that might take a while and takes up a rugsack slot untill you get back to the safehouse.The gameplay can be a bit repetitive at times, but is overall great.Pros+ Nice Visuals+ Ambient Sountrack+ Great but somewhat repetitive gameplay+ Not too hard but not too easy eithercons- Lacking story- buggy- Somewhat repetitive gameplayoverall this game gets 3 severed zombieheads out of 5 soup cans.

												The Legend of OmarMy name is unimportant though my role is crucial to the survival of our enclave. Where Lily may be in charge of dispatch, it is MY role to insure execution. As overseer, I became tasked one day to fulfill a request for assistance by a neighboring scavenger up in the northern section of the valley. I was a bit suspicious that they may be based in the campgrounds just beyond the warehouse meeting place, a ""Forbidden Zone""  to my tastes as I hate sending my people on foot in potentially hostile territory. But recent public relations being tenuous at best, I decided to send one of my new recruits.Omar was his name, a reasonably strapping young lad though limited in skill and outfitted with the most humble of gear. I had him swipe a nearby hatchback rather than dedicate one of our new pickups to this likely hazardous mission and he was off. Omar performed admirably as protector, sustaining but one bite, quickly recovering using one of his four aspirin, but as feared, his delivery destination was indeed the dreaded campground. He didn't even attempt to jump the fallen access bridge, opting instead for the treacherous ledges to the river below. Within seconds of his cresting the rise on the other side, the two were beset upon by a pair of the ravenous undead, swiftly followed by three more, alerted by the commotion. It was here that Omar received the first of his grievous wounds, breaking free just in time to rescue his charge and dispatch the vile company. He was now down to two of his relatively ineffective painkillers and reduced in vitality by a substantial 25%! They continued on, encountering a seemingly endless supply of decaying former nature enthusiasts. Understandably frustrated, Omar opted to make a slight deviation to the supply building in hopes of acquiring a vehicle to plow down the remainder while ""in park"" but alas, there was no truck spawn in this level. Undaunted, they made their way to the picnic gazebo, the final approach to the lakeside cabins below. It was completely dark by this point, making it difficult to spot the retched wandering gypsies so it came as no surprise that the pair was again swarmed by a possible passing horde! Down he went, and up he rose...surviving on mere adrenaline alone. With a mad dash, the true survivors made their way down the hill and through the courtyard, pursued by at least three. A couple of cracks in the skull took down the closest, who managed to reach them at the top of the steps, but exhausted Omar had to leave the rest to the now threatened defenders of the little log cabin. They were more than willing it seems, to offer a helping hand when a breach was imminent but their blaise' attitude toward Omar's obvious distress was disconcerting to say the least. Once THEIR danger had passed, they resumed a posture of eating fruit or lamenting their own sad state of affairs while leaning against one of the walls of the tiny shelter. Having downed the last of his remaining aspirin, Omar turned to the trio's supply locker for any sign of sustenance. "" A pack of firecrackers, a bag of chips and a talking dolly...SERIOUSLY!?!?!"" he shouted. Omar knew that death could await him in scant yards from the cabin steps as the muffled sound of zombie agro pierced his painwracked ears from just beyond the weathered door. Exhausted, sick and severely injured, our valiant comrade opened said door to meet his fate, come what may. Right at the open doorway, one greeted him with a snarl as Omar laboriously swung then kneed the fallen Z in the face but too late...another had climbed up from behind and latched his death grip on the back of our hero's neck. In an instant, he was belly up, resigned to his fate. By some act of incredible providence, the rescued scavenger was apparently close enough to Omar's writhing body when he fell that he chose to act and soundly defeat the remaining attacker!Disoriented but alive, Omar set out to tempt the fates and continue his quest for survival in the cool, crisp night air. Staying close to the rocks, he darted from hedge to bush, patiently waiting for his carnivorous quarry to pass. Through some miracle bestowed upon him by the digital deities, Omar had actually managed to navigate his way to the very banks of the river, not far from the derelict wreck, rusting in it's flow. As expected, three ambling corpses meandered their way past while Omar caught his breath in a bush, readying himself for the final dash. Once he crested that final ledge, he'd be home free since the hatchback was scant yards beyond. As we waited for what seemed like an eternity, I reflected on how far he'd come.Omar had sustained numerous injuries, yet continued the good fight. As a matter of fact, his fighting skill had increased three levels since this journey began, a noble accomplishment. I'd found myself rooting for him at each encounter, cheering him on with each setback. I must admit that I'd begun praising his every triumph, promising him the best of gear, the finest big boy backpack not to mention a personal good word to be conveyed to the curvaceous Amelia C, obviously the object of his eye since she first saved him outside that remote barn to the south. All these things awaited him and more if only he could make it to the yellow Honda above. The three had finally managed to move up river but were they far enough past for him to safely dart across? Omar knew he had little time to waste as hordes frequently descended the river valley to slog it's course, the time was now and he MUST do it...for the love of Amelia not to mention a sweet leather storage bag! Being down to a quarter vitality and a matching stamina, he had to employ a calculated sprint then jog technique to avoid staggering at an inopportune moment. Three quarters of the way to his goal, he heard it, the sickening sound of alert, he had been made! They pursued but he had reached the first step, they sloshed through the running water but he rose up on the second, as long as he kept this pace, they would never catch him in time. The two dead men bellowed below but they had yet to ascend from the icy waters as Omar pulled himself up on the third step. With one more hoist, the taste of victory would be on his lips... but it was not to be.As Omar turned to rise, another screeching cackle greeted him from above, two other undead trolls were waiting anxiously for the their next meal and they were certain that the robust Omar would NOT disappoint. One fell to the ledge    and Omar swiftly swung, catching it offguard as it reeled to recover but it's partner was swift and uninjured, falling behind then seizing our striken friend by the shoulders. By this time, the other two had arrived to join in the fray just as Omar lay back in resignation to view the starry sky one last time before he passed into the night. I was accustomed to responding to the death of my associates with a considerably less rational approach, preferring to go on a geek rampage, clearing the streets with a fiery automotive display. However with Omar, I felt only sadness...at least at first.As the sun rose high, I decided to assign one of my veterans to pick up a group of ""Friendly Survivors"" eager to join our enclave. Normally I would put them through a baptism of fire, using the group as minions to clear infestations or guard as my soldier looted high risk locations. Today would would be different...today would be a day of purging!Apparently, the cover of darkness had hidden a literal hive of zombiehood, no less than seven festering infestations plagued the region as well as scores of loner Zs. It was ""KILLIN' TIME"" in the northland and only the livin' would bear witness.God...I LOVE this game!!!!!!!!!!!!:) Nebo			"

												Do not take notice of the 1 hour playtime, I have worked my xbox to death playing this game. This review will focus on the gamplay and mechanics, story is not as important for this game. Lets start the review!When State of Decay first appeared on my Xbox 360 dashboard I thought of it as another cheap Zombie arcade game, I decided to download the demo and since that day, I have been hooked. This game throws you in the midst of zombie apocolypse and lets you know your only option to survive is to group up with other characters. You then go through the game saving (or leaving) survivors and inducting them into your community which you build up, choose what to build, where to build and what base will be yours. This game takes realism to the extreme, all characters that you can switch between have their own personalities that effect how they react in situations and how their mood is during their stay in your community. They also have their own skills, weaknesses and backstories that let you know what person you want over others and let you feel a connection with these characters. With so many different personalities staying under one roof in such a severe time, problems are bound to happen and sometimes you may need to help calm down a survivor or go take them out and have a chat, maybe someone is scared or upset and needs you to give them reassurance that everything will be alright and this level of realism for what actually would happen in this situation is amazing. One thing you must keep track of is supplies, having a large community may keep it safe from zombies but starvation and illness can hurt large groups. You will need to scavange and set runners to go collect these resources to reimburse the daily supply usage.The best thing about this game is the death, in State of Decay if somone dies, they die. Runners going to get supplies and get caught up by a horde? dead. Survivor is ill and there is no supplies? Dead AND infecting others. This really gives the incentive to stay aware of whats going on and doing your best to keep everyone alive, I let my guard down when I got near the end of the game and ended up with the games first character dead because I left him alone when he needed help. There is nothing more sad than having to go collect your dead friends bag.This game is a must have for any survival lover, 10/10!			"

												I drive my car down the highway, and screech off the side as I hop out of the vehicle.  Lily told me not to use cars (they attract zeds) but I don't really care.  Suddenly, I realize that I'm surrounded by three hordes.  Too far away from my car, I begin to shoot rapidly into the crowd of zeds, until I get pulled apart and see a screen:  ""Marcus is dead.""  I waited for the ""Game Over"" section.  It didn't come.  Soon I respawned back at my home base to realize that Marcus was dead forever, and I had to take up a new survivor.  This game is lethal, a blast, and is one more step closer to the perfect Zombie MMO everyone would buy.  You will find yourself getting attached to characters, investigating things, and dodging hillbilly mafia.  Buy it, and get hours of enjoyment.			"

The story is a bit bland at times, but that is forgivable. Something that is a very hit-or-miss about this game it the ""realtime feature"". Whereas, this game will continue on even when you're not. I was iffy about this in the beginning, but learned to accept and enjoy it. I recommend this game to anyone who is by there computer often, or just enjoys this genre. Also, don't feed the Juggernauts.			"

												This game is an enjoyable zombie survival game filled with action-oriented combat and base management. The main game has an enjoyable campaign and while the expansion entitled Breakout allows you to survive in an ever-increasing sandbox survival situation. Pros: Enjoyable combat, base-building, decent story in the main game, enjoyable variety in survivors you can acquire as you build up your enclave.Cons: Some elements of the game are not that usable, no multi-player, some PC players have had problems with the game on their machines as it was initially designed for consoles.

												I've been following State of Decay since it was just a glimmer in Undead Labs eyes. I personally loved the project from the start and that gives me some bias, but the game really is amazing. I look forward to any more projects by Undead Labs and highly reccomend this game for anyone looking for a very surreal and fun zombie apocalypse themed rpg.			"

												The Legend of OmarMy name is unimportant though my role is crucial to the survival of our enclave. Where Lily may be in charge of dispatch, it is MY role to insure execution. As overseer, I became tasked one day to fulfill a request for assistance by a neighboring scavenger up in the northern section of the valley. I was a bit suspicious that they may be based in the campgrounds just beyond the warehouse meeting place, a ""Forbidden Zone""  to my tastes as I hate sending my people on foot in potentially hostile territory. But recent public relations being tenuous at best, I decided to send one of my new recruits.Omar was his name, a reasonably strapping young lad though limited in skill and outfitted with the most humble of gear. I had him swipe a nearby hatchback rather than dedicate one of our new pickups to this likely hazardous mission and he was off. Omar performed admirably as protector, sustaining but one bite, quickly recovering using one of his four aspirin, but as feared, his delivery destination was indeed the dreaded campground. He didn't even attempt to jump the fallen access bridge, opting instead for the treacherous ledges to the river below. Within seconds of his cresting the rise on the other side, the two were beset upon by a pair of the ravenous undead, swiftly followed by three more, alerted by the commotion. It was here that Omar received the first of his grievous wounds, breaking free just in time to rescue his charge and dispatch the vile company. He was now down to two of his relatively ineffective painkillers and reduced in vitality by a substantial 25%! They continued on, encountering a seemingly endless supply of decaying former nature enthusiasts. Understandably frustrated, Omar opted to make a slight deviation to the supply building in hopes of acquiring a vehicle to plow down the remainder while ""in park"" but alas, there was no truck spawn in this level. Undaunted, they made their way to the picnic gazebo, the final approach to the lakeside cabins below. It was completely dark by this point, making it difficult to spot the retched wandering gypsies so it came as no surprise that the pair was again swarmed by a possible passing horde! Down he went, and up he rose...surviving on mere adrenaline alone. With a mad dash, the true survivors made their way down the hill and through the courtyard, pursued by at least three. A couple of cracks in the skull took down the closest, who managed to reach them at the top of the steps, but exhausted Omar had to leave the rest to the now threatened defenders of the little log cabin. They were more than willing it seems, to offer a helping hand when a breach was imminent but their blaise' attitude toward Omar's obvious distress was disconcerting to say the least. Once THEIR danger had passed, they resumed a posture of eating fruit or lamenting their own sad state of affairs while leaning against one of the walls of the tiny shelter. Having downed the last of his remaining aspirin, Omar turned to the trio's supply locker for any sign of sustenance. "" A pack of firecrackers, a bag of chips and a talking dolly...SERIOUSLY!?!?!"" he shouted. Omar knew that death could await him in scant yards from the cabin steps as the muffled sound of zombie agro pierced his painwracked ears from just beyond the weathered door. Exhausted, sick and severely injured, our valiant comrade opened said door to meet his fate, come what may. Right at the open doorway, one greeted him with a snarl as Omar laboriously swung then kneed the fallen Z in the face but too late...another had climbed up from behind and latched his death grip on the back of our hero's neck. In an instant, he was belly up, resigned to his fate. By some act of incredible providence, the rescued scavenger was apparently close enough to Omar's writhing body when he fell that he chose to act and soundly defeat the remaining attacker!Disoriented but alive, Omar set out to tempt the fates and continue his quest for survival in the cool, crisp night air. Staying close to the rocks, he darted from hedge to bush, patiently waiting for his carnivorous quarry to pass. Through some miracle bestowed upon him by the digital deities, Omar had actually managed to navigate his way to the very banks of the river, not far from the derelict wreck, rusting in it's flow. As expected, three ambling corpses meandered their way past while Omar caught his breath in a bush, readying himself for the final dash. Once he crested that final ledge, he'd be home free since the hatchback was scant yards beyond. As we waited for what seemed like an eternity, I reflected on how far he'd come.Omar had sustained numerous injuries, yet continued the good fight. As a matter of fact, his fighting skill had increased three levels since this journey began, a noble accomplishment. I'd found myself rooting for him at each encounter, cheering him on with each setback. I must admit that I'd begun praising his every triumph, promising him the best of gear, the finest big boy backpack not to mention a personal good word to be conveyed to the curvaceous Amelia C, obviously the object of his eye since she first saved him outside that remote barn to the south. All these things awaited him and more if only he could make it to the yellow Honda above. The three had finally managed to move up river but were they far enough past for him to safely dart across? Omar knew he had little time to waste as hordes frequently descended the river valley to slog it's course, the time was now and he MUST do it...for the love of Amelia not to mention a sweet leather storage bag! Being down to a quarter vitality and a matching stamina, he had to employ a calculated sprint then jog technique to avoid staggering at an inopportune moment. Three quarters of the way to his goal, he heard it, the sickening sound of alert, he had been made! They pursued but he had reached the first step, they sloshed through the running water but he rose up on the second, as long as he kept this pace, they would never catch him in time. The two dead men bellowed below but they had yet to ascend from the icy waters as Omar pulled himself up on the third step. With one more hoist, the taste of victory would be on his lips... but it was not to be.As Omar turned to rise, another screeching cackle greeted him from above, two other undead trolls were waiting anxiously for the their next meal and they were certain that the robust Omar would NOT disappoint. One fell to the ledge    and Omar swiftly swung, catching it offguard as it reeled to recover but it's partner was swift and uninjured, falling behind then seizing our striken friend by the shoulders. By this time, the other two had arrived to join in the fray just as Omar lay back in resignation to view the starry sky one last time before he passed into the night. I was accustomed to responding to the death of my associates with a considerably less rational approach, preferring to go on a geek rampage, clearing the streets with a fiery automotive display. However with Omar, I felt only sadness...at least at first.As the sun rose high, I decided to assign one of my veterans to pick up a group of ""Friendly Survivors"" eager to join our enclave. Normally I would put them through a baptism of fire, using the group as minions to clear infestations or guard as my soldier looted high risk locations. Today would would be different...today would be a day of purging!Apparently, the cover of darkness had hidden a literal hive of zombiehood, no less than seven festering infestations plagued the region as well as scores of loner Zs. It was ""KILLIN' TIME"" in the northland and only the livin' would bear witness.God...I LOVE this game!!!!!!!!!!!!:) Nebo			"

												No Multiplayer?Besides that heres my thoughts... The game impressed me during the first play the game feels like an open world with zombies appearing anywhere and they roam around which keeps you on your toes.I like the RPG element where you level up and choose which character abilities you want to use for fighting, you can also choose different type of weapons, like blunt, slashing rifles, handguns etc.. Another thing I like about this game is it can be challenging, unlike a lot of zombie games you can go around just killing at will... In this game at any time you can be overpowered by a horde of zombies and taken down as you can run out of energy and get winded.. Ammo can sometimes be sparse as well as you are limited to carrying space.The downside is the game can start to get repetitive after awhile which is when I was hoping they had a multiplayer option which would make it a lot more fun.

												Honestly, this is one of the best zombie games that I've played. The only bad thing about it is the story which is not all that intereseting. But everything else is pretty damn good about State of Decay. Things like: exploring around, scavenging for supplies, setting up a base, the fact you switch between characters, overall gameplay mechanics and locations you get to visist (although the map could be a bit bigger). I don't know what more to say, it's like GTA, just about zombies. And it's not a really ""big"" title, but it's good for what it is. I believe it's worth the price for the amount of fun you can get from it.			"

												After just over 9 hours of play I thought this game delivered what it promised. A survival game with multiple dimensions and excellent replay ability. The ""one life"" aspect is fantastic as I have not played a game in quiet awhile with this feature and it really added to the game play. Whenever you lost someone to either a miss calculation or complete underestimation of the other side, it really made you think twice the next time out. Only negative is the lack of an immediately available online feature in the vanilla version of the game.			"

												I held off reviewing this game for a year because when I first bought it, State of Decay was so absolutely epic that I thought it was too good to be true. Well, one year later, after I've had time to process this game all I can say is this:This game is the greatest zombie apocalypse simulator ever made. I've never played a game that even comes close to the pure genius that is State of Decay (Sorry DayZ fans, but no contest here). While I admit the graphics in this game are a bit dated, there are a few annoying but minor glitches, and after many many hours of this game it can start to feel repetitive but everything else more than makes up for it. The controls are reminiscent of Resident Evil 4, the atmostphere is similar to that of The Walking Dead, and the ability to control an entire group of survivors trying to survive a zombie apocalypse is just the icing on the cake. If you don't already have this game do yourself a favor and BUY IT NOW (At the time of this review it is currently 75% off the base game and both DLC) I also recommend the Breakdown DLC if you're looking for more of a challenge and the Lifeline DLC for an entirely new story.

												Would have given this game a decent review, but not after the devs ripped off it's customers by turning what should have been an update into the 'year one edition'...essentially the same game again but with new textures and a $22 dollar asking price.The original game has now been abandoned in favour of the Year one edition, which isn;t much better it seems. If you'd rather buy that then feel free, but be aware it'll likely be abandoned too when they repackage the same game again and call it the Year 2 edition, for a whole new asking price.Instead of remastering, they should have made a sequel, with co-op like we all want. Clearly that is beyond the developers who can only keep replacing the textures on their dated graphics engine.Do not reward this dodgy practice. Do not buy.			"

												I played this game a lot more than I thought I would but I thought it would be more worth it. This game provides an illusion of depth and replayability. It had potential to be way more dynamic and varied but fell short in the aspects it wanted to show off most. It's still worth the amount it asks for and is fun for a short while. However it definitely isn't as replayable as it would like to boast as most of what you do will start to feel like the filler content it is.State of Decay is a game with a lot of depth to characters and an interesting take on surviving an apocalypse for the ""Long-Term"". In my eyes it is a game where the goals were about building a strong, large community to rebuild civilization. Most zombie games I have played focused on escaping a threat or surviving relatively short terms of time without safety. State of Decay answers some of the questions of what might happen after that.The Basics of the GameThe tutorial gets you through a typical zombie panic scenario so it can focus on the main aspects of the game. The game really places focus on settling down in a base and holding your ground which is somewhat conflicting with the large map. You will quickly find strength in numbers by teaming up with a community of survivors. The character you play as cannot protect themselves alone and you'll need to take shifts with other characters so that they can heal or sleep. With the community caring for each other you are able to thrive in the apocalypse by maintaining a good base. A good base is maintained and upgraded with obvious essentials like food, fuel, ammo, medicine, and building materials. You can get these essentials by scavenging or trading. By making a strong and safe community you'll gain attention from competing communities and even the military. The military has more power and resources than anyone so gaining their attention and trust allows you to escape and ends the game's story.Conflicts and Negative PointsI felt like this game had an unclear focus for player objectives. State of Decay places a lot of focus on both exploring a huge map and settling down in a single, small base. I will say that the map for this game is absolutely huge and I was initially very impressed with how much content it had. However, exploration is encouraged but it doesn't really provide any unique incentive to do so.No incentive to explore the huge mapYou could complete the entire game by staying in one base. The benefits from moving to a different base are not very noticeable and the places you can set a base at are very limited (I think 6 or so places). Getting the largest base possible is important to have more people and facilities but the benefits for having a large base is too small. Having a different base might let you have 13 people instead of 10 but having more than 8 people is probably more than enough to easily survive. Some bases allow more facilities but it doesn't really matter as long as you have a few basic ones. Packing up your base and moving is pretty much only dependant on finding a base that can hold as much people as possible and what scenery you like to look at.There are no areas that offer unique resources. Living in one area is pretty much just as resourceful as living anywhere else. There is no reason to go somewhere far to get something valuable making less of a reason to explore the huge map.Materials for scavenging are seemingly infinite. I thrived way too easily, I had too much food and medication than I could ever need just by staying around my base. You might scavenge the area around you dry but I never reached that point. Additionally resources are randomly generated so that might be impossible.Story and Missions are lackingAt the same time the game places focus on being story driven and infinite playability. Perhaps the only part of the game that actually encourages you to explore unvisited locations is the story. However the story is extremely short and will only show you a tiny percentage of the entire map. The story will easily skip large chunks of the map which shows how useless it was to actually make the map as large as it is. The impact of the story with the rest of the game world is minimal because it struggles with trying to be infinite with filler content.The events of the story don't matter to the world. The game uses cutscenes sometimes but doesn't give them any cinematic impact. The supposed ending of the game felt as important as tying my shoe. The lack of music made story events all the less unique from the rest of the game. It was very clear that none of the story mattered after the intro which is insanely deceiving when the first moments of the game are very heavy on letting the story drive the player. After that first tutorial ""chapter"" it quickly feels like nothing matters.The infinite playability is advertised because of the endless respawning of 10 kinds of very simple missions. It actually felt like the game placed less emphasis on the story as an excuse to say the story doesn't matter and you are meant to endlessly play the game. State of Decay says it's dynamic by randomly generating things like events, missions, resources, and characters which would be interesting if the randomizations had more variables. The random things in this game are basic templates. You will quickly find a character who has the same voice actor as someone standing right next to you. Most characters will literally say the exact same script as someone else. Every random mission plays out the same way. A rescue mission is always a ""rescue"" mission and nothing unique ever changes with a mission besides the location and people involved. These missions don't even really get harder as you progress through the game. In the end, the ""Dynamic"" events become annoying, unoriginal filler content way too fast.I mean you can pay extra to get the DLC which adds a gradual increase in difficulty and more variety but these seem like things that should have been in the game anyways. DLC shouldn't charge to fix a game's flaws or even worse, intentionally reduce a game's core aspects for a quick buck.			"

												Kind of buggy, kind of ugly, and kind of not exactly everything you wish it would be, State of Decay is nevertheless a great game that deserves your attention.   At first glance there is no doubt that this was a port from the Xbox 360.  The game looks like it needs a good coat of Anti-Aliasing turned way up.  The keyboard and mouse controls work, although the game feels better when played with a controller.  The game play itself is richly satisfying.    You and group of survivors, search and scavenge your way through a fairly large map dealing with mobs of zombies.   Smacking, hitting, shooting, all work well and is richly satisfying.  Zombies are not that dangerous, unless they are in a group.  There are special zombies which can be a challenge, and they keep you on your toes.  The story is… Okay…  You rescue survivors, and work on trying to figure out why the dead are eating people.  Its okay, but really what you want to do is your own thing without the story pushing you along.  Rumor has it a free mode is coming soon.  In which case, without the confides of the story, the game should becomes more enjoyable.  For $15.00 you can hardly go wrong, as there is hours worth of gameplay that goes along with it.  Give it a look.			"

												One of the best Zombie Apocalypse game I've played so far, after ""The Last of Us"" of course, but I think it's a game worth having even if you play once in a while.It combines the adventure/fighting/shooting styles of various types of games, plus a sort of ""Sims"" society build and improvement based on the specific actions and quests you achieve, giving it a sort of RPG feeling to it.  It also offers the possibility to scavenge and retrieve items/meds and such or just go out there gather ammo/weapons and fight some zombies or just drive over them. Or just be stealthy and struggle for survival of the fittest.Therefor it's a game worth having as it offers various styles to have fun.			"

												7.5/10State of Decay is a lot of fun, but not without it's shortcomings. It plays a bit like GTA, but in a zombie apocalypse based world.It totally nails the feeling of holding back a never ending tide of undead, and slow looming desperation. The gameplay is simple, yet fun. Managing your base and survivors is cool, and you end up becoming attached to your favorites. (I actually restarted once because my ""main"" character got overrun by zombies.) Building up your base, and upgrading facilities was rewarding while not being overly in depth to the point it was annoying.The combat is easy to pick up, the weapons have variety, and the enemies have a decent amount of difference between them. I like how sound attracted enemies while scavenging for survival tools, and made it seem threatening to be out there, especially when alone. Gunshots attract anything in range of the noise as well (until you get a supressor), which made gunplay a double edged sword.The cons are: Random bugs with Zombie placement/walking through walls. Lack of quest variety, and being unable to do multiple quests at the same time. Overall, I was very pleased. While the game does get bogged down a bit in the late game due to lack of mission variety, it's a very enjoyable experience overall. It's the most realized apocalyptic world I've played in a game. No rails, you can go anywhere, and it's fascinating to see the world they've created. I'd totally recommend this to any Zombie game fan, or anyone wanting a solid gaming experience. Great bang for the buck!			"

Can customise home base, create outposts which allow you to store anything you scavenge from houses, banks, garages etc.Would recommend to any fans of zombie games, its a bit different from your typical zombie game which is refreshing.This game is crying out for coop though.

												This is a pretty great game. Nice little zombie survival; got a band of people, save more to add to your band, collect supplies to sustain them, find weapons to protect them, build a base for them. Its pretty addictive, and the achievements are pretty fun too.Some things you'll either like or hate: no save points (dead is dead, a destroyed car full of suppies is gone), time passes while the game isn't running. There are ways around both of those using external programs like Zombie Standard Time if they annoy you. "

Lifeline has great deal more guns, some new base upgrades, but don't like the fact that people die so easily plus you gotta worry about threat level of zombie attacks on the base so frequently.  I know others will disagree with me, but hey, it's my opinion.  I like to explore and level up my characters.  It seems like you don't have that luxury so much in Lifeline DLC. Double thumbs up for State of Decay though.			"

												Lets start by saying a known name on t.v. hit series The Walking Dead. Any fan of the walking dead series will love this game. Describing it with the hit name series is much simplier for me than to explain what State of Decay is about, but, lets get to it anyways. :)State of Decay brings you to a world with set objectives and has a storyline. Breakdown and Lifeline add's more of a open freedem make and survive you're choices. Everything from searching for loot, key objectives, survivors, cars, homes & forts. Infection is everywhere and the spawn system on the zombies can be you're dieing breath. Minor bugs do happen but overall the gameplay makes up for it. The game is updated every 3 months or so since I've got it. & sure everyone agree's, multiplayer or coop support would have made this game bigger news.SoundFX: 7.0Graphics: 8.0Gameplay: 8.0Fun Factor: 7.5Overall rating: 7.5			"

												I love this game it is really good and is a cool take on the zombie survival genre when it came out its difficult. However even though it isn't easy it doesn't mean that is this not a fun game. That it the opposite of the truth, you need to plan, manage and stratigize  for the survival of you group. This game is already great I only wish that there was a co-op feature not multiplayer, just co-op so me and my friend could play together. I mean we still do we sit down and play but, I would love for co-op to have been a part of the game. However this is still a great game definately worth it especially for SoD and SoD: Breakdown. I have not tried Lifeline yet but, I am sure it is a good add-on.			"

Advice: Play past the first level, which is a tutorial, as quick as you can. The gameplay, and story, pick up a lot of steam in the city. Give this game a chance if you like zombies and survival games. You won't regret it!			"
