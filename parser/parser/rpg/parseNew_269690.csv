												RymdResa is a relaxed roguelike that is divided into three chapters. Each has different goals but all involving trekking across space looking for things and not crashing into a sun. It's full of random items to find and is procedurally generated afresh each time you play.It begins in chapter 1 as a laid-back, lonely search for a home planet. Your spaceship follows a compass sentry around the galaxy while raiding derelicts to keep your resources stocked. You pass through different biomes in space, each colour-themed, and each spawning different kinds of dangers (and rewards). You can't shoot, but you can dodge enemies and hyperspace away.Raiding derelicts is mostly just a button press that may lead to gaining stuff, losing stuff or a mixture of both. Sometimes there's a choice to make.As a roguelike it does have permadeath. If you die, you'll need to spend money to buy a decent new ship, although a lot of stuff does carry over: You keep money, XP and any ship upgrades you found. In chapter one, death also means losing your mission progress.[Mild spoilers ahead]Once you've completed chapter 1, things get more complex. Chapter 2 forces you to explore the galaxy unguided - you need to locate raw material and take it back to your home planet to push the story on and earn ship bonuses. Not being led around by the nose makes this for a satisfying contrast to the first chapter - and if you die, you're allowed to keep all the progress you've made with your home planet. But you still need a new ship.Once you finish upgrading that planet, you unlock chapter 3, where the difficulty increases and you have several types of missions to complete instead of one. This chapter introduces different, harder biomes mostly full of things that can hurt you. There are also boss fights!I won't spoil the boss fights, but be prepared to have to outthink the bosses without being able to directly attack them.Gameplay video:

Good & bad stuff:* The story, atmosphere and graphic style are excellent. It all fits together perfectly. Just be prepared to fiddle with the gfx settings, the scanlines etc aren't for everyone.* Be prepared for gnomic poetry floating in space and pop-up ship logs about loneliness. If you find this sort of thing annoying, you're out of luck. * You do have a choice of up to 8 different ships to start out in, but you have to pay for most of them. New players may find a vicious circle that when they're doing badly, they'll only have a weak ship to use and will find it hard to grind to get money.* Most ship upgrades you find in space only fit to one type of ship, so you can end up with an inventory full of stuff mostly useless to your current game. Luckily, you can earn new items by scrapping a lot of old ones.* It's not always clear why the choice you made in some dialogue boxes result in a ""good"" or ""bad"" outcome, which can lead to the occasional death that feels unfair. * It's a great game for lore hunters and collectible finders. There are legendary items and unique randomly generated items to find, lots of achievements, collectible logs, and items that increase your luck and make hunting easier. You can even personalise your ship with styles, once you've found them.			"

												Well I have given this game 2.2 hours via Steam timer and I can honestly say that I cannot recommend this game. Some people may say that that amount of time cannot give a game a fair shake I think it can. I made it about 5 minutes into chapter 3.Pros:- The music is wonderful and quite relaxing for my tastes. Middle of the road:- The visuals are decent. While I found the background and resource collection objects unique and very well done, but your ship and floating resources were very crude and uninspiring.- The voice asset in the game were in my mind very well done. I do not know if it is a fully synthesized voice or if they had someone reading lines and then ran it through a mixing board.  That being said the actual dialogue/diaries entries were written like a 16 year old trying to be deep, like Jayden Smith's Twitter deep. Some will find it endearing, I do not. Cons:- The game-play just feels mediocre to me. All I have to do click in the direction that I want my ship to go, dodge some obstacles and that is it. But that is all you need right? In my mind no. A person needs challenged, they need to be drawn into the experience. There is no depth with this game-play. I feel that they could have done much more with the IP they created.I think I can see what they were trying to do here and I applaud them for their efforts. This game is not my cup of tea, but it may be yours. Give it try if you feel that the points I brought up are not important for your experience.			"

												Story premise of RymdResa is a bit of a cliche as you see the Earth explodes leaving our astronaut avatar only one hope – to find a habitable place in the neverending vastness of space. Soon you start to realize that your are probably the only human left alive, and that there is a little chance that you will find a new home in the ‘Big empty’. As years go by and your resources run low, so does your psyche, burdening you with moral doubts and at times deep poetic conclusions.Separated in a three unique chapters, each having a different premise, Rymdresa feels and acts like a true space odyssey. As space you travel through is procedurally generated by means of y and x axis there are literally no bounds to where and how far you can go, and for how long you can try to survive.As in any rogue-like game, the basics are difficult to master and take a bit of time to get used to. You gather resources scavenging through celestial bodies and abandoned spacecrafts or picking up particles of astral dust. Well, it’s not exploration as it first comes to mind, as you just need to get close to the objects and click the explore button.There are many different upgrades that you can apply to your spacecrafts; maybe you want your shields to be of a higher capacity so you can take a more rigorous punch from space debris or hostile UFOs, or maybe you want more powerful engine to cover more distance faster, or, maybe you just want a whole new ship with different preferences altogether. The RPG-ish style of your inventory immediately lets you know that there is huge amount of upgrades available. Weapons are permanently offline as there is no combat in RymdResa, and i’m really glad there isn’t any, because the omnipresent melancholic atmosphere is just as perfect as it is. Actually that’s the thing that stroke me the most from the very start of my adventure. That strange, even bizarre feeling of loneliness and complete separation from some kind of a illusionary safe-zone.RymdResa is the most tranquil space rogue-like you will ever play, but so unforgiving at times. With it's unique twist on space exploration and rogue-like features it somehow manages to separate itself from other space exploring titles.Disclaimer: Key was provided by developer for testing the game and for review purposes onlyFULL REVIEW[pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com] "

												RymdResa is not a game I fell in love with immediately. The strange poetic writing, the minimal graphical style, the frictionless navigation of space, and a soundtrack that felt unsettling did little to impress me, until I gave myself over to the experience. This is not a game that will fling obstacles at you, floating through the void of space you will maneuver through planets, asteroids, and satellites in search of resources. RymdResa’s soundtrack slowly won me, as the empty loneliness of space dawned on me. Is RymdResa truly a barren void? Or are there treasures under the surface? It’s time to experience RymdResa.The most interesting thing in RymdResa is the differing gameplay modes between the three chapters. The first chapter leads you around by the nose, to 9 random points where you will collect “resources” and “spacepoints”. The second introduces the idea of a home planet, where you will drag a third currency called “materials” which will be used to build 9 upgrades. Finally, the third chapter smashes all of your prior experience into what really feels like the pinnacle of the game. There are boss fights and endless peril, and it is the only part of RymdResa that feels like a true game.A choice was made between brutalizing the gamer into the ground, or forcing a couple of chapters where you are able to learn through doing in a relaxed environment. Both choices are correct, but the latter is a bit more enjoyable, at least on the surface. The endorphin-rush was considerably less. You must learn the delicate dance of space! Resources will keep your ship afloat and powered, spacepoints will let you buy upgraded ships with a variety of special abilities. From the turtle I used in my review video to an insanely-accelerating racer craft, the variety of ships available is sure to keep you coming back for more. Level-ups will carry over through death, so you will slowly power up your craft and realize your true potential.RymdResa is a beauty of a game with tons of items, ships, and customization. The music gets a little eerie at times, but then you look at the void and realize it should feel strange. The lo-fi graphical choice is still not my favorite, but doesn’t truly matter. While I never find myself overly-invested or absorbed in the gameplay, I find myself endlessly wanting to explore that next corner of untouched space. Huge congratulations to Morgondag on a game that is getting a good amount of attentions, for very valid reasons. Thanks so much for the review copy! I plan to revisit this one in my personal time quite soon.Gameplay:    Controls- 10/10    Fun Factor- 5/10    Difficulty- 6/10    Replayability- 9/10    Innovation- 8/10Aesthetic:    Graphics- 6/10    Music- 9/10    Sound FX- 8/10    Story/Lore- 7/10    Level Design- 8/10Final Score: 76/100 for replayability, controls, and music.Summary: Casual spaceship roguelike offering tons of items, ships, and obstacles.Verdict: If you like space, RymdResa will easily keep you occupied for hours.Full text/photo review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-rymdresa/""Lets Review"" video:

												I sincerely wanted to like RymdResa. I did find it enjoyable, initially, but the latter part of the game is filled with questionable gameplay decisions that detract from the experience significantly.RymdResa is an atmospheric, space exploration game with a somewhat charming aesthetic. You are alone in space, and the story is trickled to you in sporadic pieces of poetry. You have no weapons at all, and your health and fuel are one shared resource, which is pretty unique in a space game. It features decently accurate Newtonian physics, which is a rarity in games. The biggest criticism I can level against it mechanically is that you travel faster when moving diagonally, because your velocity is capped in X and Y directions independently.There's a standard RPG progression mechanic, with experience and levels, and progression is generally preserved across deaths. There is also loot and an inventory system, which can be transferred across different ships. There is a sort of currency, called spacepoints, which you can spend on new ships. You use the ship once, and if you die you have to repurchase it. Equipped items are preserved across deaths, but are not shared between ships.The game itself is broken into 3 chapters. In the first chapter, you have to visit 9 different points on the map. If you die, you have to start over from the beginning. It eases you into the game, and has decent pacing as long as you don't die too often. In chapter 2, you gain a central base. As long as you're able to get back to it, your progress gets saved. It introduces an entirely new progression mechanic, which keeps the game interesting. However, chapter 2 also introduces multiple ways to regenerate health, which makes it significantly easier than chapter 1. There are a few instant-kill events that are 100% RNG based, but that's acceptable in a rogue-like game even if frustrating.The final chapter is where it all goes downhill. You once again have to visit 9 different points on the map, this time to gather keys. Fortunately your progress is saved between points, because you will spend 10 or so minutes playing Asteroids betwen each point, except in this game you can't shoot back. The story snippets begins to grow bland and, by the 4th or 5th point, the game becomes a chore. What's worse is that you have 'boss fights' for the last 3 keys.The boss fights are a simple frustration mechanic. The bosses are space-god psychopaths, and you beat them with the power of dialogue. You are given sets of two choices multiple times. One is right, the other will get you brutally mauled. Sometimes the answer is obvious, sometimes it's obviously a crapshoot ('left' or 'right' is a choice you have to make multiple times). Unless you consult a guide, it is highly unlikely to win in under a few tries. Combine that with the amount of time required to get back to the boss, and you have at least an hour or two artificially added to the game for no value whatsoever.To be honest, I would recommend skipping the last chapter entirely. It introduces no new mechanics, unless you consider attempting to empathize with psychopaths as such. The ending is extremely underwhelming, and frankly disappointing. And the story snippets begin to feel like you attended a poetry reading for longer than 10 minutes.The first two chapters of the game are actually somewhat pleasant. But when judging the game, you have to consider it in its entirety. The last third of the game gives no new mechanics, and offers very little payoff for a lot of frustration.I cannot recommend this game at full price. Even if you are genuinely interested in the premise, you should only consider getting it on a major sale.			"

												Story:RymdResa (Rimmed-ray-sah - Swedish for Space Travel) is described as a procedurally generated space odyssey.  This is absolutely true... but it is actually so much more.  It's pixilated poetry.  It's 2015: A Space Awesomity.  It's the game I didn't know I had been waiting for and I get sad when I think about the possibility that I'd have missed it.It's a tale of a destroyed Earth and mankind's last hope to colonize a new world.  It won't be an easy journey, and like all epic journeys, there is a heavy price that is paid by our lone cosmonaut. Its told in a simple and effective way via space diaries and it builds an intricate background narrative as you play the game.  Nothing is jammed down your throat in RymdResa.Like Asteroids without the lasers; this game is an excellent example that not every game needs violence/combat to be fun and meaningful. That isn't to say that you are totally defenseless; sharp reflexes and some fun items will go a long way in increasing your survivability.Gameplay: Procedural World - Exploration is the name of the game and each run is going to be a little different.  Not just in the position of the neat things you'll discover in the vastness of space but each for the 3 Chapters has a different approach to exploration that helps mix things up. 8 Different Ships - After you beat Chapter 1 with your first ship you'll get many options of new vessels to buy for your next run.  They use starpoints but you'll have plenty to spend on the craft that best suits your playstyle.  You want a tanky Vanadis or maybe a speedy Skadi Cruiser? Or spend a ton of points for the dominating Ragnarok you just unlocked? It's up to your play style; they all have pros and cons and it's a lot of fun taking them all out for a spin.  Some items you collect are ship-specific so putting new gear on your new ride is just gravy.Getting Around - Finding a new world to inhabit will not be easy.  Numerous obstacles will keep your ship from good happy success: Asteroids and debris will try to damage your ship, red mines litter the galaxy, huge gravity-rich suns will pull you towards a fiery & instant death, and, just like a true rogue-like, if you interact with a random planet and it penalizes you too many resources you are going to have to start over.  Luckily your ship comes equipped with a sentry that points you in the direction of my main objective keeping you in the action instead of needing to use a map.  There are also scattered stars you will come across that give you star points & XP that you can spend on new ships and such. Resource Management - Resources are scarce and essential to your success.  They also act as your life bar and your fuel; you run out and your journey is over.  A lot of the game is stumbling across a moon or derelict spaceship and interacting with it to have an outcome.  Usually your get star points XP) and resources but a bad roll of the RNG and you may lose resources instead.  You also may fail to explore altogether!  This process is all done with a single key press and is a seamless, quick way to try your luck and keep the action moving forward.Leveling Up and Skills - Pilot level as you fly through space, survive each year, find random spacedust and complete objectives you'll be gaining Pilot XP to advance your four basic skills;  Exploration (more positive outcomes), Scouring (more items), Technology (allows you to tap into alien technology found randomly in space) and Survival (more found resources) These skills, your level and your ship's inventory carry over to new playthroughs so it gives you a feeling that even a bad run is contributing to a better playthrough next time making this a great game for rogue like fans who are less brutal (perma-death may be available in future updates).Death -  Dying isn't the end on RymdResa.  So you flew directly into a huge sun on accident, your run will be over and you'll need to purchase a new ship next time but you'll usually be in a better position to win next time around as you keep your levels, skills, inventory and star points.  Still, the fun is playing to win!Graphics: RymdResa is a fantastic looking pixel game.  While your ships are fairly simple in shape it helps keep you focused on the amazing style of space exploration.  While space feels as vast and empty as you'd expect that makes the various satellites, moons and spaceships you encounter all the more interesting.  I was always admiring how cool some new thing I stumbled upon looked.  Everything is in a muted bluish color (except those friggin' suns) that just makes perfect sense. Really beautiful stuff, all around.But your spaceships being simple in shape doesn't mean that there aren't a sizable number of fun customization/styles you can find and equip to tweak your look slightly. Its not overwhelming but nice to have as it make you feel like your ship gets better visually as well as stat-wise. Sound:FX: The sound effects are just fine, the sounds of thrusters, alerts and taking damage all work well.Music:  By Tom Croke and Pat Jacobs, the music in RymdResa is an excellent fit for the atmosphere.  Spacey, industrial, everything you ever would want without being too abrasive and getting on your nerves.  The music does a fantastic job of setting the mood.  Space is haunting, lonely and dangerous.Voice Acting: The poetic parts of this story are other voice acted and done so in such a way that it really makes you feel the helplessness and solitude of space travel.  I love hearing the cosmonaut speak they really speak from the heart.Levels/Maps: Space is huge. I found this out this the hard way when I jumped in a teleporter and ended up an insurmountable distance from my next objective.  It became a zen coasting back to the main playable area while trying to minimize my resource usage so I didn't end up floating forever in the void.Closer to home the game is much more active and dangerous.  Its meant to be played in proximity to your missions and this is where it is really fun; but I was surprised the game didn't automatically fill the dead space with more random stuff when I was on my accidental journey.Final Verdict:RymdResa is a fantastic game.  Overall it hit all the right spots with a great universe, wonderful visuals and moving music.  Personally it was a perfect game for me as a fan of pixels and sci-fi games; and the fact it could grow into a bigger game in the future is a welcome bit of hope. The only negative to this game is sometimes the space travel goes on for awhile without anything cool spawning; but these zen moments make the activity all the more interesting.  I hope you get a chance to play it, it's a great experience!Disclaimer: I was provided a copy of RymdResa for review purposes however I was not compensated for my opinions/recommendation those are my own feelings.

Space Voyages are fueled by Stardust and space diaries are the only conversation, in this Interstellar RPG.    RymdResa translates to “Space Voyage.” If you enjoy poetry and philosophy with your journey through the stars, then this minimalistic asteroid drifter game might be for you. Story: Castaway in Space  The narrative begins with the destruction of your world by an asteroid, which is played out in front of your eyes. Then you are left adrift in your rocket-ship among the stars to recount your angst to the darkness of space. The story is wrapped in poetic devices, which are discovered in pieces as you explore various anomalies on your journey. Events are sad, joyful, lonely, and splendidly beautiful in turns; and so goes the poetry to match. I bought the game on release day, as I had been waiting for it early for the poetry. Though the achievements were not popping then, I continued to play for awhile for the relaxing music, exploration, and poetry; which was what I was there for to start with. I had been surprised to find the danger element, I guess, considering the relaxing nature of the exploration. But, it all makes sense when you consider the goal of the game is to experience the angst and solitude of being a castaway in space. In space, it has been said; no one can hear you scream. What did I expect? Did I actually think I could float around in space perfectly unharmed? I mean, seriously. Well, I noticed they’ve added a sandbox for just such dreamers like me. But, in returning to the game today after not playing for some time, I noticed the achievies have been fixed. So, though I have progressed no further than the first chapter to date, I look forward to exploring the “rest of the story.”Game Mechanic: Rhyme without Reason I hesitate to use the word mechanic here, because in all honesty there is little mechanics of control allowed the player. You point your little ship in the direction the Sentry is aiming. What follows is an amalgam of random events: chance and luck, with a small bit of skill. You navigate carefully around space, only able to exert thrust or not. I’ve tried using my Steam controller to no avail here. The keyboard controls are mostly a complete waste. The best option is to just use the mouse to pilot the ship; left clicking to thrust, and right clicking when you come up on a random anomaly to explore. The random anomaly may kill you instantly or offer you a choice of bonuses. The bonuses may kill you instantly or give you goodies. Collectables include stardust, which is both fuel and health, consumables which offer special abilities and are accessed at will with the number keys, and spaceship parts to upgrade. The upgrade screen has a neat little interface that lets you click and drag found parts onto your ship. But, if you play in a skilled manner, you will probably feel frustrated from the random nature of both the objects that come at you and the luck of the dice roll that the exploration uncovers.  Pros:*Poetry *Enjoyable soundtrack & Lovely digital art style*Simple mechanics*Large freedom of difficulty choiceCons:*Minimalistic Graphics*Random Events *Little player control*Screen Resolution both limited & buggedI recommend RymdResa for gamers who enjoy philosophical poetry and random event exploration in the stars. If you are in it for the game itself, and not too concerned with a rush for the achievements, then you will find the time in space well spent for drifters. "

												RymdResa has been described as the world's most relaxing roguelike. That descriptor was enough for me to one, raise an eyebrow and two, quickly see what it was really about. Having started my first run, relaxing wouldn't exactly describe this experience. There was a sense of urgency, lack of control and, a surprising air of hostility. I died within a minute. I tried again and even when taking a more cautious and slowed approach, an asteroid still barreled right into me. I tried again and died within a menu from a pre determined hit to my resources. That's when I realized that the statement was true. It's relaxing if you make it so and go at your own pace but you won't make much progress. It's the peaceful tranquility of a lone existence yet the acceptance of a slow death. That's what this game does so well, it creates an atmosphere of loneliness and quiet contemplation, accentuated by the initial soft piano and stirring audio logs.But who has time to think when you suddenly have to reverse course in a instant and wrestle with stopping to avoid that space rock? The game comes alive when you're boosting straight through the gravity well of a sun because you couldn't pull back in time and in doing so, crash through a field of asteroids. Your ship is damaged but you're alive. How about when you're cruising along and suddenly an object 25 times your size comes into view a little too fast for your liking? If anything, the objects should be bigger because it's the most thrilling rush of the game and leads to some awe inspiring moments. It breaks up the banality, you must be alert and pay attention or you're dead.The point is space is cruel. Not by design but by nature. Nothing is actively aware or trying to kill you. The point is you have a mission and no matter how hopeless or bleak it seems, it's better than just a-waitin' 'round to die. As a diary log says, just do. The poor guy has suffered enough and no one wants to drift around in a circle for 65 years.			"

												You captain a small space ship.  As you go through space and things come up like FTL in real time with random outcomes.  The thing is that your ship's fuel and life are effectively the same.  Additionally gravity has a random and huge effect on you.  The result is you floating through space without the resources to really control what you are doing or what happens to you.  Sometimes you get pulled toward your next objective.  Sometimes, often, you get pulled toward certain death.  One time I spawned, went places, randomly found some really good research, got a bunch of XP, and lived a long and fulfilling life before I died.  One time I spawned, got pulled toward two massive stars, used a lot of fuel to boost away from a gravity pull I could not normally overcome, and instantly died because while boosting you lose all control and can't avoid asteroids in your path.  One time after 10min of play I randomly came upon an event that took away 1000 fuel/health instantly with no real warning (max starting health is 300).  The only constant is the poetry of a spaceman who is dead inside and will soon be dead outside.I like this game because I believe it attains it's own goals; becoming art.  However it also has the habit, for better and worse, of taking the player's time and throwing it away... into a vast endless hypnotic void.			"

												The poetry of the diary pods is beautiful and often thought-provoking, and they very effectively capture the essence of solitude and desolation. This is not merely a game about wandering through space, this is a compelling story about a cosmonaut who shoulders the responsibility of finding a new home for mankind, and who struggles with a profound loneliness along the way. The voice acting brings the diary pods to life, and adds an emotional power that could never be felt if they were only read. This is immersion done right and it is storytelling of the highest caliber. The diary pods, to me, almost single-handedly elevate this game to the status of art, not simply entertainment.Not to mention that the game looks gorgeous, and proves to be an enjoyable challenge. I highly recommend this game if you're in an existential mood.			"

												I never thought there would be much overlap between the roguelike and chill-in-space-and-look-at-things genres, and yet here we are. Rymd Resa is by far one of the most relaxing roguelike-things I've played, with a lot of drifting through the cosmos and collecting star stuff. That's not to say there's no death, or frustrating ends to promising runs, but it doesn't take much to get past that and into the soothing embrace of eternity.Rymd Resa starts pleasantly enough, with a rogue asteroid annihilating your homeworld. Stuck on your dinky starship in the vastness of space, it's up to you to find a new home for yourself and maybe unlock a few secrets of the cosmos while you're at it. The gameplay is very familiar Asteroids-style jetting about but with several extra layers of resources, stats, and items to keep you busy. Most of what you'll be doing at any given time is seeking out and exploring objects in space, while avoiding dangers like rocks, mines, and angry suns.There are three chapters to the game, each with very different goals to tackle. The first chapter has you following a trail of signals across the universe, while the second tasks you with finding resources and returning them to your base. The third is a mix of both, with objectives to locate in deep space while also bringing back materials for upgrades. A helpful coordinate system and objective marker (which is actually a small companion ship) keep you from getting too terribly lost in the void as you putter about.You're still going to get lost, though, because space is vast and ever-changing. The heavenly bodies of Rymd Resa move quite a bit, with some drifting lazily in the sea of stars and others streaking off into eternity. They're a lot of planets and nebulae and asteroids but also derelict satellites and stations and stranger things like kittens in F-14s. I should say now that this isn't a terribly immersive game, and it gets a lot more mileage out of its chill atmosphere than simulating any sort of actual space.Getting near a safe object prompts you to explore it, at which point several different things can happen. You could get Resources, which serve as both your hit points and fuel. You could get Spacepoints, which are spent on unlocking new ships and abilities via research. You could get a bit of poetic dialog that presents you a choice. Or your exploration could fail. Any of those outcomes can also produce a random item, either a consumable that helps you in your journey or a piece of equipment for your ship. There's a pretty broad spread of items to find and equip, which helps give the game a bit more longevity after you complete other upgrades.There are also levels to gain and skillpoints to assign and audio logs to find, and these are all welcome additions to keep you exploring space. You'll have plenty of reasons to putter around the stars, exploring and collecting to your heart's content... and then a bit of space junk will come out of nowhere and annihilate you. Rymd Resa has one big flaw, and that's how easy it is to die, at least at first. I mentioned your Resources are your life and your thrust, and the base ship can hold up to 300 points. Well, a rogue asteroid is going to do well over 100 points, so if you've been out exploring for awhile and drift too far the wrong way, or just happen to be in the way of a comet, that run is over. You can even bite it from a particularly unlucky exploration that saps your Resources with no recourse.I had a few moments of intense frustration as lovely space journeys ended abruptly and unfairly, and it's all due to how weak your starter ship is. You can unlock better ships with 600 or even 1000 Resources to run with, but this costs Spacepoints and it's NOT a one-time unlock. You're buying that ship for your next run, so you'd better hope it's a good enough run to earn all those Spacepoints and more back. Items and research upgrades can also mitigate these issues, so by the end of the game you should be back to drifting happily through the void. It's just that first hour or so that threatens to disappoint.Hopefully you can get past that hurdle because Rymd Resa is an excellent chillout roguelike full of wonders to discover. The simple, high-contrast graphics and the synth soundtrack are perfect for your treks into the unknown, building upon the strange and solitary atmosphere of your quests. There are some pretty poetic audio logs and text that might annoy you if you often find yourself deriding things as pretentious, but I found they added pleasantly to the offbeat presentation. In the end it's a relaxing journey in a colorful, creative galaxy that I find myself just as strangely drawn to.			"

												SUMMARY: A strange, relaxing, poetic, journey-based roguelike about a lone traveller in space and his mission to help humanity.  Simple to play, RymdResa manages to be both challenging, interesting, and set a wisftul, lonely mood all at the same time.  Worth it for fans of rougelikes, journey-based games, and people wanting something unusual and atmosphric.RymdResa is a bit difficult to describe.  It's a Space Roguelike, where you gradually build up a ship and a pilot (and more) to take on adventures (through much permadeath).  It's also an artistic, moody, journey based game about one lone traveller with a poetic soul, facing the void and a mysterious mission.   An atmospheric roguelike if you will (that's my current term I'm sticking with).You start out in a lone ship after the loss of earth, following vague signals to search the galaxy for particular locations.  Your ship is supported by Resources, which you can find by exploring various worlds, ruins, and artifacts or using abilities and equipment.  Running out of resources means death, and as using your engines or hitting a danger (helpfully outlined in red) costs resources, you want to keep them stocked up.Travelling will result in random locations coming up, occasional obscure choices, and your character's own poetic observations.  Time passes as well, and every year you may get a new poem, or an incident that changes the game a bit.  Your character also gains experience and equipment, both of which carry over between games.  Research pods let you add new features to your ship - and in an intersting rule twist, require time to develop, so researching something simply requires you to play or wait.   Eventually you can construct your ultimate pilot and ship - though it's still going to be tough.Adventuring also nets Starpoints, which are spent to respect the character, to purchase new and better ships for that mission only), and so on.  Starpoints also carry over between missions, thankfully.Fiinally the loss of a pilot may let you purchase temporary boosts for the next game - use them well.The game is divided into three chapters, each of which has different goals and requirements - on top of assorted side quests you can do.  Your strategies and experiences will change as you explore and upgrade  and encounter more of the mysterious tale.The game's atmosphere of isolation, drifting, and speculation is maintained by its music, the character's occasional musings, and the strange and surreal universe the character voyages in.  You may encounter a piece of poetry or a few words hanging in the void, or a space station with tentacles.  One area of space may be interted, another with a background of a pulsing star.  RymdResa is it's own surreal cosmos.The developers, as of this writing, are also supporting it with new content and quests.  These people really care about their game.The simple play, the many options, and the atmospheric presentation combine to make the game both relaxing and challening, both strange and familiar.I will note the difficulty curve is going to be different for different players.  Having seen other people's reaction to playing the games, it seems some people take to RymdResa and its easy - for others challenging.  As a guy with a near-supernatural ability to run into things in this game, I was the later.Is RymdResa a good game?  Most definitely, it shows true artistic craftsmanship, it's easy to pick up, provides depth, and can really reach you.  I've enjoyed piecing together the story behind my ever-returning lone astronaut - or perhaps I'm just making one up from the pieces of poetry.  The game also has a certain compelling element to it that draws you back.Is it for you?  Well, no, it's not for everyone.  It's best for:* If you like Space Roguelikes, flying around and exploring - but also want to relax and not have huge amounts of combat or complex trading routines.* If you like journey/travel based games but want something more, something to prod you.* If you like experimental games then this is definitely for you.  RymdResa achieves a certain ""something"" that's worth exploring.  There's something compelling about it.* If you want a game that mixes challenge and relaxation in the right amount - but doesn't hold your hand.So make the call.  Perhaps you'll join some of us in the stars, ever-returning, reading cryptic poetry in space as we try to save humanity and ourselves.			"

												This game has got so much depth to it, and between the music, the diaries, and the vastness of the distances you travel, it really evokes a sense of the solitude of space. If you're looking for a shooter or a ship-builder or an traditional RPG, it's probably not for you. But if you want a game that will make you ache in your bones and reward patience, it's sick.			"

There is something about the simplicity and zen-like nature of RymdResa that I just love.Essentially, this is a rogue-lite title that is best played with a controller from the couch. You navigate a spaceship through a fairly simple gravity-based physics system in space. Don't hit bad stuff. Collect a 'star-like' currency. Upgrade your ship. Unlock better ships meta-game style with the currency. Collect weird poems and just figure the whole thing out.Pros:+Fun little zen-like space game that will have you playing in short, yet still engaging play sessions.+The artwork is certainly original and is very nice, in my opinion. +The universe all has a ambience and feel to it.+Metagame unlocks.Cons:-Yeah, it's a bit pricey.Another little indie gem that is certainly worth it when it is on sale.

												While a bit complicated to get into at first (like any roguelite) this game really got me interested after I spent about 20 minutes to get my bearings. It took me another hour or so to really understand, but this game is a very relaxing, slightly eerie game of exploration.There's lots of persistent progress (equipment and levels) that make failed runs much less painful, and generally if runs are going to fail it seems to happen pretty early on. There's lots of ships for different play styles (I love the turtle ship) and the graphics and music really add to the haunting yet peaceful atmosphere.My two major complaints are yes, starting is a bit rough, and the game has some near-instakill events at random that can discourage exploration. Especially in the starting ship, exploring a planet can mean certain doom even when not at particularly low health. I don't mind a bit of risk, but randomly taking 200, 400, 1000 damage in a game where you start with 300 health feels unnecessary and goes against the 95% chill vibe of the game.All in all, totally recommended, just remember it's a roguelite and that means you die and there's a learning curve.

												God if this isn't the calmest, most difficult game I've ever seen. Beautiful in every way imaginable, from the custom soundtracks for each ship you can fly in, to the backgrounds of the space around you that shift when you pass through different zones, this game is literally art. If you're a poetry fan you'll like the fact that the only voice acting is read poetry from the pilot, which also helps unravel more of the plot as you go along. Very calming besides the fact that, as any good rogue-like will have, it's nearly impossible to progress the story for a very long time. For instance, i nearly completed the first chapter when i got a gift from the game for travelling through space for 8 years: a wormhole that puts me all the way back at spawn point. But besides the unfair RNG, one of the best games i've play in a while.tl;dr this game makes me want to ♥♥♥♥ space and you should too.			"

Rymd resaRymd Resa...Some say only darkness can explain what this game is.This game is an wonderful game who you would just want to replay only for the music and graphical artwork.The game has an very interesting way of bringing you in the game, there is no tutorial?!Huh. Thats weird right? Let me tell you it isn't. The game gives you information what to do and on the way of doing things you got to meet amazing things and artwork.You have 8 ships wich you can collect customizables for wich have certain ratings. Normal/Rare/Legendary so and so fort.The experience of both ''Survival'' or ''The main missions/story'' and ''Sandbox'' Are amazing!At the ''Main story'' You get the thrive to really get a good score, and at the ''Sandbox'' you have the openness to relax and play some music(*Uhum

												A hopeless mission: a lone man sent out into the abyss looking for salvation. The longing for a new place to call home drives him deeper into the void. Hints of life still remain, yet nothing in this empty universe can replace the utopia he was forced to leave behind.That isn't the plot of the game...its how I feel everytime I think I've stumbled across a spiritual successor to FTL. Rogue-like space exploration, ship customization, an original concept, and choices that matter, all of these promises convinced me to give RymdResa a chance. I give credit to what seems like a genuine artistic attempt. Slow safe travel emulates the solitude of a long solo space mission, while rocketing forward into the unknown represents the urge to discover, to explore, to hope. The art style fits, as do some of the game mechanics, all of these shades of blue and grey traveling through spaces on their own axis make your lonely little ship seem like an afterthought. On the surface I see endless potential...the existenial trappings of films like 2001: A Space Oddyssey or Moon.Too bad the game is as empty as its space theme. Gameplay is more or less Asteroids minus a gun. Motivation to explore dissipates as soon as you realize choices dont matter. At all. Fly til you die, every experience feels the same. Then there's the poetry! I get it, poetry is hard, and while RymdResa delivers decent (albeit rather brooding) prose, it also rambles. Endless. Pointlessly. Shut up, spaceman! Get out of my head! I know these are ment to be the musings of madness from a man who has spent years in solitude, but I don't need it sprung on me every 3 minutes. Just make these into ""logs"" available from the main menu; I'll read them if I'm curious. Supplement my gameplay, dont interrupt it. Upgrades ultimately mean next to nothing, a meaningless point in a stat that barely matters. Fly slightly faster to nothing in particular! The deeper I try to go, the more shallow this pool seems to be. You, RymdResa, are no contemporary to my dear Faster Than Light. You are simply a pretty face with an empty soul.And so for a brief moment, I thought I had found a new flame, but alas, she is cold and superficial. The spark fades, we drift apart, and once again I begin my hopeless mission. The next FTL is out there. It has to be. But not here. Not like this. Prehaps I will find it in my next life. For now though, I press on into the unknown. Godspeed. *mic drop*Nevermind. I'll just smash into the sun again. I hate you, Poetry Slam Spaceman.			"

												A very strange little game - drift through space, try to collect resources, try not to die. Things attack you, but you can't attack back, only avoid. There are different zones with different 'weather' and things to find, and somewhere lurking out there are berserkers...It's definitely a rogue-lite. I died within 15 seconds of starting my first game. But then you learn what hurts, and can go longer and longer - at this point it's very relaxing since I never die.  You may wonder why things are so weird, well there does seem to be a reason: It seems to be an examination of crippling depression and loneliness after a traumatic event that I won't spoil even in the spoiler section, but should become obvious.A couple tips: 1) If you find a Research Zone, /scour/ it for all the research info. These are relatively rare. 2) At first boost your resource stats, but eventually boost your item finding stats - a good shield will really pay off, 3) recycle items you can't use - do enough and you get a recycled item - some are crap, but some are amazing. 4) Steering is INERTIAL. Once you get up to full speed do not keep holding down the accelerate button, or you will burn all your resources fast. 5) Once you hit max level, reallocate your pilot points - at that point you need much less survivability, much more exploration.

												Ok this game is going to need pros and cons because not everyone will enjoy this game.Pros:- Very cool retro graphics. The atmosfere is amazing. It perfectly represents the loneliness of space.- The diaries are really cool and adds to the atmosfere- The physics are really realistic.Cons:- This game can get really boring. This game is not full of action and pew-pew's like other space games because it  represents loneliness. There is the eventual asteroid crash. - Unexpected death. I know this game is rogue-like, but sometimes you unexpectedly get to an asteroid field, and you crash into asteroids before you are able to escape and you are dead. It's especially annoying when you have a lot of materials and you lose all of them.This game is good while you watch some shows on tv.			"

												It's relaxing and enjoyable to play off and on.  Can be a tad infurating at times when you are on a crash course with an asteroid or sun and can't maneuver quite quick enough but you typically just shrug it off and start again.Not quite sure if the price is on point, I'd say $7 would be the sweet spot, but I've got roughly 5 hours in and I can see me throwing a few more hours into it so I guess maybe $10 or so isn't too bad.  I got the game in a $3 bundle however so this game has paid for the bundle itself as far as I'm concerned.You just fly towards objectives and collect stars and research discoveries while picking up resources and items along the way while unlocking milestones and stuff while leveling up and surviving for as long as possible.  You can unlock additional ships that each have their own perks but I have yet to really get into the meat of this game and a lot of things are still locked for me and I have only stumbled across a tiny handful of items.It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea but if you like exploring in a very relaxed casual setting and mood you may enjoy this game.  If you're looking for an intense space shooter you may wish to look elsewhere.			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough. Is it unfair at times? Of course. Is it vague? You betcha. In a sea of top-down rogue/like/likelike/lites, this isn't really anything that would stand out immediately. But like the rest of us clamouring for this strange combination of game and vague poetic existentialism, it is just that. I bought it at whatever hour of the night and literally played it until 10am the next morning. I honestly did not notice the time that it stole from me. For some reason, like FTL and a few others, I was invested in the futility of my continuous attempts. This is not a stand out review, I know others on here have said basically the same vein of things. I can only hope that you would get drained into it as much as I have, but I suppose there's only one way to find that out.			"

												“A poetic, roguelike space odyssey in a procedurally generated world! RymdResa is a challenging and evolving adventure where abstract poetry and art are expressed throughout a lonely and and calm journey in space.”This game.Well it’s pretty amazing. It’s atmospheric, entrancing and adorable in a borderline creepy way. With your character (or is it the ships AI?) telling you stories, while sometimes even managing to make me laugh.It has you piloting a ship and attempting to fulfill various missions. The graphics are almost a Risk of Rain style – Minimalist, but it works withthe title. Less is more and such.On one hand it is a relaxing game, on the other it is a nerve wracking drift through the unknown. Too often I would find myself coasting along looking for something and then out of nowhere a space rock would smack into my ship, or a sun would appear in front of me. The game is difficult, it is hard, but you will probably enjoy it.It’s a great serving of “In small doses” gaming. I’ve got a few minutes to kill, so I’m going to zip around in space.It’s a somber journey of melancholy proportions with a fascinating soundtrack (I immediately purchased the soundtrack from http://rymdresasoundtrack.bandcamp.com/album/rymdresa-the-original-soundtrack, since I purchased it, the soundtrack is now available via Steam, oh well) to go with the gameplay and help carry it.There were a few issues for me, but nothing that kept me from wanting more.The biggest issues I encountered were due to the Steam overlay. Anytime I attempted to screenshot the game, it wouldn’t work. When I attempted to reply to a message by hitting Shift+Tab the game would immediately crash. After some time in the game I figured my friends could wait for my reply, because I’d be damned if I started from zero again.The game is rogue-like, you have a ship, you pick up things, equip the ship and carry on. When you die / lose your ship you can restart, which allows you to have the same items equipped. There is a leveling system that also carries into your next game and things called Starpoints that you collect, that are essentially currency. To bring it all home the game has various ships to use and unlock, each with their own pros and cons, adding to the re-playability.Would I recommend this game, without a doubt. The game mixes a surreal space adventure with poetry that is far better than any I could write and a unique visual style that works. With that all that being said, the price point of 12 dollars and the type of gameplay nearly guarantees you get your money out of the game. Even if it’s only 5 minutes at a time.			"

												I had fun playing this game. I also got lonely, called my wife over to look at things several times and made my way through all three chapters the game currently offers. GAMEPLAY: You fly top down through space in a style reminiscent of Asteroids- minus the shooting. RymdResa (pronounced Rimmed Reesa) is a nonviolent space exploration game. I can clarify. You are mostly non-violent except for a couple clear screen upgrades. The rest of space didn't get the non-violent memo so your avoiding skills better be ready co compensate. Explore, discover collect powerups and just enjoy the setting.SOUND: Beautiful music by Tom Croke and Pat Jacobs compliment and enhance your lonely jaunt through the heavens. Take a listen yourself! http://rymdresasoundtrack.bandcamp.com/album/rymdresa-the-original-soundtrackIn addition to the music, beepy and boopy sound effects abound and the show stealer is The Cosmonaut's diary. Every two years you ge a voiced entry, be it happy, sad or slightly detatched from reality.THE FUTURE: The other day the RymdResa team asked my opinion on what chapter 4 should be about, so don't be surprised to see more content in the future. What do I think Chapter 4 should be about? Well with the ending we are currently at? Anything. Anything at all would work. Assembling the universe. Traveling back to stop the asteroid that whacks your planet. Fixing the Cosmonaut's broken heart. I want any and all of these.Here is my video review:

												This game is not for everyone. If you're looking for action and combat, look elsewhere. This game is more like a poem designed to instill a feeling in you. It tries to make you feel calm, and a little lonely - but you can't let your guard down, either. At any moment, something can fly towards you and crush you. It's an interesting experience.The game has some issues. There are bugs with use of a controller in the menus. There is no tutorial and learning to play is a little frustrating at times. But if you're someone who enjoys the aesthetic of this game, it's worth playing.Detailed video analysis and critique can be found here:

												I'll spare you explaining what the game is since so many reviews have already done that and you've watched the trailers. I've put roughly 6.5 hours into the game and have a decent grasp on it's everything. If you are looking for a relaxing, casual rogue-like and poetry that adds the ambience of being alone, this game is perfect for you. The price tag reflects what you will get out of this game. That being said, you will kill a lot of time trying to collect eveything despite this game being easy. Pros:-Unique-Addictive-Simple-Price reflects what you will be gettingGray Area:-EasyCons: -Lack of story (3 chapters total. Each one will take 30 minutes at most if you don't blow up in a star, crash into an asteroid, hit a mine field, get GGpew-pew'd from another spaceship, etc.) -I feel that leveling takes a bit too long past 10. Max level is 40. A minor complaint I guess.			"

												'..is a poetic, roguelike space odyssey in a procedually generated world' - full of grave dangers & fine bonuses, without real aim & feel of progression, except for pure manchkin drive to collect the bestest stuff in the Universe.. and of course not to die & lose everything (if you have chosen to play on harder difficulties with permadeath).But the main difference here which makes the experience so poetic is certainly the totally pacifistic gameplay where you only control your ship's motion in the tricky 2d gravity space, trying to dodge the asteroids, space garbage & soulless machinery leftovers, continuing to serve its lethal duty while their civilisation is long gone & there's no one to defend.I play it with Xbox controller & the flight feels really satisfying when in a long swing trajectory I use full drive against a massive sun to escape its mighty gravity field & still manage to pick up some goodies off its orbit. I doubt you can have nice time in here without an analogue joystick, the physics model rules.You have to be very patient, for the bonuses seem totally random, & I generally suggest playing RymdResa only if you have plenty of free time ahead & you totally don't rush anywhere, for it was clearly made up as a dedicated meditative space (pun intended) for relaxed gamepad gravity dancing accompanied by quality ambient music & vague spiritual sayings.I love this game, but there are negatives:1) after some playtime (maybe after alt+tabs, or numerous level ups) the active zones start to slide off the imagery, a couple pixels to the side & down, so that you risk to click another inventory item trying to scrap it, & it progresses, so you have to restart;2) only 3 missions you have to replay again & again on different difficulties until you try out all the ships, collect bonuses for them, find all anomalies & get all achievements, how about a little more tasks for the player? - I understand that the spirit of the game is zen's 'not the aim, but the process' in a randomized vastness, yet still.. more contents would be welcome;			"

												A lot of reviews describe this game as relaxing. To me it is anything but.Let's get personal: I have a phobia of planets and stars, as well as a fascination for astronomy (something that I am trying to deal with, and let's not speak of my addiction to Kerbal Space Program - I have such big problems in my life, I know).The game is thus as mesmerizing as it can be terrifying for people dealing with identical issues.That being said, it is mostly a game of grind, with some surprises thrown in.It suffers from some weird design decisioning, like the Borderlands-level loot chase that don't mix at all with the atmosphere, and seems only to be there to lengthen the experience. Or that quite abstruse leveling system. Or the nihilistic inane narration.Still like it. Or maybe I just fear it. I'll probably launch it again tomorrow. I probably shouldn't.			"

												I know now how Major Tom feels.A single playthrough of RymdResa exists in tension between narrative push and a museum stroll through arresting images and scenery. Becuase death is quick (as it should be if you are standed in space with scant resources), I often looked upon the beauty of the universe and the scraps of humanity's push from our small orb with a scavenger's eye. Did this derelict provide something useful? Does that planetoid have technology I can use? I found myself sprinting from wonder to wonder concerned only with how can I strip it for profit and progress. If it wasn't for one aspect I would say that the press of an oxygen deprived death and afterlife of slow orbit around a derelict space staion would have quickly worn thin. The repeated playthrough structure of the game (I don't want to say rougue-like-lite) provides relief from the stress of dropping gauges and the constant lookout for resources. As a constantly reincarnated lost astronaut, I could savor the snippets of poetry and audio messages strewn about the cosmos. I could wonder at the psychedelic spacescapes spanning the emptiness between mission points.			"

												"" It’s highly unlikely RymdResa will appeal to most gamers, as an emphasis on a slow, intangible offering, especially one that borders on the depression may turn off many. Even worse, this title struggles to properly balance gameplay narrative flow with narrative mechanics. Despite that, RymdResa is a uniquely immersive game that will either enthrall or bore you.

												If there's one game I have felt a desire to recommend this year, it's RymdResa. It's kept me coming back in a way that some large AAA titles just haven't.RymdResa is a roguelite, but it actually falls pretty close to a roguelike; it's fairly complex, although it eschews complex control schemes for ship upgrades and a procedurally generated galaxy with scattered messages and text. Normally I'm not a huge fan of the genre (I played roguelikes back before roguelites came along, and I bear a small grudge about the shift in direction toward simplified mechanics and so forth).The real victory that RymdResa achieves is the sense of scale and the wonder of exploration; it has a solid progression mechanic that persists across games, but the real draw of the game lies in the wonderous awe of the stylized universe. Poetry and philosophical musings punctuate your exploration, and while there's a heavy lo-fi filter over everything, there's a coherent thread of design that ties everything together.			"

The best way for me to describe the feeling I get from this game would be that it makes me feel like a very small blip in a very large universe. Nothing cares about you, nothing changes for you, and nothing seems to even acknowledge your presence. You just float on by. 8.75/10 Can't wait to play more.			"

YouTube™ Video: Quick Look - RymdResa 

			Views: 196		

			RymdResa on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/269690/ RymdResa is a roguelike exploration set in the lonely vastness of infinite space.		

In short, I don't think RymdResa is going to be a game for everyone, but it's one that I've been enjoying a lot.  At its basest level, it's just a game about collecting items, gaining experience, and not getting obliterated by space debris.  Looking beyond that though you'll find a game that's fairly unique, relaxing, and overall a very different experience from your typical roguelike/lite game.  While death will end your current 'run' in RymdResa, almost everything carries over.  Spacepoints (currency), experience, achievement progress, even items all carry over from play to play, ensuring that you're always progressing forward no matter how long your previous journey was.The audio/visual is simply stellar.  Done in an almost Gameboy-esque style, the art is in many ways beautiful and fitting for the atmosphere that the game presents, along with the ambient soundtrack.  While the writing sometimes tries a little too hard to be 'deep', I find that overall the obscure/cryptic style and synthesized narration do a great job of building on that same atmosphere.  It's definitely not a game that's going to give you warm fuzzy feelings inside (at least from my time so far), but does an absolutely amazing job at presenting the feeling of the vast loneliness of space in an almost soothing way.Overall, I really like it and would definitely recommend it, definitely a title that stands out in the indie scene today.

												RymdResa will take you on a journey through uncharted space, have you make tough decisions and skillfully navigate various hazards while you attempt to uncover the entrancing story behind it all.Beautiful writing, haunting music and abstract visuals will be your primary companions on this trip. More than once I was distracted by the image of a nebula or a peculiar derelict space ship drifting by, making me slam my ship into a long forgotten minefield, promptly turning me into space dust.This curious little gem of a game packs several features that become unlocked gradually as you play, and the developers have mentioned the game will grow further with feedback!It's time to get lost in space to find yourself again.

												RymdResa describes itself as a poetic space odyssey which is weird – that’s weird, right? I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when presented with a game described in such terms.

												This is a 2d overhead space-exploration/rpg mashup, with flat graphics and a pretend retro style.The colours are almost monochromatic - shades of blue or grey, with pops of colour in red or nice background changes in shading to indicate areas.After initially finding it hard to get a handle on the game, once I sat down and gave it a good go, I got into it and I was hooked - it might best be described as a ""walking simulator in space"" - it has the same quasi softish-RPG/aimless wandering/survival kind of game mechanic, with some power ups and levelling up through a bit of grinding and simple resource collection, required to survive but not really the aim.There is a story told in chapters, and also a sandbox mode. There don't seem to be any other NPCs in the game (well, none yet that I've found, anyway) - merely artifacts and ghosts of fallen civilixations. There are some rather poetic little pieces of prose that pop-up on in-game anniversarys, and some events that will kill you, randomly and without warning - from being sucked into a large sun's gravity well from which your puny ship cannot escape, to a fast asteroid that obliterates your ship - it can be frustrating, but part of the Zen feel is merely accepting that it all may end without warning as well.I am thoroughly enjoying this game, and would recommend to those players looking for a slower paced, lone-RPG in space.

												Short review:Chilled out exploration game with interesting narrative and enthralling graphics. Heavily RNG-driven, built around dying and restarting frequently with gradual permanent progression allowing you to get further. If that sounds good to you, I highly recommend this game.Long review:You pilot your ship around exploring stuff you come across which triggers events. Sometimes you get rewards, sometimes you get bad results, sometimes you get insta-killed. Sometimes space debris or suns or mines will kill you as well. Your ship's gear will persist through death, as do the stats you get for leveling up, and you can earn one-time buffs for your next playthrough.I still haven't beat the first story chunk and I'd say the most frustrating thing is the amount of repetition that seems to be expected - you're often thrown into unwinnable scenarios like instagib random events or too much stuff on screen to avoid. It seems to me that the only way to get through those types of things is by leveling up your stats and gathering better ship gear.I'd find this much more frustrating if the game's general atmosphere (story and art) wasn't so cool in an eerie sort of way. I'm also looking forward to unveiling more of the story by actually progressing a bit. I've been playing on normal but I'll probably start playing on easy instead.If this sounds like a game that interests you, definitely check it out.			"

												Rymd Resa is an interesting, peaceful game of space exploration. The game really tries hard to make you feel like you are alone is space, traveling vast distances full of beauty and danger, and it largely succeeds. The pixel art and music really contribute to the game's atmosphere. Unlike many spaced based games that focus largely on combat, this game focuses on the beauty and wonder of space itself. It is obvious that the developers really care about this game and have tried to make it as good as they can. This is a very unique game that anyone who enjoys playing video games and learning about space ought to take a look at. I do hope that they add more content to the game in the form of more things to see and do in space and more missions, but they have already stated that they intent to do so in the future.			"

												I adore this game. Probably the best space exploration game I've played to date. Better than Out There, although I love that one too. Better than 0rbitalis... Beautiful music and premise. Relaxing gameplay with enough edge to keep you interested. Built-in incentives to keep you returning after you die. Lovely graphics. Poetic in a way that reminds me of 2001: A Space Odyssey. An all around excellent space game. Simple, yet elegant design. I give it a 10/10.----------Addendum: I have discovered one complaint about the game. It takes way too long to load. But this is not enough of a complaint to even lower my rating. It's worth the wait.			"

Product received for free
												“Hello guys, so, I have this wonderful concept for a game, a really depressing and poetic space exploration game, but I have no idea what to make in the gameplay department, any Ideas?” Said the Lead Designer.“How about a rogue-like, asteroid-dodging-on-ice skates simulator? The frustrating mechanics won't totally ruin the atmosphere and the lonely experience.” Said a stupid yet influential employer.That kind of gives away what I think about this game, but read me out, I don't hate this game, nor do I find it bad, it's just that the gameplay is trying to be a rogue-lite in an atmospheric setting, but you can't deepen yourself in it because you've got to dodge the damn asteroids, so it kind of works against itself, but it also makes some sense, depression and loneliness are quite frustrating, but you can always turn off the game, you can't turn off life (well, you can, but it's a touchy subject), so if you feel frustrated with the rather backwards gameplay design, you can just turn it off and go relax playing Dark Souls or something.But let's get into it, shall we?Earth exploded, and now you, alone, must find us a new home, and so you wander through the infinity of space searching for the perfect planet to welcome us, while having some loneliness induced depression along the ways, and that is really well done, you read these pieces of poetry scattered around space, in clutters of stars, planets, debris, and old vessels; and it really conveys the feeling of depression this game goes for, sometimes you even have hallucinations and hear voices, even furthering the feelings of sadness and loneliness.Nothing to complain in that department. It's actually really well done.The gameplay is simple, it's a rogue-lite, so when you die you re-start, but your progress is saved, and it's very easy to die, because, you know, YOU HAVE NO WAY TO DEFEND YOURSELF. That is so backwards, why is there no way to destroy the asteroids without spending a rare consumable? The only thing you can do is dodge, and it gets old and irritating fast! Kind of like an old man with Alzh… Know what? I won't make that joke.You basically point somewhere in the screen with your mouse and your ship boosts into that direction, keeping the momentum from your boost indefinitely, but beware, if you want to change directions and avoid certain doom, you also have to work against that momentum, and you will probably have that PTSD from the ice levels in the old Mario games triggered. And trust me, there are so many irritating hazards.There's also an really unintuitive level-up and upgrades system, not once explaining the mechanics in-depth. You also have different ships to choose from, and they all have a price tag, but when you pay for one, it's for that run only, when you start the next one, you won't have the ship anymore, I figured that out the hard way.There's also a FTL-like decision system, but unlike FTL, it gives you two choices, and when it's the wrong one the message is basically “U don goofed, pick the other one next time” even though it's all RNG, where in FTL there's story and possibilities and is generally well done.In the end is all really mysterious and hard to grasp at first, but after sometime it grows on you. But that isn't necessarily good, tumours also grow on you, and you want rid of them quick!The graphics look rather good, all the explorable locations are nice, and the ship designs are also cool, and the music is incredibly soothing and relaxing, but the game is so boring, you probably will put on music on your headphones as you play it.And that's the game's biggest fault, it is boring! Really boring, even though you sometimes still want to play it, you can't stand it after some time. Sure, it's supposed to simulate loneliness and nothingness, but this is a game, you better gimme something to do, or is out the drain with you.Overall, I neither recommend nor I don't recommend this game, I got no real feelings from it, ironic isn't it? The game is extremely boring and repetitive, so if you're into that, whatever really. Me, if I wanted to feel depressed, I'd watch Melancholia, with the late John Hurt, may he rest in peace.Read more Video Game reviews at cassus.org "

												An adorable game, made with love and creativity. To me it is a perfect example, why videogames can be art.I don't recommend it to you, if you are looking for an action packed game, but I recommend it to you, if you have an eye and the empathy for art.			"

												Did not think that Space Adventures without vast dynamic combat would get my attention! As the description says, the game is very poetic in its nature - it is something that you'd want to run after a busy day at work when you want to chill.Don't get me wrong: it's still is challenging, you will die a lot before you complete your objectives. To sum it up:Pros:- Captivating narrative- The controls are very easy, but that does not take the depth from the game- Well-developed roguelike elementsCons:- You sometimes feel that the game screwed you over (especially when you lose due to unsuccessful exploration), the random factor feels ""too random.""Might update the review after I play a bit more, but here are my impressions so far :)			"

												Do you love space exploration? Do you love rogue-likes?If you answered yes to either of those then pick this up.  RymdResa has an amazing score that will immerse you into its world.  In RymdResa you are a colonist trying to find the next planet Earth after yours was wiped out by a meteor.  The game consists of three chapters.  Each chapter has different gameplay mechanics.  This game is a rogue like because every time you die, space around you changes.  You also get to keep your upgrades after death so this is more of a rogue-lite than anything else.  Rymd doesn't hold your hand either. Although there isn't really much that you have to understand here.  You fly to stuff in space and press the action button to explore it.  The gameplay is pretty basic.  I did have one complaint and that was there was no in game tutorial to discuss the basics.  There is an in game manual you can read however, you just need to look for it.  My other complaint I thought was that the gameplay was a bit basic and gets boring after a time but after listening to the score I dismissed this complaint after about 90 minutes.Definately give this one a go.

												This game is beautiful and a lot of fun. It's pretty easy to just dive right into it and start exploring space. The ship variety is good and it was extremely easy to unlock all of them quickly.Each chunk of gameplay takes a bit of time, so it's not a great game for hopping in and out of. And it's not really ""roguelike"" besides the fact that there's permadeath, which is what people mean by that these days. However, the permadeth doesn't remove any acquired items and there is a persistent pilot level with passive bonuses that carry over from game to game. Also, any improvements to ships persist after death. So really, it's just procedurally generated levels with ""permadeath,"" meaning progress in quests is lost, but not items. If that's ""roguelike"" enough for you, hop in. If ""roguelike"" is something you usually shy away from, don't let that be a factor in deciding whether to get RymdResa or not. People will talk about the poetry, I personally like the bit of space madness and apocalypticism involved, but that's just me. Worth it at $10			"

												This game is a very unique and refreshing experience. I assumed it was going to be a ""roguelike"" in the same vein as Rogue Legacy, and it's not far off from that from a gameplay perspective. You make progress with each game which goes towards future playthroughs, in short. However, what makes this game worthwhile is the setting contrasted with interwoven poetry and ambience that attempts to capture what it would be like alone in space. It's kind of a unique mix of fast-paced, almost twitch gameplay with a slow ambient artful experience musically, visually, and in story. I thoroughly enjoy seeking out unique games regardless of genre, and this is definitely unique. I haven't made it very far yet and I can't speak on behalf of the long-term gameplay, but for now I'm very much enjoying myself. I can see others who are tired of rehashes of the same game over and over doing so as well, especially those big into video games as an artform.This is a good example of what a game can be like when artistic vision is followed through to completion without seeking input from crowd-sourced game design, like how many early access titles seem to be doing. It's like people vote on what they want to see next and the majority wins. That's not art, that's just attempting to appeal to the masses, and you can't make everyone happy. Just look at the forums for Darkest Dungeon after an update. It also loses that something that makes each game special when developed that way too.TL;DR: This game is delightfully melancholy.			"

												I should say before I post this review that I've only made it to the second stage (out of three) on this game. I'll mainly be reviewing the gameplay. As far as other parts of this game go, I will say that I find the soundtrack particularly calming, and the audio cues convey their meaning quite well.The gameplay to this game is rather simple. First, you get in your Embla Colonizer (or a better ship if you've saved up points), and you engage your thrusters. One important thing to note is that your ship will continue to travel in whatever direction you push it unless something is close enough to exert gravitational force on your ship; usually this will be either a star (deadly), or an interactable object.Your fuel/health are the same ""resource"", so generally you try to achieve a desired speed, and then only use thrusters to avoid trouble. You will feel the pull of gravity from objects along the way, until you interact with them. You can gain and/or lose either points or resources from doing so, and earn xp. Some things you interact with will drop items afterwards; if you're particularly lucky, you may even find items adrift in space. Use these items to upgrade your ship, or scrap several of them to make new items. The only things I can think of that hinder the gameplay are a lack of interface options, such as being able to zoom out (while reducing the saturation or hue of objects further away so as not to give away danger zones), and having a map that has last seen locations/headings of interactable objects.Overall, I've enjoyed this game, and at a little over $10, it's not too expensive. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone that's a fan of space and roguelikes.			"

												I honestly have no idea what the draw here is, for me. Perhaps it's the fact that it only requires the mouse to control the ship. That leaves a hand free for beer. Yeah...First thing, there's absolutely no Pew Pew for you. None of the player ships have weapons, to my knowledge. This doesn't necessarily take away from the game - but it would have been nice to fire back at some of the infrequent enemy ships.Other than that, it's a 2-D exploration game with semi-newtonian physics. Most of the dangers involve avoiding suns, and various bits of debris. All the while there's a kind of relaxed randomness to the environment.For the stat heads and RPG folks, there's a bit of ship customization and a wide range of items for such.I managed to beat it, not 100%, in under 10 hours. So yeah... it's a short game if you just want to plow through it. If you're a completionist, I would imagine this game has at least 30 hours of play in it. Not a bad buy, if you want a weird semi-casual game.			"

												This game is beautiful, and quite theraputic. Cons: This game must be done slowly, because even with recent updates, there are many dangers that you will face abruptly. The boss fights can be tedious since you need to travel back to them each time if you die. There are elements of exploration, and while they are crucial to the start of the game, at end game they aren't really necessary.Pros: The soundtrack, storyline, and narration truly sell this game. If you are not interested in these things, the game isn't likely worth picking up. The game is fun and can be challenging. It has several different difficulties for the storyline and a sandbox mode, which allows you to float through space freely and explore without the risk of dying.The story mode will take a decent amount of time even if you don't go for the achievments or all the missions.

												RymdResa (Space Travel) is one of the most interesting titles I have ever come upon.This game could be described as a mixture between ""Out There"" and that old space game from back in 70's.You have a space ship that you must navigate through space to get to your destinations all the while exploring debris of space techs from the past and space anomalies and planets that you come across.This game some how manages to be one of the most atmospheric games out there with its way of presenting the game and expressing itself.All in all the gameplay system is simple yet difficult to master, the story is deep but easy to grasp, the sound design is a mixture of 8bit sound effects and some very soothing soundtracks that help the game's atmosphere and presentation to reach an even higher level of greatness and the graphics are simple, very simple and yet some how enough to help the game to get to a point that you can easily consider this game a work of art, a true master piece!This game might seem simple and empty at the first glance but give it more than 10 minutes time and it will surprise you.If you are a fan of space and space travel this game is for you.

												Cant recommend this title enough.You traverse space in a small craft, explore different space-stuff, get new equipment, unlock skills and lots more. The game has chapters which have their own kind of goal. In the first one you have to explore x number of things and in the second you do something else. Would rather not say what since the discovery of it is a great part of the game.This is going to sound irrelevant but I'm tired of permadeath games where you spend several hours, then die and now you've wasted your entire evening. In Rymdresa you can choose between different difficulties which decide how hardcore it is. I play on the regular one where you have some progress thats kept between runs so I always feel like I accomplished something.On the higher difficulties you dont keep any progress so its ""proper"" permadeath. I love this because it makes the game appealing for different kinds of players.			"

A Contemplative Searching-For-Your-Keys-In-The-Trackless-Wastes-of-Space SimulatorA game which elegantly combines the strangeness of other peoples' abstract poetry with the curious thrill of stumbling around, searching-- sometimes lazily, other times frantically-- in the dark, for something-don't-know-what, you-won't-know-why-'til-you-find-it. Sometimes, you find the thing immediately, and move on to the next challenge. Other times, you smash your shin into a coffee table, stop, cursing and bleeding, regret for a while, but know that, again, in time, you'll have to pick up and carry on; searching, stumbling, finding. And you are always finding.There are many who won't appreciate this experience-- the thrill of an unexpected victory; the aggrivation of unavoidable defeat; the humbling sensation of an experimental tactic gone horribly right. But if you aren't in a hurry to be anywhere, RymdResa can give you a lot to think, or at least, to feel about. Asteroids, inverted.			"

												RymdResa tries to be two things that can't ever work well together.One the one hand it's supposed to be a relaxing, atmospheric experience with a touch of poetry. In that regard the success is partial - while the music sets the tone during your lonesome treks through space masterfully and the artstyle complements the whole, the slivers of poetry you arrive at during your travels are as if a teenager's first venture into creative writing.On the other hand, the roguelite mechanics the actual gameplay revolves around are needlessly frustrating, without any feeling of catharsis. Especially the third level is an exercise in patience I'm not willing to undergo, as death and loss of progress is sometimes so sudden you hardly have time to comprehend what's happening. It's not a game you can get better at, the winning strategy is to move at a snail's pace and hope for the best.It's just not fun to play.			"

												Rymdresa is a strange creature. It's an artistic indie game where there is no combat but you die all of the time ;) The game is filed with poetry, interesint story elements and a space ship where applying boost at the right time will save your life. Items, pilot level and space points carry over between deaths so you feel like you make progress even when you die. RymdResa is NOT for everyone, if you get bored with exploration games pass on this, but if you like and enjoy games such as Journey and Flower go ahead and pick up RymdResa! Check out the gameplay here:

YouTube™ Video: Swash! ❧ RymdResa Critique (In-depth review) 

			Views: 132		

			RymdResa is a zen-focused (read: slow-paced and at times possibly boring) space exploration game. Developed and published by Morgondag out of Norway, RymdResa is out since yesterday!		

Graphics and SoundThe pixel art style is really pretty. Especially the choice of colours did impress me as all seemingly fits into this wondrous space. The music is calming, relaxing and underlines the slow-paced gameplay well, the sound effects are pleasing, specifically collecting the little stars give off a satisfying bling. On the other hand the voice acting is subpar.StoryThe audio logs, as well as the overarching story and the odd bosses, which require you to communicate instead of fight, all appear to me as if these were written by a first semester philosophical student... and not the kind who actually is into philosophy, but the kind who wants to appear smart, while drinking their favourite organic kale drink or something.GameplayAfter playing more than six hours and completing RymdResa, I am still quite unsure as how to go on about describing this game. Essentially, it is a walking simulator or since you are in space, it is a two dimensional flying simulator I guess. RymdResa has been described as the most relaxing roguelike there is. I would argue against this terminology here, as the only shared game feature between Rogue and RymdResa is procedural world generation and permanent death, and the latter is softened up in RymdResa with some saved progression. When starting a new run, which coincides with creating a new procedurally generated universe, you can select either the starting ship for free, or use previously collected Space Points to purchase a more advanced one. Then, depending on the chapter you are following different missions, either flying towards wherever the arrows points or flying to random locations collecting stuff and afterwards back to where the arrow points. In between you will AT LEAST SOMETIMES encounter stuff, like stars which you can collect for experience, or items that buff diverse statistics of either your current or another possible space craft, or asteroids, mines and the like which hit you and thus subtract the oh so precious resources, which encompass both hit points and fuel at the same time. A rather weird choice for game design to be quite honest. Since speeding around the universe basically costs you hit points, you rapidly are forced to adapt a passive, floating around approach, leading to very slow paced gameplay. This is desired from the game designers though. RymdResa is supposed to be a more zen-like space exploration experience.Problems?I personally just got very very very bored. RymdResa is incredibly punishing as soon as you desire to move at a tad faster pace, especially in the first few hours of gameplay, when you are forced to play the cheap space craft with a low amount of resources, which limits your travel as well as your hit points immensely, leading to unfair deaths out of the blue. Also, the chances for you to get positive outcomes for exploration of planets, satellites and the like are pretty low to start off and only increase with the levelling of your pilot, so basically with time. The weird, semi-exciting but still unbalanced start, completely changes all direction as soon as you reached a decent level, about one to two hours in, where the whole game flips everything over. At a certain pilot level and item point, you have a big pool of resources, are possibly able to replenish them often due to stars, refuel stations or consumables, and the whole game turns out to be actually quite boring. For example, I spent around two hours, just flying about the galaxy in order to find research. There seem to be sixteen different research possibilities, and I explored and explored, flew through nothingness for more than fifteen minutes at times, with literally nothing, I repeat, nothing happening on screen, all while in the end not encountering and still having no idea how to obtain any possibility for research. Honestly, I want to like RymdResa. At times, weirdly enough, I enjoyed flying around and exploring, especially in the second and third hour of gameplay or so. Later on I was just brought to endless tedium.VERDICTSo let me try to sum up this mess of a review. The aesthetics are great, sound design as well, the gameplay at least for me, is too unexciting. Exploration is not rewarded enough and overall I am just not attached to either my pilot or the missions I am supposed to be doing. The gameplay in itself is just not enough to drag me into the game, as it is frankly plainly boring. I want RymdResa to be so much more than it is, sadly it is not. If you are into zen-focused games, RymdResa might be for you though.			"

												It's awful. I guess the game's strengths are supposed to be related to its atmosphere and aesthetics, but the graphics all start feeling the same after about five minutes, the text is uninspiring, the voice acting is of negative value, and the game's aesthetic first conveys the infinite vastness  of space as you float in it, and then the infinite tediousness of space as you float in it, in that order.The main strategic choice you have to make is whether you will travel at high speed toward your destination (incurring higher risk of crashing into a random obstacle and dying) or whether you will travel at low speed toward your destination (and be bored out of your mind). The next most strategic choice you have to make is whether you will actually choose to interact with the objects in space so that you have something at all interesting to do, or whether you will wisely refrain from interacting with the objects in space so that they refrain from randomly killing you via a dialog box informing you that you have just taken damage equal to some multiple of your ship's maximum possible resources, or (more rarely) randomly killing you without any explanation at all, leaving you to ponder whether you just died due to a bug or a feature, and whether in the end it really makes a difference.I kept coming back to this game believing that there had to be some redeeming value that I just hadn't experienced yet, but there are so many more worthy games on Steam, and I can only make a fool of myself by giving this game another chance so many times.

												RymdResa is not only a slot machine, it's a slot machine you share with a nice old lady that can't stop telling you about her life.  She's shy though and talks through a voice modulator.Hit X and make arbitrary choices to see whether you live or die.  Literally.All the while moving through space, finding more slot machines to play she tells you more and more about how at peace she is with her losses .. Except if she were really at peace, she'd let me play my slot machines in peace.In it's defense, the game is clearly geared toward people who need help coping with loss.I'm glad if it can help people, but that's an interactive experience.  Not a game.			"

												This is a very interesting game.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but after the first 15 minutes I think I have a good understanding.  You are the last (?) human in the universe after a cataclysmic event that destroys Earth.  You are spared due to being on a spacecraft at the time of the event, and are left to spend your remaining time wandering through the galaxy in your ship.  You do need resources for fuel, and you consume that fuel by using your booster engine to move either towards objects to explore or away from hazards.  Much of the time I felt like a pinball since large objects have a gravity well that will alter your trajectory and speed.  There are basic missions to accomplish, but they are basically go here then there (at least so far for me).  The game itself is very ""zen"" in that the music, simplistic but not simple graphics, music, and poetry work to very effectively create a mood that, in my experience, is calmly fatalistic.  Some of the sessions were over in about 15 seconds, while others lasted 15 minutes.  There is carry over between games so you don't feel like you aren't making progress, even if you die very quickly.  There are upgrades for ship components that you may find, as well as points that you acquire to level up your pilot to either gain more resources or get better rewards for completing missions.  There is even an element of crafting in that you can research some upgrades, but it is very light in substance.I really like the aesthetic of the game, though your mileage may vary.  If you approach this game as a kind of walking simulation in space, whereby the journey is the experience, you may find yourself really enjoying it as I did.  If you are on the fence about it I would say go for it.  I think most people will know whether they like it or not within about 15 minutes - well within the return time.  This one is definitely a keeper for me.Tl:Dr An atmospheric exploration game in space with a zen vibe.			"

A game is interesting when it forces the player to make interesting choices or learn a skill.  This game doesn't do either, and is not dense in terms of rewards.

												The idea is brilliant, and as an RPG it would have worked very well. Unfortunately as a roguelike it means that you will die from things that you could not possibly have seen coming or prevented. Take note, Rogue was a good game because there was generally never a situation where you were out of options; even when you died, there was something you could have done differently that would have saved you. Here there's no such option, the game is pretty, but the controls and randomness mean that you're completely at the game's mercy.			"

												I like the style and I understand it is supposed to be a roguelike, but this game is punishing, at least at the beginning.  I simply do not understand how asteroids that fly at you from random directions and actually seek you is fun.  If you can't avoid them, it's just being punishing for no reason.  It also flies in the face of the game, which on the surface seems like a chill exploration game with artsy voiceovers.It plays like a game that was never really playtested, and the designers were very good at it.  I can't recommend this game, unfortunately.EDIT:  After playing a few more hours and adopting a very slow playstyle, I've been able to finish Chapters 1 and 2.  I can say for sure that Chapter 2 is far more enjoyable than Chapter 1, and it is a bad choice to start the game.While the game is better with an easier mode, I still can't recommend it for a general audience.There is also the issue of the in-game poetry, which is both rather overwrought and repetitive.

The settings don't do anything, the only button that works is ""return to default""On my laptop whole 5 minutes passes before the game even launches. On my gaming PC (i7, gtx 970) the game chokes when there are more than 10 asteroids, even though there's really nothing to render, it's just flying sprites, and a silhouette of the ship. Literally, nothing else happens in this game, ever. You fly around, then the asteroid comes out of nowhere on full speed and you die. You fly around some more, hear ""poetic"" monologues, you press boost button, fly into a bunch of asteroid on full speed and you die.There are good minimalistic games. This is not one of them.			"

												This game has some significant issues.For the slow pace of the game, it you should be able to see more of the map than you do.  Otherwise the game turns into a absurdly slow crawl as you avoid running in stuff.  Until you do.  That's not so bad on easy and normal where you can eventually unlock competent ships.Also, the starter ship is next to useless in this game.  Its only useful purpose is getting star points.  If you can't accumulate star points (or frequently lose half of your starpoints), it becomes very fustrating, and not in a good way since your not making progress.  There is a bug on expert mode where you only get 50% of your total points instead of 50% of the new points plus your old points.  Expert level should allow you to keep items and all your previous stars.  Otherwise the game gets boring and fustrating on the first level since it's not practically possible to unlock anything.  Near- impossible difficulty should be saved for hardcore mode, not expert made.In case I didn't make it clear, expert mode is just like hardcore mode, and it is not satifying to play on that difficulty.If your planning to buy this game, wait until it is less than $5 on a steam sale if your willing to play on the easy and normal modes.Also, the controls are not the best.And the dialouge gets repetitve.The music also gets annoying after awhile, so I've been playing this game on mute.Also, I'm not getting anything close to what could be called story.  Its a bunch of snippits of dialouge.  Like a splot painting, the story is whatever you want it be since the snippets and dialouge are all you get.  If there is a story there, its not grabbing my attention. "

												I do not know what exactly I was expecting from this.  I thought the advertising, the videos seemed a tad... vague.  Actually, they are very representative.  You click on the screen and your ship applies thrust in that direction.  The indication that you are expending resources to do this is not immediately obvious.  At least it wasn't to me.  There is a meter at the bottom but no attention is drawn to it.Then something flies at you from off screen, too fast to dodge in some cases, and eliminates most of these resources without warning.  BTW, run out of these resources and you die.  AS this is a rogue like, this means more or less starting over.If you are very luck and very skilled you might make it to the end of a ""chapter.""  I have no idea what this entails as I am not particularly lucky and have found the undodgable asteroid numerous times.  I've tried fast and slow and moderate speeds.  None help.Occasionally, if you are lucky enough to last more than a pair of minutes, you might encounter a derelict ship or planet to explore.  Exploring said body in space produces a short text description and you either gain or loose resources and experience at random.  You also collect what appears to be pixels.  I think these are resources but I'm honestly not sure.  The text that flies off of the ship whenever you touch something is small and fast and I can not read it.  But it does contain a number.  I think.Other than that, you continue to fly in the direction that an ever present arrow points in.  Why?  Eventually you encounter a space station that refills your resources.  And an new arrow appears.  Apparently, chapter one consists of finding nine of these things.  I think.  Don't hold me to that exact number.  There is also something called ""star points.""  I think these are supposed to be the currency that you spend between deaths to get better at the overall game.  I have not seen enough of these to make a dent in the cheapest item so...  Dunno how much that helps.If I had to nit pick I would say that the washed out color pallet is not particularly pretty.  The occasional dialog is...  Trying not to be insulting... not terribly good.  And, frankly, the introduction leaves too many questions about the game play itself.  I get that not having all the answers from the get go is a good thing.  But frankly, I have no idea what I'm doing or why.  The Earth blew up.  You are a survivor.  Cool.  But WTF are we doing now and why?  It seems like there is a goal but what and why I know not.  Again, a nit pick.  The impact on the game is minimal.  But when I say the advertising as rather representative of the experience, this is what I'm talking about.  Vague.So.  To sum up... Do I recommend this game?  No.  I'm seriously considering asking for a refund. "

												In a word: Tedious.For a roguelike, it's both too hard and too easy. Death can come quickly for a while, but then after a while you may want to die rather than play the tediousness any more, as you have enough equipment to survive. Once you see that you can make the camera stay centered, much of the artifical difficulty of no forward view disappears. There's no way to zoom out your view, so that sucks, especially when you run right into a sun just offscreen. The designers did this, though, because half the time the game ""procedurally"" generates stuff as it's coming into view. Really poor design.Want spacepoints? Grind. Can't afford a higher-level ship? Too bad. Get research? Oh, that's random, so early level stuff might not appear for you until chapter 3. You also buy research with the same spacepoints you get ships with. See a planet? Press a single key and hope the RNG gods favor you. Even when you have choices, 95% of the time comes down to luck. Want achievements? Well, congrats, because the ""beginner"" achivement requires that you get level 25. Out of 40. You'll hit halfway through chapter 3 before you get level 25. Want to access those science events? You get to pour 25 points into a skill that has no use until chapter 2, so you'll neglect it until you realize those events are the only way to survive.There's no save and leave feature, so I have hours and hours of ""play time"" when I left the computer for work or sleep. And since I didn't want to lose an expensive ship for no gain of spacepoints or ""legacy"" (which sucks), I idled the game for easily 85% of my ""play time"".The poetry sucks, so I turned it off. After playing for a while longer, I realized that reading (or at least clicking past) the sucky diaries gives you points. So, back on it went. And I grew more annoyed at the ""depth"" of a teenager's lamentations of loneliness. The voice was just as annoying, so that left as well. The music was decent, but tied to a game wholly undeserving of it.Don't buy this. Go find something else.			"

												I hate this game.  I hate the constant death.  I hate wasting hours floating around trying to collect resources, only to lose it all to some pointless meteor that comes out of nowhere.  Or an alien ship zooms in and shoots me when I have no defenses.  This happens so often that the entire game is an exploration of futility against space.At first it was delightful and contemplative.  Now I only have anger and a wasted weekend.  This is not fun.  It is just bad game design wearing the mantle of 'roguelike' to justify itself.Play for the experience of space.  Enjoy that.  Then run away as fast as possible.It never goes back to being delightful again. "

												RymdResa is an attempt of making a ""poetic game"". So in place of conflict and challenge as in most other games, it's trying to bring the player inner peace and mindfulness.The devs have been working hard in that direction, obviously. The artworks, visual style, music and poems are well fitting together, and the mood is well set. However, the game design fell short and ruined the whole experience.So the biggest problem is, the game is not really calming. Your ship is drifting through the space, watching space objects floating past and the sectors changing from one to another, and your mind is somewhere in a higher plane. And KABOOM!!! From nowhere, a piece of space rock smashes right into your ship, immediatly taking 97% of the resource with it, leaving you to die, in space. You have to be on high alert almost all the time against sudden and deadly annoyances, it's like a bizzare marrage between poems and cheap jump scare flicks. The gameplay elements are not nicely tuned either, e.g. I see no point in taking anything else other than the ""tough"" ships. The items seem pretty useless most of the time too.So in all, it's a nice concept lacking proper game design, which ruined the day eventually.			"

												A pedantic asteroid-smashing simulation. Pros:+ Different difficulty levels+ An overall consistent and efficient aesthetics+ Space atmosphere+ There is probably a lot of stuff to dig out further in the game+ Rogue-lite progression (at least in some difficulty levels)Cons:- Pedantic (chunks of poetry appear among disperse stardust; why is there poetry characters floating in space?)- No sense of real exploration (everything looks the same)- Inertia controls the ship more than you do- You can die instantly by crashing into an asteroid- Very slow pacing; nothing happens until suddenly a field of asteroids pops up and by the time you wake up you're dead- Hard to dive into the story (if there really is one)- When you purchase a new ship with rogue-lited money, you keep it only for one try (specifically annoying if you have saved for a few games and then smash into an asteroid after one minute)- Almost nothing to do (at least in early game) apart floating in space from place to place (this is your main objective in Chapter One). No fight, no quest, nothing. Verdict: Chapters 2 and 3 are probably a lot better than the first one. Yet it's the one we begin with, and it's boring. Permadeath has no use save from being frustrating. Without any real sense of control, it just feels meaningless. As the said chapter one requires a lot of trials to complete, it's a repelling barrier hard to overcome.  "

												The controls take some getting used to, but I really enjoy a little zen time coasting through endless space to some relaxing music. If you play it slow, it really can be quite peaceful.			"

												The game won't even start - just keeps running in the background somewhere, doing its own thing, with nothing to show for it. Too bad I've purchased it a while ago and tried only now, so no steam refund for me ha-ha. I wouldn't risk it.			"

RymdResa - A Steam Review [Disclamer - I was provided a copy of by the publisher for review purposes] The good  The music is very relaxing and transports the player into the universe The gray palette pixel art transmits the feeling of loneliness and vastness The RPG side of this game is very well balanced  The not so good:  The controls are not very responsive with a controller. Also, the ship changes orientation instantly but has momentum and can’t go backwards. It’s very counterintuitive. You will die a lot at the beginning of the game. I understand that it’s a rogue-like, but I almost quit after 30 minutes of play because It was getting too frustrating. The unresponsive controls paired with the fact that you apparently died when someone looked at you the wrong way made for a very unrewarding experience.  I don’t know if it’s intended, but I discovered that the resources replenish every time you enter a menu. This meant that I was never close to dying after I discovered that. The boss “fights” The conclusion: I could see what the developers wanted from RymdResa, even with the underwhelming controls and the frustrating first hour of the game. It really is a poetic treaty on loneliness and exploration, which is very well underlined by the soundtrack and the whole art direction. But the main thing with a game like this is to keep you interested, and I was ready to quit after 30 minutes...but I had to do this review. The game picks up as soon as you get your second ship and it might have been a fluke, but after I got enough money to get the third ship, it became a by the numbers game, with absolutely no danger for me to die. Except in the boss battles, which are a trial and error, “what did the author mean” dialogue. With a bit more balancing between the countless deaths at the beginning and the lack of deaths after that, it could’ve been an enjoying ride. But as it is, I cannot recommend it.  You can see me playing it here -

												Case 1. when developers try to make a good game, players will bash them for the shortcomings and failures...i understand.Case 2. when developers try to make the dumbest most idiotic and not fun piece of junk like Rymd Resa...lo and behold, players praise them for the success.I guess there is some logic to that, in the first case developers failed to reach their goal of making a good game, so they get bashed.In the second case the developers succeed in reaching their goal of creating a laughable piece of trash, so they deserve the praise, especially since there are a lot of coprophage players on Steam who feed on this kind of excrements and call it a profiterole.Oh its sooo poetic, so deep, sooo entertaining to play Rymd Resa, about just as poetic and deep as farting, and judging by the reviews to this game, im sure there are people out there who would find farting to be poetic and deep.Rymd Resa is a game highly recommended...if you are a coprophage.Rymd Resa is a disrespectful game whipped up with minimum effort and it shows.There is the start menu where you have several options that cannot be used until further in the game and are only there because of lazy design.Then there is the ugly big pointer in the middle of the screen next to your equally ugly ""ship"" (the wannabe designers couldnt think of a different solution to point the way except a big fat pointer thats bigger than your ship).Ive seen minimalistic graphics before, but this game gives ugly a whole new meaning. Minimalistic can be ok when its well done, but Rymd Resa looks like made an effort to be as ugly as possible.While not all rogue-likes are lazy games, most lazy games are rogue-like. The rogue-likes are the saving grace of many a lazy developer.			"

												Rating of brutal; I played this in the 80's... Think of trippy toons from the 60's, an Atari 2600, plug in asteroids, disable the fire button and fly around and crash.It may be deeper but it should come with a warrning, not for non-twitchy gamers.			"

												There is a fine line between being pretentious in a way that's endearing, and being pretentious in a way that's insufferable.RymdResa is the former; somehow, floating through an endless void of clip-art, ambient music, and pseudo-poetic snippets whilst being pelted with rocks and occasionally read bits of free-verse by someone who clearly had too much fun with a ring modulator just... works.I can't say WHY it works.  By all rights, it shouldn't.  And yet, somehow, it just does. Definitely not for everyone; if the phrase ""floating through an endless void of clip art, ambient music, and pseudo-poetic snippets"" made you roll your eyes, RymdResa probably isn't for you.  Otherwise it's definitely worth a look if you want a meditative, artsy take on space exploration.			"
