 Do you like?  Brutally slaughtering your friends to get a kiss? Making people explode? Poop jokes? General hilarity? Sandwiches that not only taste great, but also are packed with steriods?If you answered yes to any of these questions then this game is for you In short  castle crashers is a medieval hack and slash adventure which you can play by yourself or with up to 3 friends (Four player Co-op). It possesses an amazing cast of unlockable characters, enough stupid moments to last a decade, and cartoony graphics which will never get old.Have Fun!9/10			"

												Introduction:Castle Crashers was my personal favorite Xbox Live Arcade game when it was first released back in 2008. The Behemoth continued to give this game more life with it's DLC of character's that had unique abilities, animal orbs that would accompany you throughout the game, and weapons that would improve your character's growth (or vice versa if you are looking for a challenge). The game was later ported to the Playstation Network with exclusive mini-games in 2010. Castle Crashers eventually was ported onto Steam, but was ported badly onto PC on launch; however, the game was redeemed to be fun and playable again after The Behemoth made necessary updates. Verdict:This title is a hack and slash RPG, and has been widely recieved by many gamers who appreciate the genre (even those who don't). The game can feel a bit tedious at times, but as you level your character(s) the gameplay will feel slightly different before it tends to get repetitive once again. However, the game keeps the game fresh upon every level with unique scenary, opponents, and even jokes. If you plan on purchasing this title it's obviously more fun to play it with friends then it is with complete strangers, so try to convince your friends (and if they've convinced you to buy it listen to them). Completing the title will be a mission, but personally I think that's half the fun of trying to unlock every single character, find every animal orb and weapons. Give this game a try by downloading the demo. If you find the game a bit pricey than wait for a discount (or a Humble Indie Bundle that has this game packaged with it).			"

												A great game to play with a room full of friends, a pizza, and some drinks. The game is decent by itself, but with friends in a local coop setting, it's wonderful. The game is mostly you verses monsters, but occasionally you have to duke it out amongst yourselves for the hand of a lovely maiden. It has wonderful items, and challenging gameplay. I'd highly recommend picking up a 4-pack on sale to play with your buddies some time.			"

												Castle Crashers is a 2D beat 'em up with some RPG elements. I'd heard a lot of people talk it up and even tried the demo before deciding to get this bad boy when it was on sale for Halloween. You get four characters to choose from, so you can potentially play a 1-4 player game right out of the gate. Each character has their own starting weapon, magical element, and appearance. You go through levels beating up bad guys and trying to save princesses. Along the way, you'll find some cool weapons and animal orbs that give you special perks, You can switch between them between levels by visiting the blacksmith. I don't typically enjoy beat 'em ups. They tend to get stale and boring, despite how many combos or different weapons the game wants to throw my way. But Castle Crashers adds in some RPG elements to keep it interesting. Sure, the different weapons, different characters with their magic, and different animal buddies all add some customization, but the leveling system is what truly gives this game replayability and a sense of progression. Upon leveling up, you'll gain points that can be put into any of the four stats you have, strength, defense, magic, and agility. Depending on what kind of playstyle you want to use or what role you have on the team, you can build accordingly. Do you want to focus on one or two stats? Or would you rather be more well rounded? How will you compliment your teammates? Or what is best for solo play? It gives some complexity to the otherwise simple concept, which is great. The ability to play locally, cooperatively, or solo is nice for varied options and experiences. Essentially, each character you use equals one campaign. And there are a lot of unlockable characters, so this game does have a lot of replayability and lifespan. I also like the simple cartoony art style and some of the music is pretty cool. The main game with single and multiplayer, insane mode, two mini games, achievements, there's a lot of hours to be had with this title. However, I DO need to point out a few flaws in the game. Castle Crashers is a game of diminishing returns. When you start, there's lots of new and exciting things to keep you hooked. New characters, new weapons, new animal buddies, new secondary items, new levels, and a blank slate to upgrage how you see fit. But after a while... it loses its luster. There are only so many characters, items, animal buddies, weapons, and levels in the game. Your upgrades get harder and harder to improve as the game goes on and you will start to gain less points per level. You max out at 78 and from then on it's very little change between levels. Insane mode, aside from a few exceptions, is basically the same as the normal game... excpet enemies take longer to kill and can kill you faster. More frustrating and time consuming than an increase in challenge. Also, the online isn't always the best. It depends on game settings, connection speeds, and the locations of the players for sure, but laggy games can be tough to get through, especially in crucial moments the requre precision. Not to mention that when the game literally has to stop and wait for the other players, it can get very annoying and tiresome. So I'd recommend finding people close enough for online, or simply doing local play if you're going to do multiplayer.I like Castle Crashers. Sure, it has diminishing returns, and if you want to complete it with everyone at maximum everything... you'll be playing longer than you enjoy. But playing in moderation, trying to win rather than max everything, playing with other people... all of this can easily extend the playtime of the game while keeping it fun. Is it worth $15? Well... it really depends. If you like beat 'em ups a lot, then probably. Try out the demo and gauge your excitement. I'd say this game is probably worth about $10 generally, and when it goes on sale it tends to be cheaper anyway, so definitely go for it. I'd give Castle Crashers a solid 7/10. A good game, great for fans of beat 'em ups, but still alright for people who don't much care for them as well. I'm sure I'll get lots of hours in this game over the years, and you might too.			"

												I first played this game on the Xbox 360 and I have just loved the game ever since. I obviously have done a lot with the game, considering that I have over 300 hours in it.GameplayThe gameplay is absolutely perfect. The arena asset of it where you must kill every enemy before you proceed is very fitting for a game like this. The enemy AI is also great, as they seem to get more agressive as you progress more through the game, and then once you beat the game, you have the option of doing it all over again, but with a brutally difficult twist where almost all of the enemies get nearly x10 health, damage, and everything.Playing with another friend is highly recommended for this game, simply because it's just one of those games that's better with friends, however I would say the only fault with it is when there's connection problems, causing the entire game to just pause to let the other players catch up. The difficulty in general is great and increases at the perfect rate, the ending of the game is actually nice and hard, even on Insane Mode it's probably one of the most difficult things in the entire game once you get at the end, but it feels good to beat it once you kill that damn Necromancer.The StoryI find the story of this game comedic and silly, while it still gives a clear representation of what is going on and what you must achieve in the end. The ending does feel very rewarding and it makes you realize how big of a thing it is that you're at the end of the game. With how everything is set up in the story, it makes you realize that it's a long and difficult journey to save the princesses.ContentThis game has so much content in it just as you play it. By how fun the game is, and the fact that you unlock a new character for each time you beat it, you'll see yourself constantly beating the game over and over again, unlocking all the new characters, new swords, and all of the animal orbs. There is also the two DLC characters that most players might end up buying, or at least the Pink Knight because who doesn't want a character that murders their enemies with rainbows and love on the field?Simply a great game that has so many reasons to play again and again, whether by yourself or with a full party.

												I can't even express how much this game means to me. I love my younger brother, but we never really spent a lot of time together. Him and I are the only brothers in a large family of mostly girls, all of whom couldn't care less about me or him. I felt so bad that I just didn't have a lot of time to hang out with him, with work and school and my own personal selfishness. Then I bought Castle Crashers. It was ok, especially for an old title. One day I was playing it, and my 7 year old brother walks by, and he's like, ""that looks fun."" And I didn't say a word, I just plugged in the old F310 and handed it to him. I let him kiss all the princesses. 120 hours later, with almost every character unlock, I can 100% reccomend this game and 100% say that my relationship with my brother has improved so much because of this game, as well as Battleblock Theater, and now Pit People. Thanks for a masterpiece, Behemoth.11/10 would fix relationship with little bro			"

												Castle Crashers,one of the best indie games I have ever played.The gameplay is really fun with a controller,but playing with a keyboard won't ruin your playing experience.The co-op mode is a lot of fun,especially if you play with 3 other friends.They are many pets and weapons you can collect and the amount of fun can't be described.You can usually get the game for 3.74$ sales,but the game is worth it even for the full price,the DLC's are great,but they are not a ""must have"" to enjoy the game.So yeah,I would reccomend you to get this game if you think about buying it,but try to get atleast one friend to buy it with you,because once you play with a friend,you will never want to play alone again !

Castle Crashers is insaneGTA, Saints Row, Manhunt? Not even close. In terms of sheer gore, those games have Castle Crashers beat, but there are few action games out there without plenty of gore. No, the traumatizing, soul-crushing characteristics of Castle Crashers is not about gore or level of violence, it’s in between the lines of the actions of the “heroes” you play. On the surface, it might seem like your average ‘hero on a journey to defeat evil’ type story, but if you look more closely, you will quickly realize that the heroes you play are among the most monstrous, psychopathic killers you have ever had the opportunity of controlling.Let’s have a closer look at your actions throughout the game, which means in the case that you feel the story is of importance in a game like this, you should know that there will be SPOILERS ahead. The Corncob. This poor vegetable had the sad fate of being either: being born very differently from the other maize, or having had some spell cast on him to turn him into a monster. He’s probably been bullied by the other corncobs his whole life. Is it strange that this unfortunate soul is a little aggressive? And yet what is the logical conclusion that the “heroes” reach when they meet the corncob? They slaughter him, and then proceed to eat his remains. Follow me on this, they slaughter a lost, confused creature, whose only crime was being different, and then consume his dead body because it’s tasty. The motivation? The corncob was kind of in the way of a place they were looking for, and decided it was too much trouble simply going around him.Next up, genocide. On their journey, the player champions and the army that follows them encounter a primitive tribe of polar bears. The bears like to eat fish, sleep and dance in the rain, and are completely oblivious to the ongoing war. When an army invades their land, the bears will naturally try to defend it out of fear. Do the good guys try a diplomatic solution? No, they exterminate the entire population of polar bears without mercy.Wedding crashers. Our righteous heroes crash a wedding, destroy the cake, and murder the guests and the groom, whose only wish was to get married. The groom was quite the villain though; his evil weapon was a musical instrument. Be grateful they saved us from that guy. The champions are not quite finished, though. The groom was the Cyclops’ only friend, and upon seeing him dead, the Cyclops flies into a great sorrow and rage, escaping to his cave to grieve. You get one guess at what the heroes do to the Cyclops. Wrong, they do not simply murder him, but make sure to give him the horribly painful death of molten lava.‘But wait!’ A player familiar with the game might say. ‘They rescue animals!’ This is true; they rescue a selection of animals from both battlefields and black market vendors throughout their journey. Then they proceed to use them as weapons. Baby seals, kittens, birds. You name it; they probably threw it right into the bloody war, to fight for their lives for their own cruel and selfish gains.What about the hermit in the mountains? The heroes meet a crazy, old hermit living in the mountains, who only wanted to show them his sock puppet show. They kill him because he has a steering wheel that they want. Oh, and the aspiring painter, let’s not forget about him. He also only wants to show off his artistic prowess by displaying his paintings. They kill him because....no reason what so ever! F*ck art, apparently.If this is not convincing enough, then I don’t know what more to point out. Except that if you decide to play multiplayer, when you rescue princesses, you will casually be fighting your friends to the death if it means you’ll get some of the fair maidens' sweet lovin’. This is the heroic thing to do, of course. Doesn’t get more morally rotten than this. Final verdict: AwesomeSide note: after approx. 50 hours of playing, a bug caused my entire save to get erased, without chance of recovery. Not so awesome.			"

Castle Crashers
Defend your kingdom! Beat up baddies! Crash their castles and fight for honor and love! Hack n' Slash your way to glorious victory with a few poop jokes along the way.Castle Crashers is an Action Co-op Beat 'em up Flash game!Developed by The Behemoth, originating from their popular website, http://www.newgrounds.com/. Knowing that, the game comes with hilarious, but crude sense of humor, which is all part of the game's special charm. The game is all hand-drawn in Flash, giving it a nice and colorful artstyle that adds a cartoonish appeal to the game. Additionally, most of the music in Castle Crashers are submitted by loyal Newgrounds fans!Hack! Slash! Smash! Abracadabra!The gameplay is what makes this game great. It's your usual beat 'em up formula, with light and heavy attacks, performing combos and such. But in addition to that, you have the ability to cast magic! Controls the elements as you spark fire, summon icicles, conduct electricity, fling poison and throw buzz saws? Castle Crashers also features RPG elements, as you gain EXP for every hit, and with enough EXP, you level up! Granting you points in which you could assign to either physical or magical power!The Evil Wizard has kidnapped the King's daughters!The story can't be much simpler than this. As your king's loyal knights, you venture off to save the 4 princesses that has been taken away by the evil clutches of the Final Boss! You journey through war fields, forests, deserts, snow lands and many more as you battle various bosses such as barbarians, trolls, robots, dragons and aliens! Whenever you save one of the princesses, the true battle begins, as you and your friends fight to the death to win the princess' kiss! During your free time, you're free to participate in other game modes such as Arena; as you duel your friends gladiator style, and Back Off Barbarian; where you and your friends escape in this tricky tile-based mini-game!Journey alone or adventure with your buddies with up to four players!Either local, online, or hell, even both! You can select from a variety of knights, each with their own unique magical element, with many more unlockable characters as you play through the game. You can also select from a variety of weapons and pets, or ""animal orbs"" as the game calls them along the way, as most of them are cleverly hidden all across the map. However, this becomes a problem for most unlockable characters involve beating the game as certain other characters, then beating them game with those newly unlocked characters. Most of the characters are pretty much the same anyway for they share similar magic, while certain ones break the game from how Overpowered they are. While the game is relatively short and fun, it could be bothersome to most who plans to unlock everything.Final Verdict!While the game is fun alone, it is strongly recommended playing with friends. The game is unfortunately dying, so there are not many people playing online that often, so it's best to just host private games with friends. While unlocking more characters, animal orbs and weapons can be fun, it's still dependent on the player if they're into that sort of thing, and if they're willing to play the game numerous times just to achieve them.Grab the game when you can! Get the 4-pack, even! The game went as low as 90% off on sale, so you have no reason not to get it! And when you do start playing, don't play as any of the DLC characters for your first playthrough, for they do not unlock any new characters if you beat the game as them. Despite all these flaws, I'm a fan of it myself, so if you need someone to play with, give me a holler and we'll crash some castles together!			"

												Probably one of the best 4 player co-op games you can get in the Steam Store! Apart from Left 4 Dead that is. Castle Crashers has a lot to offer to those special groups, composed of four friends, as you'll find your team gaining experience, learning new unique moves in combat and fighting to the death of every chapter, all with a touch of humour. This game reaks of Indie-goodness and it goes for a fact that I love that type of game producing and development; Independently made, tying in nicely together, to make a labour of love.I love the particular 'crude' and simplistic art style this game has. Coming from the beloved artist, Dan Paladin, his ingenius creativity is best said as beautiful and completely staggering. Every character has a ''comic-component'' to them, including their emotions being presented in that of a slap-stick type of fashion. Interaction with random NPC's and the wacky medieval environments are top-notch and goofy and the rest can be left as fun. What more could be said?The game's appeal and genre, being in the typical 2-D Adventure Beat 'em Up hybrid, relates to the classic and retro games like Golden Axe for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, the classic Arcade game, Final Fight and even dating way back to Double Dragon and Battletoads for the NES. All of which shrouds you in a distant yet cherished memory, while this game adapts to its own heartwarming and charmful stylish nature. If you have played all of these previous games or other games that shares this joyful genre, you will most likely adapt to this game's control with pure expert skill.The game's mechanics are very immersive and easy enough to figure out even for first timers. Most battle systems work in waves; with a certain number of enemies that increase in power as you progress and defeat all enemies in a specific wave, which lets you advance further within a level. Most levels end in with a big boss battle, where your techniques, might and agility is put to the test, as you'll take down numerous tyrants and beasts, again with all a touch of humour and creative cartoon-ish atmospheres. All of this, to uphold the traditional tale of medieval times, where a brave knight will rise up and save the princess, either from evil tyrants, corrupt kings or beasts and the much darker figure that is behind the game's plot overall.Though this game is impeccable and fun with friends, this little gem doesn't seperate itself from its own fair share of problems. First of all, I find the controllability with the keyboard a little finicky and hard to manoeuvre when you're on the field, smashing vikings and gladiators alike. Understandably, the game does warn you right from the very beginning that a controller is highly recommended, but it doesn't distinguish the fact that a keyboard is optional and here's where I think a little more work should've been put in. Another problem I keep running into is the multiplayer connectivity. Me, neither of my mates who I've played Castle Crashers with had no internet connection problems at all, while the game seems to freeze, not respond and generally lags while in-game. To me, this game is one of the biggest icons, to serve off as inspiration to even those small Independent game developers who will hopefully get their projects recognized around. As well as a big Indie-icon, a definite recommendation from me as you will soon find out that many people have this in their own game library. I will conclude this review by saying that this game is just that damn good.			"

												Like my pre-teen kid when she's hopped up on Mountain Dew and Skittles, Castle Crashers is completely frenetic and has a penchant for toilet humor. And that's why we love it! The cartoonish graphics are great and there's little else more satisfying that to run around bludgeoning things indiscriminately . It's cheap, you'll have hours of fun. Why aren't you playing already?			"

												I'm going to look at Castle Crashers from two points of view: casual and hardcore. Now I'm fully aware that ""casual"" is a dirty word when it comes to videogames. Honestly, I think a game being casual is a good thing. If I'm playing a lot of hardcore games, the kind with a lot of depth, high punishments for failure, and an extreme level of difficulty; I'm going to want something to fall back on. In this regard, Castle Crashers fits the bill.However, a lot of games - sometimes the best ones - can appeal to both the casual and hardcore gamers. These titles offer a perfect learning curve and are enjoyable at any skill-level. There are multiple methods for playing through them. The challenge can range from easy to improbable. It all depends on how the player approaches these games. Though it tries, Castle Crashers can't bridge this gap. It's a fine game for a friendly get-together, or a time-sink on a slow day. If you're looking for a quality brawler, the kind you can keep coming back to again and again, then look elsewhere.I hate to say it, but this review isn't over yet.Looking further, Castle Crashers works as a casual game due to the constant thread of ""niceties"". These are moments that make you say ""Oh. That's nice."" when they happen. Leveling up, the discovery of a new weapon or animal, a dead enemy dropping a valuable crystal instead of a mere coin; these are all examples of niceties. The game is further bolstered by simplistic but charming hack & slash action. Through the combination of both elements, as well as flavor touches like the set-piece battles and action sequences, this game works. It just plain works.Even with this casual approach, you're still bound to run into problems. The balance between strength, magic, and agility is crap. Magic and agility require huge investments to attain any noticeable effect. Strength is an absolute necessity, unless you want to juggle foes for several minutes at a time. The ranged options are only forced onto the player by the rare appearance of giant enemies. You know who these jerks are, because you can't get close to them, without being grabbed and thrown.Also, while the niceties are appreciated, I believe that Behemoth could have done a little better. Character-unlocking is just plain awful after a certain point. Having to replay the entire game with character F to unlock character M is maddening. It's especially bad when A) all characters behave the same outside of spells B) every character starts at level 1 and C) there aren't any methods for passing experience onto new characters. Dynasty Warriors is a franchise with gobs of playable heroes, and usually there's some method for strengthening unused characters, so everyone remains at a level playing field. In Castle Crashers, this -admittedly not all that important - element was overlooked, and it's pretty annoying.The insane mode is ironically where hardcore gamers are liable to get the door slammed in their faces. This is also where the game almost completely falls apart. A high difficulty mode is fine, but it needs to make sense. Insane difficulty features faster and more aggressive enemies, so it's good on that front. Unfortunately, their HP and especially their strength have recieved a massive multiplier, and that's really bad. A number of enemies and bosses go from non-threatening to entirely absurd. For most players, insane mode ends with the large troll of the Thieves' Forest.This is my third play-through of the game, and I still don't understand why insane mode exists. In the original Xbox 360 version, insane mode was somewhat mitigable, due to a prevalent experience glitch (involving the troll boss). This is one of those rare glitches that actually made the game worse when it was fixed. Depending on how you look at it, abusing an XP glitch to make a game easier probably isn't very hardcore. As far as I'm concerned, insane mode is where the game actively cheats. Everyone has too much HP and does too much damage, but apparently it's unfair for players to have something to fall back on. Personally, I would have suggested difficulty modifiers (ala Bastion) instead of a difficulty mode, but this a 20/20 hindsight suggestion. I certainly didn't have the idea, when Castle Crashers was released, back in 2008. All told, this game is still pretty enjoyable and even better with friends. Just don't invest too much of your energy, because the pay-off isn't worth the effort.			"

												Castle Crashers has a lot of unique things to offer. A fun 4 player co-op game where you and your team (or even by yourself) go through many battles and boss fights leveling up your character to learn unique skills, combat skills etc. The game does not have the best graphics, but it doesn't change the fact that it's still a fun and of course an addicting game for you and your friends to play together. The game has a lot of enjoyment to it, the type of game where I would spend my time on for a while showing lots of love for.Basically, a couple of enemies have come to your castle and stole the princesses. You and your friends go on adventure progressing through many battles and boss fight trying to save the princesses by being ""Castle Crashers"" if you know what I mean. It starts off from easy battles to becoming more difficult but you'll be able to level up your character so he/she could become stronger and acquire unique combat skills and magical abilities. Shops will also be available for you around the map so you can buy healing potions, weapons, and even cute little pets on your journey.The maximum level you can reach each character is 99 as I believe. Once you reached level 99 or completed the whole story, don't think you're finished yet. There are lots more things you could do. While you are on your adventure, note that you could've missed a lot of ""secret"" items hidden around certain parts of the map whether it's weapons or pets. Battle arenas are also around the maps where you can test out your characters combat skills fighting certain multiples of the same type of enemy (Yes, there are different types of enemies). Now, if you're sure you're 100% completed the game, try maxing out another character to level 99, or even better, do it with a couple of friends. It's usually fun when you're playing with friends even if you've completed the game.You'll have the ability to unlock many different characters in the game with diverse abilities. While progressing through the story, you'll be unlocking new playable characters. Many characters can be unlocked through completing battle arenas, or completing a certain area on INSANE mode like the royal king of your castle. Insane mode is a special mode after you complete the story. It's much harder but you'll gain a good amount of EXP. If you're into some fun humorous RPG games, I'm 100% sure you'll like Castle Crashers. I've spent most of my hours on this game alone but still have fun playing it. Great content, great story, great features. Overall, it's just addicting as hell. "

												Castle Crashers is an entertaining Beat-Em-Up style game  filled with witty humor and a very comical atmosphere. I don't think I can review this game past "" I just power farted on an enemy and a bear rocket-pooped into space"".Castle Crashers is a classic, and a must have for any gaming library. With multiplayer compatability and a plethora of unique playable characters, I'd say it's a cut above the rest. The developers obviously had fun and this translates well within the game.			"

												Of all the games I've ever played this would be my favorite. There are four basic knights you can play as when you begin the game. You can unlock more knights as you beat certain levels, or beat the game as certain characters. There are twenty nine characters you can unlock, and two DLC characters. As you defeat enemies you wil level up. Leveling up unlocks new combos, and rewards you with skill points that you can spend in Strength, Magic, Defense and Agility. Reaching levels 1 - 20 grants you two skill points, and level 21 - 78 give you one skill point. once you beat the game with any character, you will unlock insane mode, and you can play through the game again with tougher enemies, harder bosses, and some of the stores will have different items. The objective of the game is to rescue the four princesses from the Evil Wizard.11/10			"

												The best part of Castle Crashers is exploring the world - there are tons of levels that look and play completely differently. Though it can be done, single-player assaults are more frustrating and less enjoyable than teaming up with other people. The biggest issue in trying to take on levels solo is that multiple enemies can assault you with ranged attacks, making it difficult to even stand up before being knocked down again. Animal orbs are probably my favorite thing in Castle Crashers because they're just so damn cute.PRESENTATION:The story is straightforward and the game is easy to pick up and play.GRAPHICS:Everything is beautifully drawn and animated.SOUND:The digital, techno tunes are upbeat and perfect background music for raising hell.GAMEPLAY:Classic side-scrolling brawler gameplay mixed up with fun boosts and magic makes for a great time with friends. Slightly busted multiplayer is a downer though.LASTING APPEAL:The campaign is short, but there are multiple characters to unlock, lots of weapons and animals to unlock and 99 levels to max out, making it a game you can spend some serious time with.Two other negatives:The game is not worth the high price. Buy it on sale instead.It can be rather repetetive.6/10			"

There's plenty of other characters to unlock after you finish the game. The animations are as pretty as they can get and sometimes the game is just plain hilarious.

												I got this game on sale and boy was it worth it, I was obsessed over it for a few weeks.Let's start the review. Graphics	The game has animated graphics and that's probably one of the reasons why I love it.The art-style just seems really fitting.There is really nothing to talk about an animated game's graphics. Gameplay	An arcade styled 4-player side-scrolling beat'em up.Combat feels great and you can combo to your heart's content.Depending on your timing of certain hits you can make infinite combos.Using magic to combine with your melee attacks can do alot of damage so I usually do that.There are Animal Orbs that are hidden through out the game with each one having it's own unique perk that you gain by having that certain Animal Orb by your side.The same goes for weapons, there are alot of weapons hidden across the game.You can unlock probably every single enemy in the game as a playable character which is nice. DLC	The DLC characters, the Blacksmith and the Pink Knight are awesome, Blacksmith is my highest level.The DLCs are both cheap (I bought them along time ago but I think they were 99 cents) and the money goes to charity. Bonus character	You get to a new pet and a character by owning the game ''Battleblock Theater'' which is made by the developers of Castle Crashers.The character Hatty Hattington and the pet Golden whale.It's a nice gift just for owning an equally awesome game. The Plot	The plot is pretty simple,4 princesses get kidnapped and a magical crystal gets stolen from the king and 4 knights head out to rescue the princesses (1 if you don't have any friends) and retrieve the magic crystal. Pros.	+Really fluid gameplay+Big roster+Alot of replay value+Really fun with friends and even without friends.+Difficulty is just right - provides you with challange later on and goes easy on you in the beginning.+Alot of unlockables. Cons.	-Combat gets slightly repetitive. Final Verdict	   9.6/10	 "

												This game is what I would call a classic of the modern gaming era. It's not exactly new, but it still manages to keep a certain freshness to it, which is actually quite impressive. When I say ""classic"", I mean a game that is a sort of important pillar to gaming in general. Now, I wouldn't say that it changed the whole industry per say, but I still consider this one to be a game that is part of my childhood to an extend. Many can possibly relate to that thought, I'd wager.Now, what exactly is Castle Crashers? Well, to resume the whole experience in a single sentence, it's basically a ""smash right through the enemies, save the princesses and defeat the evil king"". Sounds simple, doesn't it? That's no surprise; because this game is simple. The true experience truly comes to life when you bring a friend or two along the ride. As most multiplayer games, having someone to play with you really is a must to enjoy the full adventure. Honestly, playing through this game alone is kind of boring, and considering that the designs of the levels highly support multiplayer, trying to go through the game alone can prove to be a chore. Then again, I did play and finish it alone the first time, but when I replayed it with a few folks, my overall opinion changed drastically.This game is huge. Don't let the tiny sixteen bucks tell you otherwise; it's probably one of the biggest adventures I've seen for a Smash 'em up. The adventure itself isn't much to speak about, my friends and I started from the beginning and finished after around four sessions of one hour each. What makes this thing so huge is the unlockable content. There are a ton of them, such as characters, pets, weapons, levels, and even a secret difficulty. You'll be grinding and repeating the same levels many times to find rare items and weapons if completion matters to you. I'd like to speak about the difficulty, since I feel like difficulty is something that matters for many players and buyers. The game in itself isn't harshly hard. Most bosses have simple patterns, the level designs can be either fair or sometimes overwhelming, and the overall product will not make you frustrated to the point of screaming. Of course, I won't say that it is an easy game either; sometimes it feels like the game throws so much at you, I find it almost unfair. Without spoiling too much, the final boss in particular has a lot of annoying patterns that can drag for a while, especially if alone. Upon finishing the game, you will have the option of changing to an even harder difficulty. I will warn you : It is cheap. Enemies are insanely powerful, and quite frankly, it's not fun. If that sounds appealing to you, then go ahead and try it. I, for one, will stay away and advices you to do so as well.The game has two primary mechanics : Physical attacks and Magical moves. Physical attacks are, as the name says, attacks with weapons. The damage that you will do to enemies is generated by how much points to give to your Physical stats. Magical moves are attacks composed of magic. Giving points to this stat will not only grow your magical abilities and make them more powerful, it will also make the range and overall usefulness much more adaptable. The best idea would be to try to make a balanced knight, since enemies later on will either be extremely resistant to Physical attacks or highly resistant to Magic. You always need to have an alternative, or else it becomes truly bothersome. I believe that I mentioned every aspects worth mentioning. This game is great, and while not a masterpiece by any means, it should prove itself quite worthy of your purchase. Do not forget to try and ask a few friends if they wish to play along!			"

Many of them can actually be played out in one session. However, this is a game you'll definitely find yourself probably picking up for 3 sessions with a buddy, with characters that unlock for some level of replayability! The plot is funny and there's always some feeling of monotony throughout a beat em up adventure but the quirks of this game (for example the giant corn boss that drops popcorn as you hit it) keep them to a minimum!

												tl;dr? Aajwdlijf ajw dhrugdh 11/10!!'Now considering I took a 4 year hiatus, I'm sure a relatively large sum of you guys reading this review are in the same position as me.....'I was first introduced into the wacky world of Castle Crashers back in 2008 via the mini flash-game Castle Crashing ""The Beard."" Back then, Kongregate was the king and it quickly became my favourite platformer. Despite the simplicity of the artwork and game mechanics, the game had character and it was obvious that the developers weren't afraid to show off their work against the smorgasbord of stereotypically depicted knights, castles and overworked medieval warfare.Well a few months later, it was announced that Castle Crashing ""The Beard"" would fully mature into a proper side-scrolling beat-em-up platformer with an actual story (like fighting a giant beard would be believable lel)! While I was quickly swept away by the hype, I wasn't an Xbox owner and the prospects of getting one just for Castle Crashers weren't high. And so after beating the flash version a few times, I slowly let go of the unattainable and moved onto other things.4 years later, things had certainly changed; games were easily attainable now that I had become a successful Steam trader and suddenly out of the blue, Castle Crashers appeared on the Store page! So much time had passed that embarrassingly, the switch inside my head didn't immediately click... I saw the 4 knights and noticed the mellow colours but couldn't put my hand on why they were so familiar.. After a quick google search of ""Crashing beard game"" my mind became frantic, the impossible was finally possible, I HAD to play this game!!Now considering I took a 4 year hiatus, I'm sure a relatively large sum of you guys reading this review are in the same position as me. While the flash-version was extremely addictive, Castle Crashers is a refreshing rendition.Here are a few reasons for which Castle Crashers is a must-buy for people in the same position as I was: The simplicity of the fighting mechanics and overall movement has been entirely conserved. Artwork and soundtrack stays true to the original version :). Extensive storyline that will take you through an epic journey where you will meet the most creatively designed foes. Local and Online Multiplayer! Ability to play as other characters other than the 4 knights including...Pink Knight :D:D:D  (Yes, Pink knight from Crashing Beard is in this game with his lollipop sword!!!!!) Now unfortunately there are a few downsides: Latency issues and lag when playing with others across the world (Yes it's an old game, luckily its smoother with peers who live closer to you). Few features and special attacks are missing from the flash-version including Orange Knight's special pheonix attack.  Grinding: there will be unavoidable moments where you will need to grind certain stages of the game in which you will need to repeat certain levels to kill enemies due to the simplicity of the game's levelling system. For each character, you will need to spend a few hours on the same level to be able to play insane mode.Fortunately a few of these issues will be addressed in the Remastered edition to be released later this year (2015) including performance improvements - especially in online multiplayer. If you don't enjoy the grinding, just play with a friend, the social interaction will definitely put the boring aspects of the game to ease ;)Overall, I definitely do recommend Castle Crashers, if you loved the game on Kongregate or Newgrounds and don't trust the ""overwhelmingly positive"" review rating, let me assure you that it is undeniably worth it's weight in gold. Also the game does drop to $1.49 and usually below $5 during the Steam sales so there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't give it a try!			"

Why wouldn't you want to?+Insanely challenging on the ""Insane"" difficulty that you unlock after beating the game with your character once.+Back Off Barbarian is a fun little time waster mini game.+Good beat em up combat with decent RPG mechanics.Cons-Some of the weapons and characters are so overpowered that they make everything a joke or so weak that it makes the game almost impossible to beat.Overall Castle Crashers is a very fun beat em up that I highly recommend to everybody who enjoys the genre.

												Do you like arcade games? Maybe you wanted to try some but you've never had a chance or you don't want to waste time with emulators? If YES is an answer to any of these you should totally check Castle Crashers! Humoristic, pretty and friendly arcade game here on steam. Perfect for playing with a group of friends or your siblings.What's so cool about Castle Crashers?• Nice cartoon graphics.• Even decent plot.• Lots of funny moments.• Tons of characters to unlock, each one with thier own ""magic"".• Lotsa swords and weapons.• Pet companions.• Interesting sceneries.• With a friend to join your game, the fun is doubled.There are few disadvantages tho;• 12€ is not so cheap as for indie arcade game. • Playing alone is not as fun as with friends.• You will need a controller if you want to play on one PC.Other than that Castle Crashers is one ♥♥♥♥ good arcade game worth your time if you like the genre.I honestly recommend it.                                - D.Punk "

 Castle Crashers is some “Old School Arcade Fun”.I was on the fence about this one because of the art style, and it looked like a kids game. I ended up picking it up on a Steam sale for my son, who wanted it. To my surprise this game is a blast. You pick one of four knights each with a special ability. Fire, Poison, Electricity, Ice, you get the idea. The powers give you a special attack that does significant damage, as well as decides the color of your knight. The game supports full controller, local co-op, online co-op, and local plus online co-op. This is the way it should be. Local co-op, and split screen belong on PC! The game features three modes, campaign, versus, and a jumping mini game (not my cup of tea, but some may like jumping). The campaign mode is where it's at. You, and up to three friends button mash your way to victory against the evil horde to save the princesses. The combat gives you some options aside from hack n slash, like your special power, bow, bomb, and a few simple combos. The music is great, they did a nice job on the tracks for this game. The monster design is comical, and slicing the heads off little minions is fun.  The game will run on almost any PC (Not your Commodore 64, but anything from 2010 and up should be fine). If you've been passing on this one, give it a try at the next sale. OLDER GAMER APPROVED  POTATO PC CERTIFIED  Visit our Currator Page "

												This is a highly fun side scrolling beat 'em up with great controls. To start with the story is that your princesses have been captured, you and up to 3 friends set out to save them. This of course means co-op mayhem fun with up to 4 players at once. The controls are simple.... quick attack, heavy attack, jump, item, magic, block and item swapping. The combat is simple, fun and the enemy AI makes it more than a button masher. They will flank you and or shoot arrows when they can. It makes for some quick thinking. The art style is amazing and charming. Everything looks fantastic. The humor is charming and surprising at times. There are light RPG elements in the game that level up your character and you can assign skill points to them. Oh and ontop of that there is a world map to quickly find previous level. All of this is combine with a great soundtrack of good video game music you'll enjoy. This is worth your money and I often don't say that about games.			"

												Imma tell a story. So my cousin, brother and I we're goofing around on the Xbox then my cousin said while browsing the xbox store said this game looks cool lets try it! We bought it downloaded it and launched it. I was the Blue Knight my brother was the orange, and my cousin was the red. we got to lava world then me and my brother had to go. My brother and I pleaded our father to buy it too. We ended up convincing him, so we all three of us played it til wedding crash then my bro had to go. and me and my father got to Full Moon, then I had to go to my mom's. the next weekend I went to my dad's I convinced my little sister (5 at the time) To play castle crashers. And since then me and her played it soooooo much. then came when my brother got back into it, me and him were fire and ice like before, but im lvl 58 and hes lvl 61 we  both played to the final boss, turned out we were overleveled and it was too easy so we went to insane mode to die to the barbarian boss multiple times. He gave up on it, so I continued to play it alot with my sister. she now has lvl 70 posion knight and rn on the xbox cc im 98 ice knight. 3 Years later I got steam, and played it alot. And when I figured out Castle Crashers was on steam I freaked out. I've played it alot ever since, and still play it. This is my favorite childhood game 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 I need friends to play this with that have skype please. XD :3			"

Brought to you by The Behemoth crew, Castle Crashers is a four-player hack ‘n’ slash three-dimensional side-scrolling title that rivals and is reminiscent of Dungeons and Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara…well, if it held a different tone. Castle Crashers retains a resonance with the cast of the game, featuring the likes of Dan Paladin, Will Stamper, and several others, and mashes comedy into the classic ‘your princess is in another castle’ story arch. This title features four base knights-green, blue, red, and orange-with varying powers, and adds Hatty Hattington to the roster if you own BattleBlock Theater for Steam; there are also twenty other unlockable characters as well as two purchasable knights, but I will speak further on the said two in a later section. Here are a few things that I find interesting about Castle Crashers:Leveling System - Players have to put in some work to level up, as experience is granted based more-so on enemies routed and hits connected than overall damage done. What I love about this take on level-ups is that it blends well with the player-versus-player elements, and allows the more tenacious ‘crashers’ to gain levels more frequently than those attempting to preserve health; the player-versus-player aspect will be explained in further detail next. As an individual knight gains a level, he has the opportunity to allot a gen number of points into four different traits: Strength, to determine the power of the knight’s attacks; Magic, which improves the knight’s magic attack maneuvers, spell effectiveness, and how much energy a spell utilizes on cast based on the total amount of energy; Defense, which dictates the knight’s health point total; and Speed, which determines how much damage the Bow item deals with each strike and, obviously enough, the individual knight’s movement. Combined with varying statistic-altering weapons, items, and pets, this leveling system permits players to create their own form of strategy.Forced Player-Versus-Player - Castle Crashers is a cooperative experience, so what could it possibly mean to ‘force’ players to combat against each other? At the end of each stage resulting in the liberation of a princess, only one knight may earn the kiss of valiance from the fair maiden. To effectively decide who is chosen, the players duke it out with all of their acquired abilities and equipment. Unlike most things in this title, a princess’ kiss does not grant any boons, bonuses, or additional equipment; however, it is very satisfying viewing the ‘saltiness’ on friends’ faces when you have stolen the embrace from their colored princess.Minigames - With various landscapes and degrees of difficulty between the stages, the campaign offers an abundance of cooperative play. But minigames are available to sweeten the deal. I must admit that I have not played too many of them, but the few that I have experienced-like beach volleyball-were so much fun to play with friends and online, win or lose.Humor - Simply put, from its theme to its plot twists and cutscenes, Castle Crashers is a title that will provoke, at the very least, a snicker. I feel as though I should refrain from revealing too much from this engaging title’s comedy approach as it is very well written. It can also be humorous when played with friends even at points when it is not necessarily meant to be; this is enhanced through splitscreen play.TL:DR - Castle Crashers is highly enjoyable, especially for fanatics of hack ‘n’ slash and cooperative titles, character leveling and building, and of The Behemoth’s previous title, BattleBlock Theater; speaking of, I also recommend-if you do not already own both games-the purchase of the bundle featuring Castle Crashers and BattleBlock Theater. I would also recommend the purchase of the Pink Knight and the Blacksmith downloadable content since proceeds are given to various charities. Whether solo or in cooperative play, with BattleBlock Theater and the downloadable content or not, Castle Crashers is a laughably good time. I had wanted to mention other notable features in this title such as its outstanding level design and themes, gameplay, and specific items but I feel as though I would be continuing on for days if I started. On a side note, I would like to mention that I will gladly play with anyone that owns this title or others. Simply add me on Steam and post the reason why you plan to add me on my profile.

												This is a great game to pick up and play with friends.  The wide selection of chracters that you can choose with their certain kinds of magic and you can build them all different ways is a nice breath of fresh air, but the game has two serious flaws off the top of my head that I should point out that people should be aware of if they're going to buy this.1.  Online multiplayer always seems to have some sort of lag; it can be varying from slight hiccups to completely unbearable.  Just keep that in mind when playing with friends.2.  At the beginning when loading up Castle Crashers it says that a ""controller is recommended.""  I CANT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!  The keyboard controls for this game are horrible and I've re-mapped them several times and it just doesn't feel as good as when you play with a controller.  Please make sure to have some sort of gamepad before you buy this game unless you can deal with re-mapping buttons to subpar locations.All-in-all though such a great game.  I put lots of hours in it and had lots of fun playing it.  I definitely recommend it and if you haven't played Castle Crashers before and you're kinda iffy on if you'll like it just search it on youtube, look at other owner's reviews and you'll see it's a pretty good pick.

												Castle Crashers looks like a standard beat-em-up game on the surface, but it's definitely more fun the average game of its type. original cartoony beat 'em up with a just dose of self-aware toilet humor.In Castle Crashers you and your friends play as one of four knights who set off an epic journey to find the princesses that have been kidnapped. Why they were kidnapped beats me, so there are a couple of plot holes. Should you care? Not really, because this game doesn't really focus on the plot in the first place.Each of these four knights have their own special ability that can be executed on the battlefield. You take your weapon, your shield, and your power, and you hack and slash through swarms of enemies and the occasional boss fight. Yes it has the potential to get boring, but I haven't reached that point yet.Throughout the game, you can discover and pick up new weapons and little pets to follow you around, all to be saved in a little shed that you can go back to to change up your stats. So it's your decision whether you want to destroy enemies with an epic vorpal sword or a slab of meat, and whether you want a tiny floating ram following you around or a tiny floating cat.Each time you play through this game with a different knight, you unlock another character to rip through enemies with, which does add to the motivation of playing.This game is very quirky. There will be moments in the background that make you look at it and say ""Did that just happen?"" in the ridiculous sense. These moments will even happen in the up close foreground. There are many moments that made me chuckle which made this game all the more appealing.The soundtrack is pretty badassIf you're looking for a coop game, local or online, definitely consider Castle Crashers. It was an enjoyable experience, but it's certainly one that requires you to play with others to be fully satisfied.100/10 MASTERPIECE!			"

Gameplay: The Castle Crashers recommends you use a controller, when you first launch the game. Anyone who knows me; knows I'm stubborn and refuse to purchase a controller for my computer. So... regarding the controller suggestion: Yes, it would be much easier on your progressing-carpal-tunnel. But, the game is completely doable with just a keyboard. (It's worth noting that the game key prompts on the menu and in game are actually for a controller; but again, you just get used to it)

The controls are pretty basic you have three types of attacks: light attack, heavy attack, and throw item. (you can unlock and use different combos between jumping, quick attacks, and heavy attacks) You also have a block button that slows you down, but if you time it correctly, it can literally save your character's life.As you progress through the game your character will gain experience points, money, animal orbs, and new weapons that you can purchase or will randomly drop off enemies. Your unlockables are accessible at the Blacksmith, and there are plenty of things to collect to keep you busy.Achievements: There are 12 achievements in Castle Crashers, this is one of those games that is relatively easier to get 100%. However, four of these achievements require playing with at least one other player. One achievement requires being in a four player game.There are only two achievements worth warning/note: Arena Master (Win 40 Arena Online Matches) and Glork (Win 20 All you can Quaff Online Matches). I won't lie, to earn these achievements, I ran between two computers. My brother was nice enough to be a punching bag, when he was away at work or school.Alternative strategy: Hit the fourms and see if anyone wants to trade off, you could do something else while you get beat up... …..likeeee Battle block Theater! link at bottom. :PPrice: Castle Crashers is priced at $14.99, for the amount of time you'll spend playing this game on your own, and with friends, that's a fair price. However if you're the first of your friends to play this game (unlikely... but who knows, maybe it's possible?) you should grab the 4-pack so you can play with 3 other friends. (Trust me, the game is even more fun with a friend)Conclusion: Story: Pretty stereo typical story line, but it's delivered hilariously and without any voiced/text narrative (bonus points) and with plenty of humor. Gameplay: Suggested controller, but doable with a keyboard alone, I won't pay for carpal tunnel treatment. Shush! Achievements: Fairly obtainable 100% without too much of a time commitment, but you will need another friend or three. Price: Fair, better with a sale, or buying a bundle deal on sale.All in all, this game appeals to anyone who might have enjoyed playing an arcade styled game, indie platformers, 2D, indie graphics, 4 player games, or just wants to support The Behemoth.


Same level, Same Sword, Yeah we're cool. :P (old screenshot taken in 2014)

												Yes, just yes.PROS:- Play with up to four people!- Crisp graphics- Multiple hours of gameplayCONS:- Same plot- Get this game on sale..If new adventures were added to this game + harder places to beat, this game would improve and gain more people buying it. Overall, this game is really fun and worth $15.00. I would recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have an extra game to play and only plays about two or three games. This game has nice challanges and achievements that you can unlock and it's great for parties.I rate Castle Crashers: 4.7/5 "

												Castle Crashers is a coop, 2D/side scrolling hack n' slash game. Lots of levels, cool weapons and ADORABLE AS ♥♥♥♥ PETS. 4 starter characters that you can level up and build their stats the way you like. There's plenty of other characters to unlock after you finish the game. The animations are as pretty as they can get and sometimes the game is just plain hilarious. The game puts up a good challenge even in coop, you'll find yourself having to grind a bit after encountering some of the game's bosses/difficult levels.i recommend using a gamepad.Plus, any DLC you buy for Castle Crashers (2 available at the time) helps charity, how many developers do that, right? :)			"

												I was gifted this game by my boyfriend and so far it's been pretty entertaining. I didn't like the medusa boss, she moved very awkwardly and it was just kind of an annoying one to beat. Also, the pillars in the Sand biome, when you're going through the castle get in your way during battle. That was the most annoying part considering my boyfriend had to revive me without seeing the meter and i couldn't see my enemies majority of the time.I really like the wide range of weapons/pets & am hoping for armour to be added later.If you wanna get money really quickly I suggest beating the barbarian boss over and over (you get a load of gems and coins) or if you want exp one hit kills are pretty sweet if you wanna do it quickly (like the scorpions and in the sand biome, the barbarians before the boss and the alien minions on the space craft).Overall the game is about an 8/10 just because of those couple of annoying features and the fact that I've had to grind like a lil ♥♥♥♥♥ for hours to get high enough levels to progress.I'm not yet done but am really enjoying it so far.

												Sigh. Where do I start?Castle crashers is a jule for me, same with a lot of people. It dose have a repetive game though. Yet, Theres something just about the beat 'em up games that I loved, and I feel like this game puts it out there the most. With the wide choice of characters, there is almost no limit. Anyone with a love for the cartonny, yet dark humor, would adore this game. Words can not express how much time i've put into this game on the X-Box 360, and the soundtrack is Beautiful. Pros:Great community.Wide range of characters.Co-op.Soundtrack.Cons:Repetiteve.Lots of grinding in the works.Insane mode is almost impossible.I really do suggest this game, its also cheap. And screw Ice King. Wow is he annoying.			"

Introduction:Castle Crashers is a 2D hack and slash adventure game set in a cartoonish medieval world of knights, princesses and dragons  pooping animals. Your only goal is to rescue the four distressed princesses from formidable foes and earn their kisses as a reward. This game is best played with two to three other friends, a controller, and a box of pizza to share.Pros:-Over 30 unique characters and dozens of weapons to unlock and choose from.-Cheap DLC characters with proceeds going to charity.-Can be played on keyboard or a controller.-Wonderful cartoonish graphics and easy-to-learn gameplay.-Constant action and a simple levelling system.-Crude humour with poop jokes.Cons:-Game can get boring and repetitive after completion with multiple characters.-Lacks a high number of achievements for achievement-loving gamers.Overall:Castle Crashers is a fun game to play with friends and is a must-buy when on sale. It is simple and provides constant action throughout the story. Beating the game with certain characters unlocks other unique characters that all have their own pros and cons. With so many weapons, pets and characters to choose from, Castle Clashers is surely an enjoyable classic. My rating would be an 8/10.			"

												ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! This is one of the best games I have played in my life! Very fun with its 4-player co-op, amazing replayability, all around great time! If you are reading this, pick this and BattleBlock Theater up ASAP, as these are amazing!GAMEPLAY-The combos feel very smooth and easy to master, and I feel I get them at a good pace. Spine-crushingly difficult, but also fun- I do have the complaint that there are a lack of mid-level checkpoints. Bosses are intuitive and fun to fight.PRESENTATION-The art style, in Behemoth fashion, is cute and funny, as are the actual in game events. Special credits to the Thieve's Forest Level in humor!VALUE- I got this for 80% off during the sale, but even for 15 dollars this is good- you will spend 10+ hours for your first playthrough and 100+ as you replay with other characters. HUGE VALUE!POSTGAME-After you beat the game once, insane mode becomes available to play- 100% completion is obtained by beating the game  in insane mode with all characters. 62 playthroughs. SO MUCH TO DO!!In summary this is a great game- So much playtime, all of which is fun and enjoyable!			"

												Pretty great side-scrolling beat em' up. With an intriguing art style by Dan Paladin, and tight controls, Castle Crashers is a great experience, multiplayer or single player. What really makes the game special though is the multiplayer. If you do choose to buy it for single player, there still is a buttload of content, but it is endlessly entertaining to work together with friends to steam roll enemies. If this is your first time looking into this genre, you won't be upset. If you are a fan of side scrollers, or beat em' ups, I would definitely pick up this game.			"

												This game asks the dangerous question on everyone's mind:  What if Golden Axe had been written around poop jokes?It's a solid cooperative game in the vein of old arcade beat 'em ups with a cartoon feel and more than enough crude humour to go around.  Pick it up with BattleBlock Theatre in the bundle sometime!(Make sure the person with the best connection hosts, though; connectivity pauses the game frequently in multiplayer if you have someone with a spotty signal, but it will nearly always recover in a couple seconds rather than drop the connection.)

												This is one of the best co-op games you will ever play. The RPG elements are subtle, but very nice and combined with the leveling progression system provides a nice sense of progression. The art style is something to appreciate with its cartoonie elements. The game is a good length for an indie game not too long, but not too short. The bosses are challenging yet fun.

												Great Game! Easy to learn, and easy to get motivated. I like how you can easily decide that one level is too much to do solo, and just do it with another online player! One thing I don't prefer though, is (lag, of course) that you cant invite someone into your game if the match is already up and running. You have to gather everyone up while still in the lobby.			"

												The game itself is fantastic! The humor, game play and the low price make it worth every penny. Unfortunately, the developers were a bit lazy making the port - When playing on a keyboard you will have no idea what you are doing. The game doesn't tell you how to play and the tutorials show the Xbone(xbox) controls, not the keys.Overall though, the game is damn near perfect. If you don't own a controller but don't mind 30 minutes of fiddling and clicking, the game is perfect for you. If you own a controller and can connect it to your PC...BUY THIS GAME NOW.One of the best indie games ever made hands down. It has it all. Fun medieval sword fighting against evil knights, monsters and strange creatures. Good graphics and addicting levels. Castle Crashers is best enjoyed through multiplayer. The game lets you enable voice chat for a more fun experience. I seriously think it's a powerful and engaging fighting experience, even if it is  cartoony.Plenty of replay-ability in this title also, with arenas and arcade modes available. 10/10 for me.			"

This is a great beat 'em up, with minigame updates coming as of recently, showing there is care for this game to this day, and the multiplayer experience is fun, although you are likely to come into contact with some who may have cheated for their levels.

												Castle Crashers is a game that you have to be willing to put a few hours into. A MMO for gamers and professionals alike, you can pick 4 starting characters; Red Knight, with the power of lightning, Green Knight, with the power of poison, Blue Knight, with the power of ice, and my favorite, last but not least, Orange Knight, with the power of fire. As you beat the game with different characters you unlock more characters to play as, including Gray Knight, King, the Necromancer, and many many more.			"

												Castle Crashers. It's one of those games that is best enjoyed together with friends but also very do-able on solo. In my case i can't say how much fun i had with this game whilst playing together with a friend on his playstation. The story is pretty easy to understand, the castle you live in is under attack by barbarians and the king has something stolen from him so it is up to the player(s) to get it back for his majesty. It's an arcade style adventure game where you will fight enemies along the way and every once in a while you can expect to be treated to a bossfight so be sure to gear up. Castlecrashers also has an awesome ingame soundtrack made by various users over at Newgrounds which set a proper athmosphere and to be honest can be very catchy.When it comes to leveling and items the game also comes with a level system (1 > 99) and during your playthrough you will find different weapons and items that will fit your playstyle and will unlock different skins with each their unique attacks and magic. There are also pets you can find in the world to aid you along your travels.Castle crashers is definitly recommendable. It comes with a normal mode and a very challenging hardcore mode so ye be warned.All the best!(s.i.e)			"

												Played this game thoroughly on Xbox a few years ago, and it's still just as good as  a PC port years later. Any character can fufill the warrior, mage, and rogue archetypes, or you can go as a Jack-of-All-Trades master of all four character skills: Strength, Magic, Defense, and Agility. Not to mention, there's a huge selection of 80+ weapons and 20+ ""animal orbs"" (pet followers) with special attribute bonuses that make archetypes even stronger.There are a few levels, such as Lava World and Full Moon (at least for me) that can come as a pretty big challenge if you're not prepared, meaning a bit of grinding might be in store if you don't have friends to back you up. However, even the grinding isn't as tedious as other games, as you can potentially revisit past areas and pick up weapons and animal orbs you might have missed.The game is even more fun with a friend or two, cos why beat up a horde of enemies on your own when you can juggle them back and forth with a pal? However, the game lacks the same ""more loot per additional player"" mechanic that Borderlands 2 has, meaning that weapon, animal orb, and boss chest loot is often unfairly divided. However, the loot is not a large problem, since as long as you have a good sword that matches the build you're going for and enough money to buy some potions, you should be able to survive and thrive.The game is good for quick, casual fun with friends, and can also satisfy more gameplay-hungry players with it's ""Insane Mode"", which rescales the entire world so characters that have beaten the game can replay from the start (retaining any levels, skill points, weapons, and animal orbs you collected so far) with enemies that remain challenging.Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's suitable for all types of players, whether you play for 1 hour or 100 hours. Everything in the game feels good, from leveling up and developing your character's skills, to watching your collection of weapons and animal orbs grow with every cleared area, to finally beating that one boss that looked so threatening at first. Buy it, it's well worth the money.((also, if you do buy the game, get the two DLCs too. it's cheap, has good content, and 100% of the proceeds goes to non-profit good-will organizations))			"

If you are looking to purchase this game I recommend waiting untill it goes on sale because it becomes much MUCH cheaper. This is also a great game to buy for your friends as well since there is a co-op option availiable! But if you don't have any friends do not worry because there is also the option to play with other people online. (Whom you can make friends with) There are many levels to unlock (As well as new characters and weapons) and complete with a variety of fun challenges you must overcome. If it is on your wishlist currently I also recommend downloading the demo which actually allows you to play the first 4 or so levels of the game!			"

The arena fights is fun except for the thieves one just because they just keep on firing arrows when you're on the ground. But still a fun, hilarious game. Their was also the combat style: HACK AND SLASH! Just like the Devil May Cry series. And also the DLC. What can i say about it. You have 2 other players and 10 new weapons (5 for each).

												Long story short: This is the best Beat 'em up I've ever played. Yes, even better than the Ninja Turtles one for SNES.To start off, I hate Beat 'em ups, because of their simplicity and repetitivness. This game is neither of these things. It has great level design, Upgradable characters and an RPG-like leveling mechanic.The story is as simple as indie games get, where you go around saving princesess and fighting bosses.Oh, the boss fights. They're loads of fun and are very varied, and aren't too much of a challenge.The multiplayer is fun and unlike most multiplayer games(New Super Mario Bros Wii), it's better to cooperate than to screw each other over.Although controllers are reccomended, they're not neccesary at all, and the PC controls are (by default) comfortable and easy to get used to.The game doesn't get boring after a LONG while, with most of your efforts post-story going into Maxing out your character stats(and having fun doing it).The DLC is only $1 a piece, with them adding new characters, weapons and animal orbs.There's no reason to not own this game if you're a fan of beat 'em ups, and wth the new refund system, trying out this game has never been more worth it.

												Castle Crashers is a hard hitting story about an old man getting his potatoe stolen. The game really starts to grab you in by the cajones when you unlockl the Pink Knight in the DLC. Once you get the Pink Knight the plot thickens, enemies get tougher, and princesses get uglier. I like the part where you tell someone to go away from where you are digging, you dig up the giraffe, and then he takes it. The excuse was ""I didn't know a giraffe was going to pop out of the ground"" as he was told to get away. But the moral of the story is, no matter how far or how long you travel, never trust a purple haired, downfaced, orange dress wearing princess.2.5/10 would crash again.			"

												Ow , this game is awesome.... When i saw the summer sales and Castle Crashers was only 3 euros  , i was like "" I need this game "" I mean who doesn't like to smash things in games like this and try to unlock new things like weapons , characters , pets etc. The graphics aren't realistics but still...       There are only 2 dlcs but the dlcs are awesome , you have new weapons , 2 new characters ( pink and purple ) with great skills . Purple ( blacksmith ) for example , his first skill is to summon a toad that deals some pretty damage and knock up and then you have these cool hammers spinning in the air throwing them at the enemies , and he's overpowered too.       If u like hack'n'slash games you will fall in love with this game . There are like 32 characters ( I'm not sure ) and a lot of bosses , you have arenas and if you complete one you will get a new characters :D , this game is epic and the first time you see the game you don't thing it's so good , but when you play it with your friends this game is very very fun.       Oh , and a thing , every character comes with his unic skills and a weapon ( more weapons in blacksmith's and purple's case )			"

												Absolutely amazing game. It has great gameplay with some amount of crude humor causing a overall more casual atmosphere, perfect for a couch co-op session. Some have called the combat repetitive and stale, but in my opinion, with great co-op games becoming rarer and rarer to find, sometimes a simple hack n' slash with some friends is really all you need. The game can get tedious in a journey to grind to 99 and obtaining all collectables, but coming back to the game every once in a while allows the enjoyment of this magnificent title to be stretched out as long as possible. One of the best co-op games out there.sidenote. Friends not included.			"

												Around 2 months or so I have been enjoying this game a lot. I did a run as the green knight and currently working on insane mode. I simply love this game for it's creativity on what appears to be a cliche ""rescue the princess"" game. The artist for the game just made this game very enjoyable, especially when you first start playing it. The flaw I have with this game is that it gets a bit repetitive. The combat system is nice and simple, heavy attacks and light attacks. Not to mention each knight has it's own magic. You gain combos for mele attacks and new magic attacks as you level up. Another thing I would like to mention is the Animal orbs, a.k.a pets. Each pet has its own special thing, it could be a stats boost, it could have a progectile attack. Who knows!?.

												Excellent, excellent game. I think what makes the game as good is its simplicity and yet nice variety. It does not have the depth of proper RPG games, and yet it offers the basic functions and symbolics :  personalities of the different characters (color, element etc), weapons with different characterics, leveling, possibility to create a mini ""builds"" (based on strength or magic or agility etc). The game is super adjustable. Each session is different. I love the possibility to change color and magic from session to session, when I play solo or with friends. A big thumb up for the Pink Knight, it gave me and my friends hilarious moments.  Also, the levels are sometimes pretty short, sometimes not, which allows for different types of gaming sessions, when you just want to have a short break for 15 up to 30 minutes, or when you wish to explore the aventure mode. You can play solo easily at first, but as you progress, you'll need to be cautious and understand the mechanics if you wish to succeed (many many ennemies and long bosses). It is MOSTLY recommended as multiplayer, so much on the screen, so much to do, combos... It's a massive source of FUN. Because that's what this game is about, fun. In its gameplay, design, sense of humor.			"

												tl;dr : Fight for yo right to thirst.Thirst, a concept known among all living organisms. It is a thing that lives among us in the most blatant of displays, or it can harbor itself within our deepest mental crevices. When the thirst is in it's most realest of forms, it can take the tightest chains of comradery and render them weak and rusty only to be snapped and scattered amongst the ground. Trek through forests, mountains, volcanos, deserts with your friends, conquer your enemies and vanquish every obstacle as a team with your fellow knights. All of this, only to turn on them and spill their blood for a single kiss for a girl you don't even put the effort of getting to know.10/10			"

What's not to love?Positive:- Old school 2D beat-'em-up- Smooth, responsive controls- Great quirky humour - Very fair (you will often realize that getting hit or dying is your fault)- Plenty of collectables and characters to play- So much replay valueNegative:- Kind of short story modeConclusion:If you love 2D beat-'em-ups you will love Castle Crashers. I remembered when a much shorter and simpler version was released as a flash game years ago and I already loved it back then. I'm glad to see they actually made a full game around the same concept. There are so many things to do in this game if you are a completionist and it still continues to be fun. This is always the game I go to when I have friends over who do not necessarily play games. It's simple and entertaining enough for them to play and I do not feel frustrated if they struggle.A definite must-buy "

												This game is really fun!There are four (4) main characters to play as, the red knight, green knight, orange knight, and blue knight. The red knight's powers and abilities are lightning, the green knight's are poison, the orange knight's are fire, and the blue knight's are ice.There are many levels to complete to save the four (4) princesses from the evil wizard, Necromancer, and their allies and minions.You can unlock more characters to play as and upgrade through Insane Mode, going through the levels with the bad guys being WAY tougher.The highest level any character can reach is 99 (unless they added a higher level cap that I'm not aware of).My friend and I play it together. My friend uses the purple (blacksmith) knight, playable by downloading the Blacksmith pack DLC. I use the orange knight. Our characters are both high levels, (mine is 93 and theirs is 84)  though we still haven't beaten Insane Mode, why? it's insanely hard! xD Best played with four (4) very experienced players with (preferably) level 99 characters in multiplayer.Great game though!

												You beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of almost literally everything in your quest to save the four princesses and retrieve the crystal for the king from some evil wizard dude. That's all you really need to know because who needs story? The gameplay takes care of that.Defs a game to invest in if you're looking for a blend of RPG and fighting, but actually just want fighting with slight RPG elements.  Gameplay is solid and plays smoothly. Artstyle is also something to appreciate. While sometimes the soundtrack would confuse me a little, mostly due to the whole era theme to the game, but then I remembered this was an action fighting game, and it didn't really need much to explain that.Overall, I would rate this game 8/10, because its beefy 'n' stuff :B			"

												TL;DR: A wonderfully silly and fun game, that is also challenging and rewarding. It's great by yourself and much, much better with friends. Would definitely recommend.Castle Crashers is a comedic beat 'em up game that incorporates silly content and solid gameplay to create a fun, classic, and heavily group-centred game. You traverse the land, beating the ever-living crap out of every enemy in your way. All the while, you're able to take in the hilarious atmosphere around you and excercise your level of completionism by hoarding money from your friends and grabbing as many pets and swords as possible. There will seriously be moments where you'll be taken back for a second to laugh and say ""I can't believe that just happened!"" In addition to the button-mashing combat that is fun and challenging, you can enchance gameplay with unique magic powers that every character has. Playing single-player is great, but the real fun comes from multiplayer. You fight each other indirectly for items and money, while at the same time really being on the same team when it comes to battling enemies. The game even has segments where you actually do fight each other, in arenas and when jockeying for a princess's kiss, which keeps playful competitions between you and your friends. At the end of it all, you truly feel accomplished and satisfied by working as a team.I would certainly recommend this game to anyone looking to play a game with their friends, the whole experience is wonderfully fun. Any negative points are honestly mitigatable, such as there being sub-par support for keyboard users which can be circumvented by using a controller or simply not caring. All in all, this is truly a wonderful game. Play it, and play it with friends.			"

												I'm usually not a fan of 2D indie games, but ""Castle Crashers"" is a blast. Smashing your way to victory with up to four players is extremely satisfying and it will take years to level up everything, adding a value to the game that will allow you to play for hours and hours without completing the levels exactly the same. The weapons and potions will hav you playing for hours collecting money and buying new swords that will allow you to beat missions faster and helps you gain more xp. Even if you are not sure about this game, TRY IT. It is one of the best games on Steam.			"

What's not to love?Positive:- Old school 2D beat-'em-up- Smooth, responsive controls- Great quirky humour - Very fair (you will often realize that getting hit or dying is your fault)- Plenty of collectables and characters to play- So much replay valueNegative:- Kind of short story modeConclusion:If you love 2D beat-'em-ups you will love Castle Crashers. I remembered when a much shorter and simpler version was released as a flash game years ago and I already loved it back then. I'm glad to see they actually made a full game around the same concept. There are so many things to do in this game if you are a completionist and it still continues to be fun. This is always the game I go to when I have friends over who do not necessarily play games. It's simple and entertaining enough for them to play and I do not feel frustrated if they struggle.A definite must-buy "

												Excellent, excellent game. I think what makes the game as good is its simplicity and yet nice variety. It does not have the depth of proper RPG games, and yet it offers the basic functions and symbolics :  personalities of the different characters (color, element etc), weapons with different characterics, leveling, possibility to create a mini ""builds"" (based on strength or magic or agility etc). The game is super adjustable. Each session is different. I love the possibility to change color and magic from session to session, when I play solo or with friends. A big thumb up for the Pink Knight, it gave me and my friends hilarious moments.  Also, the levels are sometimes pretty short, sometimes not, which allows for different types of gaming sessions, when you just want to have a short break for 15 up to 30 minutes, or when you wish to explore the aventure mode. You can play solo easily at first, but as you progress, you'll need to be cautious and understand the mechanics if you wish to succeed (many many ennemies and long bosses). It is MOSTLY recommended as multiplayer, so much on the screen, so much to do, combos... It's a massive source of FUN. Because that's what this game is about, fun. In its gameplay, design, sense of humor.			"

												It is a game about a bunch of dudes beating the life out of other dudes with some cheering princesses watching in the background for some reason.  This game blends together a mediocre combat system with an overuse of poop jokes and leaves the player feeling like the game was written by a bunch of kids in Middle School.  However flawed the game my be, it allows for a group of friends to play it with nearly no understanding of whats going on other than dudes need to be hit with stuff so you can save the day or something.  This once unique blend of indie magic leaves the player feeling like the game could have been a lot better if some obvious changes had been made as to how character progression worked, and reminds us why the Xbox is a failure as a platform for indie games that get ported to PC.  All in all the game did not disappoint too greatly and thus it earned a hearty 3/Not Borderlands 2.			"

												Castle Crashers, what can be said about this game oh yeah it totally addicting to old and new gamers. The story actually has 2 parts. The 1st part is a wizard takes a giant crystal from the king and flies off with it. The 2nd part is actually more interesting since you wont really care a lot about the 1st problem, a group of barbarians kidnap the king;s '4' daughters. This game is a action, adventure and a hack and slash. You must fight waves and waves of enemies to progress through the level. If you are playing multiplayer, there will be more enemies, have more hp and when you beat the boss with a princess, you duel to see who gets a kiss from her.There are a vareity or sword you can pick up in this game and every sword change your stats or give you a chance to freeze/burn/critical/poison your enemies.There are also pets that give you a small bonus making it useful. There is a leveling up system in this game and every level you get, you can rank up your stats for either Strength,Magic,Defense and Agility. There is over 25 characters to unlock which can be a pain to do since most of them require to beat the game with a certain character and they all have diffrent magic so choose wisely.I give this game 9 out of 10 due to the communications when someone else wants something that you dont want.

												Cute, adorable, fun.Too difficult for singleplayer though. your best bet is to play with 4 players.However, with that being said, the difficulty stays the same, no matter the number of players.This makes it very hard for singleplayer, and too easy for 4 players.They should therefore adjust the difficulty.This game is mainly okay, but there are some small tweaks it needs.

												A classic game that really does require a controller/pad. Get together with 3 friend or power through by yourself. This game is cute, challenging and 100% funny! An absolute must have if I do say so. If you have played previous games from the makers of this game (For example; Alien Homind) you will see that they do carry on their previous ideas and even add to the game with them. You start off with 4 knights, but you unlock many more as you carry on. Each have their own spells and each level seperately and go through the story seperately. Graphics are cartoony, but they suit the game perfectly. Even if this game is old, it's still one you will continue to play and I don't ever seeing this being one of those ""Games of the past"" because when you do think back to it you'll end up saying ""Let's just go on it for old time's sake!""Although I do recommend getting it on sale, I wouldn't have too much of an issue if I paid £9.99 for it. I got it for 90 pence during one sale and don't know how I got by without it! One thing that is worth mentioning, when you unlock new weapons and pets (There are pets with indivual buffs/talents), they unlock for all characters! So there is no real repetitive grind with this game. Truly a game you can always go back to.Should you get bored too, see if you can't button bash harder than your friends in the ""All You Can Quaff"" mode! Bash X and Y as fast as you can to eat as much as you can as quick as you can! Finish all the plates before your friend and gain your very own boasting rights! (Terms and conditions apply. Pain in the hand is a known side affect. All rights reserved. Don't see online for details.)This game really does speak for itself and one of my most highly reccomended games.			"

												**AT THE TIME OF THIS REVIEW, I COMPLETED ONE PLAYTHROUGH ON NORMAL, SO SOME POINTS COULD BE MISSED**Castle Crashers, developed by indie devs The Behemoth, became famous at the release of one of the top selling games on XBLA, Castle Crashers. It was highly praised by many and lots of my friends used to play and were obsessed with the game. I wasn't much of an Xbox guy at the time, and therefore did not buy it. After four years of castle crashing, it was finally released on PC. Then, over a year later, I decided to give this game a whirl and bought it. I must tell you, I was very impressed.I'll start with the visuals. I actually enjoy the graphics in the game, taking a rather simple style. It doesn't get all artsy like Braid and Bastion, nor does it get too realistic like Crysis. It sits in the middle, and I'm happy it doesn't have graphics like that. Not all indie games need to be artsy and heavily story based platfomers or whatever. For the most part, I do like the visuals this game offers.Now, I'll move to the gameplay. This is probably the first reason Castle Crashers is so awesome. It's a beat-em-up game, so let me make this clear: THE ENEMIES ARE TOUGHER THAN THEY SEEM. Be warned when buying this if you're looking for a simple, kill-this-guy-quick kind of game. You WILL be dissappointed. The gameplay is simple, yet challenging.  I didn't discover any horribly unbalanced weapons, which makes the game even better. Bosses are usually quite easy, but there are a few notorious bosses in the game to look out for, none of which are extremely hard. One other thing this game has is an arena where you can duel it out with friends or fight groups of enemies. I love the gameplay, but not the best part to this  game.Story time, kids! I have very little to say for the story. Repetitive and cliche, but adds some unique twists to the generic ""kill the wizard and save the princess"" kind of style.Audio is good mostly, but could be fine tuned so there are some more individual boss themes, like most of the bosses besides the final boss. I could be incorrect, but for some of the major bosses, it was a simple theme, while others didn't even have a theme at all!Now for the best part about this game: The replayability. After you beat a short campaign (which is actually necessary in this case) then you can beat it as another character. You can unlock the 28 Animal Orbs, the 30 characters, and then beat the game with all of them, then you can go to insane mode after completion. You can also find all of the weapons to this game, play All You Can Quaff, which is a food eating game or something like that, Arena, which is simply a battle arena, and maybe help a few newbie friends or anyone in the CC community that is new or even a veteran. On average, most of my friends who play with me have usually 200 hours, and they only have one or two level 99 characters. Quite a bit of content here, so there is about 500 hours, maybe tops, if you're extremely dedicated to doing everything this game has to offer. Kind of surprising for me, even for this kind of game.Just a few flaws I want to point out: The shield is pretty clunky and is pretty difficult and annoying to use. Also, because this is a PC port, it seemed a bit rushed and only showed the buttons for an Xbox 360 controller. One other issue I found is that the multiplayer can be quite laggy, and can ruin multiplayer experiences sometimes. However, that isn't too frequent for me.Overall, Castle Crashers is an amazing game that I cannot stop playing. I highly recommend this game, and I'm always willing to play with you guys. Add me if you want to play!

												So. This game was released on XBLA in 2008, PS3 in 2010, and only came to us computer-type gamers in 2012. I'd heard so many good things for those four years, whenever castle crashers came up. People gushed. You know what?They were right.It's still charming. It's still fun. And it's still one of the best games to play with your friends when you're bored. Boss battles are often repetitive. Poop jokes get old. But the ridiculousness and the artistry and the hitty-hitty-whomp-kapow are all super fricken great, from the get-go and still twenty hours later. If you liked beat-em-ups back in the day-- your double dragons, your streets of rage, your golden axe-- buy this. And if you don't have friends who already own it? Buy a fourpack. Make three friends.And in the immortal words of Tatsu: ""Go. Play.""			"

 Castle Crashers Review  PROS -  Very fun and unique Is also a good Co-op game Good for all ages Stunning and Unique Graphics Amazing music Some sort of humour is in it CONS -  Its just button mashing Keyboard controls ( However it does recommend a controller ) Sometimes it gets just to hard and isnt fun Some bosses are repetitive Overall Review Castle Crashes is very fun and is better with friends. Although the cons may seem incredibly bad, remember that this game is currently overall 'Overwhelmingly Positive' (2017) and is a port from the Xbox 360. I think game is great and definetly worth its price. Its unique and has nice touch to the hack 'n' slash genre.			"

												Castle Crashers is very nicely done with good graphics, fun, adrenaline action, tons of enemies, simple gameplay, all this combined with a cooperative mode impeccable, longevity neither too short nor long, a mini system of growth of its characters, lots of unlockables, a unique style and a lot of irony. It is best enjoyed through online multiplayer with friends. A must that I suggest to anyone.			"

												""Hack, slash, and smash your way to victory in this award winning 2D arcade adventure from The Behemoth!"" -Castle Crashers. If you're finding a really cute game, here's another one. c:Things go best in Co-op mode with friends, the weapons, upgrades, those things makes you play some more.This is just like Spiral Knights, but this one's not graphically demanding. Affordable in any computers, even ya had a super low-end.This is like, Assassin's Creed:Unity set in the Middle Ages: Third Crusade. xD Love this game. You better grab it, you're gonna like it. VerdictThe good:-Green Knight's cute-Red Knight's cute-Blue Knight's cute-Yellow Knight's cute-The default Knight's cute-Pretty cartoony graphics-Awesome powers-Awesome combat-Cooperative gameplay-All you can quaff-Cute and amazing soundtrack-You can mount the king's horse, and take it around like it's yours and make em' walk!The Bad:-Sometimes, I find the combat really hard when enemies are in large numbers. Well at least by now.-Checkpoints way too far sometimes.-Kissing of the 4 princesses. xD-The Ugly:-Faulty Internet connection-Every animal is pooping9.8/10 "

												It's a 4 Player medival Beat-em-up set in a comedic medival setting, let's get this out of the way, it's a port from XBLA, meaning it WILL tell you the XBOX controlls, and it WILL tell you to use a controller.The game is fun, but since there are only 2 attack buttons it gets redundant fast. Much like with borderlands 2, the story is just too repetitive and they have too many characters to play it as. I guarantee you 1 playthrough of this should be enough to quench your thirst.I'm not saying it's a bad game, the thing about it is just that the only replay value it has is with it's 3000 extra characters, but think about that, would you want to sit at your computer for hours a day as each character trying to get them to level 99? of course not.The game is good though, and it does have some minigames, but expect to lose at them.i give it a 6.5/10.

												Castle Crashers is a very fun single player or co-op experience similar to the good 'ol days Double Dragon and Streets of Rage beatem up style games but with its own unique story line and humor as well as a robust leveling system, weapon upgrades (tiered by lv) and pet boosts.  There is also tons of replayability here and there are secrets all over the map once you have unlocked certain things in the story so the fun is not even close to being done once you beat the story mode.  You can also unlock 20+ characters to play and level up as which also keeps it fun and fresh!The game has been around for quite a while and has had quite the support as well as new stuff added to it over the years.  I originally purchased this on my Xbox 360 when it came out and played it quite a bit.  I re-purchased it on Steam to complete my collection and have had just as much fun if not more fun as I did when it was brand new.If you like beatum up style games with a bit of leveling and weapon progression as well as a funny story, this game is for you.  I recommend it for sure!  Its even more fun with a group of three of your friends as you fight over sharing money while arguing over who should unlock the weapon or pet first and in which order everyone will get it!

												This Game has an Awesome sound track and mixes it with insane gameplay. This side scroller combines a beautiful art style with humor and great gameplay mechanics. This game is beautiful to play alone and has alot of replay ability. It is great with friends and can be played with up to 4 players. There are alot of things to unlock in this game such as pets, weapons and characters. Really worth a buy and is really cheap in the steam sale.			"

												This is a game that although I have only bought on steam recently, I have loved for years. It has a charm about it (most of it) that is just great and even better with friends. My only complaints are 1, the stock controls are a nightmare on keyboard for me, I had to go through and change everything, but after doing that it runs fine and two, the second world, the forest, has waaaaay to much crap for me, but that is personal taste. Overall, fantastic game.			"

												Castle Crashers is a very fun single player or co-op experience similar to the good 'ol days Double Dragon and Streets of Rage beatem up style games but with its own unique story line and humor as well as a robust leveling system, weapon upgrades (tiered by lv) and pet boosts.  There is also tons of replayability here and there are secrets all over the map once you have unlocked certain things in the story so the fun is not even close to being done once you beat the story mode.  You can also unlock 20+ characters to play and level up as which also keeps it fun and fresh!The game has been around for quite a while and has had quite the support as well as new stuff added to it over the years.  I originally purchased this on my Xbox 360 when it came out and played it quite a bit.  I re-purchased it on Steam to complete my collection and have had just as much fun if not more fun as I did when it was brand new.If you like beatum up style games with a bit of leveling and weapon progression as well as a funny story, this game is for you.  I recommend it for sure!  Its even more fun with a group of three of your friends as you fight over sharing money while arguing over who should unlock the weapon or pet first and in which order everyone will get it!  Fun times indeed!			"

												This game is amazing. I recomend it even if its not on sale. I also recomend playing it with friends, that makes it much more enjoyable than it already is, and thats how its best played anyway. Dont let my short playtime on it for Steam fool you, I played the life out of this game in the following years after its 360 release and I even played a decent amount on my friends PS3. Cant wait to do it all again on Steam with the Remastered update.For those who havent played it I will say its technically repetitive after a few playthroughs with different characters, however, it might be the only repetitive game thats actually fun to replay over and over and over again. Its replayed to unlock characters, characters' abilities, weapons, pets, to level up, to play on the harder difficulty, and just simply because the game is hilarious and fun to play.10/10 If it was on Ouya id consider buying an Ouya to do it again.Consider.

												Castle Crashers is exactly what you expect it to be. Its a really fun beatemup for both couch and online co-op and even single playthroughs. It is not a huge game but the replayability is great if you have your friends on board since there are enough achievements to keep you motivated and tons of weapons and characters to unllock. There's even a harder game mode if you are up for a challenge. Overall i think this game is a must buy for everyone looking for a fun beatemup with great controls and gameplay. 9/10			"

												An evil wizard steals a large, mystical gem from the king of an unnamed empire, as well as kidnapping its four princesses. The king sends the four brave knights that spearhead his guard into the vast land to rescue the princesses, recover the gem, and defeat the evil wizard. Unfortunately, the knights first have to contend with an army of barbarians storming the king's castle as the wizard makes his escape.Castle Crashers is a gem among the endless onslaught of casual games available on Steam. It has its flaws, of course, but when all the elements are considered, it makes for a fantastic, ""I'm bored, let's play"" sort of game that you could very well find yourself coming back to again and again.The game is a side-scrolling, linear beat-'em-up, with a silly plot, very apt character design, and great handling in terms of gameplay. When you begin, you take control of one of four knights, each with a unique elemental affiliation; the Green Knight wields deadly poison magic, the Orange Knight pyrokinetically commands fire magic, the Blue Knight freezes enemies with ice magic, and the Red Knight shocks his foes into submission with electric magic. As you progress, more characters are unlocked and thusly become playable, most of which are enemies you will face on your journey. However, replaying the game as a new character gets tiresome if done in excess. Regardless, the wide array of playable characters allows you to find one you like. I adore games that allow for this,The gameplay handles well, with a great capacity for combo attacks. Chaining melee attacks of varying strengths, ranged arrow attacks, and magic blasts aptly is the key to victory. Get surrounded, though, and constant attacks will quickly see you beaten down. Drink potions to restore health, or revive fallen comrades with first aid practices. Level up and enhance your knight in one of four fields: power, defense, agility, and magic. Find new weapons with varying properties that can either complement your knight's strengths or cover for his weaknesses. Animal orbs serve as companions and can provie passive benefits, so find as many as you can! The amount of additional goodies you can find is staggering, and it allows you to further set yourself apart amongst your group.The multiplayer mode makes this very enjoyable, and since the level-up mechanic is based on hits landed, a player playing through alone from the start would be on even grounds with a group of four playing through from the start for most of the game. Multiplayer also greatly increases your chances for survival, as potions are used automatically and players can revive fallen comrades. It's a lot more fun to play with a friend or two.The art style is adorable and hilarious, and it offers a lot of laughs. A forest filled with lovable critters that are inclined to soil themselves is not to be overlooked. There are a bunch of little things that make this game that much more charming, and that's partially why I love it so much.The game does have its flaws, though. Some of the bosses have frustrating attack methods that is countered by almost nothing. The Conehead Groom boss, for instance, can be either exploited into submission or result in you being swiftly beaten down without a chance to heal. This is also an Xbox 360 port, so the game even insists you use a controller. A keyboard is usable, but it's very awkward and sometimes more trouble than it's worth. The game can, for some, degenerate into ""run forward, mash buttons, run forward again."" In that case it simply may not cater to you.Those aside, I adore this game and it's always great to come back to, especially with friends.			"

												It's a great game to play with your friends. It's defiantly better with a controller. So if you don't have one you wouldn't be getting the full experience. It's also kinda fun by yourself but the downside is you'll be wanting to level up because with friends you can do harder levels with co-op so you should get your friends to play with you as many times as you can with this game. I have not used the keyboard controls so I cannot say they are good or bad. If you have a controller for your PC and almost never use it or need a game that you want to use your controller for get this game. I forgot about the story, it's funny more than serious so keep that in mind. It's pretty solid but if you are fighting your friends it's kinda weird when you are an inch above them and not hitting them. 9/10			"

All I can say is to make the game fun you will need the following: 1: A controller.2: One or more friends.3: Time.With these three ingredients you'll have loads of fun while being on an epic adventure throught the great lands of Castle Crashers. It is really fun, challenging and satisfying with a simple yet effective artstyle. It may get a bit repetitive when you start your second playthrough but the gameplay always feels great.			"

It's a fun enough game in singe player, with the variation in different spells across a very large roster of (mostly unlockable) characters, but the game mostly shines in multiplayer. If you want a good sidescrolling beat 'em up and have at least one (of the possible four) friend ready for co-op, Castle Crashers is a fantastic choice.			"

												I don't have a lot of playtime on Steam but instead on my Xbox were I would say I have played at least 30+ hours with multiple playthroughs. All I can say is to make the game fun you will need the following: 1: A controller.2: One or more friends.3: Time.With these three ingredients you'll have loads of fun while being on an epic adventure throught the great lands of Castle Crashers. It is really fun, challenging and satisfying with a simple yet effective artstyle. It may get a bit repetitive when you start your second playthrough but the gameplay always feels great.			"

												Excuse the low hours, this is my third time buying this game. Castle Crashers is a classic. It's a fun enough game in singe player, with the variation in different spells across a very large roster of (mostly unlockable) characters, but the game mostly shines in multiplayer. If you want a good sidescrolling beat 'em up and have at least one (of the possible four) friend ready for co-op, Castle Crashers is a fantastic choice.			"

												Castle Crashers is a indie game developed by The Behemoth and is a 2D beat em up videogame that has got a minimal amount of RPG mechanics. There is minimal story and it is no reason to buy the game as it is basically just evil wizard kidnaps 4 princesses and a gem and the king sends you to save the princess's and bring the gem back. On the way you fight Barbarian's, Thieves, Trolls, A faction of knights, fire demons, pirate-ninja's and the evil wizard's minions beyond other things. The game features characters which you choose to play. You have 4 characters unlocked by default and along the way you can unlock more by completing certain stages, finishing solo arena's or finishing the game with certain characters. Many of the enemies you fight along the way can be unlocked to play as although this does not affect the enemies at all. Each character has the ability to use a melee weapon, a bow and magic. While many characters bows are just changed cosmetically and weaponry can be found and equipped instead of being character bound barring a certain character they all have magic that is unique to only a couple or even just one character. As a example the Orange knight's magic is a fire type while the Red Knight uses lightning and unlockable characters can have magic ranging from random weapons, to sawblades or nature magic. The game features a levelling in which each character is levelled seperately with a maximum level of 99. Upon levelling up each character can assign a stat point to one of the following:Strength: which increases damage dealt by the characters melee weapons.Agility: which affects the damage and speed of the bow along with the speed of the character themself.Defense: which affects the health of the character as well as his resistance to enemy attacks. Magic: which increases the damage dealt by the characters magic attacks as well as unlocking new magic moves to use.It is entirely possible to max a characters stats at around level 78 leaving 11 more levels. One thing to note is that you do NOT gain exp on kills but instead you gain exp each time you hit a enemy. You cannot juggle a dead enemy in the air for exp and neither does damage affect how much exp you get from a hit.Combat is simple in Castle Crushers with 2 melee attacks, one bow attack and up to about 3-4 different magic attacks. The game is also able to have more strategy ablied to it like the timing of juggling a enemy to keep them off the ground and unable to hit you. Standard enemies in Castle Crashers usually consist of enemies that have the same kind of moves as your knights which can include magic and bows depending on the enemy type. Most standard enemies can be juggled with enough practice which is a efficient way to deal with them. Along the way towards the evil wizard you will encounter buffed up or 'Beefy' versions of enemies who no longer consist of the move sets of you during your standard form. These enemies have got more hp than there standard versions and can be impossible to juggle sometimes. They have multiple attacks that include grabbing you and either throwing you at another player in co-op or just throwing you away during singleplayer. Then you encounter boss's which are usually signified by a HP Bar in the top center of the screen. These enemies are tough and mostly have unique attacks that are un usable by other enemies and yourself. They can also vary in there appearance with a cyclops or a giant barbarian.The items of Castle Crashers come in the forms of Bombs, Potions, Sandwichs and animal orbs. Potions are your standard fantasy potion which when used they refill your health fully. Bombs are placed on the spot you are and have a fuse. Upon detonating they will damage anything within their radius including you. Sandwichs are a special consumable which when eaten turns you into a 'Beefy' version of your character. During this state you have different attacks and can also remove obstacles that can only be removed by being in a 'beefy' form. Animal orbs are a kind of creature or animal that will follow you around and while equipped will grant you a buff ranging from stat increases, to finding food for you or even increasing the amount of exp that you earn. A animal orb stays with you until you take another animal orb with you. Upon doing that you will be able to find the animal orb in a building next to the blacksmith's frog. Animal orbs have to be unlocked by finding and equipping them.This game is mainly a co-op title with optional pvp in the arena and not so optional pvp whenever you save a princess. However the game is completely playable and finishable solo and i would still recommend it even if you have no friends that are interested or own the game. One notice of warning however is that during co-op if one person is lagging it can either cause the entire game to pause with a waiting for players notice or it can desync players which can cause players to be up to different parts of the mission and see each other doing different things. As an eample during one level me and 2 friends were fighting mobs when i started to get laggy. It seemed to pass but we got desycned which meant that while on my screen they were running around and hitting mid air while i was fighting mobs they were actually fighting the boss that was past the mobs and i was the one not contributing. A quick fix would be to just exit and re-enter the game and maybe restart the lobby.Castle Crashers has 3 gamemodes: Campaign which can be played Solo or Co-op, All you can quaff which is a gamemode where you and 3 other players/AI have to mash certain keys to quickly eat the food and whoever eats all their portion of the food first wins and finally the arena which has got multiple gamemodes in it which include standard pvp with up to 4 players and a mode where you vs each other in trying to amass the most amount of gold by digging up treasure, during this you cannot use melee, bows or magic alothough you can whack the other player by digging with the shovel underneath them. There are two other gamemodes in arena however i have not played as much arena and as such cannot remember them.This game has got a moderate amount of replayability when you first finish it if you want to unlock all the animal orbs and can have even more if you plan on unlocking all characters. However to get to level 99 is repetitive as you would have most likely finished all the area's multiple times and have gotten sick of it.Finally i would say that i definitely recommend this game if your a fan of 2d beat em up with a tiny bit of rpg meshed in and that although they recommend using a Xbox 360 controller to play i find it perfectly fine using a keyboard for it although the button prompts only being in Xbox 360 controller layout is a bit of a paint although it can be overcome.

												Warning: This is an old review that has been re-uploaded intentionally to not only fix some false/missing information, but also to remove the ratings this review has received due to the false/missing information. This has been your warning.Castle Crashers is a game where you take the role of one of four knights who have to save the 4 princesses of the land and the king's magical crystal (no idea why it's so special), while fighting the evil wizard's minions, hostile inhabitants, and even the environment at times. It's gameplay is a Beat-Em-Up with RPG elements. Every time you injure an enemy, you gain EXP, after gaining enough you level up (much like any RPG). Every level up grants you a curtain amount of skill points. These can be spent on your attack, magic, running speed (and even arrow shot length as a bonus), and defense. After gaining curtain amount of levels, your character learns a new technique such as the spin-attack or maybe a strong finisher. If you invest enough points onto the magic skill ""tree"", you can learn new magic techniques such as your character's specific magic projectile such as fire or electricity. It is worth nothing that magic attacks differ from all characters. Nobody is a reskin of another in terms of magic.As you progress through the game, there will be lots of things to find & collect. For example: there are many different weapons with different stats and elements, the golden treasures (you require them to continue the story), animal orbs (little cute (or ugly) animal/monster buddies that increase specific stats further, or provide buffs such as being able to pick up items from far away or possibly having health regeneration), and of course money.There is quite a lot to come back to the game for: many secret items hidden within levels requiring specific conditions to be fulfilled, multiplayer, mini-games with multiplayer features as well, DLC adding even more content into the game such as characters and/or weapons, and a hardcore mode after beating the game with even more weapons & animal orbs that were not in the original game. Did I forget about unlockable/secret characters?The music is very well-done, even to today's standards for a classic game. It always seems to keep that ""Epic"" feel throughout the adventure. I must also give credit that the tracks never feel offbeat, especially during boss fights. Sure, some tracks are re-used, but there is enough variety that it doesn't even matter. While the music doesn't sound very medieval, it still stands as a major selling-point for me in terms of buying the game.Enemies in this game aren't that easy to kill, but they aren't hard either. Like other Beat-Em-Ups, enemies in this game head towards you and try to damage you. When you attack them, you can knock them down and they will get back up, unless you kill them. You'll know if their corpse flashes a bit then disappears. The bosses are quite different in terms of taking them down. Like any generic boss, they have a Life Meter (this time displayed at the bottom of the screen). Once it's depleted to zero, you win. What makes bosses special in this game however is actually the character and humor they bring into the chaos that the game already was. The barbarian boss always gave me a good laugh, and I am sure you would too after being used to the head-slicing and many things being killed.The humor in this game. Just the humor. It's just insanely clever, and devious at the same time. The barbarian boss being a good example. The fight itself can be quite humorous. There is tons of humor in the game, mostly violent yet guilty-pleasure kind of humor. Whether it be a pooping owl, a cyclops wedding crash, or even the silliness of the hostile inhabitants.Who's ready for some fun facts?Fun Fact: Did you know before the ""Barbarian Makeover"" update (also is known as version 2.0), there was an old mini-game (that is now exclusive to the Xbox 360 versions of the game) called ""All You Can Quaff""? This mini-game involved you mashing the buttons as fast as you can to beat your rivals in an eating contest. The achievement related to the mini-game was changed to the ""Back off Barbarian"" mini-game achievement. Those who already obtained that achievement previously would still have it.Fun Fact #2: If you own Battleblock Theater along with Castle Crashers, these games actually sync with each other! In Castle Crashers, you can play as Hatty Hattington and unleash the wonders of green gems (and some other fun Battleblock Theater related stuff) at your enemies along with having the golden whale animal orb, which is basically a mini-money generator. In Battleblock Theater on the other hand, you get a Castle Crasher head. Worth quite a lot on the market due to it's rarity and being a promotional item. You don't have to buy the ""Can't Stop Laughing"" bundle to get the promo items, you can buy them separately and still obtain the promo, although it'll likely cost more $ from you.Overall, I feel that Castle Crashers is a blast to play (despite me buying it three times on different platforms), and is worth the 15$ price tag, even more worth it buying the ""Can't Stop Laughing"" bundle. I also must exaggerate bring your friends as this is an awesome game to play with friends, whether it be online or offline. I will most curtainly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun time with their friends (or by themselves..like myself..#ForeverAlone).			"

												Extremely funny game, specially with multiple players to share the laughter of... pretty much everything!Everything in this game is meant to cause some chuckles, from the animations, sounds, bosses and even the storyline.The gameplay is a bit retro, 2D mash-to-win (similar to Streets of Rage), but with plenty of weapons and adorable petsto collect (Gotta Catch'em All, anyone?). There are also some basic RPG elements, like stats and level-ups, andsometimes some grinding is advised before moving to certain areas, but nothing unreasonable.The game has a lot of levels and variety, but they're pretty short and once the game is finished, there's little to doexcept the aforementioned collecting. The online modes are pretty weak, just stick to 'coop' the main game.Recommended to those looking for simple gameplay and story, and want little depth but a lot of fun in their game!			"

												It's a great game to play with your friends. It's defiantly better with a controller. So if you don't have one you wouldn't be getting the full experience. It's also kinda fun by yourself but the downside is you'll be wanting to level up because with friends you can do harder levels with co-op so you should get your friends to play with you as many times as you can with this game. I have not used the keyboard controls so I cannot say they are good or bad. If you have a controller for your PC and almost never use it or need a game that you want to use your controller for get this game. I forgot about the story, it's funny more than serious so keep that in mind. It's pretty solid but if you are fighting your friends it's kinda weird when you are an inch above them and not hitting them. 9/10			"

You cannot juggle a dead enemy in the air for exp and neither does damage affect how much exp you get from a hit.Combat is simple in Castle Crushers with 2 melee attacks, one bow attack and up to about 3-4 different magic attacks. The game is also able to have more strategy ablied to it like the timing of juggling a enemy to keep them off the ground and unable to hit you. Standard enemies in Castle Crashers usually consist of enemies that have the same kind of moves as your knights which can include magic and bows depending on the enemy type. Most standard enemies can be juggled with enough practice which is a efficient way to deal with them. Along the way towards the evil wizard you will encounter buffed up or 'Beefy' versions of enemies who no longer consist of the move sets of you during your standard form. These enemies have got more hp than there standard versions and can be impossible to juggle sometimes. They have multiple attacks that include grabbing you and either throwing you at another player in co-op or just throwing you away during singleplayer. Then you encounter boss's which are usually signified by a HP Bar in the top center of the screen. These enemies are tough and mostly have unique attacks that are un usable by other enemies and yourself. They can also vary in there appearance with a cyclops or a giant barbarian.The items of Castle Crashers come in the forms of Bombs, Potions, Sandwichs and animal orbs. Potions are your standard fantasy potion which when used they refill your health fully. Bombs are placed on the spot you are and have a fuse. Upon detonating they will damage anything within their radius including you. Sandwichs are a special consumable which when eaten turns you into a 'Beefy' version of your character. During this state you have different attacks and can also remove obstacles that can only be removed by being in a 'beefy' form. Animal orbs are a kind of creature or animal that will follow you around and while equipped will grant you a buff ranging from stat increases, to finding food for you or even increasing the amount of exp that you earn. A animal orb stays with you until you take another animal orb with you. Upon doing that you will be able to find the animal orb in a building next to the blacksmith's frog. Animal orbs have to be unlocked by finding and equipping them.This game is mainly a co-op title with optional pvp in the arena and not so optional pvp whenever you save a princess. However the game is completely playable and finishable solo and i would still recommend it even if you have no friends that are interested or own the game. One notice of warning however is that during co-op if one person is lagging it can either cause the entire game to pause with a waiting for players notice or it can desync players which can cause players to be up to different parts of the mission and see each other doing different things. As an eample during one level me and 2 friends were fighting mobs when i started to get laggy. It seemed to pass but we got desycned which meant that while on my screen they were running around and hitting mid air while i was fighting mobs they were actually fighting the boss that was past the mobs and i was the one not contributing. A quick fix would be to just exit and re-enter the game and maybe restart the lobby.Castle Crashers has 3 gamemodes: Campaign which can be played Solo or Co-op, All you can quaff which is a gamemode where you and 3 other players/AI have to mash certain keys to quickly eat the food and whoever eats all their portion of the food first wins and finally the arena which has got multiple gamemodes in it which include standard pvp with up to 4 players and a mode where you vs each other in trying to amass the most amount of gold by digging up treasure, during this you cannot use melee, bows or magic alothough you can whack the other player by digging with the shovel underneath them. There are two other gamemodes in arena however i have not played as much arena and as such cannot remember them.This game has got a moderate amount of replayability when you first finish it if you want to unlock all the animal orbs and can have even more if you plan on unlocking all characters. However to get to level 99 is repetitive as you would have most likely finished all the area's multiple times and have gotten sick of it.Finally i would say that i definitely recommend this game if your a fan of 2d beat em up with a tiny bit of rpg meshed in and that although they recommend using a Xbox 360 controller to play i find it perfectly fine using a keyboard for it although the button prompts only being in Xbox 360 controller layout is a bit of a paint although it can be overcome.

												This is a nice, fluid, beat-em-up game that is surprisingly addictive. First of all, this game focuses on combat. It only makes sense that this is what the game exceeds at. It offers classic melee combos intertwined with magical onslaughts and slick bow-shooting. As a result, the combat is never boring and keeps you eager to bash skulls all around. The other aspects of the game are pretty decent. The gameplay never lags, the story is shallow yet fun, and the cartoon-like graphics provide scenery that isn't detailed enough to distract you from the gameplay.All in all, I'd recommend it to the casual gamer who wants a little reprieve from the more strategical high-end games available.

												This game is simply AMAZING.You pick a character of your liking, finish the game with him and unlock new characters + Insane mode for the character you finished the game with. You got bored repeating the story mode with your usual weapon and animal orbs? Simple, go on a quest to get them all! The Animal Orbs are helpful (and some have secret effects) which will make your playthroughs with new characters far more easier and fun!Considering weapons, there are alot to choose from. Some are hidden, some are picked up from monsters and some are just given after boss fights. There is a variety of weaponary to choose from. Also, you can get a bow and a boomerang (which is hidden and a special pet is required to get it) to boost up your combos and kill everyone with style.The story of the game is quite fun and interesting. Though I warn you the game is not that long, (about 2 hours max) but you have to keep in mind that you will be repeating it for a great amount of time if you want to unlock new characters. (Some are given when you beat arenas SOLO)My final opinion:This game is WORTH BUYING. On sale it's usually 50% or 75% off which makes it more worth the money. If you like fighting, unlocking new play methods and rewards, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!			"

												It's a fun game to play with. Either by yourself or with friends. But the downside is that when you do play with friends, the connection is bad and is hard to complete a stage.

												Castle Crashers is one of the best co-op games that i have played yet. This game is a button mashser so take note if you son't like that type of games. I really like the graphic style that looks like a cartoon. You start out with 4 different characters that look almost the same but are yet so different. They each have some type of magic that you can use. The blue one uses ice, the yelow one uses fire, the green one uses poision/poison gas and the red one (the one that i use) uses lightning. You can level each one of these characters up individually and everytime you level up you get some skill points that you can speend on stenght, magic power, health/defence and agility. The strenght upgrade let's you dish out more damage, the magic power will make your magic more powerfull and give you new magic tricks, the helth/defence one gives you more health and defence (duh..) and the agility one makes you faster and do more damage with your bow. The bow is one of the items that you can get others include a boomerang, a shovel, a health poition (up to 5), a super sandwich (up to five, a bomb (up to 5) and some quest items. On your quest to save the kingdom from an evil wizard you can have a flying pet following you. These pets will give you a variety of boosts like helping you level up faster, hit some of the enemies, helping you find new weapons and others. There are so many different weapons that can boost your stats or make some stats go down while the weapon is equipped like for example a weapon might give you +2 in strenght but -1 in magic. I won't spoil anything but when you beat the game the character you beat it with will unlock a new character so if you are more than on person the person who played played blue might get an alien and the person who played red might get a skeleton (i don't know what the different charaters get). I can't really mention the soundtrack and the soundeffects since i didn't have the sound on most of the time but what i heard was pretty good. When you have beaten the game and have a high level charater you will be pleased to find out that you unlocked INSANE MODE which i am curretly playing with my friend. INSANE MODE is the entire game again but much harder. Before you start insane mode you can buy some weapons and pets at a high cost but they help a lot. I forgot to mention the money. In stages you will collect money that enemies drop and these money can be spent on potions, pets, swords and other good stuff. One of the good aspects of this money system is that you don't EVER have to spend any of it. You can collect pets and swords everywhere so you don't have to buy anything. Shops are located al around the map and there is almost always a boss battle close to them. These boss battles are so good. They are really creative and can prove to be quite a challenge sometimes but not to hard. I mean like you had to fight a corncob that when you hit it turn into popcorn that give you health. There is a lot to do in this game and it is really gret but now to the parts that i didn't like so much. The game starts by saying the it is best to play with a controller and sure thats is fine but the game does not show any pc controls ANYWHERE! The controls for pc kind of suck too. Sometimes the achivemets can be such a pain to get and you need a friend to help you get them. On the topics of needing people to play with this game is nowhere nears as fun playing alone as it is playing with someone else. I tried alone for a while and it was not very fun at all so if you don't have anyone to play with then DON'T buy this game, but if you have someone to play with i defintly think that you should buy this game. To be honest this is an amazing game when playing with you friends. The game is so creative and fun and there are so many sword and pets and charaters because you can get more charaters from arenas and  beating the game with new charaters gives you more characters. The graphics are really cool and the gameplay is also really fun. The controls can be a bit stupid at times but it can be overlooked if you have gotten used to them. If you can play with someone else this game is a 9/10 because it is so fun and creative and all the stuff you can do even after beating the game it has high replay value. If you have someone to play with BUY THIS GAME! However if you don't have anyoe to play with the game becomes so much less fun. Alone it is one long grind (if you want to complete it) or just a game you will only beat once and then thats it. Alone i would give it a 6/10 because it is still a great game in my opinion but i would say DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE ALONE! I hope this review was useful. It was my first so i would love critisism. Thank you:-)			"

												An old-school beat'em up, where you have to save princesses, by first freeing them and then getting a kiss from them. 10/10 for originality.Graphics - If you have watched any of the 90's - early 20's cartoons, you are going to fall inlove with the graphic style of this game. As a person who grew up watching cartoons, everything I see has a mixed combination of new and nostalgia.10/10Music - Boy does the music in this game have a wide variety of emotions, from the melodical and calm one that is playing while you are just moving on to the powering up it does the moment you enter a fight. Overall the place and time for every single song is perfect. 10/10Cinematics - It does have quite a few cinematics, most of them are to introduce a level or a boss, but still you won't see a one that copies the other, every single one is unique. I have to add most of them are quite funny, 10/10Story - A pretty basic story, go there, save that, get a kiss, easy as that. The but the comedical depth it adds is just tremendous. the story is mostly told through text bubbles, either way your going to see the funny side in the text or through their action. 10/10Content -  The game lacks nothing, enough enemy variations to keep yourself interested, a wide variety of weather types, random things that happen on the screen. No matter how much you play, you wont be able to predict what a person will say or do. 10/10Controls - You can play on either mouse+keyboard or controler (I recommend the controler). Both of them are fluid and responsive. 10/10Gameplay - A really fun experience, but best played with friends, even by playing alone you are punishing yourself, by what you are missing if you have 4 players and that it is really hard for 1 player. That is either the game really does get way too hard for 1 player or that I am a bad player (the second). 10/10Just the perfect game in my opinion, it gets every single thing it strives to get right, from the littlest detail to the biggest of ones. I strongly recommend playing with friends, either buy it for them (that won't happen),  make them buy it themselves (still won't happen) or buy it for your pet bear (most probable). I would like to add why the hell do you have a bear pet, but hey that is life.Overall score: 10/10			"

												I don't have a lot of playtime on Steam but instead on my Xbox were I would say I have played at least 30+ hours with multiple playthroughs. All I can say is to make the game fun you will need the following: 1: A controller.2: One or more friends.3: Time.With these three ingredients you'll have loads of fun while being on an epic adventure throught the great lands of Castle Crashers. It is really fun, challenging and satisfying with a simple yet effective artstyle. It may get a bit repetitive when you start your second playthrough but the gameplay always feels great.			"

												Excuse the low hours, this is my third time buying this game. Castle Crashers is a classic. It's a fun enough game in singe player, with the variation in different spells across a very large roster of (mostly unlockable) characters, but the game mostly shines in multiplayer. If you want a good sidescrolling beat 'em up and have at least one (of the possible four) friend ready for co-op, Castle Crashers is a fantastic choice.			"

												Castle Crashers is a indie game developed by The Behemoth and is a 2D beat em up videogame that has got a minimal amount of RPG mechanics. There is minimal story and it is no reason to buy the game as it is basically just evil wizard kidnaps 4 princesses and a gem and the king sends you to save the princess's and bring the gem back. On the way you fight Barbarian's, Thieves, Trolls, A faction of knights, fire demons, pirate-ninja's and the evil wizard's minions beyond other things. The game features characters which you choose to play. You have 4 characters unlocked by default and along the way you can unlock more by completing certain stages, finishing solo arena's or finishing the game with certain characters. Many of the enemies you fight along the way can be unlocked to play as although this does not affect the enemies at all. Each character has the ability to use a melee weapon, a bow and magic. While many characters bows are just changed cosmetically and weaponry can be found and equipped instead of being character bound barring a certain character they all have magic that is unique to only a couple or even just one character. As a example the Orange knight's magic is a fire type while the Red Knight uses lightning and unlockable characters can have magic ranging from random weapons, to sawblades or nature magic. The game features a levelling in which each character is levelled seperately with a maximum level of 99. Upon levelling up each character can assign a stat point to one of the following:Strength: which increases damage dealt by the characters melee weapons.Agility: which affects the damage and speed of the bow along with the speed of the character themself.Defense: which affects the health of the character as well as his resistance to enemy attacks. Magic: which increases the damage dealt by the characters magic attacks as well as unlocking new magic moves to use.It is entirely possible to max a characters stats at around level 78 leaving 11 more levels. One thing to note is that you do NOT gain exp on kills but instead you gain exp each time you hit a enemy. You cannot juggle a dead enemy in the air for exp and neither does damage affect how much exp you get from a hit.Combat is simple in Castle Crushers with 2 melee attacks, one bow attack and up to about 3-4 different magic attacks. The game is also able to have more strategy ablied to it like the timing of juggling a enemy to keep them off the ground and unable to hit you. Standard enemies in Castle Crashers usually consist of enemies that have the same kind of moves as your knights which can include magic and bows depending on the enemy type. Most standard enemies can be juggled with enough practice which is a efficient way to deal with them. Along the way towards the evil wizard you will encounter buffed up or 'Beefy' versions of enemies who no longer consist of the move sets of you during your standard form. These enemies have got more hp than there standard versions and can be impossible to juggle sometimes. They have multiple attacks that include grabbing you and either throwing you at another player in co-op or just throwing you away during singleplayer. Then you encounter boss's which are usually signified by a HP Bar in the top center of the screen. These enemies are tough and mostly have unique attacks that are un usable by other enemies and yourself. They can also vary in there appearance with a cyclops or a giant barbarian.The items of Castle Crashers come in the forms of Bombs, Potions, Sandwichs and animal orbs. Potions are your standard fantasy potion which when used they refill your health fully. Bombs are placed on the spot you are and have a fuse. Upon detonating they will damage anything within their radius including you. Sandwichs are a special consumable which when eaten turns you into a 'Beefy' version of your character. During this state you have different attacks and can also remove obstacles that can only be removed by being in a 'beefy' form. Animal orbs are a kind of creature or animal that will follow you around and while equipped will grant you a buff ranging from stat increases, to finding food for you or even increasing the amount of exp that you earn. A animal orb stays with you until you take another animal orb with you. Upon doing that you will be able to find the animal orb in a building next to the blacksmith's frog. Animal orbs have to be unlocked by finding and equipping them.This game is mainly a co-op title with optional pvp in the arena and not so optional pvp whenever you save a princess. However the game is completely playable and finishable solo and i would still recommend it even if you have no friends that are interested or own the game. One notice of warning however is that during co-op if one person is lagging it can either cause the entire game to pause with a waiting for players notice or it can desync players which can cause players to be up to different parts of the mission and see each other doing different things. As an eample during one level me and 2 friends were fighting mobs when i started to get laggy. It seemed to pass but we got desycned which meant that while on my screen they were running around and hitting mid air while i was fighting mobs they were actually fighting the boss that was past the mobs and i was the one not contributing. A quick fix would be to just exit and re-enter the game and maybe restart the lobby.Castle Crashers has 3 gamemodes: Campaign which can be played Solo or Co-op, All you can quaff which is a gamemode where you and 3 other players/AI have to mash certain keys to quickly eat the food and whoever eats all their portion of the food first wins and finally the arena which has got multiple gamemodes in it which include standard pvp with up to 4 players and a mode where you vs each other in trying to amass the most amount of gold by digging up treasure, during this you cannot use melee, bows or magic alothough you can whack the other player by digging with the shovel underneath them. There are two other gamemodes in arena however i have not played as much arena and as such cannot remember them.This game has got a moderate amount of replayability when you first finish it if you want to unlock all the animal orbs and can have even more if you plan on unlocking all characters. However to get to level 99 is repetitive as you would have most likely finished all the area's multiple times and have gotten sick of it.Finally i would say that i definitely recommend this game if your a fan of 2d beat em up with a tiny bit of rpg meshed in and that although they recommend using a Xbox 360 controller to play i find it perfectly fine using a keyboard for it although the button prompts only being in Xbox 360 controller layout is a bit of a paint although it can be overcome.

												This game has its ups on downs. Pros : Fun to play with friends, one of the best co-op games and the cartoony graphics are to die for. Cons : You have to use a controller. Keyboard will do but, it teaches you the buttons in xbox form. Over all great game. 8/10			"

												The best experince is on consoles with all of the bugs and hacks you will run into here BUT, the game hols up VERY well to other PC ports, infact this company knows how to port things over the right way! Don't get me wrong when I say there are bugs and what not, there where only about 1 or 2 I ran into while playing but I still think it's worth a mention. One last note about the hacks, there are SOOO many ways to hack this game it isn't even funny, jsut a heads up incase any of you don't have a friend and want to hop online with a stranger, he might be a glitched level and start flying around the level buy HEY!

												An evil wizard steals a large, mystical gem from the king of an unnamed empire, as well as kidnapping its four princesses. The king sends the four brave knights that spearhead his guard into the vast land to rescue the princesses, recover the gem, and defeat the evil wizard. Unfortunately, the knights first have to contend with an army of barbarians storming the king's castle as the wizard makes his escape.Castle Crashers is a gem among the endless onslaught of casual games available on Steam. It has its flaws, of course, but when all the elements are considered, it makes for a fantastic, ""I'm bored, let's play"" sort of game that you could very well find yourself coming back to again and again.The game is a side-scrolling, linear beat-'em-up, with a silly plot, very apt character design, and great handling in terms of gameplay. When you begin, you take control of one of four knights, each with a unique elemental affiliation; the Green Knight wields deadly poison magic, the Orange Knight pyrokinetically commands fire magic, the Blue Knight freezes enemies with ice magic, and the Red Knight shocks his foes into submission with electric magic. As you progress, more characters are unlocked and thusly become playable, most of which are enemies you will face on your journey. However, replaying the game as a new character gets tiresome if done in excess. Regardless, the wide array of playable characters allows you to find one you like. I adore games that allow for this,The gameplay handles well, with a great capacity for combo attacks. Chaining melee attacks of varying strengths, ranged arrow attacks, and magic blasts aptly is the key to victory. Get surrounded, though, and constant attacks will quickly see you beaten down. Drink potions to restore health, or revive fallen comrades with first aid practices. Level up and enhance your knight in one of four fields: power, defense, agility, and magic. Find new weapons with varying properties that can either complement your knight's strengths or cover for his weaknesses. Animal orbs serve as companions and can provie passive benefits, so find as many as you can! The amount of additional goodies you can find is staggering, and it allows you to further set yourself apart amongst your group.The multiplayer mode makes this very enjoyable, and since the level-up mechanic is based on hits landed, a player playing through alone from the start would be on even grounds with a group of four playing through from the start for most of the game. Multiplayer also greatly increases your chances for survival, as potions are used automatically and players can revive fallen comrades. It's a lot more fun to play with a friend or two.The art style is adorable and hilarious, and it offers a lot of laughs. A forest filled with lovable critters that are inclined to soil themselves is not to be overlooked. There are a bunch of little things that make this game that much more charming, and that's partially why I love it so much.The game does have its flaws, though. Some of the bosses have frustrating attack methods that is countered by almost nothing. The Conehead Groom boss, for instance, can be either exploited into submission or result in you being swiftly beaten down without a chance to heal. This is also an Xbox 360 port, so the game even insists you use a controller. A keyboard is usable, but it's very awkward and sometimes more trouble than it's worth. The game can, for some, degenerate into ""run forward, mash buttons, run forward again."" In that case it simply may not cater to you.Those aside, I adore this game and it's always great to come back to, especially with friends.			"

												Decent, but overrated.  The combat and customization is great, and the multiplayer and trademark Newgrounds goofiness makes this a great party game. However, the experience/leveling is too overbearing; it controls not only the player's moveset and abilities, but also their health and damage-dealing ability. This kind of soils the experience by creating situations where the enemies either feel too tanky or too glassy, with rarely any middle ground if you play the game's levels out of order (or, if you play the game's tedious Hard Mode). And while the player character has diverse combat abilities, the enemies you fight start to become a little same-ish after a while.As far as single player gameplay goes, I honestly would prefer to play Turtles in Time for the SNES.  Price tag is ""eh"", your milage may vary.			"

												Castle Crashers starts with a mysterious man snatching a large (and what I assume is also expensive) crystal and four lovely princesses from the King's throne. As one of the knights of the castle, it is your duty to retrieve the stolen goods and fair maidens. There's no dialogue, so you won't get more of a story than that unless you use your imagination. That's not a bad thing, though, especially for a brawler. If you're like me, you probably don't need an excuse to chop enemies up into little pieces.       The best part of Castle Crashers is exploring the world -- there are tons of levels that look and play completely differently. From slip-n-slide icy terrains to sandy deserts, it's clear that every area was crafted with care by the Behemoth's resident artist, Dan Paladin. His unique art style really brings the environments to life, and even the most ferocious monsters are still pretty cute. To counteract the adorableness of Paladin's creations, the game includes lots of potty humor and gore-filled battles.       The four starting knights wield magic powers that are differentiated by armor color -- Red has lightning, Green has poison, Orange has fire, and Blue has ice. Armed with magic and steel (or maybe a stick), you'll hack your way through mounds of enemies, gain experience points, and level up. As you progress, you'll garner more skill points to divide amongst four traits: Strength, Magic, Defense, and Agility. You can build up your character however you'd like, but that's not the only way you can customize.       On your quest to save the princesses you'll discover two other tools to help you: melee weaponry and animal orbs. You can find new weapons several ways; some will be obviously given to you and others you'll need to dig up or purchase at a store. Every weapon will affect your stats either positively or negatively. A regular sword might take away a point of Strength but add a point to your Agility, so you'll need to make the call on what traits are more important to you. The urge to find a better, cooler weapon never dies, so you can expect to search the many hidden crevices of the game until you find something that suites your style.       Animal orbs are probably my favorite thing in Castle Crashers because they're just so damn cute. There are 28 creatures (the two DLC animals from the Xbox 360 version are now included) scattered across the lands, and it's up to you to find them. Each animal provides a different boost and comes complete with an endearing name, so Meowburt the kitty increases your agility skill while Owlet the owl can retrieve food items for you. It's fun to battle with a small animal hovering around you, especially if it's Rammy the ram who will ram nearby enemies for you.       The Behemoth is known for making difficult games, most notably Alien Hominid, and that reputation stands true if you try and take on the campaign by yourself. Though it can be done, single-player assaults are more frustrating and less enjoyable than teaming up with other people. The biggest issue in trying to take on levels solo is that multiple enemies can assault you with ranged attacks, making it difficult to even stand up before being knocked down again. Since it's designed to be a cooperative game, it's hard to scold The Behemoth for making it incredibly difficult to conquer on your own. There's no ""I"" in team, after all.      Speaking of friends, you can crash castles with the favorite people on your friends list either locally or online. With local co-op mode, you can't sign into multiple accounts like you could in the Xbox 360 version; you can only split up the main PSN ID into quarters. Friends curious about the game can also drop-in and out from the map, but not in the middle of a level, so it's not truly drop-in, drop-out co-op. Despite that flaw, it is nice that you can mix up the local and online co-op modes, so if you and a buddy at your house want to pair up with some other people on your friends list, you can do that.      If you're lucky enough, you can successfully create private matches with your friends, but out of several people only one of my friends was able to host a match without getting an error. Dropping into quick matches, however, seemed to work just fine. While playing online, there was some noticeable lag, but it didn't actually interfere until the worst possible moment -- once I made it to last part of the final boss, the game I was in suddenly dropped. Curse you, wretched servers!!! I can only hope that a patch fixing these issues will become available for the PS3 faster than it did for the Xbox 360 version.      Since the game had to be re-coded for the PS3 anyway, The Behemoth added in some minor differences throughout the campaign along with some major re-hauls. The most noticeable change is that the former mode All You Can Quaff has been removed and replaced with Volleyball. True to real life volleyball, there are two four-person teams playing against each other. The only problem is it's really difficult to figure out if you're on the same plane as the ball, so expect to get scored on a lot until you get the hang of it.      Team Arena has also been updated to include teams. Now you can pair up for some two-on-two battles, or prove yourself against three other people. There's also an Insane Store that's unlocked once you've beaten the game on normal difficulty. All former DLC offerings and the popular Alien Hominid character are included, some are found in the Insane Store, while others have to be earned in different ways.      THE VERDICTThe Behemoth's incredibly fun cooperative beat 'em-up would have been pure brawler perfection if the multiplayer had launched in better form. It's incredibly frustrating that it's easier to play Castle Crashers with strangers than with your friends, but it's still a great brawler that will soak up your time. Between unlocking new characters so you can level them up to finding all of the hidden weapons and animal orbs, there's a lot to do in the campaign mode. If you never experienced the Xbox 360 version, or you happen to have more friends on your PSN list, Castle Crashers is a great game though you might want to wait for a multiplayer patch before investing.

												An old-school beat'em up, where you have to save princesses, by first freeing them and then getting a kiss from them. 10/10 for originality.Graphics - If you have watched any of the 90's - early 20's cartoons, you are going to fall inlove with the graphic style of this game. As a person who grew up watching cartoons, everything I see has a mixed combination of new and nostalgia.10/10Music - Boy does the music in this game have a wide variety of emotions, from the melodical and calm one that is playing while you are just moving on to the powering up it does the moment you enter a fight. Overall the place and time for every single song is perfect. 10/10Cinematics - It does have quite a few cinematics, most of them are to introduce a level or a boss, but still you won't see a one that copies the other, every single one is unique. I have to add most of them are quite funny, 10/10Story - A pretty basic story, go there, save that, get a kiss, easy as that. The but the comedical depth it adds is just tremendous. the story is mostly told through text bubbles, either way your going to see the funny side in the text or through their action. 10/10Content -  The game lacks nothing, enough enemy variations to keep yourself interested, a wide variety of weather types, random things that happen on the screen. No matter how much you play, you wont be able to predict what a person will say or do. 10/10Controls - You can play on either mouse+keyboard or controler (I recommend the controler). Both of them are fluid and responsive. 10/10Gameplay - A really fun experience, but best played with friends, even by playing alone you are punishing yourself, by what you are missing if you have 4 players and that it is really hard for 1 player. That is either the game really does get way too hard for 1 player or that I am a bad player (the second). 10/10Just the perfect game in my opinion, it gets every single thing it strives to get right, from the littlest detail to the biggest of ones. I strongly recommend playing with friends, either buy it for them (that won't happen),  make them buy it themselves (still won't happen) or buy it for your pet bear (most probable). I would like to add why the hell do you have a bear pet, but hey that is life.Overall score: 10/10			"

												Very good co-op/single player beat 'em up style game. I loved playing with my firends. The only problem is, there's some compatibility issues. It has control 'prompts' for you to press for combos and stuff, but the prompts appear as the xbox controls, not what i have mapped for my PC. Ifthis gets fixed, an easy 5-star rating.			"

												Castle Crashers is not a new game to me, In fact I pretty much played it non stop when it was released on the Xbox 360. But I’ve finally got round to playing it on the PC and my love affair has started allover again. Behemoth have a history of shall we say quirky but brilliant games, Alien Hominid and BattleBlock theater are the best known of them. Castle Crashers is no exception to this ether, the age old tail ofKnight rescues Princess is turned into the most ludicrous romp you’ve ever seen. You’ll find yourself retrieving weapons from the mouth of a giant toad, battling a Giant Cat Fish that is more cat than fish and even kissinga clown! Castle Crashers is anything but normal in any sense of the word and that’s its charm. The game its self is a fast paced side scrolling beat em up, much like Streets of Rage and Final Fight but completely different at the same time.  It has RPG elements too with characters being awardedpoints for each level they increase that they can spend on various skills such a magic and speed. Weapons can also be discovered through out the game, but with the exception of a few later ones offer very little advantageexcept cosmetics. The starting line up of four characters can be increased as you progress through various means. Pretty much every character in the game if a similar size to the starting line up will become playable. The story is set in medieval times, with your Knight sent off to rescue four Princess’s from an evil Sorcerer who has stolen the Kings prized emerald. As I’ve said, its not exactly original, its theway its told that’s original. Don’t misunderstand, its not Shakespeare but its extremely funny all the same. You will find yourself travelling through enemy encampments, lava worlds, deserts and even travelling on pirateships and alien spacecraft. Castle Crashers isn’t afraid to be obscure or bizarre and we love it for that. The boss battles are imaginative and just as off the wall as the rest of the game. The first boss sets the tone forthis very well, You enter an arena to be greeted by a giant barbarian only for him to be squashed by an even bigger one! Or there’s the Giant Metal Hand, the Cat Fish, Medusa and the list goes on. Don’t get me wrong, its not going to change the way we game or rewrite the genre. Castle Crashers is the ultimate pick up and play game, you don’t need to have played it before and you don’t needexperience with scrolling beat em ups. You just play it, there’s no better way to explain it, you just do it. I could explain to you how holding this button and pressing this makes your character do that. But it would bepointless, the system just works and works well. Its worth pointing out though that although most characters magic ability’s are the same with different effects. Some characters powers really are different and can changethe way you play. The graphics may not be cutting edge or super realistic, but all the same you’d be hard pressed to find a more stylised example of 2D draw sprites. There fun, colourful and unique, if you’ve playedany of Behemoth’s other offerings you know what to expect.See this and more reviews here http://cyberusuk.com/2015/03/03/castle-crashers-by-behemoth-review-be-a-knight/ "

												Castle Crashers is one of the simplest games but it's so much fun.You attack by constantly mashing buttons which is encouraged rather than looked down upon. There are also combos you level up to learn that you can master and even though they do help greatly, even the best of players usually resort to mashing. Vertical alignment can usually be pretty annoying given the perspective, but a quick magic jump or bomb and you're good.Mashing is usually the worst possible tactic in Back Off Barbarian though.Straight outta Tom Fulp, Castle Crashers has all the Newgrounds humor you could ever want and more. This game shines in multiplayer, where you gang up on literally everything and go to town with your buds (or just play volleyball with some sand dudes.)			"

												Please play this game with a controller please.Castle Crashers is an honestly silly game involving you, maybe three other friends, and sharp objects with which to stab other things with. Each colored knight has this ability which corralates to its color; in a sort of elemental attack or so.Its a fun and zany stab-em-up game with a penchant for mob-based mechanics which in my opinion, is the best and most fun way to do it. The best feeling is when you throw a dude into a bunch of other dudes.The art style is cute, but its unknown to me if its trying to be funny. I laughed anyway.My only real complaint is its rather easy to ram bosses into a corner and keep right on hitting them, and they can't do a darn thing as they're much too busy recoiling from my hits. Bosses are easy to cheese, is what I'm saying.Play it with friends if you can. I got four USB hookups. Let's do this. The green one is my favorite because poison.9/10			"

												This is a very good beat-'em-up style game, and a good time-waster at that. There are many fun bosses and interesting enemies, as well as a decent storyline to put it all together. There are a few weird cutscenes where the animals are defecating, though. Very good multiplayer setup and overall one of my favorite games on Steam. I have never gotten bored playing this game. The endgame is a little rushed, but well worth the erratic boss patterns. Insane mode unlocks after the main game is beaten, and that's a gigantic struggle.			"

												The art style is quirky and fun and in a way, beautiful. I like it. The humor of The Behemoth is also something to enjoy, like the pooping owl and the small boss that gets replaced by a bigger boss--not to mention the hilarious unveiling of a certain princess. It took 13 hours for me to complete the game, which is on the longer side. It usually only takes 5 hours (according to what I've seen posted) to complete the game. CC has tons of replayability with so many characters and insane mode, but I'm just not one for doing the same levels over again. All in all, I'd give it 8/10, and say it's worth playing at least once.			"

												I've only played this a few hours so far, but I must recommend this to any fans of old school beat 'em up / hack and slash games.  While I haven't seen it bring anything particulary new to the table in my play thus far.  It does deliver a very solid performance for the genre.  Already in my play I have seen little nods to classics like Golden Axe and Battletoads that made me smile.  The art work is colorful and crisp and really pops.  The enemies vary as you go along to mix things up a little bit.  It is also rife with cheezy little humourous moments that will make you chuckle.One other neat thing is that you can find different weapons and pets throughout your play.  So you are not just stuck with the same stuff the whole time.  Also, as you play you level up your character and gain new combos along the way.  So there is some progression to the game play.I really can't find anything negative to say about it thus far, except for maybe the fact that if you want to change pets/weapon you have to go back to your home castle and it can take a moment to navigate the map back to where you were, but it is a minor inconvieniance at most.I picked this game up for DIRT CHEAP during the Summer Sale and it is absolutely worth every penny.  Best beat 'em up I've played on PC since Little Fighter.			"

												One of the best comic style co- op games i have ever played. This is so much fun and is has a weird sense of humor :DDbut you should try this with a x- box 360 controller for better gameplay. So just go for it, the money will be well spent.			"

												Even though so far, I have only played this game for 2.5 hours on the PC ... I own it on my Xbox 360 thus have played over 60 hours on there.Regarding the game itself regardless of platform ... it's an awesome game. The jokes are well timed, the combat is pretty addicting since it's all fast paced, the co-op for this game works wonderfully well, and the fact you can get creative in how you kill your enemies. For example, you can equip any dropped weapon if your states meets it's requirements. Or perhaps you want to just use a bow the entire way. That's fine too! Though if you use a bow, better upgrade that agility up lol.Interesting enough, you can have 'pets' with you. I think pets really makes this game stand out more since each animal has a different ability. The owl will bring you food, the bat will bite enemie's heads off, the golden whale shall crap out golden blocks. It's all really cool to see plus the artistic design is appealing to how the game's mechanics work out.On the PC, it's not only as glorious as the Xbox 360 version... you don't even need a controller. Unlike most action games where a controller is required, the game allows you to set up the controls on your keyboard. Any action + item use + movement can all be changed. Thanks to this, playing on the keyboard is actually possible thus I can play without any troubles. It's a huge relief to be honest since games like Double Dragon Neon is truly hard without connecting a controller. This game is amazing and just great to play with your friends. I advise you see for yourself.			"

												Castle Crashers is a cartoon-style adventure game where four knights go on a quest to stop an evil wizard and return the four princesses. Along the way the knights will face an army of barbarians, travel through a forest infested with theives, crash a wedding, fight off a giant troll from the back of a high-speed carriage, fight a dragon who loves sock puppets, get abducted by aliens, play volleyball on a sand castle roof, fight Medusa on a bad hair day, defeat a necromancer, and save the four princesses. All things considered, it's definitely a great game.			"

												Even though I have only 14 hours on this game, I really do recommend it. It allows players to go adventure in a 2d type of gameplay. You can also play with your friends and other players too if you want. If you really want to, you can also play solo. There are many weapons and items you can buy from stores too. This gives a whole new taste to the genre of Adventure and actions games.			"

nukes-viewHi all, nukes here.Castle Crashers is a 2D side scrolling hack and slash adventure. Easy to pick up and play, I enjoyed playing this game solo and online with friends (up to 4 players).This game is very well put together and the developers have a knack for 2D side scrolling games. Great humour and art styles with a variety of musical artists creating great music for each level.The Game PlaySimple side scrolling game (works best with a controller)with great combo's and intuitive magic system. Simple levelling system and many different characters you can unlock, items you can find and pets you can make love you.DifficultyThe difficulty is pretty straight forward but not restricting there is a harder difficulty that you can unlock after completion, which can be found on the map after the first boss. Can only be done with same character.Controls & InterfaceGeared towards playing with a controller but not limited, as keyboard can work just as well.I just found it much easier with controller.AchievementsThis game has simple and fun achievements that are relatively easy to get and nothing that you would lose sleep over.StoryYou play a knight out to save the princess's and to defeat a dark evil wizard, on your journey you will encounter many hardships. Be brave young knight.Combat System The combat system is simple and fun revolving around a hack slash method with great combos that are given to you along your journey through levelling up.Magic spells are also learnt in the same way which can sway the battle in your favour.Pet companions can also be found throughout, used to give your character unique perks or advantages in battle that can help on your quest.Got to love RammyLevelingSimple levelling system that lets you place points into four attributes that increase your characters stats.The magic spells, can be quite different per character and all have great uses. Try out different characters to find the spells that suit you. Sounds & EffectsThe music for this game was composed by a variety of different artists and I found some of the music to be great and even downloaded a few of them myself from NewGrounds[www.newgrounds.com]for freeFavourite has to be this one but it isn't listed in the list.GraphicsThe graphics are simplistic but I found them very pleasing and suiting to the game. Cut ScenesI found the cut scenes well thought-out and funny, got to love the ending of the cyclops.Humour & TriviaI loved the humour of this game it is brilliant and suited for all ages and retains the same style throughout.MultiplayerThis game has a fantastic multiplayer that lets you play co operatively with friends either locally or online. Castle Crashers offers a small range of fun multiplayer modes where you can go up against friends in a fighting, feeding frenzy and good old volley ball real man's game.Bugs - ImportantNo bugs or issues were found.ConclusionI loved Castle Crashers and would happily go back to it if my friends asked, overall fun and great entertainment for all ages.Great to play with guests or friends at home.Easy to pick up and play and then just walk away if needed.I would say the only downside to this game is, that lately the online community has dwindled, best to play with friends.I will be keeping a close eye on the developers to see if they have any future releases planned as I really do like their style of games.Hope I helped.ηυĸєΜ266 "

THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT CONTENT FROM BEFORE THE REMASTERED PATCH!Do I reccomend Castle Crashers? Yes.Do I reccomend you buy the title on Steam? No.Castle Crashers is an Arcade-Style Side-Scrolling Beat 'Em Up with a level-up system, unique playable characters and loads of weapons!Where this game succeeds is in its focus around cooperative play, but can still be played to its completion alone. Behemoth's ""Game 2"" has brought fun times to players for almost 7 years now.So what are the good qualities of this game?
1-4 player cooperative story mode sure to pack laughter and anger in one box2-4 player pvp arena modeAmazing soundtrack that will make you want to play levels over just to hear themBehemoth's signature cartoony yet brutal gameplayACTION! COMEDY! ROMANCE!Over 80 weapons to tweak your stats outside of the level-up systemNow, this game is great and a must have, just not on Steam.
If you don't have one or more friend(s) who are willing to play this whenever you are, this game will get really old really fastTerrible, and I mean TERRIBLE online multiplayer. Whether you're playing with somebody across the country or across the room, 95 times out of 100 there will be unbearable periods of lag on one or more players' ends, causing all players to see different screens. Some examples may be that a player is standing still, using their W key attack, while another player is seeing them using their W key reviving another player. On one screen you may see your teammate dead on the ground, while they are actually fighting something you may not even see!Button prompts are displayed as X-Box buttons. Leaving players who didn't read and memorize the chart on the main menu often clueless on what to pressIf you're not playing together on the same machine, don't play together at allSo all in all, I do reccomend Castle Crashers to players. I myself picked this up for 70 cents on the last Steam Summer Sale, having no idea of the lagfest I was getting myself into. Only buy this on Steam if you plan to play by yourself a lot.I suggest you pick up this title up on another platform. Either the X-Box Live Arcade or the PlayStation Store.			"

												The game is fun - especially with friends! So don't think I don't like this game. It's got a hefty amount of clever jokes that aren't too far shoved in your face (like I noticed Ceiling Cat watching me from above in the pet store). But the controls for this game are... to put it gently... relatively poor.It recommends an Xbox controller, but it's a PC game so it should assume the majority of people will play it using a mouse and keyboard. It translates it's controls as though you're using an Xbox controller first off - something that was a really bad sign to me at first - but the real thing that crimps the controls is the fact you have to hold some buttons and tap others to activate this or that action. Your starting spell for instance is simply ""Hold Shift, press Strong-Attack"" while the bolt version of it would be ""Hold Shift, Press Use-Item"". Even then to cast spells in the air you have to use different buttons (Strong-Attack or Use-Item) to decide if you shoot horizontally or downwards which is just feels off (why not just let the movement keys press the direction you want to aim?). The fact that you can't even seperate the Item, magic, and the melee commands makes it bug♥♥♥♥ disorienting. It's a keyboard: It has enough buttons to cover the actions without having to resort to playing Twister with your fingers.That said I can't say I've played it and not had a blast yet. Granted I've only been playing it a couple of days so far. It's by no means an easy game, but it's a fun one.			"

												I would most definetly recommend this game to everyone. This game is amazingly addicting and it is super fun to play with friends. This game does have its defects like being 2D or that some of the music is ♥♥♥♥ but still I will always love Castle Crashers it holds a really really special place in my heart, lol. It is a difficult game but it has so much to offer. You don't have to do the campaign you can work on trying to get other characters from arena's or find certain weapons and even play a different character. And if you don't like your level then you should do missions in the campaign over again. It has allot to offer, all the boss battles are different and they all contain different things. This game will get on your nerves but eventually you already beat the game.			"

												Great fun game for the whole family, or just good 4 player sidecroller to mash enemies with your friends. TONS of unlockable characters, and a relatively easy achievement list to 100% if you are an achievement hunter. The DLC packs are cheap and totally great adding two extra Characters, The Blacksmith and The Pink Knight.Insanity mode after game completion offers a new difficulty to play through increasing the amount of playability and extending the level grinding to a more enjoyable and challenging setting. The artwork is great as well. It is very colorful and family friendly. The Game is playable by all ages (with a few poop and fart jokes in the mix).I also like that with my Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows I am able to hook up more than one controller and allow more than 1 player/controller to be supported by a single USB port and play/level multiple characters at once as my friends can choose my other characters and level along with me.Also available on the Playstation Network and Xbox Market. I would certainly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. Loads of enjoyment, replayability, and good laughs.10/10			"

(Hatty Hattington, Minion.. and more)..If you are looking for a good Local Co-op game, this is it.You can also fight against enemies with people online. (Multiplayer)You can win/get and find gold on maps.Also, there's very much weapons you could use in fight.Its simple when you play on keyboard... you just use: A,D,W,Space and CTRL, and you move on the arrow buttons.This is a very fun game, I recommend it because I played it myself, and I think it is awesome.Castle Crashers, 11 outta 10 (11/10)			"

												This game is a amzing beat em up. The same guys who made battleblock and alien homid created this. There are 2 really good and fun dlc. Its worth the money. Buy the cnat stop laughing bundle too. You will get hatty as a character in castle crashers and a castle crashers head in battleblock. 9/10			"

												An extremely fun side scrolling, beat'em up, co-op rpg.  While it is nothing that  we haven't all seen before,  Castle Crashers executes all aspects of this  type of game perfectly.   Each character, do to color coordination, is easily identifiable.  Unique special abilities help each player  stand apart, as well as weapon choices, secondary items and companions that add passive abilities and stats.There is an rpg aspect that allows each player to upgrade his or her character's stats separately from the rest.  The enemies are well balanced as well as each type possessing its own attacks and abilities.  Almost every level has a boss at the end.Similar to Diablo, you can play back through after completion for a greater challenge.  I recommend having 4 players when you do this; otherwise, the game might begin to feel off balance.The game as a whole offers solid game play, good re-playability, fun co-op and many laughs.  A good buy if you plan on playing with a group of friends.Note: there  is a bit of lag when using the keyboard; the game is built around the game pad.

												I played the demo of this game for a good 4 hours so of course I love the full game even more. I enjoy this game pretty much equally as much as Battleblock, which is also a great game. The art style in CC is fun in my opinion and the gameplay is also entertaining and enjoyable. Playing with friends or just online is also fun (though the online can be empty sometimes). 9/10			"

												Loved that they made this game available for PC play. The default key bindings are wonky and I feel they were poorly chosen for someone without a controller. This game really isn't difficult without a controller, I'm not sure why they are pushing for one so hard. An easy recustomization of your key bindings isn't too hard. Fun overall old gem of a game. It was great for the era it came out in and is still fun to replay to this day.			"

												This game is a pretty solid game, where you need to either be patient or go in Leeroy Jenkins.Of course, like many games, there is a tier list and the character power difference from the best and worse is so horrid that i'm afraid I will never be able to finish Hard mode with Hatty, because Hatty in all essence just sucks.Until you meet the Ice King.Then you start to ask yourself ""Was this Bungie's prototype for Destiny?"" Because he ISNT HARD.HE JUST HAS SO MUCH  HEALTHJUST LIKE THE ENTIRETY OF DESTINY.Overall, pretty good game. I had fun killing my gf then kissing another girl in front of her in this game.Red Knight is just so good in pvp.			"
