												Having completed the Steam version and PS1 version back to back, here are a few things I noted:- The button layout can be confusing in certain sequences if using a controller, for example; telling you to press B2 or B5 as instructed, requiring you to remember your controllers personal button layout.- All polygons look much better in this version, obviously, but it often clashes very unnaturally with the low res backdrops.- A lot of the ported-to-midi music is noticably worse than the original, some peices sounding broken and off key- Character portraits look a lot nicer and more detailed in Steam version.- The gameplay seems to have been sped up by about 25%, which makes the frame rate APPEAR smoother, although animations still seem to be quite choppy. Particularly makes battles and traversing the world map seem much smoother!- Various scenes will load much faster, ie; card battles and the startup screen, which is a big quality of life difference!- 360 degree movement doesn't work by default, only 8 direction. I'm not sure if this can be modded.When all is said and done, I personally prefer the original PS1 version, but if you don't have access to it, this version is not a bad option either. Hope this was helpful. :)			"

												Hello, my old friend.Years ago, I remember walking into a local Wal-Mart to browse through the bargain bin of Psx games. There I found a green label greatest hits game called Final Fantasy VII. The blonde man on the cover holding a giant sword tore away at my curiosity. So my allowance was spent on this mysterious game I had yet to hear about. Not very long after beating it, I realized I was in love. ""Where has this game been all my life?"" I asked myself. A few weeks later, after saving up my allowances for a NEW psx title, I returned to the same local Wal-Mart and began browsing the sliding door glass case. ""Hmm...Gran Turismo sure looks fun...Tomb Raider....maybe..."", but there at the bottom in the left hand corner it sat. Final Fantasy VIII. I must've screeched from excitement. Though none of these characters on the case looked familiar...""So the games don't connect then?"" I pondered...In a rush to get the game, I flagged the worker down to open the case. Game in hand, I opened the lid of my Psx, removed Dark Stone, and placed in Disc 1...Never has a game brought as much excitement as seeing this sequel that day. It was the best, is the best, and will forever be the best. Now I am no longer a child, at 25 I have 2 children of my own and hope one day they too find their ""FFVIII""...			"

												Edit: Update to the title on 20th June 2014 added more cheats - no fixes to any of the technical issues.Before I get started, Yes I know about the mods to fix it. We shouldn't have to mod the game to get content Square Enix claimed was in the game.FINAL FANTASY VII (Yes, 7) was released on Steam a little while ago. And while many were happy, many were disappointed. Square Enix released the game with awful audio. Entire vocals were missing from some, for example, the infamous ""One Winged Angel"" BGM, and the audio in general sounded very subdued. A modder, Assimi, went out of his way to patch the BGM to the quality it should be. Many months came and went, and eventually, one day, Square Enix released a patch, which upgraded the audio to a better quality.We then hear FINAL FANTASY VIII will be coming to Steam, with what Square Enix claimed - PlayStation Quality Audio! Superb! They won't make the same mistake twice! Surely? Especially not after such a statement...We were wrong.FINAL FANTASY VIII Steam Edition is an almost identical copy of the original FINAL FANTASY VIII PC Port, except this time with added layers of DRM, cheats, and ruined FMVs, along side all the issues of the original port.So all the issues:1) Background music uses low quality midi. 2) Sound effects uses low quality audio (Quetzalcoatls roar sticks out the most).3) Limited to 8-way movement, rather than the 360 movement on PS14) Still uses B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 button prompts if using a Gamepad.5) FMVs have been giving a horrible filter to ""upscale"" them. This blur removes a tonne of detail from the FMVs.6) Linear Filtering simply blurs all the textures, and makes the world map look disgusting.So let's go through these 1 by 1. Links to any mods mentioned will be put at the bottom of the review.Issue 1) Background Music. This is horrible. My main problem here is Square Enix LIED to us. When they announced FF8 Steam Edition they shouted ""PLAYSTATION QUALITY AUDIO!"" from the rooftops. They did not deliver. Here's a comparison:Steam Edition:

If you're using any decent speakers, you can hear the massive difference. My speakers cost me about £10, and I'm not even an audiophile (hence the £10 speakers) and I can tell the massive difference in quality.Thankfully - Thanks to DLPB of the QHIMM forums this can be fixed and modded out (and the BGM can be changed to whatever songs you want, just make sure they're .OGG and looped correctly). But. It shouldn't need to be in the first place. Square Enix claimed the game has PS Audio. It doesn't.Issue 2) Similar to issue 1. Unfortunately here I don't have a comparison. But again - SE Claimed PS Quality Audio. They did not deliver.Issue 3) 8 way movement. If you're on KB+M This is absolutely fine since you're inherently limited to 8 way. However many people, with this being a PlayStation game, would play with a gamepad, and if you do, think again about using that wonderful analog stick for 360 movement.Issue 4) So you'd expect, with this being a PlayStation game to use X Square Triangle Circle right, or maybe they updated it to ABXY? Unfortunately not. The game uses the possibly ancient Dinput, because forget updating the game to a more modern form of input, right? Way too much effort.Issue 5) So instead of doing a proper job of editing the FMVs too look decent at high-res, like the 1080p standard, or like me, 1440p, Square Enix applied a filter to the entirety of every cutscene. It's a blur filter. It blurs the FMVs to remove the ""blockiness"" that would occur from upscaling and especially when in motion. Instead of putting in effort to do this, carefully applying filters when and where necersarry, they made it global. Destroying massive amounts of detail in the progress.Fortunately, someone on the Steam Discussion forums applied a better filter, though still not perfect.Issue 6) Linear Filtering is 50/50. It looks okay. In combat, it looks good. Applied to character models, it looks good. Applied to the world map? Oh my.Just look at this mess: http://i.imgur.com/p7QGH2w.pngCompared with it turned off: http://i.imgur.com/pA9jlED.png--------So. What's better about the Steam release? Well the improved hardware compatability is nice. Chocobo World is included as it was with the original release too, so if you never got a chance to play and have the benefits of that, that's a bonus. You also get achievements if you're into those.Cheats. More controversial. The cheats this time aren't as bad as FINAL FANTASY VII. Why? It's just magic. And that's a non-issue if you read up on how to use the card game mechanics and refining to get spells very quickly, and very early. Indeed, you can get many powerful spells for junction via card refining very early on that aren't even included in the cheat. All it really does is remove some of the grind... Which I guess is okay.And well slightly improved graphics due to the higher character model polygons. But that's about it. I would not recommend this in it's current state. This is simply a re-release of the old PC port, with very minimal effort put in to actually updating it.My recommendation would go out to purchasing a PlayStation copy of the game and playing it that way. You can get it for cheaper than Steam on the PlayStation store.--------Roses and Wine BGM Mod: http://steamcommunity.com/app/39150/discussions/0/666828126495993258/FMV Replacement Mod: http://steamcommunity.com/app/39150/discussions/0/666828126807201587/?tscn=1386758049#p1Shoutout to Assimi, the FF7 BGM Modder: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004345221/ "

												The black sheep of the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy VIII is a game that divides opinion to this very day. Is it good? Is it bad? Does it make a lick of sense? Is Squall a sexy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? No one entirely agrees on an answer to any of these questions (except for the last one, the answer of which is YES), but I have my own take it. FFVIII is perhaps the most underappreciated games in the entire series. Much like how FFVII deconstructed JRPGs that existed up to that point, FFVIII deconstructs the wave of RPGs that followed in Final Fantasy VII's wake, mocking their tropes and characters, while at the same time telling a very unique story. FFVIII follows Squall Leonheart, a student at Balamb Garden, a military academy that trains SeeDs, a mercenary force designed for one purpose: to hunt down and destroy Sorcerresses. Squall is probably my favorite lead character in a Final Fantasy game, and that has one clear reason: he's realistic. Unlike Cloud or Zidane, he isn't a teenager who can somehow fight the forces of darkness without sweat: he's a flawed person, broken by a crappy childhood and a dehumanising education that taught him how to kill. In essence, he behaves how a real person would in his situation. Over the course of the game, we're treated to a near-constant internal monologue that tells us about the struggles he faces internally and how he deals with them. He's a great lead. The rest of the cast is more mixed, with high points being Irvine, who often reflects Squall, and Laguna, who's chipper attitude is a nice respite from the grim tones of Squall, and low points being the annoying and fairly useless Zell, the bland and boring Quistis, and the game's dumb villain, Ultimecia. The plot itself is also a bit of a mixed bag, with some really good moments offset by some really dumb ones. The battle system is a clear departure from the rest of the series too. Rather than levelling up your characters to build stats, instead, stats are built by ""junctioning"" magic to various stats to increase their parameters. This is a great system, one ripe for experimentation, hampered by one thing: Drawing. Magic works like items in FF8: once you use a charge, it's gone. The only way to get magic early on is by painstakingly drawing magic from enemies: an incredibly tedious and boring prospect. It's rectified later once you get access to card refinement, but it's still a hassle. Speaking of card refinement. this game comes with a very entertaining trading card diversion called Triple Triad, and it's a blast. Simple, quick, yet endlessly addictive. So, that's Final Fantasy VIII. Honestly, I love it, and it remains one of my favorites of the series. However, it's a very flawed game, so chances are, you may not like it. However, approach it with an open mind, and I think you'll enjoy what lies in store.			"

												If you've never played a Final Fantasy game in your life, then here's a great place to start.The Final Fantasy games have suffered from their ups and downs over the years, and VIII is no exception. If you take the time to search for opinions on the internet, you'll find a myriad of opinions ranging from one extreme to the other.At it's heart though, I've found the game enjoyable, replayable - and the few aspects I do not like are swept under the rug.As with most FF games, it relies on turn-based combat, but don't let that fool you. It is possible (and quite easy when you get the hang of it) to finish the game without levelling any of your characters at all. There are side quests aplenty, including the Triple Triad card game, which is fun for the most part, and the chocobo forest mini game.The story is quite in-depth, so while I don't recommend it for the very young, based on this, it is still age and gender friendly - there is romance, comedy, plot twists, and a story and world so rich you might just not want to leave it.The art style might take some getting used to, but the menu, and how magic and summons integrate with characters, may be the biggest hurdle for new players. Simply put - I didn't use magic. Summons are ""junctioned"" to characters to grant them abilities, not the least of which is the ability to link collected magicks to your stats, giving them a significant boost. This is the primary method of getting stronger. As you level, so too do the enemies, meaning you can't outlevel them. It is a unique system among FF games, but somehow it works, and works well with practice.If you're already familiar with FF games, you might have already decided whether or not to get this game, but if you haven't, it's definitely worth a look-see.

You can't play until you make an account with Square-Enix, and you have to login EVERY time you want to play. Internet down? Tough, can't play.

												TL;DR?: Don't buy, yet, wait for a sound mod or SE patch.I picked up this game quite eagerly after missing out on FF8 on the PS1. Sadly I was incredibly dissapointed in the poor job Square Enix had done in porting the game to Steam. First problem, I had to navigate a menu that after refusing my Facebook account, forced me to sign up to Square Enix's website. A pain, but a minor one I would have forgotten.Second problem, which damns the game and makes it unplayable, the sound. This appears petty, but the lack of the PS1 soundtrack, one of the games defining features, is lost with the MIDI versions which seriously takes away from the games atmosphere. This is especially damning when you consider how dated the games graphics are, which whilst not a problem on its own, the poor sound artifically ages the game and damages the experience. FF7 received a number of Mods and even an offical patch to fix the sound problem alone, I'd say its worth holding out for one of these until you buy.It is a shame really, as the core gameplay is fantastic, the depth of the RPG mechanics still intact and there is a lot to pick apart in the story, though the lack of a good soundtrack (Which hopefully will be improved in the coming weeks) really does lessen the quality of the package. Hold off buying this until Square Enix or some modder updates the soundtrack, at which point I would actually recommend picking this up.			"

												Final Fantasy 8 was my first game of the final fantasy series.I absolutely loved this game and it made wanna play all the other games of the series (from 1 to 10 at least since i really liked the old style turn based system).This game is still one of my favorites . Altough i was so excited that it was released onto Steam i was a bit disappointed that they quality of the sound was still no match for the ps1 one (although there are some fixes out there that deal with this problem, I still think that SQUARE ENIX should have taken care of these issues before releasing the game).Overall Final Fantasy 8 is still a very good classic game.

												I am a huge Final Fantasy fan so a re-release of one of my childhood favourites was a must-have for me. This is an absolutely fantastic game with such a gripping story. Okay, it doesn't have the graphics that modern games do but they have certainly done a pretty decent job at improving what already existed to make it look pretty good. The only downside to this steam addition is the soundtrack being in MIDI, but that is easily fixed with the Roses & Wine mod. You can even have custom game music and load up The Black Mages for battles if you so wish. If you've never played a Final Fantasy game, I would certainly recommend this one to wet your taste buds. It has everything a good RPG should have; a turn based battle system, gripping story and characters you get emotionally attached to (well, except Selphie in my opinion but I accept that some people do like her). If you don't already own this game, you need to buy it right this second.			"

												Thinking all the time, never saying a word. Looking miserable, wearing awful black clothes. Being rude to people, mood swings.Remember when you where a teenager? Perhaps you are one, and that is why Final Fantasy VIII is a hidden gem, concealed by the fact, hype and fans of 7 & 9.Final Fantasy VIII is in many ways like other FF's, its set in a huge explorable world upon which, a situation arises, threatening its existence, companions are gathered along the journey to prevent it. But what 8 has done is extraordinary although it has to be said, unappreciated. This fantasy is through the eyes of a teenager, Squall, dubbed a Leonardo Dicaprio look-alike misery guts. Which is without doubt true, and possibly a strong reason why so many detest this game, living-reliving the life of a teenager in a world that is the closest to this one than any other FF game beyond 7. Effectively taken place in a Garden (school/college) where the students are trained to be become functioning members of an elite group of soldiers known as SEED. Ok not exactly a clever or exciting plot at first glance but this is only the beginning of something overlooked. Everything about it has that youthful learning element to it, such as the SEED tests as a means of gaining regular income, testing your knowledge of enemies, magic and general surroundings, you participate in field exams where you are graded accordingly on time, battles, attitude, spirit etc. oh and you're not aloud to buy a porn mag because you're to young.Like all successful square games, it begins slow but picks up the pace by new events, addictive mini games and tugs on your heart strings with a puppy love storyline. Clearly, gamers have taken one look at the indifferent main character they must control and shake their fist in disgust that they aren't a mysterious mercenary, fun loving optimist athlete or a womanizing thief with a tail. I'll admit there are moments in the dialogue where you get annoyed at the ignorance of said character, such phrases like ""go talk to a wall"" are aimed at someone spilling their emotional guts and ""whatever"" occurs repeatedly followed by ""....."" making Squall an essentially unresponsive cold jerk.. what he wants you to think.. however the time I played this, I was of a similar age, disposition and could defend 'some' of his actions. As time wears on though, more light is shed as to why your guy seems so hormone ridden, a past frequently visited in game that should be cherished to understand. Ahh but Square likes messing with you and cant resist a sub-plot, cue Laguna (main), Kiros & Ward, three laughable soldiers in the Galbadien Army (who later become a threat to SEED) running around like headless chickens on a journey of old, with Laguna the exact opposite of Squall - a moronic happy-go-lucky journalist. This change of setting and character can be greeted with relief or reluctance as it occurs when things are about to get interesting.Battles are both improved and altered with the addition of a new ""Draw"" system, abstracting magic from creatures and specific points in the world, and simpler nice touches like summoning times with button bashing and chance (due to low health) involved with limit breaks. GF's or Guardian Forces (that's summons, eidolons, aons to you an me) are introduced in a brilliant new way, instead of merely stumbling across them all the time, you must battle them or draw them from powerful boss's. All of which is overawed by this games surroundings. When a place has a name like Fisherman's Horizon you know its gunna be weird.. in a good way. Towns like Deling resemble London with an array of shops and structures like Big Ben. Dollet seems like an old French town with cobble roads and 18th century architecture, even the score fits thanks to the genius that is Nobuo Uematsu. I could write a thesis on how spectacular the soundtrack is but I'll just say look at the soundtrack itself for reviews. Such is the realism of the setting but don't be fooled, around the 3rd disc you'll stumble across the city of Esthar, a gigantic technological wonder the size of a continent.. then you wake up as a writer in a rustic village called Windhill, magic. Shame that such an innovative, well designed game is largely considered poor, when really its similar to all the others. It still has the apocalyptic doom threat, it still has a global scourge of an adventure if you're into doing things properly. There's the giant airship that takes you there. SPACE, 7 went into space for a few minutes, 8 goes there for a while and conjures up some of the most cinematic and thrilling events that square couldn't come up with on earth, so much so they put in a song with vocals and as you know that's a special almost rare treat. Plus you can play cards with cactuars on em!Stunning FMV's accompany the key moments that all culminate into an epic journey of self discovery and destiny. It sounds cheesy but I implore you, give it a chance, this game is superb.			"

												For many of us, we seek to relive the nostalgia that FF8 would offer to us through steam. This review will be a juxtaposition of the PS1 version and the Steam version. I guess I'll start with a few pros:+You can simultaneously play Chocobo World while playing FF8. Chocobo World was not offered on the console version of FF8, so I thought this was a nice addition to the game.+There are much faster loading screens. I think this was one of the most notable things seeing as how I would spend 50% of my time on the console version just staring at a black loading screen between transitions.+Cloud Saving - No, not referring to FF7, but this is a nice way to save your progress without having to deal with memory cards. You will always have your non-corrupt Squall wherever you go.Now, for some cons:-MIDI files are messed up. If you're a big FF fan, you will know that the music plays a big role in the series. The fact that the MIDI files sound like garbage just tells us that Square Enix did not give a **** about the PC port. Thankfully, there is a mod/fix for this, so it's not that big of a deal.-If the Square Enix servers are down, then you're not able to play your offline single player game. I'm not sure if this is primarily because of the cloud server, but it's annoying.-You need a Square Enix account to play. This can be problematic because.. well, a lot of people experience all sorts of problems. Some have problems navigating the site, while others are still waiting for their email confirmation.-This is the PC version, but that doesn't mean that the keyboard controls will be great. If you want to fully enjoy the PC experience, I would recommend a controller for your PC. I bought one for about 20$.I actually did not swap out the music, did not have (too) many problems with accessing my account and still managed to almost get 200 hours into the game. All in all, despite a handful of annoying flaws, I like the PC port. Am I adamant on strongly recommending this game? No. In fact, I would ONLY recommend buying this if you have played a previous version of FF8 and/or if it's on sale.If you are new to the Final Fantasy series, I would not recommend this as you will probably be dismayed by the frustrating flaws of the steam version. This could potentially just leave a bad taste on your tongue overall for FF8, too.TL;DR - Buy if you're a veteran and/or if it's on sale; skip if you're new to the game.			"

												I must admit, after watching my father play this game on the PS1 when I was young, and then when I was older getting to play it myself on the same console, my nostalgia glasses for this game area pretttty thick. But, I'm going to give this a good review anyways, and try to be as unbiased as possible. Pros:-An interesting ""Junction System"" that allows customization of characters stats through their ""Guardian Force"" (who in the previous games were merely summonable monsters). -While the graphics aren't great by today's standards, they're definitely a step up from the PS1 version! There's new resolutions to choose from (and you can play in widescreen! Woot!) and the character models are significantly less pixelated than before! -A Fantastic story, like seriously. Even though I haven't beat it yet, this is really a cool story that I'm really enjoying. -Good characters that I've remembered throughout my entire life of gaming. Squall is just so great, and wow his gunblade is so cool! -The combat is really fun! Honestly one of my favorite things to do in this game is just waddle around on the map and fight monsters. There's just such a good variety, with such good design, plus I'm partial to turn-based combat. Cons:-The music. Okay, the music in this game is amazing, but the quality is not. Square used the original ""midi"" files from the old PC release rather than the good files from the PS1 release, however, there is a community mod out there that replaces the files and makes it all better! So there! I tried to look through my nostalgia glasses and give you a good review of a really cool, really memorable Final Fantasy game. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!			"

												I've played this game shortly after it was released on the ps. And it is still one of my most favorite games. However like all negative reviews, the audio is not of its original content. I do not recommend buying this game unless you are willing to go out of your way to install mods to bring the game audio to its standards.A customer should not work to fix defects on a product.Audio is one of the most fundamental ingredients in a final fantasy game.

												By far the Playstation version is better than the Steam version:  [PROS]-Steam achievements-Smoothed graphics or original Playstation 1 graphic settings available-Great soundtrack*-Attacking can be hands-on (Example: using Squall’s gunblade or Zell’s Limit Break)-Magic Booster available via the launch menu-Cheats are available via the Function keys-Cheats do not affect Steam achievements-Tons of creative monster/landscape designs-Triple Triad card game-Chocobo World included[CONS]-In order to play Final Fantasy VIII an account must be created with Square Enix-Save files CAN BE LOST due to the Steam's cloud syncing, so be sure to turn off cloud syncing before playing (Library>Games>Right click on Final Fantasy VIII>Properties>Update>Uncheck 'Enable Steam Cloud Synchronization for Final Fantasy VIII')-*Great soundtrack but… the sound is awful on the Steam version due to MIDI; however, this can be fixed (http://steamcommunity.com/app/39150/discussions/0/666828126495993258/#c666828126498515672)-Guardian Force (GF) summoning time can be too long such as for Eden-If you’re hardcore into grammar the typos (mostly in the beginning of the game) may drive you insane-Rinoa.  (She has always driven me insane since the first time I played this game, and the few times where you have to save her in the game I never wanted to save her)Then there's the PocketStation game Chocobo World available via the launch menu to Final Fantasy VIII.  This mini-game can be muted via your computer's sound settings (Windows 7>Speaker/Volume Control>Mixer) and run in the background taking care of itself.  Personally, I find Chocobo World boring; however, Boko the Chicobo can find items (ranked A through D), which can be useful to your saved game once you finish your first Chocobo Forest (Final Fantasy VIII 'Disc 2').  Also, leveling up Boko to certain levels and meeting certain event requirements in Chocobo World can allow Boko to use powerful attacks in FF8's main story with Gysahl Green.Keep in mind that the Steam version of Final Fantasy VIII is far from a remake; therefore, the graphics, sound, and game play are still on par with the Playstation version released in 1999.

												Don buy PC version, play this game on PS1 emulator, because its very lazy port:- just 15-30 fps lock against 60 on PS1 (note for those tho cant remember 1st line which mentions EMULATOR, PS1 in this line means PS1 Emulator, ok? Try not to forget that when you will see PS1 mentioned again)-no analogue movement - very annoying 4 direction movements iwth annoying aimation phase skips, Square could have done a little bit reversing to hack in analogue mvement. Controls are really bad without that.-no filtering for backgrounds - everything is pixelated as hell, them managed to hack in MICROTRANSACTIONS and Achievements via renderer, but was lazy to do add some bilinear filtering or post effect scanlines and gauss filter.-no high quallity cut-scene - somehow they managed to blur original videos that was way sharper and detailed-no HQ music - bad midi that sounds way worse than on PS1, they could have actually make an orchestrated remastering of original music for this release-no proper widescreen support - just a stretched screent-no proper gamepad support - launcher does not support gamepad input, when game just started you have to press x on keyboard before you can use gamepad, all buttons messed up by default, not xbox 360 controller UI was patched it, hell lot of buttons stil displayed as NONEGenerally this game has no improvement over old retail release, actually it worse because of launcher and videos.Fans on forums did much better job on about everything from list, except for widescreen and analogue movement.Square need to invest more money, time and effort into remastering of their classic gems! While game is great this remaster is not, is a lazy hack job, thats why square do not deserve your money.If you just purchase this game - request refund!			"

												Disclaimer: I'm not a contrarian. At least, I try not to be. This has always stood the test of time as my favorite Final Fantasy. I don't say that lightly, as I find the era of IV-X to be one of the most impressive runs of consecutive brilliance in video game history. The characters are as well-rounded as any in the series; this is accomplished by providing the player with a cast of heroes that is less archetypal than most JRPGs. The main character, Squall, is troubled. He's not bright-eyed and eager. His compatriots provide similar contrast just when you think you have them pegged. The junction system is probably overly complicated for newbies. It takes some time to master. And while the tutorials are good at showing you how to work the system. They come at the beginning of the game and negatively effect the pacing. If you can power through that first 5-7 hours though, you are in for a treat.As a character-driven experience, it's tough to find a better entry in the series (perhaps VI?), however the story is slightly muddled by an odd duex ex machina type of plot-hole around the 25-30 hour mark. The good thing is it leads right into one of the most wonderfully action packed moments in the game, thus, in final fantasy history. If you played it and quit a when you were young, it may be a good time to give it another look. The game being sandwiched between two more beloved entries (VII and IX) probably didn't help it's place in history. For my money, it was my favorite. A flawed, but ultimately masterful entry in one of the most celebrated franchises of all-time....and that ending, whew...			"

												Well, where to start. This game is a masterpiece, great example of a jRPG genre. A lot of time spent in this game kinda speak for itself. Great story, maybe little dummed down and easier to pick then the plot from FF7, very good Junction mechanic with all around it (Refine and GFs) and, of course, the best mini-game ever to be placed in any video game, TRIPLE TRIAD!! :) The only complain I have is the music, it's not the original, PS1-like music, it's not even a MIDI version from the original PC version of the game, it's a little better then that, but If you want to play that game as it should be played with a proper music in background, Install Roses and Wine mod, I recommend it to you all. You won't regret it :)P.S. I've just finished the game for around 20th time and It's still one of the best games I've ever played. It also brings memories of my childhood :) Now if you'll excuse me, I have some achievements to unlock :)			"

												FF8 is quite possibly the most discussed FF due to how the public percieves its story and what it really means.I'll explain this game a little for players who missed this gem from back in the day. It is quite confusing to someone who's never played it before for the first time.The game uses a GF system (Guardian Force = aka Infinite Use Summons in Battle with outside of battle skills)Now you need GF's equipped on a character to use basic actions like using Summons, Drawing Magic from Monsters or using items.It's important to realize that there is NO MP at all in this game. Think of Magic like Items. Only way to gain magic is from draw points on the world or Draw it from Monsters in combat.With Magic you can Junction it onto your characters to give them a boost in Stats to greatly increase their capabilities, like putting Fire on STR to boost Damage, or stack Cure onto HP to give your characters a boost in Max Health.The more of a certain Magic you have while Junctioned onto a stat, the greater the bonus. So you'll get more STR bonuses from 100x Fire rather than just having 15x Fire. The same goes for the Level of Magic too. So you'll get even more bonuses to stats for Junctioning Higher Level Magic onto your Stats rather than Low Magics. (Like Cure vs Curage. Curaga gives much more to bonuses)Now everyone should take note that the Limit Breaks in this game are different. You don't get a limit Meter. As such it can be abused to hell if you really want it to, just leave your characters in Low (Yellow) HP and watch your Limit Breaks wreck everything for you, making the game considerably easier.This is a game EVERY JRPG player should experience once in their life. The music is top tier. Boss battles are blood pumping with the music, the story is pretty good and the Superbosses are really fun. Not to mention Squalls and Irving's limit breaks at endgame can completely wreck any boss in a matter of seconds.To sum it all up. This is by far my favourite Final Fantasy, besides Tactics of course.GET IT, GET IT, GET IT, GET IT, GET IT, GET IT, GET IT, GET IT!

												This is a very mixed bag.   First of all I recommend purchasing this release purely for the fact it is available legally, and will run without any major issues,  no hacks/mods/patches etc needed.However,  I feel like the quality of this release is sub-par, compared even to the FF7 release.   FF8 was made for the PC -after- the technical failure that was the Final Fantasy VII PC version.  One of its features was higher resolution Full Motion Videos, and it did indeed deliver on this.   But I don't ever remember them looking as bad as they do in this release.   Whereas the  FF7 videos scaled up to 720p surprisingly well for their age.    Also some videos have very clearly show deinterlacing artifacts, which is puzzling  for something that should have been progressive from the start.      Not only did they do some kind of deinterlacing on some (or all?) parts of some videos,  but they did a ♥♥♥♥ poor job, using cheap blend deinterlacing which can clearly be seen in some scenes.I was secondly unimpressed with the background art.   Now we know in FF7,  they were rendered in low-res and the artwork was lost or unavailable to render again at that that point in time;   did they truly make the same mistake again with FF8?    I don't have the original PC version to compare with, so I don't know.   But  some of the background art arguably looks worse than even FF7 did in some areas.   At best it looks about the same;  a pixelated mess.The most offensive act however, is one again, the MUSIC.   Square got blasted for the crappy MIDI renders they released with FF7 both originally,  and then again just recently.   They had the audacity to include the audio in OGG format;  audio of  rendered MIDI.   The finally got a clue and just recently patched the REAL  Playstation Soundtrack back into the game.So why the hell did they not do the same for FF8?   OK it clearly appears to use a slightly more non-standard  format for its MIDI music (and that's what it is.... General MIDI) but could they seriously  NOT  patch in the  OGG support like they did for FF7?   Could they not have applied fan-made  PSF hacks and included the original Playstation Music Files  and instrument samples?That is just a glaring slap in the face.   But I suppose we should be grateful that they released it on Steam from the start this time,  instead of lying to customers  that it would only ever be in the Square-Enix store, like they did with FF7.....One other minor annoyances is they appears to have changed the Overture.   The sequence of images is not only ugly and grainy (like the original PC release) but they appear to have changed the sequence and omitted one or two images, throwing off the timing,  so you are sitting at the white FF8 Logo/Title  while the Overture actually finishes.

You can link your steam account and then unlink it from square enix's website (you still have to have a login) it auto registers the game to that account when you do that but you still play ff8 without having to keep it linked.Now for the actual review, the sound is garbage... its just garbage

  It seems to be a very low quality midi, and upon hearing it for the first time it was rather jarring to say the least. My nostalgia was rightfully kicked in the nuts and left me seeing stars.The button mapps in game show up at B4, B2.. and so on, button 1 button 3 and all that. Getting a ps3 controller is a pain but i was able to do it with motionjoy just install the drivers under driver management. The UI also has issues in that it seems to be missing frames of animation, such as the time bar skips a bit and the window transitions on the in battle menus seem to clip a tad. The forest textures in the overworld also look entirely like garbage and i dont see any reason they couldnt at least attempt to fix them.This link shows a screencap of the forest:http://steamcommunity.com/id/marusame00/screenshot/721997070252044906ONE Positive is the cutscenes look damn good, im positive they re rendered them or did something as they look VERY nice, on the downside the models are semi nice looking but CLASH with the entirely unmodified 2D backgrounds, it would help if they at least applied a softening filter to 2D backgrounds like emulators can do.All in all this gets a 2.5/5 its a butchered port, nothing more, and they didnt even release it with a sound patch which they KNOW from the FF7 debacle to be an issue. This is their SECOND time releasing this and id hope they would of learned their lesson but they didnt.			"

												This is a bad version of this game, and it's a travesty that Square is charging 11 dollars for this. Seriously, just play the PS1 version if you really need to play FF8 again.The music in this version is PC MIDI, which causes the entire OST to sound off in comparison to the original. Square said that they would update this version with the original OST, but they never did. There are music mods, but I couldn't get most of them to work, and the one I did get to work didn't even have the songs set to properly loop. Amazing.On top of that, this version has very jittery looking eight way digital movement that feels terrible, while the PS1 version had analog support. There are also some issues, especially with sound effects, that aren't present in the original PS1 version. The only benefits from this version are the higher resolution UI, FMVs, and better quality models, but that's about it. I guess achievements too, if that's your thing.Keep in mind that this version also adds optional microtransactions for whatever reason. Just avoid it, do yourself a favor, and emulate the PS1 version on ePSXe.  Don't waste 11 bucks.			"

 This Game is a masterpiece, even if I don't like it that much. Why? Mentioned below. 
TL;DR at the Bottom This Game is pure nostalgic. You go into the Game and even the Intro Cutscene gets you right into the heart. Like... You'll never experience the same feeling I had, without knowing it from the past. I have to admit, that i screamed a little, like a teeny who saw his first Popstar.But besides that, i didn't like it that much. Why? Because I'm not into Love Storys. Thats it. Game is fantastic, Gameplay and cutscenes are Top-knoch, but i can't rely on my feelings when it comes to Love Storys. Same Story in Reallife. I'm not someone who thinks about his/her feelings. I mean i'm not completely retar*** when it comes to feelings but yea... Thats it.TL;DR:+ Squall Leonhart+ Story+ Gameplay+ Amount of things to do+ Guardian Forces+ Soundtrack+ Game Boosters, if you need it+ Chocobo World - Draw- Missable things- ""Disc 4"" restricts many areas			"

 Never had as much fun playing a card game in my entire life!  I would like to call myself a veteran within the Final Fantasy (FF) franchise now. Granted I am probably overstating myself, I figured it is about time I wrote a review of Final Fantasy VIII. From here on I'll refrain from using Roman numerals just to make this review easier to follow. I played FF8 near to the time it first came out on the PS1. I did not complete it, nor did I have any idea of what was going on - I was a mere child at the time dazzled by the beautiful colours, yet puzzled by the battle system and depressed by Squall’s sadness. Years later, I've returned to FF8 and I can say I have finished the game with a good idea of the actual story… But still depressed by Squall’s sadness. I confess from now that I understand why people would NOT have a liking for this game. There are a number of reasons I can and will point out which would detach the ordinary gamer from any will to finish the game, but I love this game and it is, along with FF6, my favourite JRPG of all time.*No spoilers*  Story  FF8 arguably has one of the most convoluted story's of any game I have ever played. The numerous fan theories surrounding the game seem to make more sense than the actual game! I do not take that to be a criticism of the game however - as strange as it sounds. The story is not bad in and of itself as it is very easy to follow. It is one of those games where the longer you think about whether the story actually makes sense, the less it does... So don't read into it too much is what I would say. With that aside, the story takes place in a confused futuristic world. I say confused purely due to the array of varied environments and settings, from educational institutions which feel a lot like mercenary camps, to castles and to outer space. The story itself is a good balance between being engaging and interesting enough to make the player want to be able to find out how the story concludes, whilst still being complex enough to inspire countless fan theories; some of them keep me up at night to this day!The world of FF8 has remnants of the post-apocalyptic FF7 world, whilst not being nearly as futuristic as Final Fantasy 13. The ending is extremely satisfying to the player and does not leave a feeling of emptiness. Characters To my mind, there are two main categories of Final Fantasy main characters. There is the quirky and easy-going kind (Tidus and Zidane for example), and the more aloof, lonely and emotionally confused kind (Lightning and Cloud). The main character of 8, Squall, fits in the latter category. If Cloud and Lightning had a child (which would make for an amazing game by the way), Squall would be that child. He initially comes across as blunt, cold-hearted, distant and anti-social, but over time there is a gradual change in his character as the game develops. He becomes a nicer, blunt, cold-hearted, distant and anti-social character. Despite being a character of very few words, every sentence he speaks always manages to be funnier than the last. His lack of character ultimately defines his character. The secondary characters (particularly Rinoa) provide an excellent contrast to Squall’s personality. None of the characters feel rushed or uninspired, with Zell, Selphie and Seifer standing out as my favourites (Quistis and Irvine are great too).  Music  DO NOT listen to any of the music in this game without having played it first. I say this because the OST is among the greatest I have heard in any game and explains why Nobuo Uematsu will be my favourite video game composer of all time. The music is best experienced in-game first. Whilst I do admit that there are a couple of pieces which are slightly overused, all of the pieces are memorable and unique with a persistent motif running through the whole game. Liberi Fatali, Maybe I’m a Lion, Find Your Way, Man with the Machine Gun, Eyes on Me, Fisherman’s Horizon and all of the battle themes stand out as my favourites. Eyes on Me in particular is played during one of my favourite scenes in any video game –the piece suits the scene perfectly.  Gameplay I must confess that the first time I played the game, I did not have a clue what junctioning is. I spent the entire game spamming summons until I realised using summons just wasn’t enough. To put it simply, junctioning is the system in FF8 used to upgrade a character’s stats and use magic. It is one of those mechanics which are best learnt while playing the game as it is easier learnt than explained. Nevertheless in contrast to other games in the series, characters do not permanently hold magic. Instead magic is collected by each individual character. That magic can then be ‘junctioned’ to a stat. For example, if you wanted high HP, you could collection the spell ‘Full-life’ a hundred times and junction it to a character’s HP stat. This functions alongside the usual summons you would expect to see in a Final Fantasy game. The system is slightly tricky to get your head around when you first begin playing, but with a little practice it becomes easy. It is a system which could put a player off the game, but the story, the characters and everything is worth the struggle. Triple Triad: This is easily the most overpowered mechanic I have ever experienced in a video game. It is a fairly simple card game which can be used to collect items which can then be used to buy weapons for example. I personally loved it and would love to see a similar game (albeit less powerful) in Final Fantasy 15.  Conclusion Final Fantasy 8 is easily one of my favourite games of all time, however I told one of my friends not to play this game. The reason why is that although I love it, I understand that there are many reasons (such as the battle system) why a person would dislike or even hate this game, particularly if you aren’t a fan of JRPGs in general. If you are a fan of JRPGs (particularly the older classics) I definitely do recommend trying this one out. Whilst there are many reasons to hate the game there are so many more reasons to love it. I can guarantee that you are in for the best card game in a game you’ll every play.  8/10  "

												Highly, highly recommend. This game is the definition of gorgeous game making.Remember, this is an old game. I believe I played it first in the late 90's. Back then I was enthralled by the art, graphics, and the breathtaking views. It shows it's age, but the chance to play it on PC at 1080p? Yes, please. One to keep forever.I'm not going to go into best games or best Final Fantasies, but I've played a whole slew of games with great stories or sparkling reviews over the years and very, very few have made an impact anywhere close to this. Final Fantasy VIII is, without a doubt, a must play for all gamers and anyone who wishes to experience great depth of storytelling and gameplay. I can't recommend this enough, and I've told so many friends already.However, it is not for those wanting an evening of mindnumbing shiny lights to forget and walk away from. It is a long game and requires thought, for both the gameplay and the story. It also requires it's share of 90's style game management skills. If this is a learning curve, stick with it, you'll get it and still have plenty of game to go.I'd recommend not using the game boosters though unless you've already played all the way through once or you have a REALLY casual relationship with good games and fine art. Seriously, they take you out of the game too much and cheapen the experience. This game rewards perserverance and draws in curiousity. Play it if you like Final Fantasy, love story games, or need to see a part of gaming history. Oh and get a good controller too, one with full synergy with Windows. You'll thank me later.			"

												You need a Square Enix account to play, which may be problematic because the Square website is a bit fussy with their confirmation emails. I got mine about 24 hours after I asked for it. Playing with achievements is nice, and this is the only way I've found where you can access Chocobo World, but the music is low-quality MIDIs for some reason, and you need to download a mod to restore the audio.If you're an old fan looking to come back, I'd just see if I could find a PS1 and a disc instead. Newcomers, maybe give it a shot, but be prepared to wait for that email.EDIT: Also crashes like a blind Nascar driver. You know those sections with the ticking timer that gives you game over if they hit zero? Imagine one of those ALWAYS counting down and you can't see it. That's what it's sort of like playing this. A crash ever seems to be lurking around the corner. It makes you paranoid and tense, and it's not the least bit fun.Do yourself a favor and track down a PS1 disc and a system to play on. Do not waste your money on this.			"

												Nominated this game for Steam's ""Test of Time"" award.In my eyes it truly has withstood the test of time and still holds up strong against many of today's latest releases.Final Fantasy VIII will always have a special place in my heart, being the very first game that when i watched someone play, i was so hooked upon the story that i had to rush out and buy myself the game and a Playstation 1 to play it.I won't go into the argument about which FF was best since after getting hooked on FFVIII, i bought every single one on release stopping after FFXII-2 and enjoyed all of them, some more so then others but time and time again FFVIII draws me back as no game has and i simply adore the story as much as i love the main protagonist XDSo when i saw FFVIII on sale i simply had to buy it to play the story out once more on my PC. However as you can see, RL & a major backlog of unplayed games has gotten in the way so i will update this review once i play it through. I highly enjoyed my hundreds' of hours playing this back then on console & am looking forward to doing the same on PC.I would highly recommend this game, especially if you can grab it while on sale. Well worth the money with the many hours of enjoyment you'll get from it. "

												Originally released on the Playstation and then ported to the PC, the Steam copy of Final Fantasy VIII is a fairly cheap way to access one of the PS1 era classics while also getting to use the Pocket Station game Chocobo World (a mini-game that didn't come included with non-PS1 versions of Final Fantasy VIII outside of Japan, which can give items in FFVIII.)I'll get right to the negatives, not just of this port, but of Final Fantasy VIII. [ CONS ]These are pure problems.-MIDI music. There's guides on Steam for how to fix this, but the fact remains a fresh install will see lower quality music in various situations than in the PS1 version.-Square Enix DRM on the launcher. If their servers go down for maintenance, you can't play your single player game. That's stupid. -If you already have Final Fantasy VIII, Chocobo World's really going to be your only major draw to this, since cloud saves don't justify the above DRM. -Final Fantasy VIII's story requires a lot of work on you, the player's part to make it decent. This seems to stem from odd narrative choices and mistranslations, but the fact remains you might find yourself disappointed with a world where child soldiers are led by Evil Robin Williams to battle a Double Witch. YMMV. -Gamepad support is iffy. Sometimes, if your gamepad disconnects for any reason, even if you reconnect it, you're stuck using the keyboard until you close out and re-open the game. [ MIXED ]Middle of the road. +/-The magic system in this game is polarizing. Essentially, you use a command called Draw to take some magic from what you're fighting. Then you can equip that magic onto your stats via a feature called Junctioning. You can also get this magic from other sources, like converting items (cards come to mind). I personally don't get the hate for it, the system's pretty simple and lets you inch out whatever level scaled opponents you're facing with minimal thought involved, but note a lot of people don't like it. +/-With the relatively young age of the main protagonists, the ... Gunblades, and the odd direction the story tends to go in - while there's a unique identity to the world of this game, it can feel like a high school drama with magic and gun swords thrown into it sometimes. +/-It has a better story than Final Fantasy XIII. But that's not saying much.  +/-Hard to relate with the romance build up between Squall and Rinoa (two main characters), but I'm sure there's fans for that. [ PROS ]Where the game does well.+If you don't have Final Fantasy VIII and are a Steam addict, it takes three seconds to fix that Midi issue above. Square Enix sales happen a lot too, so the game's usually dirt cheap.+Triple Triad. When the world is on the brink of destruction, play card games. +You can cheat. Cheat a lot. Use the launcher to give yourself a ton of drawn magic, or use the hidden Function Keys to cheat in all kinds of things. While no Final Fantasy game is hard, this can be very useful for speed running or getting yourself up to a certain point in the game if desired. +Lots of Steam community material on where and how to mod Final Fantasy VIII into a better looking, better playing game is available. +Final Fantasy music. Always good. +Guardian Forces (this game's summons) actually level up and unlock you new abilities. This and the square button mashing damage bump when you summon them in battle makes them a lot more interesting than Final Fantasy VII's cutscene spam. +Everything concerning Chocobos, be it the Tamagotchi style Chocobo World or the overworld chocobo mining, is enjoyable.+You serve under Robin Williams, Evil Headmaster Military King who trains children to use experimental demon magic, casually hands students he wants to see die lamps that transport them to hell to fight Satan without telling them what it does. It is implied he banged the main antagonist while possessing a minor protagonist, so he was in bed with a Triple Witch. Furthermore, when the actual owner of the Garden (think flying military base) gets mad that he tried to have a political leader -murdered and fails during an already tenuous war- and attempts to placate said understandably angry nation, Headmaster Robin Williams has the appropriate response in mind after stomping off from the well mannered NORG, his lips profusely wet from screaming. ""CHILDREN? FIGHT TO THE DEATH""Did I mention there's a dating hangout area for the students of this Garden, and so he has Tyrannosaurus Rex(multiple) stocked there for ""training purposes?""The guy's a menace. Play this game so you can discover how Robin Williams nearly doomed the world.			"

												As much as I love Final Fantasy 8, I'm finding myself wanting to pull out my origional copy and play it again.1.Visuals: While they are updated for the characters, the world map suffers. Everything looks like it was put through a blur or blend filter. The forests look horrible the towns look horrible, the world map looks horrible now.2. Monsters: They don't really look any different from the origional, ****they also don't level up as you do (like in the origional). Why would you change a feature that allows casual players to play through at their own pace while still making random battles worthwhile, into something where people are going to be equipping Enc-None for 90% of the game. The point of that system was to make the game for everyone, if you wanted to play hardcore, you level grinded at the start and the battles became harder, enemies got new moves and so on. Now, nothing changes.******EDIT***The normal monsters do level up equal to Squall's level, the Bosses/GF's don't seem to. Diablo was 7 levels lower than my whole party and Ifrit was 4 levels lower. I didn't check any other boss so far.3. Controls: The keyboard equivilant of 'select' is default set to the J key while the ""Square"" button is set to S. So when using the boost command on your summon, you end up crossing your arms to hold J and mash the S key to boost your summons. Not a horrible thing, but for people who are right handed, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥.4. Sounds: While I don't mind the normal sounds of the game, memorable although lower quality due to being original PC MIDI files. You summon Quexelotl (lightening bird) and while it look pretty the sound is horrible, listen to the origional compared to it and you will be horrified. (haven't noticed the same with other summons (yet).5. Official description of game: Really, Galbadia didn't declare war on Dollet, it attacked it in order to take the Comm. Tower. Squall and Siefer are not a part of Dollet nor is their 'Training Facility' Balamb Garden, as the name might suggest it is located elsewhere (on another continent). The person who wrote this part should be fired for not even playing the game, how can you screw up something that is explained within half an hour of gameplay.Overall, I recommend buying the game from the playstation store. Either via a ps3 or PSP (any version) or if you don't have that then I'm sorry but this lackluster game is the closest you'll get to the origional.FInal comment and biased opinion: This is the crap that happens when Square Enix gets a hold of a SquareSoft origional, please don't support this utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because it's obvious that they don't care about you, only your wallet.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Square Enix Publishers: Square Enix Initial release: Feb 1999 (PSX), Dec 2013 (PC)Genre: JRPG#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationI played and finished Final Fantasy VIII on the original PSX; In all honesty, I don't believe I truly understood the breadth of variance within the GF-Junction system. It's likely I don't understand it's subtle nuance still. This is a standard JRPG. In fact, it's THE standard or at the very least the standard for this era of gaming regarding this specific genre. This is a port of the PSX version. Meaning, all the low-res static jpeg backgrounds with your polygonal character models running around you remember are here. Complete with the pre-rendered FMV sequences that made these games stand out back on the PSX. To be fair, the switch between a static background to a FMV whilst retaining control of your characters is still impressive. Not from a technical or processing power standpoint mind you but from a purely visual effect perspective it remains immersive and effective as a story telling element. I'm not about to attempt to delve super deep into the GF-Junction system but here are the basics. You have multiple GF's (Guardian Forces) and multiple party members; You assign one or more GFs to a party member. Depending on how leveled those GF's are they allow you to Junction magic into specific stats to increase your characters abilities. Aside from this point they also allow you some leeway in drafting your own list of commands in battle. GF's can also be summoned in battle as an attack or provide buffs/debuffs depending on which you are using. Some are overtly placed in your lap while others are hidden in draw points from specific enemies and other locations. Because of how integrated this GF-Junction system is, as without it, you quite literally are only allowed to do basic attacks. Something as simple as reaching into your item bag is not feasible without them; the game grants you a fairly easy to grasp “Junction exchange” in where you can swap all GF's and magic that is junctioned without having to drag yourself through setting up each party members junction setup every time your party switches (which happens a lot). There are also auto setup options to optimize attack strength, defense or to prioritize magic should manually junctioning things prove too much to handle.Addressing more topical issuesThe game does have gamepad support. I'm aware it claims it does on the store page; I am also aware of other reviews claims of it not working. I will quickly surmise my experience with a gamepad support:  I used a X1 gamepad The D-pad was not functional without some relatively tech heavy workaround by default The opening screen requires you to press 'X' on the keyboard regardless of any gamepad setup you may or may not be using With the utility known as JoytoKey or any other keymapping software, it's a fairly simple process to setup up a gamepad to use both analog and digital controls. As well as be able to assign a face button to that pesky 'X' prompt at the title screen. It's not a big deal.THE GISTFinal Fantasy VIII is, in truth, the only Final Fantasy of the PSX era that I got past the first Disc (out of four). It remains one of my favorites to this day. Sure, it's definitely dated but at some point you might be asking for too much from a game this old.Follow my curation for more "

												Despite my love for Final Fantasy, the PC releases for the series were never that great. While Final Fantasy VII was salvaged by having a fairly simple implementation on the Playstation One, Final Fantasy VIII has a significant problem when compared to it's alternate platform.Let's put it simply, the PC version of Final Fantasy VIII was terrible. It looks terrible, it sounds terrible. Music shipped with this release is an unexcusably terrible cacophany of MIDI instruments that lack in detail that made the Playstation One release as great as it was. Despite the potential for better hardware, the game looks fairly terrible when on the field and in certain 3D environments. Texture tiling is rampant in the overworld, whereas the Playstation One version managed to avoid that alltogether.I love being able to play VIII on the PC, but it comes with the sheer bitter taste of knowing that what I'm seeing is nowhere near as good as it was on the first platform I played the game on. Even with it being as old as it is, it's a damned shame that the PC version of this game had it's artwork stripped bare of what made it look and sound so good.That's not even getting into the playability part. With everything in the game being referenced as ""Button 1"" through whatever, it's maddening to try and map them. While you can fumble your way through the launcher's configuration, do NOT try to mess with the configuration inside the game, else you will get your controls all sorts of messed up and you won't be able to restore it. This is where even giving me the Playstation's references would have been helpful, but in this case it just failed hard, which resulted in me having to restart my game in order to get the controls back in order.It can be done better, it has done better. For those with access to Amazon, or Playstation Network, consider finding a Playstation copy instead.			"

												(EDIT: Due to the high level of knee-jerk downvoting I've noticed as I happily play via emulator after my steam refund, I thought I'd explain a little something: I adore FF VIII (otherwise why bother even warning people about how wretched this port is?), it's my favorite PSX Final Fantasy and my 3rd favorite, full stop. I know I use big words, but you do yourself a disservice when you don't read to the end of a document - reading is a big part of JRPGs, after all)FF VIII is a deeply misunderstood Final Fantasy, probably because it breaks with so many series traditions and has a mechanics system based around stat management. This requires more responsibility on the part of the player than a lot of JRPG fans would probably prefer; you don't just gain levels and skills, it's on you to figure out how to develop your characters the best way. But there has been plenty written about the gameplay and storyline on both sides - I would like to focus on the Steam port.You'll notice on the store page that you're also required to agree to a Square-Enix EULA. This may not seem like a huge deal, just hit ""accept"" and agree not to basically break down and resell the game, right? If only. You'll first be required to make a separate account, log in via their website, confirm again via email, and then enter a setup window.Here you can arrange the buttons for your controller, and here is the ultimate deal-breaker for me. Hope you arranged everything exactly as you like it, and never want to change anything, because in-game your controller buttons will be referred to by their device names, that is, B1, B2, B3, etc. This isn't so difficult until you consider that a number of characters' limit breaks and other attacks rely on timed button inputs - hope you don't ever want to play as Zell!Also, every time you start the game you'll need to use your keyboard. You cannot boot it up, grab a controller, and go. You know, the implicit promise of a console game from the PSX era.Couple this with MIDI music left over from the 15-year-old PC port and you're left with the option of spending hours installing mod after mod to (supposedly) get the game to be (maybe) playable, and I'm forced to say that once again, Square-Enix has shown itself to be the animated zombie corpse of Squaresoft. What a mess.			"

												I was excited for this game. I beat it into the ground in 1999 and was looking forward to playing it again with the new features offered in the Steam edition. I wasn't able to get the game launcher to load past 10%. This is a pretty big issue on the forums with no straight answer on a fix. This is the first game I've had refunded in my 10 years on Steam. Apparently the music is also a bad MIDI reproduction of the OST but I couldn't play it to verify myself. Square-Enix doesn't have a good track record of console to PC ports. I'm better off dusting off my PS1 and playing it that way.			"

												Like many players, I dislike the magic system used in FF8. However, many other people hate this game for just that reason, while I decide to overlook that issue and learn to love the game for what it is. The idea of giving summons (known as Guardian Forces) HP instead of draining your MP is actually pretty well done, because it gives you more reason to use your summon abilities more often in non-boss encounters. In conclusion, this game has its share of flaws, but people should learn to overlook those flaws and see the game for what it is.			"

												(no spoiler review) Final Fantasy VIII:  A pretty good RPG with some really interesting mechanics. It is now the highest number FF game I've beat, so you can tell I'm behind in the series. Even though I only just beat it, I actually owned and played FF VIII the year it came out, but got so addicted to Triple Triad that I never progressed the main story more than a few hours; so it felt really good to go back and finally beat it.A lot of the game systems threw me off at first.  Understanding Junctioning and GFs took me a really long time to figure out. Once I got used to the system, I really liked it. It was addicting to level up by GFs to get new abilities and stats on them, especially when it meant I could open up a stat to junction magic onto, which made the characters much more powerful.  However, as the game progressed, the attaching gfs and abilities to each character became probably my biggest complaint about the game. The reason for this is that every friggin' 10 minutes your party either splits off, or certain characters become unavailable, or you switch between parties, and every single time you have to switch junctions, abilities and magic to your new group (and if it affects their hp then you have to waste cure magic to bring their hp up). This drove me crazy and really disrupted the flow of the game.I highly enjoyed the Steam version of FFVIII. I read a bunch of complaints about the Steam version, but the only one that I thought was valid was that all the music was in midi format, which made it all sound horrible. Luckily, someone created a mod that replaced all the midi music files with non-midi ones, so once I installed that, I got all the regular music back again. Another bonus of the Steam version is that the game comes with a lot of cheats. They have some pretty heavy ones, like always have full health, or always do 9999 damage. The only ""cheat"" I indulged in was the amazing high-speed mode. By pressing F1, you could activate high-speed mode which sped everything up by a factor of five. I found this to be a great QoL feature that I used mainly during the game's ridiculously long summon sequences, grinding regular battles, and parts that I had to repeat due to me dying and reloading a save. This feature, along with the Half-Encounter/No-Encounter abilities one of my GFs learned, made it so I could cut through overly long segments and random encounters if I didn't want to deal with them.As for the story and characters, overall I thought they were good. The story got really complicated and weird towards the end, but I liked it. I had to research some stuff during the game and afterward, because the game didn't explain many things that the characters would talk about and reference, which was frustrating. I know a lot of people found Squall too moody, and he was very moody, but I really enjoyed the arc of his character. I think my two favorite characters were Quistis and Zell. I also really enjoyed Laguna, Ward and Kiros. "

												I, personally, don't know why the bloody hell people dislike this game so much.  Sure, the junction system takes some getting used too (especially if you're used to the traditional MP system) and continually drawing magic from enemies can, and will get tedious, (have your GFs learn them refining abilities!)  not to mention the teen drama style story might not be up everyone's ally, but in all fairness, FF8 is a solid game with a ton of nostagia surrounding it, for me anyway.  The smooth looking Steam version is very appealing to the eyes, but the stock midi format music kind of kills the trip down memory lane for me. I mean come on! FF8 has, in my opinion, one of the best soundtracks in the Final Fantasy collection. I can understand making the game smaller in size, but the music is a key factor in the whole Final Fantasy experience.  (Nobuo Uematsu is a game music GENIUS!)  But fear not friends, get the Roses and Wine mod for oust the midis and replace them with the original PS1 music, or add some of the different songs that come included, I recomend the orchestrated Balamb Garden, Blue Fields, Boss music and Battle themes. The replacement Winhill flashback music is a good break from the original music box version too.  All in all, the Roses and Wine mod is a major saving grace for this purchase, and I highly recommend it.			"

												I'm mixed on this one. I would only recommend the steam version of this game if you're going to take the time to mod it in order to fix all the sound and graphics problems. However, if you're not willing to mod the steam version you might as well use an emulator or pull your old playstation out of the closet instead. When I first installed and played the game I was highly dissapointed. The gorgeous music I remembered was replaced by horrible sounding midi and the textures are far more pixelated than I remember the game being. On top of that, I was having trouble getting my PS3 controller to work and had to play the game on keyboard, which I did not desire to do. Upon searching for a controller fix I also found fixes for the graphics and music. After installing a set of mods (Tonberry w/ Seed Reborn, Project Eden, and Tripod) along with replacing the music files and getting the controller to work, my opinion on this game completely changed for the better and I am incredibly happy with my purchase. Yes, we shouldn't have to spend an hour modding a game we just purchased in order to make it pleasing to play, but this game is worth it. It is, and has always been, my favorite of the Final Fantasy series for it's story line, characters, environment design, music, and atmosphere.			"

												This game is widely known to be a great entry in the series, one that has great pre-rendered cutscenes (both for the time and still today), fantastic music, an intriguing plot filled with action and drama, and a heartfelt love story that starts with two unlikely people and builds over the course of the game. I personally love this game and believe it lives up to its standing - but the Steam / PC port is simply not the version to get thanks to the ridiculous and ugly Square Enix DRM popup that shows up every time you run the game, as well as the soundtrack sounding like trash since they used MIDIs instead of MP3s.There are many ways you can enjoy this game. Go out and seek an alternative.			"

												I thought my ears were deceiving me but they were not. Square seems to have an issue keeping the original osts in the Steam releases of the Final Fantasy games. As of now, playing the game in this current state doesn't bring the same ear-pleasing experience as playing from the original FF8. There most likely isn't a good enough reason why the tracks were replaced considering Square made that mistake once with FF7 and corrected it soon after many complaints. I'll leave this as a recommendation because this is my favorite childhood game and surely Square will fix this so you can experience one of the most underrated Final Fantasy games out there.			"

												Bad port of my favorite game ever.This is my favorite game of all time. It's also a downgrade from the original version. The music is lower quality. To even start up the game is awkward. I also keep getting some notification in the top left corner during battle which has something to do with Steam and achievements. It's still a great game. But poor ports like this should be frowned upon. Oh and you also have to create a Square Enix account to even play this game.Square is an awful company. Late 90s Square is the greatest company of all time; they put out the following games in a between 1997 and 2001:Final Fantasy 7, Final Fantasy Tactics, Xenogears, Final Fantasy 8, Final Fantasy 9, and Final Fantasy X. Let me put it another way. In less than 5 years, old Square put out 6 of the greatest games ever made. I'm also not counting other fan favorites like Chrono Cross, Parasite Eve, and Vagrant Story. This company was a serious beast. After the release of FF12 (which was mediocre), it took the company 7 years to come out with FF13. FF13 is one of the worst games I've ever had the displeasure of playing.New Square is garbage and only their Eidos brand puts out good products. Square itself develops trash and creates terrible ports of amazing games. How many version of FF4 are there now?It's really hard for me to recommend this game. If you have no other way of playing this game, you should probably go ahead and buy it. Just know that it's not meant to be like this. I'm ashamed to even give this version a recommendation.An aside -- don't purchase Square games on Steam. Not even great Square games. Square is just looking to churn out half-♥♥♥♥♥ ports to Steam users.			"

												When I was a teen, placing in my PlayStation for the first time, I knew I would be a gamer for life.  This wasn't Sonic jumping on robot creatures or the pixelated curiosities that were the original Final Fantasy's on the NES.... This was a heartwarming journey weaving an epic and timeless tale of the human spirit.I collect and play Final Fantasy games, and this one is my classic favorite.  The story and characters are more realistic than the previous games starting a trend in the series.  It hurts to relive the pixelated limits of 5th generating gaming, but if you can look past (as we all had to back then), you will see a beautiful 3D rendered world featuring elements from modern architecture, classic fantasy, sci fi, and steam punk.  This was one of the first multi-million dollar game productions, and it shows.  I'd love to see high-res versions of these backgrounds.The magic draw system is tedious to play as a completionist, but it is a fun diversion for adventurers because with every enemy encounter, there is an opportunity to draw something unique you can use in gameplay.  Also, each of your party is setup like a blank slate and you strengthen them with magic you've drawn.  So, unlike other RPGs, you can create your own jobs using any of your favorite characters.  And the backgrounds, Enemies and GFs are artistically rendered, and it's easy to feel a sense belonging to this world.  For newcomers to classic RPGs, think of a large open world game like Skyrim or Fallout 3 with quests, but with a turn-based battle system.Pro draw tips: Make every character able to draw and Mag-J if you can.  Find one weak enemy, draw with each character and hold down the confirm button.  I use Xpadder to toggle-hold it down.  If you have to draw from a stronger enemy, you can put one person on cure-duty, and I like to make Selphie weak on attack (no or weak Str-J and low level) and give her mug and put Stop on Status-J.  This is a good setup for the draw, and also a weak attack can help you bring their hp low without killing so you can finish them off by turning them into a card (which is refinable and also gains AP).  In the beginning of the game, I find galbadian soldiers (which have 4 spells) and Fish from Balamb are strong early draws.  When you convert a Fastitocalon fish to a card and refine it, you get 20 Water which is a midrange attack spell and a powerhouse on Str- J early in the game and defeating them yields 3 AP each which I think is even more lucrative for grinding than the famous cactaurs.Also, there is a chance to play the game non-violently which should appeal to some including women and girls who may also appreciate the game's romantic undertones.  Most of the enimies are not evil minions.. They are more like nature's creatures in this fantasy world.  Gaining experience from killing is not really rewarded because the enimies gain xp as you do.  However, you can non-violently draw magic.  I have a combo team: One freezes the enemy and steals items with a weak whip attack, a second draws magic, and the third heals any damage recieved.  You can also gain the coveted AP (used for building abilities for the Guardian Forces which are like spirit-assistants in battle) by turning enimies into cards (which I like to imagine is like keeping them as a pet).  Not that this release isn't without problems.  To me, the most noticable omission is analog controls.  They were a great improvement over FF 7 and brought the more realistic characters to life.  Also, it's a shame the face lift didn't make the cards in the in-game card game, Tripple Triad, higher resolution.  I also didn't like the control customizations which don't support the triggers or the D-Pad on the X360 controller; although the extra buttons are really needed.  I used Xpadder to keyboard emulate to fix that and emulating the keyboard's ""confirm"" key because the gamepad one doesn't work everywhere. Unfortunately, this means setting up both gamepad and kb controls in the game's settings.  I wish I could just disable gamepad support in the menu and do full keyboard emulation.  That way, I could keep it all in one place.In fact, first, the fact that it wasn't exactly the same as my mint condition Play Station 1 version infuriated me.  However, when I took my rose colored nostalgia glasses off for a moment, I can appreciate that it has HD 3D (although they had to preserve the original lo res background images).. and there are things you can do to achieve a more original look including lowering game resolution and checking the ""original graphics"" box in the settings.  Also, the high resolution character and GF profile pictures are a nice touch.  I found the MIDI music an acceptable with those nostalgic melodies, but I hear you can community patch it with original sound.  I imagine they had copyright issues with sony requiring them to use PC-MIDI effects.  Modern games tend to have a lot less music, so appreciate the themed soundtrack that accompanys you throughout your journey.Thank you, Square, for bringing these Final fantasy games to Steam.  I hope everyone interested chips in and rewards Square with a little fresh support for these efforts.  Not everyone can collect classic consoles like I do, and very few FF fans can collect every console every FF game was originally released on.  Even for a console collector, it can be more convenient and practical to download from steam and avoid using outdated hardware (I admit: my PS 1 joysticks are getting a bit stiff d: )  Also, we have a chance to share the classics with the younger generation.  But trust me, if you can overlook the outdated graphics, the near-futuristic sci fi and fantasy atmosphere will feel modern and timeless.			"

												I would definitely recommend this game to any Final Fantasy fan and any person new to this series. At first, I did not like this game, but when I replayed the game after a few years, I realized how good this game is. It has complexity to it and once you get the hang of the magic and leveling system, it is so vastly different from all the other Final Fantasy games. I have this game on Playstation and Steam. The music is another plus to this game and adds a whole other dimension to the games story.			"

												  This is the first time I have had the opportunity to review a game I have played for years! First off for the winers and detractors remember this game was released when win98 was the hot new operating system and you had to spend a ton of cash for the great new 486 computer with maybe a 16meg video card and 4megs of ram!! Yeah guys gigabytes were a programers wetdream! The PS1 had just come out and this game was the cutting edge in graphics! Yes I played this game on such a computer.    My profile may say 11 hours played on record but I still have the original PC version installed on my system! I have played this game for hundreds of hours and have loved every second of it. Well maybe not every second cause you do have the odd OPPS! moment and there are some tough battles.    Now for the game. The port system that has been used does have it's querks like the 720p window ( what ued to be called 640 by 480) inside the fullscreen port. Starting and ending the game are a bit cumbersome as I have a cordless rumblepad so the keyboard controls do mess with me. 5.1 sound takes care of the need for ingame volume that was designed for the PS1 plugged into an old CRT possibly stero tv anyway! I did notice one graphics glitch when riding in the garden car to Balam but the sceen is short and not to important. The magic boost in the start menu was a nice touch and saves a lot of work early in the game. You still have to build up your GF levels and ablities which means your characters still get leveled up pretty fast. What I would recommend is a patch to remove the echo screen command in the sync to server message, but for the most part I can ignore it.   I have played FF1 through 8 and 12. I have FF9 but it is still on my to do bucket list YAY! Every one of those FF games has been an experiment or should I say a work in progress. Each one had a huge list of things to find make or create to advance the game and build your characters. One game does not a series make or break for that matter. This all came together in FFVIII. The side quests the card game and all the other features make this the best in the series to that date. Yes I mean way back when it came out in 98!    As for the grand expiriment that is FINAL FANTASY I can only hope to live long enough to put on the harness strap into the cage put on the VR helmet and play the game LIVE!!!   All I can really say is bravo 10 out of 10 they did not change the game during the upgrade!!!  "

												My absolute favorite game of all time. <3Where to begin. Hmm. //StoryI think the story is probably the most important aspect of a Final Fantasy game. The story in FF8 is, well, weird. It starts off simple enough, you are a student in a military school on your way to your first assignment. After a while things become very weird, almost dreamlike, introducing characters from different timelines and so on. This is probably one of the cons for many people, because the story doesn't really make sense. But if you read into some of the theories circulating the web (*cough* Squall Is Dead *cough*), the story starts to make sense and in my opinion becomes much more enjoyanble!//CharactersThis game has a list of lovely characters. Well, some might think the main protagonist is a bit Emo and not fit as a party-leader. And that's the beauty of it, he ISN'T fit as a party leader, he doesn't even WANT to be that, he sort of was just put in that situation and has to deal with his social anxiety and peoples problems that he can't even get his head around. In my opinion that makes this game so beautiful, because Squall reminds me of me and my personal struggles I've had. Squall seems very hounest and almost autistic in his behaviour, that makes him very real and not so much a ""cliché hero"" character. //GameplayWell, mostly you're stuck in cutscenes and dialogues (as sadly is the case with most FF games).The battle system is simple enough, with a gimmick, you can get a Crit attack with Squalls Gunblade if you time the attack correctly (only Squall, not the other party members). Something I almost wish they would implement on ALL characters, as it actually feels pretty satisfying.The other thing that is a heap of a mess before you really get into it, is the Junction system. Basically you Equip a GF (Guardian Force (Esper / Aeon)) in your mind, that GF in turn gives you certain Stat slots in your mind, where you can equip magic, that you gather from monsters using Draw (confused yet?). All I can say is that, it took me a 3rd playthrough as a kid before I actually fully grasped the system. That being said, I actually LOVE it now, it gives alot of customizability and you can fine-tune characters a bit more than most FF games. //MusicDefenitely one of Nobuos finest masterpieces, it suits the game very well and has several memorable pieces that sticks to me to this day, nearly 20 years later!//OtherTriple Triad is a card game in FF8 that is really good!I've played through this game more than 10 times (both PC and PS1 versions) and I'd defenitely recommend it if you have the patience, and like JRPGs in general. If not, I guess it's ok to pass, as I totally understand that this game isn't for everyone.Edit: I nominated it to "" The “Test of Time” Award "" in Steam Awards as it's a game I come back to very often and still enjoy.

												Final Fantasy 8 is one of the more overlooked entries in the series. Talk to fans of the franchise and you will generally find that opinion is neatly divided on both gameplay elements and storyline. The easy to abuse Junctioning system and J-drama high-school esq plot will not appeal to everyone, but are worth experiencing if you are in anyway a fan of Final Fantasy or jrpgs. The music however is like having an entire casio keyboard ground up then forced roughly into your ear canal. Whilst the recent HD remake of Final Fantasy X had its score rearranged and brought up too our refined modern standards, with this game Square Enix seems to have taken the opposite approach and ‘de-made’ its soundtrack back to era before the original game was even created. The original PC release of FF8 featured the same MIDI chip tunes used here, possible to save space, however in 2014 I would expect the quality to be at least that of the console version from 15 years ago. Unfortunately I consider this to be a fatal issue. One of the key attractions of the Final Fantasy series has always been its music. It’s a core aspect of every game in the series and one which Square Enix’s marketing department defiantly recognises. So if you are going to go to the trouble of adding these extra features (the Japan only ‘Chocobo World’ mini-game is fully welcome) is it not worth polishing up one of the games major selling points whilst you are at it? It’s like putting sprinkles on a cupcake but not bothering to brush off the ants. In my mind the addition of an achievement system is not enough to outweigh ear wrenchingly poor music in any game, especially Final Fantasy. Unless you really really like achievements or have had your ears shaved off by a murderous barber, seek this game elsewhere.			"

												So, I randomly decided to buy this game for the nostalgic value. I hadn't played it for SO many years. It was one of the first games that piqued my interest in the RPG genre. I definitely didn't regret it.  Have been a fan ever since and the Final Fantasy series would still have to be my favourite, this game being number one. Totally recommend it to people who love a great story featuring so many different genres and elements. The characters, witty dialogue, as well as their development throughout the game are exceptional(Although Rinoa was slightly annoying this time round, all these years later). The slightly touched up character graphics featured in the PC version are really nice and far less pixelated. I found the battle system in this game to be rather unique and the game isn't very grindy. You can basically level as you please, most monsters/encounters level up with you. You can also turn random battles off after obtaining a specific GF (summon) and learning a certain skill .The card  mini-game known as Triple Triad would have to be one of my favourite aspects of the game also, it's a very fun and sometimes an extremely challenging mini game. Funnily enough after winning almost every card I still haven't become bored of it! Gotta win em all. >=o  The controls in the game are a little klunky, but nothing to really complain about.			"

												Unfortunately the game sounds awful. Musics seem to be played by the computer (midi lecture) which... destroys a lot of the game's atmosphere. Someone who played FF VIII once on PSX can't bare it. Actually, it's sad to say, but emulators on Playstation Network (and else) do a better job running the game than this version.+ cinematics, which truly are an important part of the game's narrative as much as an impressive historical performance in animation and gaming history, are so compressed they now look and sound ugly.12 dollars / 13 euros is an insulte from Square to their fans. I feel like I've been ripped off.I do not recommand this for anyone, neither nostalgic or curious gamer. I really hope it'll be patched soon to enjoy it in a decent way.			"

												Bought the game for one reason......Triple Triad. Don't get me wrong FF8 is a great game, personally one of my all time favourites, however i probably spent most of my time just relaxing and playing TT. Also if you know what you're doing with TT you can get yourself a nice little headstart in the early game with some powerful magic and nice weapon upgrades.What drew me into FF8 was that it moved away from the typical FF roots and featured a setting very much like the real world. A focus was put on large cities with bustling populations, the introduction of driveable cars to the game and even a space station. For long time fans of the franchise this change in setting to a more modern day comes at a cost. We see fan favourites such as the moogles and chocobo's take a back seat and hardly feature whereas previous title had these character incorporated heavily into the game. The moogles are replaced by moombas whilst the chocobo steps aside for the more up to date method of transport the car and train.Personally i felt that compared to other FF titles the character development in 8 was pretty poor. Too many of the characters you encounter seem to fade into the background, either you don't come across them again or like some of your party memebers, seem to just be there for the ride. Other than the main characters don't expect to get to know your other party members too well.The true emphasis of FF8's combat is the Guardian Forces, or Summons as they are known in earlier titles. GF's are now vital to every aspect of combat/gameplay. When a GF is equipped or ""Junctioned"" GFs may be summoned. They also activate various commands such as Magic, Item, Draw, steal etc. They also allow obtained magic to be junctioned to your characters stats to give them boosts. Without a GF equipped your characters can do nothing other than a basic melee attack.The way you obtain spells is also changed for this series. Rather than buying or finding materia like you would have in FF7 you have to find Draw points throughout the world. These draw points allow you to a random quantity of a certain magic. Unlike previous titles magic acts like an item in FF8. You can hold a quantity of 99 for each spell per character meaning that unless you plan your usage out well and keep stocked up you can easily run out of a specific magic. It also makes stronger magic harder to obtain although this can be subsidised with Triple Triad if you convert cards.The thing i do like about this game is the levelling. It is possible to hit level 100 in the starting area if you have the patience, unlike previous titles you will always only need roughly 1000 exp to level up each time. The game balances this out by having the enemies scale with your level, meaning you don't have to spend hours power levelling your characters unless you enjoy doing so. Play your junctions right and you can overcome most boss fights whilst remaining a relatively low level.I could go on for ages covering every aspect of the game but it's better if you just jump in an experiment and give it a go.I would give Final Fantasy 8 a rating of 7/10 i'm basing this on:Music - 8Battle System - 7Originality - 9Plot - 7Characters - 6Replay Value - 4Visuals - 9 (for it's time)Like most FF games it's a solid title just don't expect replay value or great character development. Go in with an open mind to a different direction and setting and you will most likely enjoy this installment to the series.RIP Moogles			"

												Final Fantasy VIII is a game that was an experimental shift from the traditional Final Fantasy series. This is a game where you do not need to level and grind in order to beat the game. For that reason alone, someone can beat this game in under 12 hours if they truly wanted to. To fully embrace the characters, that is a whole different situation. To sum up the mechanics and key differences, FF8 focuses around enemies that will scale to your highest level hero. You will be allowed to have up to 3 heroes at any given time. Your main source of power comes from your summons, which act as something you can equipt in a new system called Junctioning. In Junctioning, you must attach summons and pick their respective abilities. They act as stat boosters and provide unique skills. Through this new system, you must ""Draw"" unique magic. These are much like your traditional spells/magic such as Fira, Cure, Esuna, only with Junctioning, you attach these limited spells like equipment and can potentially attach one spell to each attribute stat to boost them. In fact... this is your main method of powering up, not traditional grinding. Drawing magic is possible through almost every monster you encounter, or ""Draw-Points"" that are located throughout the game. These magic spells you ""draw"" are expendable and limited. If you run out, even if you have the best spells, Ultima, Holy, Demi, you must re-draw them from key locations, monsters, or through a craft system called ""Refinement.""A lot of people will miss the point, but this series adds a bonus method of Crafting or Refinement by means of a card game, Triple Triad. It's a simple game where you have 4 numbers for each direction, top, right, left, bottom, and you must play your strategy to beat the numbers of the previous set cards. There will be additional rules that come into play to make this much more challenging. Using these cards, you can potentially refine powerful items, some of which may make you immortal for a short duration, which is needed for the dreadful final boss.Now for the plot...You start off as Squall, who aims to pass his SeeD exam to become an official member of the most prestigious honor in the Garden. Squall and his companions take on various assigned missions, acting as mercenaries. Eventually, they are assigned a special task by Master Cid. The one who gives this task is Rinoa, our main heroine. Together, this sparks the start of a long, treacherous fight against the ambitious Galbadian Dictatorship that plans to use the Sorceress Edea to take over the world.The story will be a hit or miss for most people. Squall is your typical lazy teenager who doesn't have any plans in his life. He has a very ""Why should I do this...?"" attitude and does not want the burden of responsibility to rest on his shoulders. Later on, you will discover Rinoa is actually a spoiled girl from a powerful family, and everyone has a negative impression of her cause of it. She will learn to become fearful of loss as well after her first confrontation with the Sorceress. As for Squall... because Squall's ""older sister"" left him at an early age, he isolated himself from the world to prevent himself from being hurt. In essence, you could say these two are the most paranoid heroes you will ever come across in the FF series. But because of this, the heroes in FF8 are also the most human you will ever meet. It makes them relate-able to the average person and requires a rather mature audience to play.By the end of the game, you will discover that majority of the characters will have something personal that they struggle through. Learning about their insecurities and pasts will, without a doubt, draw you closer to loving the characters. Several parts of Final Fantasy VIII will have your heart tugged. I played this game throughout 3 very different parts of my life. Almost 10 years later, I finally got around to beating it. I appreciated it more and more each time I played it. Become the characters. Relate to them. Be prepared. This game will change you.			"

												Final Fantasy 8 is a black sheep in the franchise. It's got a really different battle system and a weird story.Final Fantasy 8 does away with MP and replaces it with the Draw ability! This ability makes it so you have to 'draw' magic from your opponents or from specific areas in the world in order to use that magic. Magic is now treated like an item, you can only use as many 'fire' spells as you have stocked. In order to use magic (or any ability that isn't 'attack') you have to junction GFs. These GFs are the equivilant of Eidolons from the other Final Fantasy games and can be summoned during a fight. It can be a real pain to grind on enemies to obtain magic, but fortunately, the Steam version includes a 'magic booster' which gives you 100 of a few spells.Now onto the story. Squall is... a strange character to say the least. If you thought Cloud Strife was dull, you're in for a surprise. Squall is silent, calculating, and has more internal dialogue then external. He has issues relying on people which becomes quite apparent throughout the game. The plot of the story is weird and confusing and has led to may theories on what actually happens during the game. The beginning is a lot more normal however. You are Squall Lionheart. You are a SeeD (pretty much a mercenary) in training and are about to perform in an exam to become fully ranked. You have a rival (kind of like pokemon) and you have a love interest later in the game. After the first disk, things that border the ridiculous start to happen, although they can be completely 100% explained.I liked this game because the farther you got into the game, the more you found yourself enjoying it. This game has, in my opinion, one of the hardest final boss encounters in Final Fantasy. The ending's pretty dope too.			"

												You would have thought after the FFVII debacle SquareEnix would make sure the latest Steam FF did NOT have the compressed, horrible MIDI music. Sadly this is not the case and once again you have to deal with ear diarrhea. Nevertheless, they did patch FFVII to have the high quality PSX music eventually so there is hope.Apart from that, the port is as good as can be expected. Game runs smoothly and looks better than my PSX version slightly. There are some fun achievements if you're into that too, more interesting than FFVII's terrible ones at least.The game itself is fun. Somewhat easy/game-breaking if you understand the Junction system but remains a game I usually beat every 1-2 years. Triple Triad is the highlight of the game, addictive, fun and a welcome distraction when the story begins to go off the rails slightly. I recommend this (£10 is nothing for the time you'll get out of it).			"

Also, why do I have to sign up to Square Enix Online to play this?

												This was my favorite game when I was younger so it's hard to knock it down as a whole. However steam release feels half ♥♥♥♥♥. The upscaled character models make the backgrounds painful to the eyes, the world map looks like a poorly tiled floor, and not to mention the requirement of signing up to squareenix website on a game that has no network affiliation.There is original graphic mode that allows you to play the game with graphics closer to the original ps1 release but that doesn't make up for the poor controller layout, the d-pad is inactive and the stick only emulates the d-pad giving only four way movement rather than the full movement of the original analog function. Also the ""L2 R2"" buttons of the original game are inactive if you're playing with a controller here and have been replaced with Joystick buttons which makes little sense.There are other minor annoyances such as audio but I'll not get into em. All in all great game butchered due to laziness. Not recommended as a steam game, seems like more of a moneymaking scheme by square. Do not support it.			"

												I've always had a strong affinity to this game. Way back when, it appealed to me so much more than VII, due to the more realistic graphics. I have to say, I think the junctioning system is ingenious. I know it gets a lot of stick, but I really think it add a fantastic dimension to the game.Triple Triad, what can I say? It's painfully frustrating, it appears cards flip at their own will, but once you understand every rule, you'll see why the not-so-mini game is arguably more loved than the game itself.			"

												The mandatory account sign-up rubs me the wrong way. If we could use a star system here on Steam that would certainly cost this purchase a star. It doesn't take away from the game itself, though. I had no technical issues with the installation, account sign-up, or the game itself.FF8 is an underrated title in the series. I see a lot of people saying it was the beginning of quality downturn for the series, and I mostly disagree. The ""draw"" system for acquiring spells is a bit monotonous at times, but that's the only flaw that could have been thought out better. I may not like every feature of the game, but I chalk all of my other issues up to simple taste preference. You can't please everyone.Where this game fares well is storytelling, and that's really what these games are known for. Relatable characters on journeys that pull you into the game, and almost make you feel as though you have a personal stake in defeating the antagonist(s). The length of the cut scenes may seem a little excessive at times, but I enjoyed the vast majority of them.The mini-game is card-based, for those concerned with making this game last as long as possible. It isn't as repeatable long-term as Chocobos from FF7, but on the plus side you can start playing cards a lot sooner in the game, and most rare cards are attainable even if you choose to skip the task (or miss it) originally. Like I said, it's not as fun as breeding and racing Chocobo from 7, but they were never going to top that for my enjoyment anyway.Overall it was well worth the purchase. I have the original discs for PS, so I waited until I saw a nice sale on it.. but for those who are looking to play for the first time, or play again and no longer have it on Playstation, I think it's worth the full price.

												Same old awesome game. No bugs and everything seems to work fine, though the graphics I wish would look a little less blurry/fuzzy when adjusted for my monitor. The only negative thing though that really stuck out I would say it's the music. I can stand this more because I actually first played this on the PC version, but the old MIDI music is a bit annoying (though I'm sure it was not easy to program). It becomes glaringly obvious during some of the more complicated pieces of music that represent shifts in the story, and it takes me away from the game more than I would like it to. I would guess though that they will get around to updating the music soon enough, since they did the same for ff7, so I will probably not play any more of this until then, as music is very important to me in the Final Fantasy series. I mean, the Final Fantasy series is essentially a melodrama plus an RPG, and in melodrama music is half of the entertainment.			"

												Pure nostalgia, it takes you to the time when Final Fantasy was the king of the JRPG genre, and even if it is hated by many because of the combat system or the ""cheesy story"", it is still one of the best in the saga.It has improved 3D models compared to the ps1 version and some new things added, but it has a problem. It uses the old PC version music files, which are much worse than the Playstation 1 files. It can be easily fixed by modding it though, so it's not a big problem.For me, it is one of my favorite games of all time, and I'm happy to finally have it on Steam. If you've never played Final Fantasy, you might prefer other games of the saga or other JRPGs, but if you already played it and want to live those special moments again, get it now.			"

												One of the more under rated final fantasy games. Why is this you ask ? Mainly due to its draw and junction system. Magic exsists in the title only by drawing from enemies useing the gf abilities such as life magic refine and or draw points scattered everywhere in the world. why dont people like this sytem? let me explainMost people think you have to draw 100 of each magic to become extreamly powerful when that is not the case. you can infact refine powerful magic  from items early on in the game if you learn the right abilities. The junction system works like the equipment system. Basically you can junction magic to your base stat. Heres an exzample Junction curaga >hp = 8000 base hp 1500  From that you should get the general idea  you can be at an extreamly low level (which is reccomended) and still beat the game. Monsters level up with you so lets say your strongest character is level 17 monsters will also be at level 17 including bosses. Some saymonsters level up with squall thats not the case. There are items that increase your base stat with out leveling a lot of people that i know that play this game grind out those item so they have max hp as well as a 255 (max) base strength stat ect. I would not go that far its easier just to junction. you do not gain gil in this game through battles instead you are given gil based on how many steps you take on a regular occurance. How much you get will be determained by your seed rank highest rank= a. I am not sure howmany steps it is but i am pretty sure it is based on that.Triple triad ....

got that song in your head yet  ?  No  ?  Well you will. Playing cards in this game is almost a must. Each card in the game refines in to an item with the card mod ability. Some items you get can refine in to really good magic. Others refine into items you may need. If you played ff9 efore you played this then you should know how the card game works its fairly simalier and easy to learn. The only thing that sucks are the same and sameplus , random rules .  PRO TIP : Save your game before playing any card games. You do not want to loose your stronger cards such as gf and or character cards. you can win them back but its faster if you save and reset.

												This is an excellent game of the franchise, frequently under stated and disliked by the Final Fantasy fanbase it lacks some of the plot of the predecessor FFVII but makes up for it with beuatiful video scenes and music tracks.The conversion from the Playstation was well done but as with any game converted for PC after its creation there are a few flaws, none of which detract from the playability, most notably in the fluidity and layout. (Rather than completely redesign all interfaces the decision was made to alter the controls to a keyboard system simmilar to many emulators making some key combinations a bit challenging.) On the up side its entirely possible to hook a USB PS2 controller into your PC and use that instead of your keyboard and return to the original feel of the game.Overall I would say its a great game, a great buy, and a great choice.

												What can I say, Final Fantasy VIII is my favorite Final Fantasy and one of my all time favorite games. The story line is fantasic and this game will give you many feels and laughs. Though I am a bit disappointed with this PC version because the audio sounds different..especially the music which is a complete and utter shame because the soundtrack to this game is beautifully phenomenal, Nobuo Uematsu is truly a musical genius. Would I recommend this game? You bet. Anyone who hasn't played this game is really missing out and needs to play it as soon as possible. Although it doesn't feel the same playing it on a PC instead of a PS1, its still enjoyable. Also, at some point listen to the entire soundtrack to this game so you can fully enjoy the real music instead of the weird ""recreated"" versions.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII was the first game i bought in my life and i still feel a little bit of nostalgia playing it. Pros	  Triple Triad - Still love to play it to this day. One of the best minigames of all time.  Music Score - As any FF game the Music score is great.  Graphics - Were Great back in the day, FMV still look breathtaking to this day.  Story - Good. Could have been better but I still felt engrossed by it.  Cons	  Lazy Port - Sound is Midi ported from the Pc version of this game. Playstasion sound was way better. No button configuration. Original button configuration is terrible.   GF Animations - Although they look great the first 15/20 times you see it, after a while it gets really boring to not be able to skip this animations. It makes battles tedious.  Main protagonist - Squall simply isn't likeable. For half of the game he actually passes for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ most of the time. Limbo The Junction System - Great customization, you can junction elemental magic to your attack or defence (fire,ice, lightning etc), status magic (poison, blind, etc) and also junction magic to your stats. The problem is the grind you have to go through to get magic since it is drawed from monsters. Mostly you find yourself spending hours drawing magic than actually fighting most of the monsters and bosses.Good game, but you should only buy it on sale. Too expensive for a game that is 17 years old and has been poorly ported. Mods help.			"

General info~Genre: Japanese roleplaying game (JRPG), belongs to Final Fantasy series~Number of players: 1~Completion time: 45-100 hours~Partially enhanced (HD) version of already existing titleStrong points+Story: A tale about the coming of age, the fear of loss, the acceptance of responsibilities, the need of expression, the importance of friendship and the warmth of love. Younger gamers might find the aforementioned topics quite boring, as I did back in the day, but as I grew up I understood why the developers chose to enrich their product with such thematology.+Content: A game suitable for both young and mature audiences.+Music: Don't take my word for it; just listen to the complete soundtrack (uploaded on youtube by TantrisOST)


YouTube™ Video: Final Fantasy VIII - Complete Soundtrack 

			Views: 1,601,814		

			Music from the video game Final Fantasy 8 from 1999, by Square Music by Nobuo Uematsu ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Musique du jeu...		

+Tradition: Many well known figures and themes of the Final Fantasy universe make their appearance in Final Fantasy VIII: Prepare to fight Malboros and Tonberries, summon Shiva and Ifrit, cast Reflect and Ultima and ride chocobos. Also, many artists already involved in previous installments are back: Yusuke Naora, Kazushige Nojima, and composer Nobuo Uematsu.+Team spirit: Create teams of three characters (from a total of six) and face challenging foes in a turn based battle-system. Experienced Final Fantasy players will tread on familiar ground while newcomers will adapt gradually thanks to the game's instructional early stages.+Not another grinding fest: Final Fantasy VIII introduced the juctioning system with which you may team up with various summoning entities and enhance your stats, abilities and defences. Thus, instead of killing enemies for hours and hours in order to level up, you are able to apply various combinations of spells to enhance your characters. You can actually finish the game with your initial level (steam achievement) thanks to this innovative progress system.+Road to the riches: You don't have to worry about buying your expensive equipment in FFVIII. Most items will be dropped from slained monsters or they can be crafted by collecting various ingredients with the help of your summoned creatures. +Along came Behemoth: Enemies level up as you do. It's your choice where and when to increase your level of experience as well as how to fortify your team in order to overcome enemies who change attack pattern as your levels go up.+Characters, NPCs, companions with interesting background and distinctive personalities. Most of them answer to the principles of japanese manga and anime culture; if you have played any other Final Fantasy game you know what to expect; and that's not necessarily a bad thing.+Environment: Both urban and rural. You can visit cities, ports, schools as well as beaches, deserts and the infamous chocobo forests; by renting a car, riding a chocobo or exploring on foot!+Chicobo: The famous pocketstation game Chocobo World which accompanied the original title is back! Train your little chocobo to the highest level, slain enemies and transfer all acquired loot to your main saved game in order to aid your team with powerful items.+Rich background: Despite starting the game ""in medias res"", the complex background of the game will be revealead to players piece by piece as they progress. Visit the in-game Information section often to learn new things about the world you are exploring.+Controls: Customizable in-game settings, controller support.+For seasoned adventurers and newcomers: You can level your characters up to the maximum or stay at  a low level and depend on your juctions and individual skills only.Weaknesses-Problematic PC port: This port suffers from a few issues which can be fixed with various mods or community unofficial patches. The two major problems can be found on the sound and graphics department:  Despite the fact that characters, spells, summons and vehicles are graphically enhanced , the background remains in low resolution. Click  here for an example. As for the sound, the main issue is its bad quality. You can fix this problem by downloading a mod called Roses and Wine. Consult the Steam guide section  for links. SquareEnix could have spent more time improving their product.-Juctioning: Ironically, one of Final Fantasy VIII's best features is at the same time one of its flaws. Juctioning can make your team almost invincible and it's quite simple to comprehend as long as you have spent time on the tutorial understanding how the system works. Unfortunately, while the game extricates the players from many hours of useless killing, they must still draw spells from various enemies at large quantities for maximum junctioning effect. This can be time consuming as well.-Spam this sword: Although the juctioning system gives a lot of choises as to how you wish to develop your team, in the end you might end up saving your acquired spells and magic for stat enhancement only and just spam the attack command to dispatch your enemies. This issue might frustrate or disappoint some players who prefer to play with mixed teams (fighters and mages) or the older fans of the series who prefer variety and strategies during boss fights.-Smithing: Final Fantasy VIII features limited character costumization. Your characters' appearance cannot be changed since you do not have access to armor or other protective equipment. The only item you can actually costumize is each character's weapon. Ironically, weapon enhancement is not advisable until the latest stages of the game due to the the fact that enhanced weapons feature negligible upgrades compared to the initial weapons equipped on each character. Long story short, upgrade your weapon to their ultimate forms only.Neutral ground±Price: Preferably buy it during a sale.±Permanently missable content: Meticulous players who enjoy searching every nook and cranny of the world, won't have serious problems finding most items in the game. But for the rest of you, it might be a good idea to consult a detailed guide if you want a perfect run with all the achievements unlocked on one playthrough.My rating4/5
Final Fantasy VIII was cursed to grow under the shadow of its predecessor. Up to this day, many gamers form an opinion about this game without having played it themselves. It might not be as flashy or fancy as VII or IX but thanks to its thematology, soundtrack and juction system it deserves a spot among the greatest games of its genre. Concerning the issues I mentioned on the “Weaknesses” section, try consulting Steam guides on how to surpass the low quality sound or graphic issues you may have. "

												Dreadful controller support. The game prompts you with ""button 1"" ""button 2"" instead of recognizing you're using a 360 controller and saying  X A Y B.On top of that the implemenation of the cheats and boosters is terrible. I shouldn't have to google to work out how these things are done.♥♥♥♥ing hell I know these are cheap rushed ports but at leastspend one minute thinking about the fact that humans are playing your game and so think about how you can make your product enjoyable to use.

												I may only have 11 hours on this game, but I've played this game on the PS1 a number of times. It's an absolutely gorgeous game that has withstood the test of time. This game is a solid gem, and it's beautifully ported for Steam. Nostalgia ensues! Pros- Cheats such as infinite magic and max health (Warning- PERMANENT once you apply it to a save data)Save ANYWHERE when you're roaming outside in the open world. Those pesky save points hindering your ability to take a break? Not a problem. Save ANYWHERE when you're roaming the open fields.Retextured graphics, but you can choose the original PS1 settings if desired.Chocobo World is INCLUDED..for FREE.Cons- The music is composed of MIDI Tracks. I recommend downloading the Roses and Wine music mod to truly enjoy the game.Some of GF summoning sounds are reworked, so it takes some time to get used to.Cheats as mentioned above, cannot be reverted once you apply it to a save data. USE WITH CAUTION.All in all, it's an amazing game. I recommend it wholeheartedly, for old fans and newcomers alike, especially if you can get this when it's on sale!Happy Gaming.			"

												This game has a love/hate relationship with some fans but It's always held a place in my heart being the first major FF game I got into after seven when I was younger and I grew to like the world, characters and story. I would say the  junction system can be a bit of a mess and kill the game for a few people but once you get the hang of things it's not too bad and it does add a bit of a challenge to the system.

												  FF8 is a good game. For those new to FF this would be an odd start. Each FF has a little gimmick within their gameplay. FF8 introduces a ""junction"" system which can be confusing at first. In actuality it's pretty lame, but a cool concept. In previous FFs magic would drain MP, but in FF8 magic is drawn(upto100) from various points in game, and from monsters. All while requiring a GF(gaurdian force) to be ""junctioned"" to that character. In order to actually buff your characters, junctioning magic is required. Unlike in other FFs leveling hardly boosts stats. It is required to draw a lot of one spell just to buff a character efficiently. What makes plain leveling useless is the fact that enemies are level'd according to the party's average level. People have beaten the game low level'd with proper junctions alone.   Also... you can find yourself mashing GF summons early on... which means watching a cutscene, damaging enemy, and continuing fight. Not only is combat a bit dull compared to other installments, there doesn't seem to be much enemy variety. The final area's random encounters are monsters that you fight throughout the game. Although the little summon cutscenes are pretty great for 1999.   Other than the combat the game plays like a novel. A very nice story, and smooth character developement. Even with a story that is all over the place, literally, it is shown beautifully. Oh, there is also extra things like ""Triple Triad"". It's a card game played with cards collected while progressing. There's a whole bunch of other things involving the cards, but no need to mention it. Just more things to do rather than blowing through the story. Never bothered playing any card matches(or using cards) in my playthrough.   Like I said in the first sentence... FF8 IS a good game. IMO not the best FF, but definitely better than some of the  recent releases. ON THE SUBJECT OF THIS PARTICULAR PORT: It has some issues.   The sound isn't on point  Takes a bit too much space. Apparently not compressed well.  Square Enix has an annoying requirement of making an account for their servers. Bad enough it's on the steam DRM. Feels even more distant.... BUUT it doesn't intrude much and y'all can still play offline, I believe.  "

												It's probably the most convenient way to play the game these days, and that counts for something. And it really is worth playing; it's the black sheep of the Playstation FF games, but that makes it interesting. It's broken, has an even more ridiculous plot than usual, dungeons are very often literally copy-pasted together, and the ever-present card game brings the pace to a crawl. But, it also has a great cast, interesting changes to the typical FF ruleset, the card game is fun, and the settings are varied and beautiful while creating a more consistent universe than its immediate predecessor.THAT SAID...If you have a Playstation/PS2 hooked up to a CRT TV/XRGB-type scaler, or an emulator with a good CRT TV simulation mode, you will have a vastly better experience. The game is designed around the limitations of the Playstation, and the PC version makes no attempt to hide the ""strings"", such as they are.  The backgrounds are 320x240 scaled up with nearest neighbour scaling, while the characters are rendered for native resolution and filtered, and it creates a distracting mismatch - only exascerbated by ""crowd scenes"" where the crowds are baked into the backgrounds, designed to match up with low resolution Playstation models but completely out of place with the smooth, detailed characters.It's actually kind of fascinating to get a the behind-the-curtain perspective on the game like this, it gives you an appreciation for the craft and cleverness of the developers - but it takes you out of the game, looks like crap, and that sucks.  Games designed for low resolutions should be played in low resolutions.Also, by default, the music uses awful general MIDI versions of the soundtrack.  There are mods to fix this, but it's kind of unacceptable to put out a rerelease of a game praised for it's music with a general MIDI soundtrack in the year 2014.  My god, you don't have to fit it on 4 CDs anymore, you can distribute it with a recorded soundtrack!I recommend it because it's good, but the presentation is awful.  Step up your game, Squeenix.

It's a beautifull story. Story about Love between Squall and Rinoa. Story about fight versus Sorcceress. And saving the World.Every character have his own nature and destiny.I don't know, why I love this game. Maybe it's a story, or gameplay, or characters. But, mayby, all together. As I said, It's a beautifull story. Awesome music and characters and CGI cutscenes. Incredible dramatic scenes, like Squall and Rinoa in Space (Song: Eye on Me), which make me sad . If you love good story, you must play FFVIII (VII). Don't look on graphics. It's really hard to me,describe my feeling on foreign language, sorry. "

The draw system is my favourite magic system of RPGs, and coupled with the immersive story, and great gameplay, it's still holds its own today.

												This was the 2nd Final Fantasy game to originate on the original playstation. The first being Final Fantasy VII.In this game you'll follow the journey of Squall from his start in Balamb Garden to wherever he and his friends end up as the story progresses. Many of the common Final Fantasy creatures return which are also known as Espers, Summons, or however each game in the series differentiates between them such as Ifrit or Shiva.One of the shining qualities of this game is of course in my opinion the music which is done by Nobuo Uematsu.For those new to the game: I'd suggest playing this for the story and the music. Also even though it's been out of style lately, the turned based combat system I still enjoy.			"

												The second Final Fantasy game to grace the Playstation console, Final Fantasy VIII had some big shoes to fill after the success of it's predecessor. Though considered by some to be a flop, I see FF VIII as one of the greatest stories in the series. With very well developed characters and hours of cut scenes, FF VIII delivers an epic and emotional ride. While the magic and combat system is a little quirky and easy to exploit, over all the game delivers on most fronts. At no point in the game does the story feel contrived or boring, keeping you on the edge of your seat the whole way. I highly reccommend this game if you are a fan of the series or just looking for a fun game to keep your interest.			"

												If you enjoyed playing Final Fantasy VIII on the PSX you should definitely consider getting this version.  It's nice to earn achievements along the way, plus the Steam version allows you to play Chocobo World, a mini-game not previously available in the US.  This version of the game does have a few downsides, however.  As many mention, the default music is subpar compared to the PSX version, so you would have to find a mod with the proper music files and install them.  Also, while the character models are cleaner looking than the PSX version, the backgrounds all seem to be a little lower quality.  They seem a bit more pixelated than I remember, which just stands out that much more against the various characters.  I've also noticed a few NPCs pixelating very badly at times.  First it was a nameless girl in the classroom at the beginning of the game, and shortly after Headmaster Cid turned into an unrecognizable blob of colored squares.  It doesn't seem to happen often, and I haven't noticed it happening to the various party characters.This version has some flaws, but if you enjoyed playing the game in the past this is still worth snagging here on Steam, especially if you can catch it on a good sale.

												Final Fantasy VIII was one of the first Final Fantasy games I ever played (along with VII), and even after all the years that have passed since I first picked up this game and have played more and more Final Fantasy games in the series, I always find myself coming back and playing this game. This game was something special for me, maybe it was because it was one of the first RPG's that I ever played or some other reason, but this game has not lost its luster to me. I absolutely love this game and I very much recommend to anyone who is wanting to start playing a game in the Final Fantasy series. A lot of the things that I love about this game is the story (the only few complaints that I may have is for people new to this game, the story may be a little hard to follow at certain points, and people like to complain about how much of an emo that the main character happens to be which kind of turns some people off to this game), the cast of characters range from emotionless to flameboyant, the magic system is a good change of pace from the typical MP system that had been a part of the games before for a very long time, and overall is a nice change of pace from a lot of the other games in the series as this game tries to blend fantasy with realism (the cities for instance show many signs of fantasy and realism in them), plus the soundtrack is beautifully composed. However the one major complaint I have about this port is the butchering of said soundtrack (which I recommend to anyone to go and get the Roses and Wine mod which replaces the butchered soundtrack with the original). Overall, this game is something special and I think for anyone who is either new to the series, or someone who's played Final Fantasy games before but has never picked this game up, I highly recommend playing it, it's a game that can be played over and over again, either trying to play seriously, or waste away playing Triple Triad.

												I remember playing this game in the early 2000s I think I played it the most out of all the Final Fantasies. I was searching YouTube one day and I came across some game theories so to get a better understanding of it I decided to get it on a whim. The game is as great and enjoyable as I remember it even though I played it all the time I always feel like it is a brand new experience. I grew up with it and have always loved it and my appreciation for it only grows as I get older anyway enough gushing you clicked this for a review so here we go.Graphics: The game does look good it always looked good however sad to say upscale pre-rendered graphics do not hold up well the art though really well done does show its age as they can be blurred and through the sharpened quality you can see errors in the textures a lot easier. Character models however are very well done the pre rendered cut scenes are well made and are well shot and the in game sprits are smoothed out almost flawlessly (blocky Rhinoa legs anyone). Despite these gripes it in no way takes away from the full game. This is my first review so please give me your feed back so i can give you all better ones in the future.Music: It's final fantasy nuff said the music is excellent and fits the game perfectly. There are scores that strike my nostalgia cords as well as my feels and never fail to get me invested.Characters: Again it is final fantasy the characters are genuinely likable and compliment the story well except you Irvine stay away from Selphie you fiend she's mine!Story: It is a well done story however around the second story arc it gets confusing but again what final fantasy doesn’t the story takes you on a journey that will have you locked in place until the very end though some of the story aspects seem clichéd by today’s standards they are however clichéd because they work.Challenge: The enemies in this game scale up with you so as you grow stronger they will become more dangerous this is a welcome change or a really hated change from previous Final Fantasies depending on who you are. It takes a very good understanding of the Junction system to keep up with the difficulty curve you will undoubtedly find yourself getting smacked around with if you do not prepare well. SAVE OFTEN I can't stress this enough because sometimes this game can be downright frustrating and brutal at times but the payout is rarely not worth it.Overall: This game was an excellent piece of work in 1999 and the port is an excellent piece of work almost 17 years later it holds up well and is very enjoyable to play with it has a romantic story and plentiful side quests as well as super bosses and hiddend summons that come with their own abilities that you can learn you will not regret playing this I give this game a solid 8/10 despite the clichés the brilliant twists, the musical score, the likable cast and a solid world to explore at your leisure make up for it. The game has flaws just like any other but it is well worth its asking price.			"

												It may not be up to par with the PS1 version of the game, but this did exist once upon a time. The MIDI version of the game's soundtrack isn't too pleasing and does not do the game's amazing music any justice, but hopefully that's fixed. It's great to be able to access the Chocobo World mini-game if you never had a chance to do it, I sure didn't. Great game over all, highly recommend it.			"

												Final Fantasy to me has always been one of my favorite video game series. Now most people are obsessed with Final Fantasy 7 though I love that game as well I had to buy this game on steam first having played both in the past. This game features a great story, Wonderful music, and though the graphics arent up to say modern games at the time this game amazed me with its fantastic graphics when it first came out for its time. I must say the music is different from the ps1 version you can change this but having already owned the ps1 version on my ps3 i see no need. Even if it's slightly different Eyes on me is still there and its kind of interesting listening to the pc version of the soundtrack. They are both in my opinion equally as good soundtrack wise. I give this game a 10/10 for its story. It's also got some pretty awesome characters.SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT!:There is also a scene where you end up in space!			"

												Final Fantasy VIII is one of my favourite RPGs and my favourite game in the Final Fantasy series.The game is alot different from other RPGs due to the fact that magic must be taken from the enemies you battle and instead of mp you have a stock of all the magic you've takenMagic spells are also the best way to increase your characters stats as enemies get stronger when you level up, and will end up stronger then you if you don't junction magic to your stats, as doing this will increase them (and can also make you extremely powerful.) It is this unique system that makes it one of my favourite RPGs.The story is pretty good and will make you want to keep playing, around the middle the story feels to me like it was struggleing but it picked up again towards the end.If you want a decent RPG to spend some time on, or are just looking for a unique RPG then you should give this game a shot!Also Triple Triad.

												I first played this game when I was around 11 years old. I hated it to be honest, the game was too confusing for me at the time and the system was weird, nothing like the almighty Final Fantasy 7 that I loved. Naturally, some years later I wanted to make a better judgement of it, and I did, and I absolutely loved it. Now that the game is on Steam, I can make a review with my memory completely freshened up after beating the game for the 3rd time, after many unfinished playthroughs.Everything from this game seems to be way above and beyond of what gaming was at the time. The game is modern, it feels modern and even the system is unlike any other title. The way you build your characters is very unique in the sense that you can costumize every single detail and no character is like any other, the choices are also limited so you can't have a character doing absolutely everything while the others do nothing, which makes the concept of a party much more likely to happen. Aeons or Summons have always been a big part in Final Fantasy games, but never like in FF8, not even in FF10 are Aeons as important as Guardian Forces in FF8, this makes the amazing GF cinematics in FF8 much more wanted, which for me was an issue in other games, they looked awesome, but physical attacks just cut it better in FF7, for example.The characters all have a big role in the story (which will be the last part I'll talk about), and they're all well crafted, none of them are spot-fillers, they're there, they're unique in their personalities and traits and they're just not annoying. In other titles I've always felt there was this one character I didn't like, but I think it's the fact that in FF8, there's only 6 characters that makes it so much easier to like them all.The side-quests are bad and few. And this is all I should say about this, but it won't be. The only ''side-quest'' you should be partaking in is the Card Quest, but unfortunately even to obtain all the cards you have to complete most of the other boring, dull, hard to find and hard to complete without guidance side-quests, this is the biggest flaw in the game in my opinion, the game barely gives any hints on how to find or complete most side-quests and you're forced to search the internet for most, such as the PuPu quest (after the 3rd occult fan, no more hints are given), or obtaining the Tonberry King GF (There's one mention of it in Trabia Garden, but one would only get so far to getting the GF by sheer persistence and guessing.And before we move on to talk about my favourite part of the game, let's talk about how I love the draw system. Many people hate this system, some think it's unfair, some think it's boring, I personally think it can be whatever you want it to be. I have a system when I play that I get the magical and the defensive character do the drawing and have the offensive character do the killing. It works because it raises the stats equally and it's not boring at all, so I reach the middle of the game with all my characters balanced and even the ones outside the party get to have spare magic. And it's also super fun finding out magic from monsters.Now, the story. The perfect, yet flawed story that makes me think this is the best game I've ever played (I've never have a game that I wanted to replay right after finishing it). The story is incoherent? Maybe. Maybe the story is confusing and has a lot of twists and weird happenings throughout the game. But it's all resolved in the end... Or is it? There are 2 theories to the story of this game that I love to discuss about, and they both make a lot of sense, but they're just theories, because the story allows for them to exist, the story isn't vague but it has this open space for creativity that's just right. I won't go into many details because of spoilers, but when certain things in the game come together and you start figuring out certain things, it just makes you go ""wow..."", and everything unfolds and makes sense in front of you, it's brilliant.Also, Selphie is adorable.

												Final Fantasy VIII is a bit ridculous.No, really - this game had a huge impact on me when I was 12 years old, so when I saw it up for grabs on Steam I acted fast. And you know what? Holy cow is this just goofy as hell. Of course, we should all be willing to admit that cliches are what FF is all about, and that's not a bad thing. It's just that VIII attempts to be a deconstruction and the story is frequently tripping and falling on its own ""and now a twist!"" approach that gets a tad bit tired by the ""disc 2"" segment. That being said, I do enjoy the  settings as they're consistently well-rendered and imaginitive. I'd expect nothing less of the team from this era.The characters? Pretty damn bland. There's a certain backstory that ties in importantly, but it doesn't really explain why (with the exception of a couple) these characters are all so ridiculous. Only Squall, the mainest of main characters, has a degree of depth and even then it falls into borderline-woe-is-me nonsense. The models are certainly worth snickering at (to be fair, that's the age showing).As for the gameplay itself - it's pretty fun! It's also pretty easy to manipulate if you know what approach to take with the juncitoning system. Putting the right spell on the right stat makes things so quickly breakable that it blew my mind how much trouble I had as a kid. Still, it's fun trying in mix and match what element you're going to smack what enemy with. And that Eden summon never gets old. Stuff like this is why I've avoided strategy guides ever since I turned 14. It's going to be fun if you don't know exactly what item does what function.In summation, this is certainly a game that can be fun to play if you've never played it before... Just know your tastes.

												I got to say: this was a waste of money (Thank goodness I got a refund for it.)I did like FFVIII a bit, but I didn't get all that far when I was young, and didn't get a good opinion on it. On a sale, I got this computer port, but man what a mistake.For one: The Music. Square Enix said that this port has the same music as the PSX version. I would say that they don't know what is the same/difference in the Final Fantasy VIII songs, because it's NOT the same music. The boss battle music is amazing imo, but it lost it's charm in this version.Original:

For two: Messy textures. I mean, the characters look good, but the world/areas look worse than the PSX version. The areas are super pixelated, but that's understandable since it's a PSX port, but the world map is a mess, and comparing with the PSX version, you clearly see that they just blurred the world map textures to not give that pixelated feel, which results in a huge fail of nice textures.For three: Controls. I mean, yah this is a PSX port and those controllers had only the directional pad, but it had full joystick support, meaning that you can move in any direction freely. This though, if you use a gamepad, you can only move in the 8 directions, D-pad or Joystick. This game is hard to get around without the freedom of moving in any direction. Even when using a controller, it's Button 2, Button 5, etc, not giving Xbox 360/PS3 controls. That just shows how rushed and lazy this port is.Don't buy this port. I am really disappointed with this.			"

												While it may not be the best in the Final Fantasy series, FF8 holds a big place in my heart. This is the first time I've played the game, so I'm not speaking with feelings of nostalgia here.Gameplay: Initially, I was turned off. The Junction system wasn't something I was used to. MP doesn't exist here with magic being a consumeable item. It's just something you draw from enemies or synthesize. I rarely casted magic against monsters and used it as a stat upgrade, which left a bad taste in my mouth. Eventually though, I learned to like the system. Once you get the hang of it, it's like a fact of life that you don't put much thought on. It's also easy to power up your party, making this one of the easier FF games.Sidequests: Not a lot. Plus most of the sidequests are not difficult to accomplish. They are just time-consuming. To note a few challenges, there's a Steam achievement called ""Contrived Victory""; you may have to play through the game a second time. Card collecting is also a big hassle.Story: I really enjoyed the story even if it was presented in a confusing manner. For a game that had schools training teen soldiers, warring factions, and a time compression scheme by a corrupt sorceress, I didn't feel the gravity of the world's situation until the middle of Disc 3. That's just something funny to observe. You could tell that the game's theme was about friendship and love being the most precious thing that surpasses past, present, and future. Cheesy but endearing. (Squall and the gang are #squadgoals; Laguna and the gang are #squadgoals)Music: Memorable. There are strong pieces in the game that you will download and listen to on repeat. They go very well with the various places scattered in the world. My favorite scene was when ""Compression of Time"" started playing. To me, that will always be an iconic moment in the game.(Just make sure to replace the bad steam port music with the orginal PS1 version!!! It makes the gaming experience significantly better!)All in all it is highly-reccommended you play FF8. The whole game plays like a sentimental memory because time is what brings this whole game together. There's a lot to be had in FF8 that will give you a great experience despite its' imperfections.

												The game is one of the under-appreciated game of the series. This game suffers being in the shadow of FFVII which in the time was a masterpiece. This game excels itself and I actually prefer this game to FFVII. One thing that FFVIII excelled over FFVII is the lead character.IMHO Squall is a much better protagonist than Cloud and he's one of the best of the series. You know what he's always thinking, and he's actually human compared to the other lead characters in the series. Throughout the game you can see his conflict in life caused by his troubled childhood. He wants to be alone because he's lost so much, he's not tough, deep inside he's weak and he cant accept losing anyone important to him, which is why he prefers to be alone, so he never has to lose anyone. The plot has many holes, but the overall story and the characters more than make up for it. The battle system is nothing like the other FFs. Drawing system to stock magic is a nuisance, and frankly it deters me from using magic completely, only for the sake of junctioning. The junctioning system has always divided opinion, but it is easily mastered if you put some effort into it and I really enjoy experimenting with each character's stat.Overall, this is a great game but the port is quite poor. The music for some reason is ported poorly and that is the main highlight of this game so if you do pick this game up,do something about it.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII seems to exist in a crossroads. The game is either loved by fans or dismissed as being not of Final Fantasy norm. Due to some changes in its core mechanics and its reliance on much more realism in the characters and worlds compared to other Final Fantasy games of the era, many prefer its predecessor Final Fantasy VII or its successor Final Fantasy IX that utilize more fantasy driven environments and characters. Final Fantasy VIII however is a title not to be missed by any story afficianado or RPG enthusiest. The story is of top notch quality and the depth to which you will find yourself emersed is unparallel.Having purchased and completed Final Fantasy VIII twice on the original PlayStation I decided to purchase it again to relive one of my favorite games of all time on the PC with its slightly better visuals and increased resolution.  I still have yet to play a game with as much emotional connection to the characters as this game did back in 1999. The controls are a little awkward and take time to get used to but other than that the game as a whole has been running flawlessly for me. Load times are MUCH faster as compared to the PlayStation version, and the sounds are intact with no glitches for me. If you’ve never played the game before, you’re in for a ride that you won’t forget.			"

												Finally!! A chance to do all the things I was either too young, stupid or impatient to do all those years ago! Time to hunner per cent this bad boy!In my opinion the best Final Fantasy out there. There are easily obtainable mods to rectify the music issue some people have with the game.Unfortunately the controller / keyboard layout is non customisable and confusing initially, making it hard to use Zells limit break or do the train mission in Timber.Being able to play Chocobo World and get Boko levelled up and acquire the rare items / GFs that come with it is great. I didn't know about this playing the PS1 version.All in all it's just amazing to be able to play through this adventure again with the added bonus of Steam Achievements for that extra satifsaction and ""tick-box"" feeling.

												While it's no Final Fantasy VII (Yeah, I'm one of those guys...) I have to say that 8 ranks number 1 for story line.  True, many dislike the way magic was handled in this title, but if you can swallow the drawing and stick for the story, it's well worth it.If you're a Final Fantasy fan, you don't need a review to decide.  If you're just entering the franchise, I reccomend Final Fantasy 7 (Also on Steam).  Try that one first, if you like the mojo of that game you'll enjoy this one too.			"

												This is probably my most played game of all-time, and definitely my second favorite game of all-time. This is arguably the most devisive Final Fantasy game ever made among fans, but I am a huge proponent of the game myself. Drawing magic was a huge bothersome chore, but the rewards paid off well enough. Squall was a jerk, but was surrounded by a well-rounded cast that pushed him towards likeability enough that you ended up rooting for the guy anyway. The storyline was a bit of a mess, and probably quite a bit underdeveloped overall. Many huge plot points were never made entirely clear, so it ended up being equally fun to try to piece together certain things, and yet incredibly frustrating because you were never sure if you were right or just grasping at straws (and because certain revelations, like Squall's parentage, could've had huge ramifications that were instead sort of just hinted at and never really dealt with outright). Still, despite its flaws the game is a masterpiece of the PS1 JRPG era, simply because of its breadth, its world, and even its outstanding music.This new release isn't perfect, but hunting out a few mods does make the PC release a bit more interesting. While I love the original PS1 score, hearing orchestral music playing in Balamb Garden is certainly very, very cool (you can also just go with the original PS1 score). Sharpening up the details of the pre-rendered backgrounds and Triple Triad (AKA the best card game in a single player game ever made) is pretty awesome, too. FFVII has a huge crop of mods readily available that made the game look and sound and play a whole lot better. FFVIII isn't there yet, but hopefully it will be someday. And hey, if you don't want to spend hours upon hours of drawing, you can at least save quite a bit of time with SE's own Magic Booster. Sure, it feels like a bit of a cheat, but if you've played the game before than there's really no reason not to. I'd rather spend more time playing Triple Triad anyway.			"

												An (almost) direct port of one of the greatest PS1 games. I'll break this up into three sections:Overall gameplay:Final Fantasy 8 continues the trend of the ATB gauge but with a few alterations:Magic is no longer reliant on MP, but is stocked like an item by drawing it from either draw points hidden around the world, or from enemies. The 'junctioning' system is an unusual beast: It requires you to equip a summon (called Guardian Forces or GFs for short.)Junctioning a GF allows your character to use more commands than just 'attack', such as items, magic, and the 'GF' command that allows you to call upon a junctioned GF to aid you in battle.Junctioning also allows you to allocate magic to stats. For instance, you can increase your physical or magical damage by junctioning a fire or thunder spell to that stat.Weapons aren't purchased or acquired frequently, but require you instead to find weapon magazines which will list parts needed to remodel your current weapon into a more powerful model. Weapons also allow for more limit breaks for your characters. Most limit breaks are semi-controlable, allowing you to use certain inputs to boost damage or the like. Summary- Very enjoyable, but the junctioning and magic drawing system may be daunting to those who aren't used to it. Story: You are a student at the military academy - Balamb GardenEarly in the game, you learn of the tyrannical president of the neighbouring region - Galbadia - and his plans for domination and war. As the story progresses, you find that it goes much deeper than a president gone mad with power, and will fight to save the integrity of the world as you know it. The main character; Squall, is a steriotypical loner. However, his dullness is counterbalanced by the colourful cast of allies that fight at his side. Summary- Interesting story, good characters, will get you very engrossed... Until you get stuck and need to go grind, typical of most RPGs. Port Quality - If you're like me, and love your old favourite games, you would want them to be just as enjoyable as you remember. This is where there are a few hitches -If you've played the game before, the first noticeable difference will be the music quality. It has been very dulled down from the original PS1 version. This can be easily fixed with a mod, but shouldn't have been an issue in the first place. The next is SFX.For the most part, the SFX is the same, however, much of it has again been stripped and dulled down, most noticeable with the summoning animation of Quezacoatl. Unfortunately, I can't find a fix for this and have had to just grit my teeth and bear with it. My final gripe is that even though there is controller support, there is no omni-directional movement, making navigation difficult because you can only move in four different directionss, and the in-game tool-tips don't change their text if you have re-assigned the buttons. For instance, if you have re-assigned 'B1' and 'B2', the game text will still read what the default setting was. Summary- Overall port quality is poor. The graphics and gameplay have remained consistant, but there are many issues. These wouldn't be such an issue if they weren't so prominant. Overall, I'd give this a game a 7/10.  It is very, very enjoyable, despite its faults.			"

												This is still one of my favorite Final Fantasy games, and the PC benefits over the PS1 are pretty nice. I love the ability to speed up the cinematics to 60 fps, which make the scenes look fantastic, although everything is moving at twice the speed, thus making it a much shorter cutscene, which is the closest thing to being able to skip it. But if you've already sunk hundreds of hours into it before, then it's definitely worth checking out, especially when it's on sale. If you havent played it before, its still definitely worth the money. The cutscenes still look good (for the time they were released, especially) and the overall game doesn't look too shabby compared to others from its time. The ability to summon GFs  (basically pets) and unlock loads of skills for then as well as everyone in the party is awesome. The magic/GF/Ability junction feature is also one of my favorite implemented systems, making it much easier to help overcome more powerful opponents once you've gotten used to utilizing it. Only downside to that is that you constantly need to stock magic in order to keep your stats as buffed as possible, which can take awhile and becomes a bit tedious. But overall, the mechanics are very smooth and simple. The story is very well done too. It's enough of a driving factor to keep people who may not like grinding very much to stay interested, although there's no journal or anything of that nature to keep you focused on where to go next, which may become a problem if you decide to stop playing for a while and resume later. That's one of my only real problems with this game. Most adventure/open world games have some sort of journal or objective list in case you forget where you're supposed to go next, or at least who to talk to. That aside, I'd still highly recommend this game to just about anyone who loves the old school RPG style of game play with some unique mechanics and a good storyline.TL;DR Buy this game. It's a great part of the FF series.			"

												Final Fantasy VIIIRPG-Developed by SquareSoft / Square EnixYear 1999/2000 The Story  8/10You are Squall Leonhart an orphan and SeeD of Balamb Garden. SeeD is a mercenary group trained to fight the sorceress. You awake in the hospital wing after your training session with your fellow student Seifer. As your progress you go on your final exam to become a SeeD and be deployed around the whole world. Your first mission helping out a resistance faction. Sets you on a course that will change the entire world.Grahpics 7/10The graphic are better than Final Fantasy 7 fewer blocky textures. More movies they transition seemlessly between gameplay. The way monsters die is cool. Some will turn of stone or explode. Most just fall over and die I like that more than them turning red and dissappering like in Final Fantasy 7.  There are graphics mods that will improve the game if you can install them.Music 0/10  after JunkyBiggs music mod 10/10The music on this release of the game is poor... not of worry though it's a simple fix after you install the game just replace the muisc files with the converted ones thanks to JunkyBiggs. It takes less then 1 mintue to do this. Just look in the Guides section you will find his and many of music mods there.The music in the game is amazing all the songs ""Eyes on Me"" The Man with the Machine Gun"" those are my favorites. The opening theme ""Liberi Fatali""  The battle theme ""Don’t Be Afraid"" and the nice ""Waltz For The Moon"" all amazing. The songs all fit and game and fit what you are doing at the time.Gameplay 10/10The gameplay I love as it makes you have to think about what you are doing. In Final Fantasy 8 the monsters all level along with your party, Their level is ramdonly decided as a few levels higher or lower than your average current partys level. If you had say Squall at level 100 and Zell at lvl 8 than monsters you run into would be from lv60-80. Summons or Guardian Forces / GF The GF play a major rule as they allow you to junction. The Junction system allows you to junction magic to your stats to makes yourself more powerful. Monsters do not level with your GF. It's really the base of the game it's easy to figure out and the in game tutorials explain it very well. The animations for the GF can become repetitive over time. Otherwise I really like this system myself it's fun and allows you to play the whole game without leveling at all.Money / GilYou are paid in this game based on your SeeD rank. Your SeeD rank is really based off of how many monsters you kill. There are a few other times in the story where doing your job right will up your rank but, not many. What I didn't like about this is that your rank falls after a short time. There are tests you can take to up your rank they as well. Making money becomes very, very easy once you get GF tonberry. So don't worry about money after you get him and train him you will never run out of funds.Chocobo WorldMake sure you start using this as soon as you get boko from your first forest. Boko will make getting items very easy. Do not start chocobo world while Boko is set to Home. You will gltich the game and have to start over with a new boko. Just remeber to close chocobo world bring him home get his items and send him back before opening it agian. I'll save you some time the best ID is in fact ""211"" use the do over button till you get ID 211 it'll make the game much easier as boko will be a total pwnage machine.The Card Game Triple TriadI found triple Triad to be fun not challanging though. You are providing with cards of insane power by the time you get the GF brothers. Don't mix rules as they are very hard to get back to normal. The game is played on a 3x3 size board. You and your npc opponent start by selecting 5 cards and using the number rating and rules to flip and cards placed down. It's very simple and enjoying as long as you don't mess up and rule system. I'll say this again do not ever mix rules!Chocobo ForestsI didn't like how they used chocobos in this final fantasy. After 7 had such fun with them all you can do in this one is ride them around the map. I would have liked to have had another race track or something along those lines sadly chocobos fall short in this game. I give the Chocobo Quest in this game a 3/10 it was boring. I give this game a 8/10 I recommend you play it if you love RPGs			"

												While it may not be the best in the Final Fantasy series, FF8 holds a big place in my heart. This is the first time I've played the game, so I'm not speaking with feelings of nostalgia here.Gameplay: Initially, I was turned off. The Junction system wasn't something I was used to. MP doesn't exist here with magic being a consumeable item. It's just something you draw from enemies or synthesize. I rarely casted magic against monsters and used it as a stat upgrade, which left a bad taste in my mouth. Eventually though, I learned to like the system. Once you get the hang of it, it's like a fact of life that you don't put much thought on. It's also easy to power up your party, making this one of the easier FF games.Sidequests: Not a lot. Plus most of the sidequests are not difficult to accomplish. They are just time-consuming. To note a few challenges, there's a Steam achievement called ""Contrived Victory""; you may have to play through the game a second time. Card collecting is also a big hassle.Story: I really enjoyed the story even if it was presented in a confusing manner. For a game that had schools training teen soldiers, warring factions, and a time compression scheme by a corrupt sorceress, I didn't feel the gravity of the world's situation until the middle of Disc 3. That's just something funny to observe. You could tell that the game's theme was about friendship and love being the most precious thing that surpasses past, present, and future. Cheesy but endearing. (Squall and the gang are #squadgoals; Laguna and the gang are #squadgoals)Music: Memorable. There are strong pieces in the game that you will download and listen to on repeat. They go very well with the various places scattered in the world. My favorite scene was when ""Compression of Time"" started playing. To me, that will always be an iconic moment in the game.(Just make sure to replace the bad steam port music with the orginal PS1 version!!! It makes the gaming experience significantly better!)All in all it is highly-reccommended you play FF8. The whole game plays like a sentimental memory because time is what brings this whole game together. There's a lot to be had in FF8 that will give you a great experience despite its' imperfections.

												Final Fantasy VIII is my all time favorite RPG. Why? Because it's one of the first video games I ever got into, so naturally I have some sentimental value. That being said, I'll give as unbiased of a review as I can on this game.StoryThe story of Final Fantasy VIII is somewhat strange and can be hard to follow at times, but, it's Final Fantasy. I wouldn't consider any of the games normal story wise. I find the characters to be very individual and personable. While Squall does start out as somewhat cynical and brooding, you, as the player, slowly watches him grow and develop into a new person in a very natural way. Not to mention he has one of the most badass weapons ever created, though it's nowhere near as interesting as Selphie's comically large nunchaku that everyone is just kind of okay with.GameplayA lot of people gripe about the system in VIII. Truth is, you aren't understanding it. If you think you have to sit for hours and draw magic from random monsters, you aren't playing the game right. Learn the system inside and out and you can make absolutely insane characters. I tested just how strong you could go, and ended up soloing most of the game with Selphie. More so, the battle system is fun, and a little bit more interactive than just hitting Attack over and over again. The GF's (Summons) are powerful, and completely infinite use, and the center of the whole system. While the animations for the GF's can be somewhat long, if that doesn't bug you, it can make for pretty epic battles visually, with respects to when the game came out. Magic works like Ammo, with no MP system, and you can obtain more through various ways. There are a lot of extra abilities you can learn as well, which can help specialize each character.VisualsAgain, it's a PSOne game, and while the character models recieved a nice upgrade, the field took a pretty serious hit. I honestly have no idea why they couldn't upgrade everything on a PC but I'm not gonna complain too much. The art of the world is very sci fi and quite beautiful in my opinion. There is a lot of realism, which both characters and field. While a bit futuristic, it's very believable to see these towns as places that could actually exist (barring Esthar).AudioUnfortunately, all the music in the PC version of this game is in the MIDI format. It's not nearly as good as the original soundtrack, but if you can get over that hump, it's still the same music, just crappier quality. There are ways to patch it if you really want to, but it doesn't bug me enough to want to change it. Oddly enough about 90% of the sound effects stayed the same. There are some minor differences, most notable in Quezacotl's summon sequence, but for the most part, they are all the same. Force Your Way will forever be my single most loved video game song ever.BugsSo far, I haven't encountered any serious bugs. If you tab out of the game, sometimes all of the music will stop playing, which is weird. Incredibly weird. Final Fantasy VIII with no music makes for an odd and awkward experience. Everything just kind of feels... empty.OverallI would highly recommend this game to anyone really. Hell, I bought this game for a good chunk of people for the holidays. If you are an RPG fan, give this a shot. It might just be your next favorite.			"

												One of my personal favorites, arguably as good as 7. Glad to own this again, worked great on my comp no problems. All the people complaining about graphics issues/crashing must have have pre 2008 comps or something. Triple Triad is the best mini game ever. Very addicting.Squall (MC) is kinda minimilistic and stand offish but the side characters make him shine. You'll be quickly lost in this story and will forget about the at times fustrating junction system (more difficult than 7's matieria). Even this system is so unique that it makes this game stand apart from other FFs.			"

												Final Fantasy 8 is the best RPG game I've played. It was incredibly fun when I first played it on the playstation 1 and for a game that was released in 1999, it definitely lives up to today's expectations in terms of quality of gameplay and cinematic beauty. The cutscene's are simply beautiful and the storyline is entertaining enough to keep you occupied for hours, making this RPG truly replayable. The mini card game bundled into this game is a nice bonus, that coupled with the steam achievements makes this old classic a real steam RPG of 2013. "

												Alright. Here's my obligatory review. I've played this game too many times to count, and I'm just as grateful to have it here as ever. Yeah, there are some sound issues. They're all midi's of somewhat low quality. Additionally, from what I can tell, Renzokuken slows framerates just a little. Finally, control settings aren't the best.

												It's the same game it's always been, so it's impossible to do anything but recommend it.  Granted, the music is still the awful tinny PC Midi soundtrack, but as with VII, Square-Enix will fix this (i'm more surprised people didn't complain at the classic Doom releases retaining it's PC soundtrack, instead of including, or perhaps even giving the option of, the far more creepy and atmospheric PSX soundtrack, but hey, PC gamers are a funny lot at the best of times :p)Anway, none of this takes anything away from the fact that 14 years on, this is still not only one of the best FF titles, but one of the RPG's ever made.  Definitely recommended!			"

												This is a must have game.  If you've played the Final Fantasy Series, especially #7, then you'll enjoy this game...but you won't rave about it.  Why?  Because everyone who has, raves about 7.  Well let me tell you something.  I played 8 before 7 and yes, 7 was good.  But 8 is far better, graphics are irrelevant, the characters feel more alive in 8, they're easier to connect with.  And above all, you feel sorry for every single one, this includes the evil characters!  This game humanizes the characters, you feel their sorrows, triumphs, defeats.  The storytelling does it all, beginning with that first spar before the Seed Test...good luck and have fun all.  I know I am! :)			"

												Does this game even needs a review ? What are you doing reading review for one of the best jrpg ever made, just play it.I'm not gonna compare this FF to any of its predecessors, or any of its successors, it is one of the greatest, and that shoud suffice.- Turn-by-turn combat- Impressive summonings (called G-Force in this game, Nvidia didn't invent anything, I tell you)- Nice story (if you like those J-RPG stories - I do)- Cliche characters (You'll find them in pretty much all the FF)- Amazing cinematics. I mean, even for an old game, the cinematics are still awesome.And the most important point: Triple TriadThis is a card game you can play with many NPCS in the game, it is AWE-SO-ME!It's nerve wracking, the rules change from one game to another depending on who you met in the game and who you played against. You get the strongest cards by fighting other players, and sometimes you even loose your own cards and you go home your head lowered in shame !I have no idea why you even bothered reading this far, if you ever wanted to try Final Fantasy, or if you enjoyed any of the great ones (I'm looking at you FF 6 through 9) and are still wondering about this one, stop: just buy it.Honestly, for 15$/€ you still get more playtime than most 60$ latest RPG you might find on the market. At least the ones that won't scar you forever (ain't that right, Dark souls?).			"

												Much akin to the steam verison of VII, the port runs perfectly. Improved character models are good, more so than VII's, and comes with the pocketstation game chocobo world if you want to make your already overpowered characters absurdly more so by wiping and re-customizing all your GFs with the items you can net yourself in that.Major drawback of this port is that unlike VII, they didn't fix the music so you're stuck with lower quality MIDI versions unless you mod it. As far as I know they haven't fixed this and likely don't plan to, so mods to the rescue.			"

												At first, this game took me a while to get into due to the strange magic and stat system as well as the general world of the game, but I ended up surprising myself by how likable it ended up being.In this game, you can gather magic spells from enemies via battle command, and then recast the spells, or equip them onto your stats to make them increase. This felt like a very weird system, having to gather and collect spells just to cast them later, as well as how slow you'd gather the spells. I later learned that the higher your magic stat, the faster your magic gathering would become, and I also learned that magic generally wouldn't be used a lot in normal combat anyways, so you'd rarely touch your huge pile of magic spells unless a boss or healing.What really makes me like this system is equipping the spells to your stats, since the more magic you have of that type you're attaching to a specific stat (maximum 100 stack of any spell), the higher boost that stat would recieve. It also takes into account what kind of magic is being placed onto the stat, so placing something like... haste onto your speed stat would give it a massive boost. Casting spells equipped to your stats would cause that stat to lower, due to a smaller stack being there now, so you might end up finding a use for many spells you'd never even give the chance in other FF games.I've personally only played FF4, 5, 6, and 7 (as well as this game), but I find this manages to be my second favourite, even beating out games I have a nostalgic feeling for. A well-written and interesting story, wonderful soundtrack (even though I think this port has a different one, but I haven't heard the original), and a cast of characters I ended up warming up to the same as the protagonist. If you haven't played this, I strongly recommend you give it a try if you're into ""turn-based"" RPGs, since it was a wonderful experience for only $12.			"

												Ok, FF VIII is one of my favourite games from the FF franchise. Awesome story, nice grafik, stunning CG. One of the importent things in this game is the soundtrack.

												I'd review this game with some real effort, but the very thought of writing about that ♥♥♥♥ing card game drives me mad. So I'm not going to. Go ahead and downvote this if you wish.Another PC port of a PS1 classic that is pretty much the same as it was back then. Get this on sale if you didn't play it before or if nostalgia dictates that you try it again. Or because you want achievements. Whatever reason best suits you.Though you do need to mod the game to get the correct soundtrack, which is really annoying. If the review system here wasn't so binary i'd give this a ""maybe"" for that reason alone. This is just a cash-grab by Square-Enix.			"

												After FF7 I was rly excited to play FF8 on steam after unbelievable 15 years :D I remember having loved this game and I was curious what I would think about it after so many years.As in all Squaresoft (Square Enix) RPGs you can spend A LOT of time playing this game and some sidequests are rather annoying but if u dont ant to play them then just dont :)The game itself isnt rly difficult...well obviously it depends on your characters skill but I got through without any big problems. Though there are some tough enemies which you dont have to kill but u will feel great after defeating them.Again the battlesystem is quite goood. You should speed it up in the menu though then u wont have to wait ages for each character to have a go. Magic isnt used by junctioning special materia to your character like in FF7. Here u have to collect the spells. U can either draw them from enemies or refine them (quickest way is refining them). U will have access to the open world pretty fast and can go exploring. Story takes place in pretty calm and colourful world. You can use magic for the battles and have the possibilty to summon Monsters to help you out. You are a soldier of SeeD a special force who fights against witches. Yeah... witches... but luckily not the medieval witches :D They r just mean rly mean women with exceptional power who always want more... (sounds familiar?). Main focus, next to saving the world, is the rather complicated relation between the main character and one of his clients. Yes! This is an epic lovestory :DThe characters can be annyoing from time to time but after long speeches u will be rewarded with awesome cutscenes :D All in all I enjoyed playing the game after 15 years and it is the second best RPG Squaresoft (Square Enix) has developed :D			"

												As someone who had never played Final Fantasy 8, this game is fantastic on the first playthrough. It breaks the mould of other Final Fantasy games, especially with Triple Triad (very addicting card game) and the drawing of magic. I didn't mind spending hours drawing magic or grinding for one card, because the game makes it feel very fulfilling. 100% recommend!			"

												I don't normally leave reviews, but I feel that I need to try and readress the balance slightly with FFVIII as it seems to be getting quite negative feedback. Most of the bad reviews seem to focus on one issue, that being the MIDI sountrack. Having being a huge fan of the game since it was released in 1999, in fact it's one of my favourite all-time games, I can honestly say that the soundtrack issue really isn't an issue at all. It takes a little getting used to, but after an hour or so of play I hardly noticed the difference at all and it takes nothing whatsoever away from the gameplay. I really don't see what the fuss is about. It's a good port of a great game.			"

												I bought FFVIII on PS1 when I was a kid, and I was very disappointed that it wasn't FFVII. Since 7 was my first FF, it was hard to let go. That said, I thought I would try it again, as an adult and see how I feel.It was still a little hard for me to get into, but once I did, I really liked it.Again the port feels a little sloppy, as per usual, but there are no deal breakers here for me, and I am a fan.

												Why I like Final Fantasy VIII more than most: (Warning contains major spoilers to the plot)1 - The music. Sure every Final Fantasy has a few good songs out of their soundtrack, but Final Fantasy VIII, almost every other song is excellent!2 - The Characters. Yes, sure most say that Final Fantasy VIII has the weakest character selection and is a cliche. And the student/teacher relation plot is overused. But it's not the relationship, it how you relate to them. Everyone can be like Squall; quiet, sticks to themselves, and puts themselves first. Say you don't have any of those qualities, I dare you! If Squall isn't you then you must be Zell (Jock) or Irvine (Playboy)?3 - The Secondary Plot Line. Sure, I'm not big on the whole war thing... But hear me out. It's not really about fighting the sorceress from the future who corrupted the sorceresses of the past and today. Well, it kinda is. But the back plot is: As much as Squall looks quite on the inside, he really want's acceptance. Most orphans are like that; stick to themselves because they don't want to get hurt again. 4 - The Story. Now I'm going to the primary plot line. Squall is a SeeD (a mercenary) who's sole job is to defeat the Sorceress Edea along with the other SeeD cadets to ultimately gain peace. Though the story to Final Fantasy VII was a bit better... But this is about VIII! But then... Squall finds out that Edea is/was the lady in charge in the orphanage (What a twist!) along with the other party members, they all were orphans together (except Rinoa) And now Squall want's the Sorceress to live. Fights her hoping for the best, then Rinoa gets possessed. Later in the game, he will forgo all he knew and lived by if Rinoa wasn't cured and become a Sorceress' Knight. That's what makes this story so compelling and an emotional journey. The emotion put in this game is stronger than VII.5 - The Side Quests. Triple Triad was the best side quest out of every Final Fantasy. Sure Final Fantasy IX had a card game... But there were no REAL rules or at least none that were explained in depth. In VII you could raise Chocobos which was fun to a point, but very repetitive! The card game in VIII if you got one of Quetzalcoatl's abilities you could mod the cards into items. That made getting a perfect 100% hard!6 - Sis, come back to me... I'm all alone (Ellone). She is the key to the whole game. She doesn't get much screen time. But is a very key character! She takes Squall and gang to 'The Dream World' where they see through Laguna, Kiros and Ward's eyes. To understand the sorceress and what went on before the war. But that wasn't really her motive. Her motive was to make Uncle Laguna stay with her. This is where Rinoa comes into play. Laguna was madly in-love with a singer at a bar named Julia. And Julia's song 'Eyes on Me' (voiced by Faye Wong. That song makes me want to cry...) was all about Laguna. But since Laguna kept getting called all over the world (since he was a soldier and all) she married another, General Caraway. Even though her last name is Heartilly (Presumed to be Julia's last name). So that would make Laguna a very key part in the story... Well he is! He put a stop to Sorceress Adel (Though... Adel looks like a man...). But I guess where I'm going with this point is: Knowing the past, is the key to the future. He then became the President of Esthar (who was the very enemy when he was a Galbadian Soldier). All in search of his little Elle. Ellone was searching for Laguna, whilst he did the same. Well, I can go on-and-on on how perfect Final Fantasy VIII is, but I won't. I'm probably boring you all to tears. Well I guess ""It's like killing two pigs with one stone. I'm just so awesome... Genius, I tell you..."" ""Pigs? I think you mean birds."" Well no... I was just trying to get a point across! Final Fantasy VIII is one of the most unappreciated Final Fantasies of all time!			"

PC Port ReviewThis is a re-release of the original PC port from 2000.GameplayIn terms of gameplay, original glitches and exploits are still here. The game itself however is not fully representative compared to it's PlayStation version, read below for more info.Controls- Xbox 360 controller is supported.- Cannot use dpad or triggers (bumpers work, but not triggers.) - Due to lack of triggers, clicking the thumbsticks is used to escape from battles.- Original game has rumble support, this does not.- Very playable, but does not perfectly emulate the PlayStation version.- Keyboard support only.- No mouse. - Not all keys are bindable.- Binding other keys like Enter, Tab, CTRL, Spacebar, etc. is possible but requires trial and error.- Playable to a certain extent.Controls note: In-game control prompts are also buggy with misplaced buttons or displaying the keys NONE if you manage to bind certain keys like tab, enter, shift, ctrl, spacebar, etc. This will lead to certain sequences like entering passwords for the train napping sequence being harder than usual and possibly lead to a game over screen.GraphicsPros:- Can be played in a higher res compared to PlayStation version.- Models do not look as jagged compared to PlayStation.- Character models are much more sharp in this version and look decent for a PlayStation title.- FMVs (while compressed) have aged pretty well.Cons:- Game battles are locked in at 16FPS, world map at 30FPS.- World map framerate is good, but looks HORRIBLE with blurry textures.- Pre-rendered backgrounds while upscaled are very pixelated.- Would recommend playing on a TV or a Window for those that do not like pixels.Graphics note: While the game has a ""widescreen option"" I would highly recommend playing the game in its original 4:3 aspect ratio with your regular screen resolution, playing this game in widescreen will only stretch the image and make it look worse. Edit: The world map looking horrible is due to a glitch that reduces the textures to it's lowest quality when bringing up the menu, going into a battle or a town fixes this. I have also noticed a major FPS drop when summoning the GF Eden and going up against the final boss. My PC itself meets the requirements and should not be an issue.SoundThis game DOES NOT have the original PlayStation soundtrack and uses the original PC Midi mix which does not compare to the original PlayStation soundtrack, would HIGHLY recommend using third party mods to fix this as it is very easy to find and implement. Some original sounds are changed or missing but not a major distraction.Would I recommend this?Yes but with CAUTION! Soon after downloading the game I had to:- Install third party mods to make it closer to the PlayStation version.- Rebind controls in notepad which took time due to using number codes for each key and actions not being labeled correctly.- The game also minimizes when first launching, very annoying when playing on TV with Big Picture mode.I am enjoying playing Final Fantasy VIII on PC, but first time setup is a pain and should not be necessary.Edit: also Triple Triad is a good game.

												Final Fantasy VIII is a game that peaks my list of favorite games. It also will go down in history as a huge source of debate on all of its innovations, story, game play, and graphics. The one thing that all of it's passionate fans will agree on is how great this game is. With in the sea of criticism and broken theories to make since of what's going on, all of us found ourselves comming back to it. Is that not what a great game is all about? Being able to come back and re-live the joy it handed to us the first go around? If we find ourselves going back, who are we to not reccomend this to anyone else? Sure the steam version has it's flaws but it still contains the heart of FFVIII. This is a game everyone should enjoy. It's not getting easy to just go buy the ps1 version of this game, and people willing to actually play this style of game are increasingly dwindling. Serisously if you are looking at reviews to decide rather or not to buy/play this don't let the people itching for nostalgia ruin your decision. If you can handle some grinding, turn based fighting, and a rich story line, this game is something you should delve into. As I said it may not be perfect, but there is a reason people keep coming back.			"

												A poor port but the game still is worth it.Reasons to buy:1) Achievements. Especially ""contrived finish"" which just makes you play the game in a totally different way. Such cool! WOW! But I guess some people can't be bothered with trophies.2) The Hi Speed (F1) option. Makes traveling back and forth a lot less tedious. I love it.3) Nostalgia. Yes, the game is as good as you remember.Reasons not to:1) The port is TERRIBLE. Espcially for music. Don't despair! Mods make up for it. I only grabbed the Music Replacement mod (Roses&Wine) and the mood was set, but if you want, there's a lot of graphics enhancers/texture replacement and whatnot. They make it equal or better than PS1 version. And Achievements still work!2) Buttons are very hard to set and remember on a controller (""enter code: B4 B2 B3 B4"" yaaaay). Still, it only bothered me on the Train mission and in the battle of the two Gardens, so not too bad.			"

												This is the ultimate love/hate game for me. I'll begin with the negatives. The junction system can be a chore to set up since you have to draw magic from enemies and casting it by the amount you have drawn instead of having the traditional MP (mana) system.  The story is pretty shallow and some characters just seem unnecessary. The soundtrack is pretty hit or miss. Lastly, the game can be pretty easily beaten by spamming Aura+GF combos from a certain point onward.Now with the good. Despite the rather shallow story, Squall and Rinoa's character development is pretty neat to watch unfold. Once your junctions are set up, the battle system can be pretty fun at times. There's plenty of fun sidequests and of course, there's the well known card game: Triple Triad. The game does have a certain charm to it and big part of it are the cohesive and well-timed cutscenes. The cutscenes were ahead of their time when this game was released and graphically still hold up very well. The final boss fight also rivals that of Kefka (FFVI) and Sephiroth (FFVII) in terms of epicness and challenge.To keep it short, this game is worth playing as long as you can accept it being very different from the traditional Final Fantasy game. Don't try to play through it as if you're playing VII or IX. Learn the junction system and use it properly. I've seen so many others try to play the game and end up not enjoying it because they didn't ever learn the junction system and played by just pressing 'Attack.' It's not worth getting if you're looking for a story that'll keep you wanting more. IV, VI, VII, IX, and X will provide much better stories than this installment. If you can accept its flaws, it can prove to be a good game with a certain whimsical charm to it and will provide you with plenty hours of playtime.			"

AUDIOOrchestral/StockVISUALDatedDIFFICULTYDifficulty LevelVIBEDream-likeCRAVINGClassic RPGON SALESeldomPROS: Nice graphics for its time, they haven't dated as poorly as FF7's, I'd think. Square account maintains your save, which is nice for a big game like this and happens instantly. Summons look great in this game, alongside the enemies and character attacks. I really like the story, despite its flaws. Pretty solid port, had no trouble getting my controller to work with it and did not run into any issues.CONS: The game itself is pretty broken. It is very easy to use exploit the system. Square Enix account may be seen as invasive, especially since Steam can back up your game for you. The menus are an absolute nightmare to navigate. The junction system hits you like a baseball bat to the head. You may spend a fair amount of the game stumbling through battles after giving up trying to understand some of the weird facets of the game.WORTH: This game doesn't go on sale very often. There are some big FF games planned for the next couple years though, so we may expect more bundles and discounts with this title. Still, all the new features of this digital copy were worth $12.00 USD for me!OVERALL: This is my favorite installment of Final Fantasy. Even though it's downright bizarre, it still manages to capture my interest. The sheer audacity of its strangeness leaves me a little stunned in its path. I have fun watching this game unfold. To me, it is like a dream. A weird, childish fever dream. A little immature in its writing, but fragmented from reality in the way a young, unstructured mind would be.SCORE: 9/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												What more is there to say. It is a re-release with very little changes, and some slight graphical upgrades, but only slight. Par for the course for Square Enix. Square Enix, you are reading this, please for the love of GabeN give these old ps1 titles a proper re-texture job please. Love them for their mechanics and story, but holy Cid could these use an update.Now if only they would release IX and X International on the PC. They can keep X-2 on the consoles though.  Square, if you do this, you have instant access to my wallet. Shameful i know, but there you have it.All in all, i give the game a 4/5. It's not my favorite of the series, but it is good none the less, and definitely worth the purchase if you have not played the games before. That being said. Square enix REALLY needs to start thinking about their customers who have already bought all the other versions, even the original PC releases of 7 and 8. For us, this is almost a worthless purchase other than to say we have it legally on PC. Why do i say that? Well, mostly because all of these ps1 title re-rereleases can be played on an emulator, and sometimes with better resolution and even sometimes some extra texture filters. These are things that not even Square enix bothers to deliver on.So, is this game worth a purchase. Sure. But understand that you really aren't getting much more than a quick re-release of an old game that already is playable in some other way, and in some cases, at even better quality. AND without having to log on to some server.........Just saiyan......			"

												The second best FF game ever released in my opinion (FF7 being the best). Story is amazing, cutscenes breathtaking, and gameplay impecable.The only ""problem"" with the PC version is the crappy audio quality installed by SquareEnix (it uses original PC version quality, not the PS1 quality). However a famous mod has been created called ""Roses and Wine"". Search steam forums for this VITAL addition. I put off playing the game for a whole year because of the music quality, but now I can finally play it again!			"

												This is absolutely the greatest Final Fantasy title ever made.It has the most touching story I have ever witnessed and has a huge complexity regarding the managing of your characters.Huge numbers of characters, spells, skills, commands, variety of combat, enemies and gameplay in general.The card game and the junctioning system probably consumed most of my play time but it also was almost the most fun to do.11/10 for the sheer awesomeness and of course the fitting soundtracks and the previously mentioned aspects.

Yes I reccomend this game to Anyone that lieks the Final Fantasy Series, The Originals that is. This game is turn based, and it comes in the format of somewhat of a romantic novel between a Soldier and a Faction Leader. I Highly reccomend that You take your time reading and please for your own sake DO NOT RUSH, you will miss out on a breath taking story and its world; And i do mean this DO NOT RUSH. This is my favorite Final Fantasy in the series, and yes i played 9, 10 , and reasonably 7 [i will get back to it]. Anyway here it goes:The Graphics.. don't give a damn about it, this isnt a remake is re-release of the game. Still love the original one on PS1The Audio: It was very interesting to hear the MIDI structure Nobuo Uematsu put together, I was able to tell how he approached the themes, and where he could have possibly had trouble playing. [ Check out EDEA's Theme i believe is called sucession of witches, or the sucessor. Also check out Balamb's theme you would hear a  dissonant sound from both themes. So from musician to musician it was very exiting to hear what the next track would sound like in MIDI :D. Though I like the MIDI version in its own way, the orchestrated versions of the OST is by far better, and i mean waaaaay better. The Gameplay: Turn based, OR NOT really. There is  ATB which is Active Time battle and you can basically bump this all the way up and it wont feel turn based. what this does is that it makes the battle waiting faster, and as you level up so do your sorroundings so it will be even faster! The magic in this game is not learned as an ability but drawn from Draw points and or monsters, and they do not take away any magic power, or MP, but they are stored in Quantities. To some this might be an abomination BUT to me this feels a bit interesting and maybe, challenging, because you will then learn not to waste magic, lets say you have for instance 10 curagas or 5 Meltdowns....ehheheh. you best use them wisely. I also love the Junction system because this gives the characters and the GFs more uniqueness, enough said. One con, and this is a big one for me, I DO NOT LIKE THE MAGIC BOOSTER, i think that takes away from the game, and also encourages people to cheat, which in my opinion  is a bad thing to do, because it takes away from the experience & who would want to cheat with such a good game? this turns off people. On a side note if they were to do more Final Fantasy remakes' they should add an option that Filters the graphics of these games, they arent demanding anyways, to give them different tones.. that would be very very very cool. I will highly reccomend this game , dont worry about what people say about this title, everyone has their own taste,10/10 - Personally.. Oh yeah & PLEASE IF YOU ARE A FF NEWBIEGO PLAY CLASICS LIKE THIS FIRST.			"

												Where do I begin? I've never been a huge fan of final fantasy with 8 being the only one in the series that I've beaten. To put it simply I love this game and it pairs up with Dragon Quest 8, another game by Square Enix that i absolutely love. I'll start off by saying Squall has to be one of the best characters I've seen in a long time and the character development of Squall over the course of FF8 is nothing short of spectacular. The love story is brilliant and anybody whos beaten the game and seen the ending you know how amazing it is. The reason I like Squall so much is that I can relate to him and being able to relate to the main protagonist of any game is a good thing. My favortie scene would have to be Squall and Rinoa on the ragnorak with the eyes on me theme song for the game playing. Truly beautiful scene.

												Ever since I was a kid, I loved playing this game, and still do to this day. Everyday before school, I would get up an hour before I had to leave, do some more of the story, come home, do my homework and spend the rest of the night playing Triple Triad. This game is easily my favorite game in the series, and always will hold that spot in my heart. I recommend this game if you do not have it, GET IT. It will be worth every penny you spend for it.

												Final Fantasy VIII is a game that peaks my list of favorite games. It also will go down in history as a huge source of debate on all of its innovations, story, game play, and graphics. The one thing that all of it's passionate fans will agree on is how great this game is. With in the sea of criticism and broken theories to make since of what's going on, all of us found ourselves comming back to it. Is that not what a great game is all about? Being able to come back and re-live the joy it handed to us the first go around? If we find ourselves going back, who are we to not reccomend this to anyone else? Sure the steam version has it's flaws but it still contains the heart of FFVIII. This is a game everyone should enjoy. It's not getting easy to just go buy the ps1 version of this game, and people willing to actually play this style of game are increasingly dwindling. Serisously if you are looking at reviews to decide rather or not to buy/play this don't let the people itching for nostalgia ruin your decision. If you can handle some grinding, turn based fighting, and a rich story line, this game is something you should delve into. As I said it may not be perfect, but there is a reason people keep coming back.			"

												A poor port but the game still is worth it.Reasons to buy:1) Achievements. Especially ""contrived finish"" which just makes you play the game in a totally different way. Such cool! WOW! But I guess some people can't be bothered with trophies.2) The Hi Speed (F1) option. Makes traveling back and forth a lot less tedious. I love it.3) Nostalgia. Yes, the game is as good as you remember.Reasons not to:1) The port is TERRIBLE. Espcially for music. Don't despair! Mods make up for it. I only grabbed the Music Replacement mod (Roses&Wine) and the mood was set, but if you want, there's a lot of graphics enhancers/texture replacement and whatnot. They make it equal or better than PS1 version. And Achievements still work!2) Buttons are very hard to set and remember on a controller (""enter code: B4 B2 B3 B4"" yaaaay). Still, it only bothered me on the Train mission and in the battle of the two Gardens, so not too bad.			"

												This is the ultimate love/hate game for me. I'll begin with the negatives. The junction system can be a chore to set up since you have to draw magic from enemies and casting it by the amount you have drawn instead of having the traditional MP (mana) system.  The story is pretty shallow and some characters just seem unnecessary. The soundtrack is pretty hit or miss. Lastly, the game can be pretty easily beaten by spamming Aura+GF combos from a certain point onward.Now with the good. Despite the rather shallow story, Squall and Rinoa's character development is pretty neat to watch unfold. Once your junctions are set up, the battle system can be pretty fun at times. There's plenty of fun sidequests and of course, there's the well known card game: Triple Triad. The game does have a certain charm to it and big part of it are the cohesive and well-timed cutscenes. The cutscenes were ahead of their time when this game was released and graphically still hold up very well. The final boss fight also rivals that of Kefka (FFVI) and Sephiroth (FFVII) in terms of epicness and challenge.To keep it short, this game is worth playing as long as you can accept it being very different from the traditional Final Fantasy game. Don't try to play through it as if you're playing VII or IX. Learn the junction system and use it properly. I've seen so many others try to play the game and end up not enjoying it because they didn't ever learn the junction system and played by just pressing 'Attack.' It's not worth getting if you're looking for a story that'll keep you wanting more. IV, VI, VII, IX, and X will provide much better stories than this installment. If you can accept its flaws, it can prove to be a good game with a certain whimsical charm to it and will provide you with plenty hours of playtime.			"

AUDIOOrchestral/StockVISUALDatedDIFFICULTYDifficulty LevelVIBEDream-likeCRAVINGClassic RPGON SALESeldomPROS: Nice graphics for its time, they haven't dated as poorly as FF7's, I'd think. Square account maintains your save, which is nice for a big game like this and happens instantly. Summons look great in this game, alongside the enemies and character attacks. I really like the story, despite its flaws. Pretty solid port, had no trouble getting my controller to work with it and did not run into any issues.CONS: The game itself is pretty broken. It is very easy to use exploit the system. Square Enix account may be seen as invasive, especially since Steam can back up your game for you. The menus are an absolute nightmare to navigate. The junction system hits you like a baseball bat to the head. You may spend a fair amount of the game stumbling through battles after giving up trying to understand some of the weird facets of the game.WORTH: This game doesn't go on sale very often. There are some big FF games planned for the next couple years though, so we may expect more bundles and discounts with this title. Still, all the new features of this digital copy were worth $12.00 USD for me!OVERALL: This is my favorite installment of Final Fantasy. Even though it's downright bizarre, it still manages to capture my interest. The sheer audacity of its strangeness leaves me a little stunned in its path. I have fun watching this game unfold. To me, it is like a dream. A weird, childish fever dream. A little immature in its writing, but fragmented from reality in the way a young, unstructured mind would be.SCORE: 9/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												What more is there to say. It is a re-release with very little changes, and some slight graphical upgrades, but only slight. Par for the course for Square Enix. Square Enix, you are reading this, please for the love of GabeN give these old ps1 titles a proper re-texture job please. Love them for their mechanics and story, but holy Cid could these use an update.Now if only they would release IX and X International on the PC. They can keep X-2 on the consoles though.  Square, if you do this, you have instant access to my wallet. Shameful i know, but there you have it.All in all, i give the game a 4/5. It's not my favorite of the series, but it is good none the less, and definitely worth the purchase if you have not played the games before. That being said. Square enix REALLY needs to start thinking about their customers who have already bought all the other versions, even the original PC releases of 7 and 8. For us, this is almost a worthless purchase other than to say we have it legally on PC. Why do i say that? Well, mostly because all of these ps1 title re-rereleases can be played on an emulator, and sometimes with better resolution and even sometimes some extra texture filters. These are things that not even Square enix bothers to deliver on.So, is this game worth a purchase. Sure. But understand that you really aren't getting much more than a quick re-release of an old game that already is playable in some other way, and in some cases, at even better quality. AND without having to log on to some server.........Just saiyan......			"

												Final Fantasy VIII, on steam, just as in 1999, fails considerably to equal its predecessor and yet still manages to be one of the best RPGs ever created. The graphics, in a different style, seem to have aged terribly on our HD monitors today. But this can take little away from the beautifully crafted world and pretty interesting (if rather unnecessarily confusing) storyline. Cards are still a blast to play and remain one of the best side-games to this day. Final Fantasy VIII is well worth another look on PC, although the mods are neither as plentiful nor as comprehensive as those for VII, this is perhaps also due to the fact that it was released much more recently. If you're looking solely for a nostalgia trip to 90s Final Fantasy, the 8th installment of the series is a very, very solid title, but I'd still always recommend its predecessor. 9/10. "

												A classic to play again.  The graphics have been improved upon, I'd say more but for those of you who played this when it was brand new, I will save the description so that you can see for youself.  A personal favorite of mine of all of the final fantasy story lines.  Game play seems a little simplified from the original game play version in that commands for the gunblade as well as other small functions in the game and it is enough of an improvement that it makes the game much kinder to a first time final fantasy player.  Final Fantasy is hard to get wrong, especially the originals but if you're new to the final fantasy experience I would recommend getting into it with these older versions as learning how the game works in these versions is easier and allows you to learn quickly when moving on to the newer versions of the game (you dont feel as lost when you know what you're doing).  Final Fantasy VIII's story line is one of the more light hearted ones so if you're looking for one that is feel good, this is one of the few.  I would recommend this game to any one and especially to RPG fans out there.  If you have not played it yet you really are missing out.  The game is fun, chok full of 90's jokes/referances and of course as with all Final Fantasy games, look forward to the grind ;).			"

												Having played this game when it first came out, I decided to go for the nostalgia bomb and try it on computer. I must say the designers (or whoever prepared this version) did a really nice job making the controls computer-friendly. As for the game itself, I love it. It's a great addition to the Final Fantasy series and allows you to tailor your characters any way you want. None of them have a predisposition for a type of activity (black magic, white magic, thief), so it's up to you to decide which stats they gain. I'm also impressed how well the graphics have held up. I suppose the resurgance of 8-bit homage games have helped, but it's always easy to tell how the characters are feeling. To me, that's such a great part of this game.			"

												To preface, this is now the third time I have bought FF8.  I own a disc version for PSX, a digital classics for PS3, and now this for Steam.  This rerelease is basically a very very minimially touched up rerelease of the original PC version.  Graphically it's mildly better, the audio sounds mildly worse (although I believe there are mods to get the psx audio installed,) and they have added cheating to help deal with the magic grinding.To anyone who has not played an PSX generation Final Fantasy (7, 8, 9) they're all worth the time to play through and generally all have their own faults.  FF8 is generally very easy to beat, but does require substantial grinding, so the built in ""Magic Boost"" is a nice touch to make the game a bit less of a chore.  In general, if you like JRPGs, give this one a shot.  For all of its plot holes and grinding, it's a game that offers quite a few hours of play for not a whole lot of money.  For me, its a trip down memory lane, one of my favorite childhood video games, and a reminder of what an emo kid I was back in 1999.			"

												Look, this was my first and favorite Final Fantasy. I love everything about the core game, the fighting system, Junctioning, GFs, the story, the music, the characters, all outstanding. Unfortunately this port leaves a lot to be desired. The music is subpar, tolerable but actually below PS1 standards, as it has the original PC port's MIDI tracks. Most of the music and sound isn't affected drastically but when you notice a difference it sticks out like a sore thumb, and music in Final Fantasy is one of the most important aspects of the experience. Without the Roses and Wine mod it's really not that great a port, and it has few good features that are new to the release. Maybe they'll patch the music like with 7, maybe they'll just make their money and be happy, but either way, if you can't tolerate the music being a bit worse than the original, it may not be for you. If you've never played FF8 or any Final Fantasy, well, you're missing out, and should seriously consider picking up this game.			"

												- I never had the chance to finish this game, until now. I liked. You can't compare with Final Fantasy VII, but still worth playing. Sadly, it lacks of real markable characters. There are some interesting fellas, but nothing too much special. Squall saves the game. His own conflits are very interesting. Kinda remind me a little of Cloud Strike. There is a nice romance (a little corny but I can live with that), an amazing soundtrack and a lot of cool missions. - The villains are useless, Seifer (Squall's rival) is useless, the mini-games are lame and I think they should have shown the secondary characters a little more on CG's. Plus, when I was fighting the last boss, the game ran pretty slow during almost half of the battle. Like lagging. I dunno if there's something related to the music mod that I installed. But it was only on that fight. 8/10			"

												Final Fantasy VIII is a wonderful throwback to the multi-disk, open world RPG's of the Playstation Era. It has an interesting (albeit somewhat convoluted) story, multi-dimensional characters that have compelling motivations behind their actions, and a world full of incredible environments and enemies.No game is without fault. The experience system of the game is flawed in that it actually rewards the player for NOT leveling up, and the Draw system (which allows you to stockpile enemy magic for junctioning) can become tedious at times, but with the inclusion of the Magic Booster modification and playing enough Triple Triad (the trading-card minigame within the FF8 world) you can bypass the more tedious parts of the game. Final Fantasy VIII, like any other Final Fantasy game, has 100+ hours of playability, is chock full of quests and side missions that take you around the world, into outer space, and deep, deep into the dark ocean depths. For veteran players looking for a nice piece of nostalgia or players who want to experience a classic RPG, Final Fantasy VIII is certainly a good buy.			"

												It was funny to see this again and it shows how old it is, but even so the fun is still there. However they do make you sign up unneccesarily, and you cannot change the music volume in windowed mode which is rather irritating. The magic booster was a nice touch and if you're looking to burn some time, well FF never fails! But don't use magic booster early on, it will just give you most of the powerful spells and you'll be way too overpowered at the beginning (if you junction right with GF). All in all, exactly the same, just a bit of fun 8) Oh and the card game, I LOVE YOU AND HATE YOU!			"

To everyone else, if you enjoy the old JRPG style gameplay, I, again, recommend this and even if you arnt a big fan of that style, the story alone is enjoyable.  While they have -not- upgraded the background, kept the original music files (yeah, it's a repeat of the FF7 release), nor adjusted the CG movies for widescreen, or done very little for resolution... the character models are MUCH better than the original blocky pixelated monstrousities of it's original release.  The big negatives for myself are the obvious music and horribly blocky background.  The positives are nostalgia and a great story with some fun old schoolish gameplay.  Hopefully the fans who enjoy making mods will make them (if they havnt already) to improve the negatives, should Square-Enix not do it.  Which they should.  Overall, worth it to fans of the series and to the old school RPG gameplay fans as well.			"

												This game is exactly the definition for the saying: ""Haters gonna hate, players gonna play!"".You love it or you hate it! Since it was released back in PS it had been always the subject of arguments (and comparison to FF7 mostly) for it's characters (Squall 's EMO - better nerf Cloud Strife and etc :P), its mechanics ( GFs- Junctions- Draw Command) and more. As a player who has played almost all FF game in the old generations consoles (from SNES to PS and later on to Android/DS versions and Onlines from FF XI - was in beta for XIV also) IMO is worth getting. The only minus is that thing with the sound which has these butchered midis but still its EPICNESS and AWESOMENESS levels are beyond 9999.			"

												Yay! Another game from my childhood released again for me to play. Nice story, fun characters. The magic system is kinda funny, you have to stock up on spells from monsters, and then you can slot them into your stats for stuff. Summons are back, same moogle time. Overall this game rates a 7.5 out of 10. Definitely worth the price tag, if you play for the story like I do.			"

												I think this game was well made for it's time. It has its ups and downs but the pros seem to outweight the cons for me.Firstly, graphics were pretty much ""make everything as 3D as possible"" and was a nice step up from simply having characters move around on a set background. One could easily tell from even simple places that they tried to put as much detail as possible into things.The cutscenes were rather nice for their time and if you pay attention near the end of Disc 1 (the parade) you'll notice the dance being done is very similar to Michael Jackson's Thriller dance. Another moment of hilarious in hindsight is a phrase Selphie tried to get going. ""Booyaka!"", guess which WWE wrestler would make that his catchphrase a couple of years later?The battle system was different and kept the game at a challenging level, almost everything (save for a few bosses with levelc caps) leveled up as you did. This could be good or bad depending on how skilled of a player you are. If you play it well enough you can pretty much level up quickly right after obtaining Siren (Life-RF skill yourself Zombies + Life/Full-Life and go fight some T-Rexuar).While keeping a low level is generally advised to keep the game easy, going to over level 40 as early as disc 1 can prove helpful by getting some of the best skills in the game to junction to your characters making the rest of the game a cakeqalk (Junction either 100 Quakes or Ultima to Attack and say good-bye to difficulty~).The music was excellent. Most of the music would fit the mood, although sometimes cheerful music would continue to play during times where it suddenly became very unfitting (nothing new there actually). The battle and boss music is what has always stuck out the most to me though, it always made me feel pumped and excited to keep playing the game.The GFs were also another fun factor, some had really humorous attack animations (Tonberry, Cactuar, or the Brothers) while others could be downright frightening or strange (Eden, Doomtrain, or Diabolos (imagine a giant dark matter sphere crushing you into nothing!)). The junctions and abilities they give are incredibly helpful. However I tended to always need to make one of them forget SumMagic 10% to add a more needed ability such as HP-J or the coveted and rare Ability - x4 (Rosetta Stones are very hard to come by and unless you can find more than the one at Ultimecia's Castle, only the person with Bahamut will get the full benefit).Overall, I think this game was great for it's time and while the Romance theme is a bit strong, the game managed to remain fun to me then and still does now. 8.5/10, would recommend to others.

												FFVIII is my absolute FAVOURITE Final Fantasy game of them all. It starts off a bit slow, but once you get into the plot and get used to the battle system, it can get really intense really fast. It's also a lot of fun to run around the world and fight extra bosses and upgrade weapons and, of course, play Triple Traid (once you understand the rules, of course). The plot is good, the animation is good considering when it came out, and the music is, as usual, perfectly written to suit the scenery and moments in-game.			"

												A lot of mixed opinions comr from FF8. The draw system, where you pull spells from your enemies and then equip them to your character, seems fairly devisive to most players. You either love it or hate it. I always loved it. You can become so poweful from simply maxing out the spells that you have equipped that you can win big fights just using the basic attacks.And of course, the card game. The card game that exists inside of FF8 is worth $12 alone.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII, on steam, just as in 1999, fails considerably to equal its predecessor and yet still manages to be one of the best RPGs ever created. The graphics, in a different style, seem to have aged terribly on our HD monitors today. But this can take little away from the beautifully crafted world and pretty interesting (if rather unnecessarily confusing) storyline. Cards are still a blast to play and remain one of the best side-games to this day. Final Fantasy VIII is well worth another look on PC, although the mods are neither as plentiful nor as comprehensive as those for VII, this is perhaps also due to the fact that it was released much more recently. If you're looking solely for a nostalgia trip to 90s Final Fantasy, the 8th installment of the series is a very, very solid title, but I'd still always recommend its predecessor. 9/10. "

												Okay, first off, I'm a fan of this game.If you read the other negative reviews, you'll see there are tons of bugs SE didn't fix. They are releasing FF9 this year, and FF8 is still trash. I feel like they just made an awful port and they made us pay for quality when my PS1 could do better. Unless SE fixes the issues, I'm heavily discouraging you and my friends to avoid this version of the game. It's frustrating in so many ways!- You can't use Zell's LB, even with an XBOX 360 controller, it shows B1, B2, B3...- Music is awful and requires mods- Graphics are worse than the ones on the PS1- Only cross directions, forget about the joystick- You can use Chocobo World, which is something you didn't have on the PS1 (most of us)			"

I loved all of VII, VIII, IX, X, XII and XIII coming soon XV. I just related to the world, which was more futuristic than fantasy, more than the others. The Draw system had it’s issues and although it doesn’t hold a candle to the Materia system in 7, the way you could bind spells to your stats was genius. Triple Triad was also very cool card game. And my order of liking those differs from most, though I hold VII most dear like most others too "

												Let me just get this out of the way, this game is fantastic. In fact I rate it higher than that other Final Fantasy that seems to get more attention. Maybe you agree with me or maybe you disagree but let me at least give you a couple of reasons that you shouldn't shy away from this gem. This game is unique and it is that same uniqueness that makes this game shine. Forget all the bad stuff people say about this game. Lets instead focus on the good that this game does.	Final Fantasy 8 did some wonderful things that no other FF title did. One of the most basic of JRPG principles, grinding battles. Well in short you don't need to really fight anything. I mean you can level up your charactors but there really isn't any real incentive to do it. For starters you are a student and you take a test early in the game. This test determines you pay or salary. Plus if you don't do so hot on the test you don't get a high salary. You can retake the test to do better and get paid more as well. So no need to really grind mobs for money as you get paid at regular intervals just like a job. I believe this is a plus as it allows for me to explore the world and without the need to stop and fight over and over. Also note, that bosses do not give out EXP at all. So theoretically, you could go thru the game at the starting level if you really wanted to.	So lets talk about the leveling system in the game, another plus to FF8's formula. The game uses a scaling system, which means the higher level you are the mobs scale to always give a challange of sorts. Which in every other game is a bad. I truely despise level scaling. It defeats the purpose of leveling to get stronger but this game bring a happy medium to play. FF8 intruduces the ""Junction System"". This entails a few things. One you ""draw"" magic from a couple of places. You can also ""draw"" from special points that refresh every so often to aquire more. You can ""draw"" from mobs as well. Now you can use these spells in battle which is fine, but let me say this game isn't really about magic as the other Final Fantasys. If there was a ""grind"" in the game its from drawing magic to aquire enough of it. So what is the point of magic if you don't really want to use them against mobs? Well as I was saying earlier, FF8 uses a ""Junction System"". This allows you to ""Junction"" magic to your main attributes. Your Hp, Mp, Att, etc. Doing this augments your abilites and makes you pretty damn strong. This is also how you overcome the level scaling to make your character stronger. You can level up but remember, mobs scale with you so this allows you to overcome this ""handicap"". If there is a ""grind"" in FF8, this is it. Which if you ask me, its far better ""drawing"" for magic than spending more time to grind for EXP for hours on end. I also told you that you could beat the game at the starting level. Which sounds bad but honestly beating the game at a lower level is way easier than a high level. Using the Final Battle as a reference, without spoiling, beating it at a low level was hard but certianly not difficult. But i will say beating it at max level was one of the most challenging battles I have ever done in a game before. It took me close to 2 hours to beat that battle. With the active battle and max level I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Note that it took me many of times to even succeed in doing this. It was simply a rewarding feat to acomplish. I can also atest to this being the hardest boss I have fought from any of the other Final Fantasy titles.	Some tweaks have been done to the actual battle system. The main charactor uses a weapon called a gunblade. In battle you can attack like you normally would with no problems. But it has another feature that allows for it to do more damage. If you press a certain button at the precise time, you will pull the trigger and shoot as you attack. This effectively adds more damage to your normal attack. It uses a turn base battle system that is active, which means you have to think fast on your feet. No planning your attack like chess for the best move, you have to be quick and do something or just keep getting attacked over and over. Some might see that as a turn off which I can understand just be aware its there. Summons are back in this game as well. They will be mighty helpful. They also learn abilites as well. Most noteworthy is the ""boost"" ablity. This allows you to push a button repeatedly to amplifiy the damage done. Its a nice to be able to do that but after the bazillionth time it will get old. Still to this day I would have like to have a final ablitiy to just do max damage without that button mashing marathon. Also the animations for the summons are top notch for its time. Truely amazing but some are really long and overdone, would have been nice to be able to skip them. Annoying yes, dealbreaker no.	  	Probaly the most agreeable positive about FF8 is its included ""card game"". Triple Traid is its name and it is crazy fun that I am suprised was never given its own game. It sorta starts out slow but as you collect more cards you really start being sucked into it grasp. I personally have logged into FF8 just to play the card game and nothing else. So simple, but yet so much depth and strategy. Traveling to new areas brings about new rules to the game. Some of these rules are good and some downright brutal. Also there are ""rare"" cards to win from certain people. Some you might only have one chance to aquire so maybe using a guide isn't a bad idea in this area.	To talk about the story would ruin alot of it. I won't mention it but I'll hit on a few high points. I kinda throws you right into the middle of everything and you'll feel like you understand what's going on. Then you'll go from knowing what going on to not having the slighest clue. That formula happens multiple times in this game. But each time it happens the story gets deeper and more seems to be happening. It gets dangerously close to being to long. When I first played this on the Playstation 1, I was  wondering what was on disk 4 for the longest time. Even when I was at the end of disk 3 I felt like I had done so much I couldn't believe there was still a whole other disk to run though. Although in hindsight, disk 4 felt almost out of place and to this day I still believe it was only that way because the amount of data on a cd-rom wasn't enough to do it the way it should have been. I works but only like hitting a foul ball 1 foot away from being a home run. 	Other worthy mentions are the locations. The cities are big and give a feeling of being alive. The music sets a nice tone to the atmosphere. Still some of my favorite music in the series, not that any really stand out but they fit the games vibe. They are rendered backgrounds but still beautiful to look at. Throughout the world you can use roads to navigate around. You also gain access to cars to drive around the overworld. These greatly help speed up travel times. There are a few other ways of travel but I don't want to spoil any crazy details. Although I will say the ""airship"" in this game is the freaking best of all the FF games. 	What else is there in FF8? Quite a bit more if you ask me. For one it feels more like a world than past Final Fantasy titles. Or maybe I should say a little more grown up. This game as a whole seems more mature. But its overall experiance that makes it shine. The story goes up and down. There are high points and low points. But you are doing yourself a disservice if you pass on this up. Final Fantasy 8 knows its not like the rest of the series and its proud of that fact. If you give it a chance, you might be pleastantly surprised that you wished played it sooner.			"

												Complain, complain complain. I bought this game knowing well about all of the petty and -completely stupid- warnings about ""Oh no the music quality is garbage"" and ""Oh no there's nothing different or special"" and the most infamous ""Oh no this game is so terrible because the magic system is different.""I bought this game as is with full understanding that it was going to at least be a smoother looking game with a couple of nice extras. I bought this game to play the game I remember as it stood. So please, shut the f*** up. Stop complaining about having to mod it to make it ""better."" Don't mod it, or don't play it. sit down, spend a few bucks and enjoy a game that obviously meant a lot to an entire generation of gamers. If I want high quality sound and non-pre-rendered backgrounds I'll go buy a brand new game that has a much worse story line, no replay value, is way over priced, horribly buggy and is barely worth the price that humblebundle -LETS- you choose to pay for it! This isn't some big time piece of corn lined golden sh**. This is nostalgia. This is a classic Playstation game. Deal with it or go have raging sex with a lion you ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII works hard to address a lot of the design issues present in the previous game - save points are present in better locations, the world map now has roads you can travel to avoid constant enemy encounters, the tutorials are detailed (in some cases too-detailed), the minigames are less frustrating.In saying that, the game is technically poorer than the PS1 version in terms of both visuals and audio. The soundtrack is good, but it's no FFVII, and the cheap midi sounds are jarring when compared to the PS1 version. The pre-rendered backgrounds have very low resolution, and the characters stand out starkly against the world around them. The greater articulation and realism given to the character models is a blessing and a curse - their gestures are much more varied and identifiable, but the stylised actions and humour of the characters clashes with the life-like designs. The cuteness of FFVII's characters allowed a sense of humour and slapstick that doesn't comfortably carry over into this more realistic design, and leaves some moments feeling awkward, as if the designers couldn't quite meet the goal they were aiming for. In contrast to FFVII, the game world opens up almost immediately, and rewards the player generously in terms of money. The 'Junction' system of battle is quite confusing to begin with, and may be prohibitively overwhelming for those with little patience, but once one learns the ins and outs of the system, the variation it allows makes the FFVII system feel like button-mashing child's play. The abolition of 'magic points', in favour of 'drawing' spells from the enemy and the environment is a refreshing change, and makes the battles feel less restrictive as you can more-or-less cast away to your heart's content, rather than constantly worrying about refilling the MP bar. One feature I don't quite like is effectively making the summoned Guardians a default attack - watching their stunningly cinematic (and lengthy) attacks is fun for the first few times, but gets really tedious after a while, to the point that I could set one attack for each character, and then surf the web while all the cinematics played. All in all, the gameplay is a noticable improvement over FFVII, although it comes a distant second in terms of audio-visual quality. Hopefully these issues are addressed at some point, but who knows. It doesn't kill the game for me, and FFVIII is much easier to pick up and play than its predecessor, but they are both worthy additions to the series, and were iconic games of their time.			"

												I always loved the way this game scaled to your level and rewarded you for understanding the draw and junction systems (you can truly be overpowered early on if you understand how to best use them) But beyond that I rather enjoyed the story itself and the way they framed more than one narrative via ""dreams"" through which the party experienced the history of other characters. Some dislike how easily the draw and junction system can be broken, but personally my view has always been if you do not want it broken... don't break it... and if you do then have at it. I found the game enjoyable doing runs of both those styles. Also of all the ""minigames"" Final Fantasy has given us over the years, Triple Triad is still my favorite... I honestly would have payed the price of this game just to play Triple Triad on my PC. So all in all I would definitely recomend this game to fans of the series, and doubly so to those who might have been on the fence because of angry opinions they may have heard... try it, if nothing else you will enjoy the card game.

												The gameplay is pretty good. To make your characters stronger you use a junction system where you will equip magic to your stats. Drawing magic from monsters can take quite a bit of time, but you can use your GF (Guardian Force) to create spells out of items from your inventory. And then there is the awful card game that I never play.... Disc 3 is my favorite part of the game because that is when you can travel through the entire world, finding all the GF's and by far the best time to level up your characters.The story is horrible. After disc 1 the whole thing falls apart. Luckily there are some fanmade theories that make more meaning into the story, such as the ""Squall is dead theory"" but as my brother says: ""I dont believe in that theory because I doubt they were capable of telling a decent story.""

												Pain in the ♥♥♥ to get to work with a controller, and the story is probably the wack-est FF storyline in the whole franchise, but with the Fast-Forward booster and mods available, it reinvigorates an old classic (?)Starts fun, ends weird, and the characters are mostly lame (except for surprisingly, the character that was supposed to be the lamest, Zell, who turns out to be the most fleshed-out member on your team).  Give it a shot if it's on sale and you like Final Fantasy.			"

												A great game, although the final disc just falls apart and leaves a lot of questions. Drawing spells can be tedious, although rewarding. The card game is fun and rewarding, and arguably the most powerful part of the game - until some stupid rules get thrown in, but you can fix that easily. this comes with the Pocketstation addon, so most people who havent been able to experience it will be able to enjoy it. Aside from that, It's got music that took me time to love, but once I started listening to it I found its merit and maybe like it more than FF9's music. not quite up to FF7's but oh well.			"

												This game is a classic from the Final Fantasy franchise. It doesn't always get the attention it should, while being overshadowed by the FF7 and FFX, and so on. However it is one of the vastest FF games of its generation. Being a PS1 game, on 2 discs, it had some of the best (and sometimes laggy) cut scene vids, and it has enough side missions to keep you busy for many days on end. To have it on PC in a version that will hopefully not have the old bugs, and so far (in my early stages of playing the game) has the same great game play as the original release.I would fully recommend this game to anyone that enjoys RPGs, and especially to those old FF fans. And if you have steered away from this game because of the lack of public attention, I encourage you to check it out! It’s a classic.			"

												This game defined my childhood, it was also one of the only reasons i ever turned on my PS1. The soundtrack is probably the best of any game i've ever played, the gameplay was exactly what you'd expect of an FF game with a battle and junction system that is one of the best in the series but above all that the story is what makes this such a standout in the series, i haven't found many RPG's outside this era where i actually gave more than half a ♥♥♥♥ about the story or the plethora of poorly developed one dimensional characters that came with them. This version is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the MIDI music. The DRM is not an issue as you just need register once for a SQE account and you can play offline, mod, cheat and generally do whatever you want afterwards. It also looks a hell of a lot better than the original PC (and PSX) release, the backgrounds obviously aren't improved but the character models, attack, GF and spell animations are all greatly improved by the increased resolution support.I played this when it was first relased on steam and at the time there weren't alot of mods available besides Roses&Wine which is a must for improving the audio but some of the mods that are available now make the game look a hell of a lot better and i'll definately be using them next time.

												Amazing game, full of original ideas for its time, epic story line with loads of side quests and hidden bosses. Between the story, the beautiful graphics, music score, and the insanely enthralling card game mini-game, Final Fantasy VIII does the series proud. This is the RPG that proves if you got a great story and solid characters it can still be a damn good game despite some glaring flaws. This is the best and most memorable game i have ever played, and everybody who loves RPG games will without doubt love this game. First laid eyes on this game on my 11th birthday, my dad got me a ps1 and this game. Grew up playing it. This was the game that would spark my love of gaming and the rpg genre. You probably think that you can't trust my review since I'll be blinded by nostalgia but I played this game again recently and loved it. Played, loved and obssessed on it as a child. Played, loved and obssessed on it as a manchild.It has a good mix of humor and seriousness, the combat system works well.

												(Note: I'll be basing my review off of this version and comparing it to the PSX version as I haven't played the 2000 PC version)The very first minute of playing, I already fell in love with this remake of my childhood game. Been going for 3 hours now.The graphics of the characters/sprites definitely looks much much more cleaner and beautifully done. I can see a somewhat significant change to the FMV's quality.Although, I'm not too fond with SE's use of MIDI/.SGT files for the music; it really brought down my expectations for it. Luckily, I found a mod on the forums helped fixed and replaced it with the original soundtrack. I hope that the Official Patch comes out though.Gameplay is still really nice and feels a lot more smoother and faster than the PSX version. I'm still trying to get accustomed to using the keyboard as the controller instead of a PSX/2 controller.I think it's good that SE implemented the Magic Booster option, however I'll be trying not to use the option mainly because I find it a way to obstruct the true way of playing this game (i.e. Spending hours on drawing magic from monsters). However, until worse really does come to worse, I'll probably use it when I finish the game (which would probably be useless because I'll probably have 100 of all most magics).Other than that, my overall score for this is a 9.6/10.

												It's no mystery to any of my friends, Final Fantasy VIII is my favorite game of all time. While this is largely due to the huge amount of nostalgia I have for the game that I spent just about every weekend of my childhood playing, FF8 is a game I still find myself playing to completion nearly 6 times a year. The Steam version is something i've been waiting for for some time, being someone who uses their PC more than any console. The remastered version does include some much needed brightness and sharpness to the every character model in the game, as well as redone portraits for the party members and guardian forces. However, the remastered version isnt without flaws. The music is not the original PS1 quality music, and is largely replaced by shoddier midi files that are less that are far from perfect, especially when compared to Nobuo's epics. The other drawback is that the Overworld looks just absolutely terrible. I'm not sure why the overworld looks as bad as it does, but it's pretty unforgivable, fortunatly you wont be spending too much time there. Fortunatly, both of these porting issues can be addressed through mods. The new addition also features a ""Magic Booster"" to help players struggling with the content, however I would advise against it, as half of the fun of playing the first time comes from clever use of ""Junctions"" which i'll go more into later.Now to review the actual game itself, as I said, Final Fantasy VIII is my favorite game ever made, however, i'm well aware of it's flaws. The game revolves around a ""Draw"" system, requiring character to absorb magic from enemies. After ""Drawing"" magic, the player can then use it to cast the spells stocked or to ""Junction"" it in various ways. The junction system allows the player to improve stats, everything from strength and speed, to more complicated stats like elemental resistance and status inflicting attacks are done through the junction system. The more magic stocked, the more potent the effect, and every magic has different stats with different attributes, so expiramenting around can be quite fun. However this comes at a price, drawing magic can feel quite tedious at times, and the junction system can feel a bit overwhelming to new players. But if you stick with it, it can feel quite rewarding to min-max and tweak characters to their roles.Next up are the ""Guardian Forces"", which are the various iconic Final Fantasy summons, but used in conjunction with the ""Junction"" system. GFs at their core, are powerful elemental attacks or party-wide buffs that take time to cast (but which bond with characters based on the frequency used, allowing faster cast times). But the GF's also level up and gain abilities, these abilities are then slotted into characters using the above mentioned ""Junction"" system. For instance, training Ifrit to give +60% strength, in addition to a very large amount of fire magic junctioned into strength, will tremendously boost a characters damaging abilities. Other abilities, such as Tonberry's ""Junk Shop"" allow the player to use a weapon shop from any point in the world. The GF abilities are fun and diverse, as they should be. Clever use of junctioned magic and capitalizing on enemy weaknesses is crucial to beating FF8's diverse boss encounters.The story of FF8, is VERY JRPG, so be prepared for fur/feathers/romance/schools/other cliches'. If any of that bothers you, it might be time to turn away, as this is a Final Fantasy game, and story is kind of a big deal. Focusing on the theme of love, Final Fantasy VIII follows the mercenary Squall and his fellow soldiers of SeeD. While I personally enjoyed the story, and still do to this day, don't expect anything groundbreaking on the levels of games like Bioshock Infinite, you're playing a JRPG, and it's VERY apparent.Even with all of it's flaws, Final Fantasy VIII is still my favorite game ever made, and if you were on the fence about picking it up, I hope you found this review helpful. It has my undoubtable seal of approval, though I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone.			"

The game clock is glitched: when playing card games, time runs faster and played time is inflated. And... like many people already said, the awful midi music...

												At first, I didn't like it very much, since the steam version has a midi soundtrack that is far worse compared to the psx original. It was kind of tedious at the beginning, and it took me a while to understand how junctions worked. However, when I got past that, and reached Disc 2, oh boy I couldn't stop playing. This game may not be the best Final Fantasy, but it is pretty good, and one of my favourites from the Final Fantasy series. I just wish Square made the leveling system easier to understand, and polished the story before releasing it, since I believe it could be improved in many aspects.If you want to play this game, though, I recommend you to look for the original psx one, and try avoiding the steam version.

												A great game, although the final disc just falls apart and leaves a lot of questions. Drawing spells can be tedious, although rewarding. The card game is fun and rewarding, and arguably the most powerful part of the game - until some stupid rules get thrown in, but you can fix that easily. this comes with the Pocketstation addon, so most people who havent been able to experience it will be able to enjoy it. Aside from that, It's got music that took me time to love, but once I started listening to it I found its merit and maybe like it more than FF9's music. not quite up to FF7's but oh well.			"

												Ahhh finally a good PC version of this game. I am glad I added this to my collection.After reading some reviews, I was concerned that this version was bad, but it seems that some of the complaints were a little misplaced in my opinion.SoundSo here is the weird thing, everything sounds like the familiar way it is supposed be. Wav, midi, and old PS1 style. No HD Remastered sound effects or music, this is a good thing to me in this case. If you have problems, you may need to update drivers or your midi set. The orginal PC game had to install Yamaha Extensive MIDI sound library just to get the sounds to work (needless to say, you do not have to go through that trouble anymore).GraphicsI have not tried the orginal mode, but I can clearly see what is going on. Some people might not know how bad a game designed for 4:3 CRT TVs look like on a 1080p screen, but overall this is a lot better than when it was orginally released. However there are some spots that look silly. You will know them when you see them. Take a deep breath and just keep playingBut the biggest suprise for me, is the overall FMV quality. I am very pleased with this because the FMV in the orginal PC release is more choppy on the recommend 800x600 (for the time).ControlsI would recommend using a controller, but it is optional. The direction movement is only 8 ways, true to its orginal version. If this puts you off, then this is not the game for you.Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who would enjoy an old jrpg from the 1990s. If you are worried about HD grapics and remaster music, then this game is not for you.Also you will need a facebook account or a square/enix to sign in once before playing this. So make sure you have internet access the first time you start this. After that, you should be good.			"

												Each time I replay either FF8, FF6, FF9, or FFX I always think to myself ""Wow, this is the best FF game.."" because those four are amazing. This is a great port. My only complaints are the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MIDI music and the slightly awkward controls (which is just how it has to be as a result of being on a keyboard.)As for the super ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MIDI music, just download the mod Wine and Roses, and you'll be listening to Black Mages versions of the music even better than the original PS1 quality.The junction system is very confusing at first, but its actually really sweet when you figure it out. Drawing does become tedious, but its almost unnecessary if you play Triple Triad and teach your GFs the abilities to ""Refine"" magic early. The CGI cutscenes that merge with the prerendered backgrounds are really one of the coolest things about FF7 and FF8, and they're especially awesome here (see the Parade sequence in particular.) The story gets slightly convoluted, but nothing compared to the crazy nonsense that FF7 goes into (I also like FF7 so chill). The Laguna sequences make this game really stand out, and really make the world feel connected.Overall, FF8 has always been one of my favorite games, and is quite possibly my favorite FF game.. I'd reccommend it in a heartbeat, but you're doing the game a disservice if you don't install a mod to fix the trashy MIDI music.			"

												This game defined my childhood, it was also one of the only reasons i ever turned on my PS1. The soundtrack is probably the best of any game i've ever played, the gameplay was exactly what you'd expect of an FF game with a battle and junction system that is one of the best in the series but above all that the story is what makes this such a standout in the series, i haven't found many RPG's outside this era where i actually gave more than half a ♥♥♥♥ about the story or the plethora of poorly developed one dimensional characters that came with them. This version is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the MIDI music. The DRM is not an issue as you just need register once for a SQE account and you can play offline, mod, cheat and generally do whatever you want afterwards. It also looks a hell of a lot better than the original PC (and PSX) release, the backgrounds obviously aren't improved but the character models, attack, GF and spell animations are all greatly improved by the increased resolution support.I played this when it was first relased on steam and at the time there weren't alot of mods available besides Roses&Wine which is a must for improving the audio but some of the mods that are available now make the game look a hell of a lot better and i'll definately be using them next time.

												This game is a classic from the Final Fantasy franchise. It doesn't always get the attention it should, while being overshadowed by the FF7 and FFX, and so on. However it is one of the vastest FF games of its generation. Being a PS1 game, on 2 discs, it had some of the best (and sometimes laggy) cut scene vids, and it has enough side missions to keep you busy for many days on end. To have it on PC in a version that will hopefully not have the old bugs, and so far (in my early stages of playing the game) has the same great game play as the original release.I would fully recommend this game to anyone that enjoys RPGs, and especially to those old FF fans. And if you have steered away from this game because of the lack of public attention, I encourage you to check it out! It’s a classic.			"

												At first, I didn't like it very much, since the steam version has a midi soundtrack that is far worse compared to the psx original. It was kind of tedious at the beginning, and it took me a while to understand how junctions worked. However, when I got past that, and reached Disc 2, oh boy I couldn't stop playing. This game may not be the best Final Fantasy, but it is pretty good, and one of my favourites from the Final Fantasy series. I just wish Square made the leveling system easier to understand, and polished the story before releasing it, since I believe it could be improved in many aspects.If you want to play this game, though, I recommend you to look for the original psx one, and try avoiding the steam version. You won't miss much, but the music makes a lot of difference.			"

												Great classic with a decent port for PC. Playing this on controller was fairly difficult though as all of the buttons are labeled as B1, B2, B3, etc. This is not my favorite Final Fantasy game, but it is still a great game worth playing if your a fan of the franchise. It has great characters who develop over the course of the game and an excellent storyline. Personally I wasn't a fan of the magic drawing system for increasing character stats, but to each their own. It felt too grindy to me.TL;DR. If you are a fan of old school JRPGs and turn based combat, definitely play this game or replay it again for nostagia sake!			"

												Nostalgic... Recomended, but... Square was very lazy on this steam version: the keyboard comands, when customized, may cause some trouble to the player, since at many situations and moments, the game still considers the original config; example: the command to escape combat, the moment to insert the codes on the trains at Timber's first mission, and some others. The game clock is glitched: when playing card games, time runs faster and played time is inflated. And... like many people already said, the awful midi music... I am a master of old school games and I recomend this one... It's on my top 10 list.			"

												It's no mystery to any of my friends, Final Fantasy VIII is my favorite game of all time. While this is largely due to the huge amount of nostalgia I have for the game that I spent just about every weekend of my childhood playing, FF8 is a game I still find myself playing to completion nearly 6 times a year. The Steam version is something i've been waiting for for some time, being someone who uses their PC more than any console. The remastered version does include some much needed brightness and sharpness to the every character model in the game, as well as redone portraits for the party members and guardian forces. However, the remastered version isnt without flaws. The music is not the original PS1 quality music, and is largely replaced by shoddier midi files that are less that are far from perfect, especially when compared to Nobuo's epics. The other drawback is that the Overworld looks just absolutely terrible. I'm not sure why the overworld looks as bad as it does, but it's pretty unforgivable, fortunatly you wont be spending too much time there. Fortunatly, both of these porting issues can be addressed through mods. The new addition also features a ""Magic Booster"" to help players struggling with the content, however I would advise against it, as half of the fun of playing the first time comes from clever use of ""Junctions"" which i'll go more into later.Now to review the actual game itself, as I said, Final Fantasy VIII is my favorite game ever made, however, i'm well aware of it's flaws. The game revolves around a ""Draw"" system, requiring character to absorb magic from enemies. After ""Drawing"" magic, the player can then use it to cast the spells stocked or to ""Junction"" it in various ways. The junction system allows the player to improve stats, everything from strength and speed, to more complicated stats like elemental resistance and status inflicting attacks are done through the junction system. The more magic stocked, the more potent the effect, and every magic has different stats with different attributes, so expiramenting around can be quite fun. However this comes at a price, drawing magic can feel quite tedious at times, and the junction system can feel a bit overwhelming to new players. But if you stick with it, it can feel quite rewarding to min-max and tweak characters to their roles.Next up are the ""Guardian Forces"", which are the various iconic Final Fantasy summons, but used in conjunction with the ""Junction"" system. GFs at their core, are powerful elemental attacks or party-wide buffs that take time to cast (but which bond with characters based on the frequency used, allowing faster cast times). But the GF's also level up and gain abilities, these abilities are then slotted into characters using the above mentioned ""Junction"" system. For instance, training Ifrit to give +60% strength, in addition to a very large amount of fire magic junctioned into strength, will tremendously boost a characters damaging abilities. Other abilities, such as Tonberry's ""Junk Shop"" allow the player to use a weapon shop from any point in the world. The GF abilities are fun and diverse, as they should be. Clever use of junctioned magic and capitalizing on enemy weaknesses is crucial to beating FF8's diverse boss encounters.The story of FF8, is VERY JRPG, so be prepared for fur/feathers/romance/schools/other cliches'. If any of that bothers you, it might be time to turn away, as this is a Final Fantasy game, and story is kind of a big deal. Focusing on the theme of love, Final Fantasy VIII follows the mercenary Squall and his fellow soldiers of SeeD. While I personally enjoyed the story, and still do to this day, don't expect anything groundbreaking on the levels of games like Bioshock Infinite, you're playing a JRPG, and it's VERY apparent.Even with all of it's flaws, Final Fantasy VIII is still my favorite game ever made, and if you were on the fence about picking it up, I hope you found this review helpful. It has my undoubtable seal of approval, though I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone.			"

												Nice story and character moments, and the visuals hold up surprisingly well. Aside from modding potential, this release has 2 specific advantages to simply emulating the original, getting in on PSN, etc.1) Hi-speed mode. This is like unlocking the FPS limit on an emulator, but the music doesn't get warped. Since you will spend a lot of time either in the field or an unskippable cutscene, this could save you multiple hours in a single playthrough. Also, during certain timed segments the timer will not be sped up - this is kinda cheating, but arguably justified since you're dealing with some annoyingly long battle animations. I think you can use this hotkey (F1), avoid the rest (F2-F5, which are unquestionably cheating) and still feel like you are playing legitimately.2) Magic Booster. This is a built-in hack that gives you 100 copies of every spell in your inventory, for each character. But it does not give you spells you don't have. This is definitely cheating, but if you've played the game before, you might see this cheat as acceptable compared to max Gil/damage/etc... you can easily farm 100 copies of most spells, but it is very time-consuming.That said, this game has some design issues regardless of what platform you're on. The Junction system is kinda broken, and the game ends up becoming very easy once you've obtained enough spells (which takes time and/or effort, but not skill). For me, one particular character could completely demolish every boss with little to no strategy involved. It's not awful, but it's not great either, which is why I think stuff like the magic booster isn't a big deal. Overall, this is one you'll enjoy for the story over the gameplay.			"

												This game just brings back so many memories. I definitely appreciate it more now since I can understand the junction system a lot better as 23 year old than a 9 year old.The music is midi like, but it didn't bother me much as I have the official soundtrack just playing in the background. The story is actually more complex and developed than most Final Fantasies. (For example, I find the character of Squall enormously complex, and not...""emo"" as some people think. The guy is abandoned in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ orphanage by one of the only people he really cares about for Christ's sake. Half the time he's the only sane person in the game, he has to deal with so much stupidity). I thoroughly recommend this game, and am hoping for a HD release with fixed music or a sequel. It's that epic of a game.			"

												Def an underated FF game, but I understand why people don't like it. The draw system is so aweful it adds hours to the grind... BUT THATS WHY YOU GET IT ON STEAM!!!! Get sick of the draw system? Well use the magic boost and get 99 of each magic :P problem solved.. or was it 999? eh anywho, the combat is more or less pretty standard FF but the limit breaks have changed since 7. I don't really much care for 8's system though.. instead of just getting pow wacked enough they changed it to ""yellow hp"" then you just get it. Each limit break has its own gimmick to and nothing is more frustrating then finally pulling off a limit only to miss the triggers.. Also you can 'boost' your guardian forces to do extra damage but in a game as grindy as this one.. it adds alot of extra work as lazy as that sounds. As far as story goes its pretty awesome! Characters are pretty sweet to! Aside from the usual bland main character and in this one equally as meh love interest and rival... But the support cast is alot of fun! My favorite thing about FF8 (aside from the card game :P) is the theory behind it.. which I won't spoil anything here but just google FF8 squall theory :P you'll see			"

												Final Fantasy VIII is a tale of sorceress wars, romance, and the ties of friendship that bring people together in the timeless tale of heroes vs villians. The characters are fun, different and the story is immersive, allowing you freedom to choose how you boost your stats and what abilities you can use with the unique Junction system. Recommended to all who love the Final Fantasy series, or for those who enjoy the JRPG genre :3. While the PC version's music leaves a lot to be desired, there is an easy fix found in the FFVIII Steam forums called Roses and Wine. A simple way to retrieve the beautiful Playstation version music fans remember and newbies will appreciate.			"

If you are a Final Fantasy fan (or any rpg in general), this is an absolute must.

												My favorite Final Fantasy within IX. The port is pretty decent, better than the PC version we have more than a decade ago. I've played this game since the Japanese release and beating it several times a while I was a kid that's why I like it a lot. Nowadays I started this Steam version 16 years after and of course is way simpler even than other entries of its days. But I love the art style the story, the music, characters and in general the atmosphere of this game. This is great version.The only bad thing about the port is the lack of normal button prompts. Xbox ones or  something else. For instance in the train mission you'll have a few little issues acknowledging which button you need to press but nothing terrible. Long story short...buy this game <3 ;) "

Short version: 90%Final Fantasy VIII was the point where the series reached a whole new level, thanks to small changes like the focus on the romantic story elements and the more realistic character design. The Steam edition includes a few additional features over the old PC release, making it one of the best ports of the game so far, recommended for old fans or newcomers who would like to experience one of the gems of the golden age of Final Fantasy.Long version:Final Fantasy VIII was sort of a trailblazer when it came out. This was the first Final Fantasy game where we said goodbye to the traditional NES/SNES era cartoonish characters in favour of a more realistic design, and where the romance plot-- which is normally a secondary or tertiary storyline in similar games-- is promoted to be in the focus.This won’t turn FFVIII into a romance/dating game, far from it: your main task is still to save the world/universe from the ridiculous-haired main villain. To do so you’ll have to gather friends and allies, explore much of the planet, and of course slowly discover a rich backstory told in two separate timelines, which will eventually (with a little guess work) uncover one of the most confusing, yet best-written stories of the genre.Gameplay-wise FFVIII is a bit of an odd one out in the series with the large amount of gameplay changes it features. Although a lot could be said about these, the length of a Steam review simply cannot hold this much information, so let’s just say that some of them, like the expanded Limit Breaks, are favourably looked upon and work well; while others, like the junction system, were met with great opposition and never returned in later games. The Steam version can be considered a well enough port of the original PlayStation release, with a bunch of really nice technical features, including better display compatibility and more user-friendly controlling. Sadly, like the Steam version of Final Fantasy VII, it features a subpar version of the original PSX music tracks, the same ones that were used in the original PC version.Overall, the Steam Edition is Final Fantasy VIII may not be the HD remake lot of people still want, but it is a good port of an excellent game, well worth of owning and playing, even if you have the original PSX disc somewhere.

												I lost my PS2 so I couldn't play FFVIII for over 6 years, but as soon as the game was available on Stream, I HAD to buy it right away. All the nostalgia of a love-story based FFVIII made me excited to be able to play this game once again. The enhanced graphics makes the experience on PC much better than the original PS2 version. The only downside of this is the music, which sounds like MIDI files, but still, in my mind, all the music sounds like scores from a live orchestra. It doesn't matter the flaws, since my imagination is still like a child - much like using your imagination while playing old Atari 2600 games when pixelated games didn't mean the game sucked.			"

												If like me you grew up playing VIII and IX (8 and 9, possibly 7) Then get the game, it's cheap and brings back memories. The music in certain scenes has changed a tad, but, at least they ported it to work on steam so we can play that awesome game. If you did indeed buy it for the music, you're as well buying the album or just listening to it on YouTube. Other than that, I recommend the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game, being a fan when it was first released. Get it, do it.			"

This is by far my favorite final fantasy game of all times (and yes better than 7 imho). The story was great for me because you could see the character development as you played. The enviorments are beautiful and despite some of the clunky character models the everything else is great. Only downside is there is no volume control for the ingame music, but hey mother fuzzin gunblades yo.			"

												Story – 1/5 -> 20%The story is the typical “defeat the evil mastermind who threatens the life of the entire planet” type of story.  However, it is also incredibly convoluted and filled with many plot holes.  If you finished listening to some NPC's explanation about what is going on and still have no clue who's side they are on, then the story is too convoluted for its own good.  The one redeeming quality is that the main characters are well-defined.  You could easily identify with the main character, Squall.Graphics – 4/5 -> 80%The graphics are much improved over the horrible graphics of the previous game.  Some parts of the game still have rough edges, like a few of the character models, but for the most part, you shouldn't really notice any problems (at least for graphics of its time).  In particular, the FMVs look spectacular and flow smoothly with the rest of the game.Sound – 5/5 -> 100%None of the music or sound effects felt out of place.  Of particular note is the boss theme music which provided an appropriate adrenaline rush.Controls – 9/10 -> 90%Even if you have a problem with the default controls, it is possible to redefine them, and none of the extra ways the main controls were used for “minigames” felt awkward or misused.  The only problem I experienced was that the overworld was incredibly disorienting to navigate without the map open.Resources – 5/5 -> 100%Unlike the Playstation version, this version of FFVIII comes with Chocobo World without the need for a Pocketstation.  This provides an extra source for items beyond the main game.  Even if you choose not to abuse Chocobo World, FFVIII provides plenty of ways to keep your stats in tip-top shape.One interesting resource system in this game is the SeeD rank.  Depending on your rank, you will be paid a certain amount as you walk around the world.  The higher your rank, the more you are paid.  There are a variety of ways to increase your rank, including monster kills and several sidequests.  This ensures you don't have to always face monsters to grind for gold if you don't want to.Player Growth – 3/5 -> 60%FFVIII's unique system is the Junctioning system.  Summon spirits are called Guardian Forces, or GF, which can be linked to particular characters to give them new abilities.  GFs can be taught new abilities for your characters to use as well as slots for particular stats in order to boost them with magic.In addition, enemies level with you, in order to attempt to balance the game.  However, the game is not very well balanced for both newcomers and veterans alike, as leveling up too much tends to make the game more difficult, and it is possible to obtain late game magic spells at the beginning in order to boost your stats ridiculously high.Learnability – 4/5 -> 80%The game regularly provides the option to view a tutorial on various game mechanics.  Unfortunately, it can be rather invasive when you are given a chance later in the game to view a tutorial of a concept you have already been taught.One feature of note is the SeeD Test.  In addition to increasing your SeeD rank, tests also provide a way to test your knowledge of the game mechanics.  The tests can prove to be a nice refresher if you forget anything, since you can view them at any time.Difficulty - 12/15 -> 80%The game initially provides a nice blend of challenging gameplay.  However, it does not provide enough challenging end-game content.  There is a super boss, but it is easy to defeat compared to other Final Fantasy games with super bosses.Entertainment – 38/40 -> 95%While the game is not very challenging overall, the Junction system still makes the gameplay very enjoyable.Replay value – 3/5 -> 60%As with most single player games, there is not much incentive to play the game again, especially if the story hurts your head.  However, the Junction system provides many different ways to approach boss fights.  It can be interesting to experiment with different approaches and create your own challenge runs.Total – 84/100 -> 84%I would recommend at least giving the game a try if you have never played this game before on the Playstation.  It is very fun to experiment with the Junction system and different magic spells.  If you have played the Playstation version and you are a completionist, you might still want to buy the PC version for the inclusion of Chocobo World.			"

												This game is just epic. Always been a FF fan and VIII is one of my favorites. The gameplay itself is exactly the same as I remember it playing the PS1 except with more HD characters.+ If you're looking to play the old style FF8 but with HD characters, this is your game!+ Nostalgia overdrive- Everything except the characters is kept in the original art and sound (not really a minus point honestly, it creates this nostalgic feeling).10/10 would buy again "

												Fantastic game. Have been waiting for this for a while, and it really does not let you downfeatures - high resolution modes - origional or new graphics - native controller support - a ""Magic Booster"" mode for new players.The game launches fine and handles well on Windows 7 x64, no crashes yet. And not having to download an OpenGl hotfix to run 1920x1080x32 is a nice feature. I haven't tried the new graphics mode yet (because I'm a purist!) but I'm sure they inclide higher-res textures and some neat particle effects. There are a couple rather small things I'm sure will be fixed in the new futureStrangely enough, and even with controller support, the game will not recognize the D-pad on my controller, so I still have to use a pinnical profile to use the D-pad (which feels natural for this game). Even weirder (and kind of annoyingly) there is NO controller support for out-of-game menus, like the startup menu, or the pre-game start menu so you're forced to use the keyboard. I've looked around myself and can't find a hotfix.other than that, the game runs well and is fantastic. Definitely recommend!			"

												I love this franchise and I love this game, but I had to refund this title. Why? It's possibly one of the worst ports Squeeny have released. As mentioned in almost every post, the soundtrack is MIDI and thus requires modding. By the time I was done messing about to get it to a playable state, it still looked and sounded worse than my original disks emulated and modded. How did they get the VII port so right and this so wrong?Try harder.			"

												My personal favorite of all  Final Fantasy  franchises. Played this in 1999 with my brother when I was around 7! If you never played this game, you wouldn't believe how rich the story was, and how wide the range of the conflicts really are. Game is set in the future, but somehow post-apocalyptic after what happened in Centra around 4000 years ago, a Lunar Cry, where in current time people rebuild Centra into what is called a Garden. Relationships in this game are two of the most contributing factors, while others include politics, war, sorcery, and just massive destructions.The game's background arts look ethereally.. poetic. It is just simply stunning. They're all 3D environment, just rendered into 2D and made it into a background where the 3D low-poly (characters) move accross the 3D space that have been motion-tracked to the background. The designs are mostly steampunk (architectural elements of Greek and French) combined with futuristic elements (try to observe the 3D models, colors, sounds, and advanced technology in the game).  Best battle system of all time. Indescribably cool. Junctioning GFs and Magic, draw, limit breaks, elements, statuses, real-time turnbased, weapon forging, student exams, and tons of other stuff. Just get the game and play it. And play its card-game, it's fun as hell.			"

												I love this FF, I probably got over 9000 hours played across dozens of playthroughs... but this is such a low effort port cash-in I really can't recommend it.Every single time you launch the game it pops up a keyboard controls box despite the fact that you're playing with a controller, so you have to press X on the keyboard to close it just to be able to use the controller to play. Then the resolution, despite having it set to 1920x1080 @ 144hz in the launcher, it runs in 4:3 aspect ratio with black side bars @ 30fps while roaming around the world and only 15.5fps during battles. How can it possibly get any worse you ask? With HIDEOUSLY pixelated 2D backgrounds and choppy ♥♥♥ looking 3D environment where you actually see the polygons sticking out, that's how.Whatever.../10			"

												This is the game I know and love. This was one of the first games I bought with my newlywed wife, and the kids and I would spend hours on it. The PS1 along with the Nintendo 64, we have fond memories. The graphics at the time were amazing - and I was dumbfounded by the ""high-res"" cutscenes that are commonplace in games today in actual gameplay - and in fact would be considered low-quality. Putting that aside, the nostalgia alone was something for me not to pass up. If you want a cutting edge game, this is not for you. If you played this before, this is a fantastic port, and be forewarned, this is not using the widescreen 10,000,000p goodness.			"

												People who have been rating this down because of the music don't care about the game. As a matter of fact, if they're letting some sub-standard music get in the way of the game, they probably don't even like the game to begin with and should be disregarded entirely.First of all: the music isn't that bad. It's not bad at all, in fact, and certainly not enough to make people NOT reccomend the game. It has a retro feel to it, which, for any other game, people would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ing over because #RETROISAWESOMELOL.Second of all: yes, there is a second layer of DRM. Squeenix's login thing. I haven't had issues with my internet in long enough to accurately remember whether or not you actually NEED a constant stable connection, but I seem to recall that with FF7, you could play offline just fine as long as you had an account, which isn't difficult to create (and fake, if you so desire).The game itself remains one of Final Fantasy's most underrated titles. People ♥♥♥♥♥ed about the need to ""grind"" magic for the ""unintuitive"" junction system, but how is it any worse than grinding hundreds of millions of XP in any other title? I find the Junction system is laid out very simply and is easy-to-use. But then, I have at least two functioning brain cells to fire neural impulses between, so it wouldn't have taken me much effort to figure out even if I didn't understand it at first.The characters are deep and relatable, to an extent (I mean, how well can you actually relate to a bunch of teenagers who were riased to be elite mercenaries during their childhood). The story is engaging, if somewhat generic, but they genuinely tried to mix it up. The love interest plot developes naturally, though it gets somewhat rushed at one point late in the game when Female Love Interest (tm) goes into a coma and Male Love Interest (tm) who had previously been pushing her away constantly suddenly and abruptly realizes how much he needs her. Overall, it's a very good game. I look forward to when Squeenix releases FF9 for the PC *coughcough*hinthint*cough*getonityoulosers*cough*.			"

												Final Fantasy VIII is a great game for first time FF players. It has a great plot line and many puzzles. As it is quite old, it uses low quality textures and models that look horrible on today's hardware, and unfortunately they decided to use a smaller soundfont for the music in this Steam release (although this can be replaced by better ones that can mimic the PSOne soundtrack pretty easily).It would be great to see a full 3D remake of this game that works accross Windows, Linux and OS X in the future, but for now, running this in Wine seems to work ok :)			"

												The game is good but unfortunately not that great, at least for this PC version. Back when I first played Final Fantasy VIII at PSX,  the quality of detail in graphic and sound was higher than this version. I think Square Enix needs to work out a patch to polished it in terms of quality, like the sound patch they released for Final Fantasy VII Steam. Only thing that keeps me playing Final Fantasy VIII is the gameplay, and it's addictive. But until Square Enix release at least sound patch, I won't recomment this game.			"

												UPDATE:  2014/07/28Still unbearable midi music.  This is a great game, it's not my favorite Final Fantasy, but I would recommend it.  I don't recommend this half-♥♥♥♥♥ port.UPDATE:  2014/06/11Square still hasn't changed the music.  While I understand that porting the PC version was the most effective method of putting the game on Steam, the midi is horrifyingly bad for anybody who's had the pleasure of hearing Uematsu's original PS1 music.  This isn't my favorite Final Fantasy game, but the music is better than most games with original compositions.  Overall, this is a very hardcore JRPG:  there's a lot to micro-manage, there are important items and buffs that you can permanently miss, the characters are very derivative of an Anime style, and the story is all over the place confusing.  If you're a fan of RPGs in general, you need to play this and if you're a fan of JRPGs specifically, then you may have already played this.  I recommend waiting until they have the original music since the midi is plain awful. Original Post:  2014/03/25:Music is absolutely atrocious.The PSX game music isn't here, it could EASILY be fixed.  Not worth it until this midi garbage is gone.			"

												I don't recommend this because of the game itself. You are better off with the original since the controller works perfectly or an emulator (epsxe) since you can smooth the textures. All they did was upgrade the videos. That's it. It tries to sync with Enix servers and fails for no reason. It was advertised that I could speedup the game. I'm not seeing that. I used a USB to PS1/2 adapter and after setting the keys, it isn't responding to the buttons. You cannot map all keys on your keyboard either. Only characters and numbers, not punctuation (comma, semicolon, slash) or space, tab, alt, enter. If you enter the game and switch to default, you will not know how to exit the game unless you know the default keys. I've bought most FF games on the original console and I recommend playing them on an emulator or the original console, not this, not here. Don't buy this.			"

												[Note that the following evaluation only applies to the Steam version of FF8]In its present condition, I can't recommend this game, and even more If you have in mind your old PS1 version of FF8. The Steam version is far inferior than the ancient one and you'll need to apply a couple of mods only to restore your childhood memories. Basically, there are two serious issues related to this version: the OST which is - I ought to say - awful, and the  background graphics which are blurred at best. In sum, you'll pay 12 bucks to have an ersatz of your good and old Final Fantasy game. Then you'll spend 2 hours for the game to regain its former quality. Otherwise, you'll restart your PS1 like in the old days... "

												Not a remake but a simple port... but it is the one FF that should be remade. Not because it was great... just because it's so crappy that it's in deep need and hidden somewhere under the battles that take forever and game play that's complicated(not in a good way) there's probably a salvagable game. The pre-rendered background graphics really show their age in this port. they seriously couldn't have 2xSaI'ed them, really? . The junctioning system was crap when it came out on the PSX.. it's why they bothered to add a save-game mod to max out your spells. Almost everything about this game needs as big of an overhaul as FFXIV needed when it first came out. If you want to see outdated graphics with game play mechanics that you can play the whole game and never feel like you properly mastered them.. then give this game a try. The most immediate things that they could do to enhance this game is to replace the godaweful sound and prerendered back grounds and other simple things like turning the globe on the overworld... into an actual sphere rather than the bunch of polygons that passed for a sphere on the PSX.

												I played this game on the Playstation back when it came out and decided to buy the Steam version for old times' sake. Sorry to say that the PC port of this game is absolutely horrendous. It's not worth the purchase even on a deep discount.The foremost problem is the controls: the button/key labels in-game are indicated using B1, B2, ... B10. Sure, you get shown the button meanings when the game boots, but it's not very useful when you can't remember the key combination for 'escape from battle' (required for the plot in the first game mission) and the in-game comments are useless. Also, don't bother with the controller support for this game. I attempted to use my wired 360 controller and found that the left and right triggers and the directional pad aren't detected -- you can't specify them in the custom configuration screen. (Also, there goes Zell's limit break.) On an aesthetic note, you should probably just mute the game instead of trying to tolerate the lo-fi, MIDI quality music. It's a shame, because the Dollet music mission is one of my favorites. Also, 'Magic Boost'? Seriously? Drawing magic was a HORRENDOUS idea to begin with, but Magic Boost is pretty much game breaking if you use it early on (it gives you 100 of the fire/thunder/blizzard, fira/blizzara/thundara, firaga/blizzaga/thundaga, all the status effect spells, and a few others... but fortunately it doesn't give you 100 of the top-tier spells like ultima, aura, etc) The game wasn't hard, there's no need for this kind of cheat.

												Was excited to play 8 again so I bought it, made it through one random fight and then stopped playing because the music sounded terrible. Square, you need to realize that the music in your games pre-voice acting was what helped convey emotions of the characters. As such players are emotionally attatched to the songs as well, and when the music doesn't sound right, you're butchering the game.Fix the music. Now.*Editing this review to say that I've since managed to play through almost the entire game, but still cringe every time I hear one of my favorite songs in such poor quality. I'll gladly change my review completely if the music is ever fixed, but until then...			"

												Holy ♥♥♥♥, I haven't even got to playing the game yet, and it's given me more hassle than any other title.I was unaware that a Square Enix account was required for the game, and after signing up (using a back-up e-mail because it wouldn't accept my usual one) I went to accept the usual conformation e-mail only to find that it wasn't there.I've waited half an hour on an e-mail that should take minutes if not seconds to send. And I've hit 'resend confirmation' like 12 times now.Good job, Square. You've really outdone yourself, putting mandatory sign-ups on a ♥♥♥♥ing single-player title.What the hell are they playing at.

												Pros:- Card game- Hot dog protection- Music- Junction system (many hate on this for being too complex...but there's an auto feature if you're lazy)- Characters (yea, I like all of them, deal with it)- Interesting story/romance- Others that I don't feel like typingCons:- Occasional crashes (I think it may have been related to Windows updates that would occur while playing)- Draw system can be tedious- GF summons and some limit breaks take forever (although there is now a fast forward option which helps)The good outshines the bad.

												Truly the best Final Fantasy. 7 was great, but my opinion changed after horrible additions to the story, prequels and movies and such: Cloud never changes and stays mopey. 9 was just horrible, the protagonist being a cross between David Bowie, Meg Ryan and a monkey. With FF8, you have a somewhat unlikeable punk kid protagonist that, through the 4 discs of the game, developes and starts becoming a man.FF8 had the least amount of plot twists I feel. You have the main goal through most of the game: Kill the Sorceress! 8 has an awesome love story, a very likeable cast of characters, and amazing graphics for its time. I still get goosebumps watching the intro scene.There's some definite flaws with this port, but this will probably always be my favorite of the series and my favorite childhood game as well. I read a review earlier recommending this to younger audiences, couldn't agree more. Let this game be etched in your memory from an early age, this is a true classic			"

												The Greatest Final Fantasy Ever, people have so much hate for a game that introduced the Junction system....purely because they didnt understand it and cant utilise it fully. Great story line, boss fights are awesome, magic and effects are amazing for its time and for a game to stir up this many feelings of nostalgia.....Best Game Ever....			"

												Final Fantasy 8 is easily my personal favorite game of all time. Amazing storyline. Great characters. Just over all awesome!Problems: The PC music is pretty ♥♥♥♥ so go download a music mod. And the DPad on a PS3 controller doesn't work, therefor you have to resort to using the analog stick which can make battles a bit weird. Especially when it comes to Zell's directional input Limit Break. Definitely think that the DPad issue needs a fix.			"

												Everybody knows how good this game is, great to see it coming to steam!Only the music... same bad MIDI files... the music on the PS-One is a million times better. This should be adressed ASAP, so for the time being, I am not recommending this to anyone. The music of FFVIII was one of the things that captivated the players, and make a sweet taste of nostalgia for many. I surely recommend the game, but not in this form.Also what is strange... the characters, Squall, Quistis etc. all seem more... sharper. Their graphic quality has actually improved, while the surroundings... are of a lesser graphic quality. All in all, just a strange release! Some graphic elements improved, others lessened. Very bad quality music, which takes away the whole atmosphere and heart of the game. Adress it quickly is my advice.			"

												Great game and my favorite Final Fantasy on PS1. However, I think this ""HD Remix"" is real ripoff... Only Character models and SOME bosses has gotten their sprites upgraded to ""HD"". Everything else is still the same quality as it was in the PS1 and first PC version. Also I think the MIDI Files theu are using on this ""HD"" Remake are even worse what we got in the PSP version of the game, though I might be wrong on that one. But still, if you want to play Final Fantasy 8 you should buy this or the PSN version since they will be much cheaper compared to what you would have to pay for the PS/PC(If you can even find the PC version anymore) versions.

												I would like to point out that I love the original game on ps1 and that his is not a remake in the slighest, this is a re-realease.Pro: The game works on modern systems. The character models are mildly betterCons: The backgrounds are very pixelated, they definitely need reworked so they don't look terrible at 1080p. You have to have an account with sqeenix to run it. The music is the original music that came with the first pc version, what that means is that it sounds terrible. I could put up with the sqeenix account and the backgrounds just so I didn't have to use an emualtor but the muic quality is unforgivable, if it gets patched then this review would actually be positive.
