												Okay, so I'm having a hard time trying to recommend this game, so I made the decision to not do so.It's a match three game, mixed with a rather basic city building type of game, and by very basic I mean, click this, see if you have the resources, build, then job done! Not complicated in any way, very simple and easy to get the hang of, but it's honestly nothing special. Now on to the actual gameplay!Like I said, the game is a match three game, so the main gameplay is just swiping so you get a line of three or more, but where it is a little different is the mechanic of the battles. On one side is you, which is a building filled with your gems/runes that you need to match three in order to use as an attack. On the other side is where the enemies will slowly encroach upon your castle, and it's your job to match those gems, be it horizontal or vertical to fire a spell at the enemy. You'll slowly whittle the enemy down with your matching abilities and the battle will be over and you'll be sent back to your village.The combat isn't overly-complicated, and you will be getting extra abilities that you can unlock to help you along the way, but it's all simply ""okay."" And that's how I'd describe this game in a nutshell. It's merely okay. I'm not the biggest fan of the graphics style, but I can live with that. The combat is fairly simple, but it's nothing spectacular, and the whole village gimmick kind of makes you feel like you're playing a FaceBook game as you have to wait for your buildings to give you the resources you want. If you want to sit and wait and just watch that timer slowly tick down so you can get that extra little bit of ore, then you can, but I can't admit being the biggest fan of having to wait on real time to get something a little extra in a game. I don't hate the game, but at the same time I can't say I like it either. Which is why I'm not going to be recommending it, because an ""okay"" game does not make it necessarily a good one.			"

												Interesting Match 3 game. Basically you build and upgrade a village to provide power-ups for the Match 3 combat game.  Then you use the money from the Match 3 game to purchase upgrades for your town.Occassionally you'll get popups in town about a random event and you have a multiple choice decision you can make. Depending on your choice you may unlock other power-ups.Several of your buildings are for gathering resources - ore and wood that you use to build and upgrade structures. A farm to feed your people. A blacksmith to research new weapons and an armory to store them in.  You use the weapons as power-ups in the match 3 game. You can build and upgrade an Academy for spells to use in the match 3 game, A City Hall to hire workers for your buildings or as power-ups such as an Archer or Boulder tosser to fight off the encroaching enemy. And finally a Grainery to bring in more settlers.Combat is a road map of towers on the continent. Once you win a match 3 game in one, you can advance to the next tower or redo a battle at a solved one to grind money.In the combat sequence you have enemy forces coming at you randomly in rows. As you make matches in the match 4 game it sends out energy beams from the matched gems out into the enemy ranks of those rows. You can also use your archer/boulder tossers/loot gatherers/healers as power-ups to help defend the walls or keep your troops healed.As you defeat enemies, they may drop piles of money that you can click on as you're  making your matches. All in all it's an interesting twist to your standard Match 3 game. All the standard Match 3 obstacles are there - as are the power-ups. Just that now they have to be researched from your village before use, and some unique power-ups like archers and such running around shooting the approaching waves of enemies as you make matches to send out energy beams to blast them away from your ramparts.Other than that nothing terribly unique from any other Match 3 game - just its presentation.

												True addiction.Reignmaker is a match-3 style game with a compelling mixture of elements that never distract from the gameplay.The main meat of the game is the tower battles, which see you matching runes in a tower to create elemental bolts to destroy incoming waves of attackers. There is a wide variety of enemies, most of which shamble slowly towards your tower, giving you plenty of time to pick them off. Levels offer a great deal of variety, whether in the set-up of the board itself, 'corruption' that affects your runes, and other maladies that you can either hire citizens to deal with or just power through. Boss battles give you a chance to fight somebody that fires back.The game also allows you to research spells and craft items to assist you in game, and hire the aforementioned specialized citizens to roam your tower walls and assist.If that sounds like a lot to pick through, well, it is. Reignmaker has an overabundance of options, but the learning curve (at least on Easy or Normal) allows you plenty of time to pick out your own strategy, whether that's deploying spells as a mage, throwing bombs and blockades in your enemies' paths, or hiring a big guy to smash everybody with rocks.As competently done as the individual battles are, they were actually the part of the game I found myself enjoying the least. On top of everything else, Reignmaker has a city/resource management side to it, where you can turn your little village into a true city. This is the hub of everything else in the game, where you upgrade buildings and research spells and items to assist you in battles. Watching the city 'grow up', and the citizens going about their day within it, is quite satisfying. Likely the best part about this game, though, is the ability to set 'policies'. After each new level you beat, you can travel back to your city and set a new policy that the populace is up in arms about. Some of them gain extra resources, some will create aesthetic changes to the city, and some of them are just for flavor, but ReignMaker's excellent sense of humor shines through here, and it's definitely something to look forward to.Graphics are bright and colorful, though nothing really stands apart from the pack here. The design of the three main city types you have to choose for are brightly distinct from one another, but while there are minor differences in city attributes, the base gameplay is still the same. It has a soundtrack. Creatures have their own unique grunts of pain and death rattles, and some of the citizens have spoken (or mumbled) lines. The music itself is about what you'd expect from a game like this, pure background. It exists, nothing really more can be said.Achievement hunters can rejoice as well, and maybe get a little glassy-eyed when they first load up the game. Reignmaker is heavily geared towards getting a whole slew of achievements right off the bat- I got 40 in one day, and didn't even play for that long. Later achievements can get quite grindy.Overall, Reignmaker offers a great deal of variety, and encourages unique strategies. If you're a fan of match-3 type games looking for something a little different, definitely give this one a try.			"

												Store page says: ""city building political strategy game with match-3 tower defense combat""That is a lie. What is more, that is an unnecessary lie. Yeah this game has some building in it, but it is even more shallow than Facebook games like ""Hayday"". Yes, this game has some policy options which does not effect gameplay in any meaningful way. These two things are not main part of the game, they are just spices to make player sure that he actually is not playing some kind of ""Candy Crush"".That is also a lie. This game heavily resembles Candy Crush. Actually, if I were to sum it up, ""Candy Crush with tower defense elements."" That is not as bad as it sounds, since we all know about addictiveness of candy crush. Gameplay mechanics are rather solid, most of the weapons and skills has their own uses. Policy options are just there for the sake of feeling like a king, not a 3-matcher. Soldiers have their own uses as well, but Scouts (the elite ones) maybe a bit unbalanced since they are the obvious choose for almost all missions.I got this game from Humble Bundle, which also includes Paranautical Activity, Stacking and Windforge. The funny part is I got that bundle for Stacking. But this was the game I played most among those. Why? It is addicting. It gives sense of success. But if u despise mechanics of Candy Crush, you wont like this game. This is guaranteed, It has more complex mechanics when it comes to battles, but the main part is the same.I have two more complaints. One: Resource system is a bit unbalanced. You earn money by waiting, you can earn some infinitesimal money in battle as well, which has no practical uses. Every thing needs wood. Almost nothing needs ore. And you wont need food after you upgraded your town center to level 5. Yes, it should not be more complex than this since this is basically a match 3 game but if these mechanics exist I would want it to be more gamey.Second. After all this time, (and this is actually the second game first being Tower of Elements) there are still some gamebreaking bugs. If you use some spells which alters the gameboard too much (like Landslide, Tornado etc), and dont wait it to be completed, some cells includes two different colors which is practically impossible to complete the chapter after that. If you wait after using those spells no bug is there, I guess if there is a restriction on using heavy skills one after other, the way it is restricted should not be via a bug.But still. If you find this game cheap. Real cheap. Under 4 dollars even, I would recommend it if you like such casual games. Since it got me hooked, and I actually finished it with most of achievements unlocked, I feel obliged to recommend it. By the way, this game will be fun for achievement hunters as well since it has well defined goals. Just dont be deceived by claims of the game about being a political simulator, true successor of Sim City 3000 etc, and if you cant find a good deal, go online and search for similar games for free.

												This isn't your mother's relaxed session of Candy Crush. Things get hectic during the match 3 based battles, and an added layer of spells, items and supporting troops with specific abilities makes it a much deeper experience. The varying board layouts and boss battles up the challenge, even for a match 3 veteran, and that's just at the Normal difficulty.The citybuilding and RPG side are light, but a good way to break up the battles and give you options on what to unlock and upgrade. The endless tower mode keeps things going past the story and allow you to continue upgrading your city and unlock the top level spells and items.FrogDice has really upped their game with this one, and support their products well post-release. I was a Kickstarter backer on this and played quite a lot during the beta phase, so I have a bunch more hours in this game than Steam reports.			"

												To be honest, if this were a $4.99 game, I'd have recommended it. I picked this up as part of a bundle, so I thought I'd give it a shot.Overall, I found the concept fun, though extremely similar to free or $1 - $3 games on mobile store fronts, so the significantly higher price was a shock.The graphics aren't flashy, and at times feel quite rushed.The sound effects are very boring, as is the soundtrack.Gameplay overall was what you'd expect out of a match 3 game, and it was fairly decent.  The castle defense aproach, with launching spells through the air was a nice take on the genre, and the boss battles were a bit challenging.The town building portion of the game was somewhat interesting, though I admit I didn't get too far into it to say how interesting it ultimately gets.The policy decisions was a nice touch, and tbh I found that the most well thought out aspect of the game.Again, if you see this game in one of the sales for a few dollars and you like match 3 games, go for it, but anything more than that seems over priced considering you can get a similar quality or significantly better game on mobile for free or a few dollars, max.

												I'm a sucker for a good Match 3 game. Everyone needs a little casual in their life, right? ReignMaker is a fantastic choice if you're looking to scratch that itch.To start, the game has some light city-building mechanics from the start. Pick a city with a passive bonus and then use resources such as wood, ore, money, population, money, and food to build and upgrade buildings that provide magic, weapons, defensive units, and extra resources to help build up your city. Once you go into battle, you can use up to two additional troops you have trained to help fight. For example, you can use an archer and a stonethrower to help deal damage while you take care of the rest. Every battle has rows of enemies coming down the line (think Plants vs Zombies). It is up to you to match different elements to deal damage to those enemies before they deal damage to your tower. Every so often quests will pop up such as ""Match 3 fire elements"" that will reward additional resources. You can also use magic and items that have been researched/purchased to help get the upper hand. You will want to ensure you use EVERYTHING at your disposal. While the game starts out very easy, the boards become more complex and new mechanics get thrown in such as corrupted elements that will make it so nothing it cast once the match is made. Post battle you are presented with an event that occurred while you were at battle. These events allow you to choose a policy or a method for dealing with the particular issue at hand. While some policies have an immediate effect, others have a small or a slow growing effect that become more apparent the longer you play. So far it has served as an interesting piece of storytelling and each policy is complete with an outcome once you make a choice so you are never left with a feeling of ""so what?"" Some events have be humorous, and others have been tales of love lost and found (and some deal with poop because who doesn't like some good ol' fashioned toilet humor?). There is a definite variety to the policy portion of the game.Rounding all of this out is a thorough Bestiary (as FrogDice games are known for) that lets you see your foes up close and personal and a pretty decent soundtrack. The voice acting isn't anything to write home about but it serves the purpose. The graphics are, again, nothing to clamor over but they are charming and the purpose is served. This is a game that is all about the gameplay and it certainly delivers in full. If you're familiar with other FrogDice games and have enjoyed them, you can expect more of what makes a FrogDice game worth playing in ReignMaker. If you are unfamiliar with FrogDice games but enjoy a good Match 3 game, definitely pick this one up. There is a level of depth in this one that I haven't seen in a Match 3 in some time. Icing on the cake: you can sit back in your chair and just play with the mouse; no need for the keyboard (other than to put in the name of your city in the beginning). Doesn't get much better than that.			"

												I'm just finishing last achievements and I'm done with this game (100% complete).I'm going to divide this review on 2 different view points.I love match3 games and at the beginning I fell in love with this one, simple but great idea, every match create attack (depends what you match). I was playing years ago similar browser game, there you had your character and monsters - every match was causing your character move with his sword or magic, this is really nice kind of game, which I enjoyed like nothing else. Here's additionally a city which you administrate, making it bigger, inventing new spells or special attacks, gathering resources, I have to say it's pretty well thought. But it was lasting only first ~34 hours (when I played half year ago), after that ""long"" time, the game is getting repeatable, so it's rather not a game which you want to replay more than twice.I'm achievement hunter, since I started it, I can't imagine a situation where I won't finish it with 100% achievements done. There are a lot of nice achievements, but most of them are unlocking randomly just while playing, it's not bad... till the game forces you to play more than you would actually enjoy... some of achievements require unbelievable big amount of actions to be done... (like making 100k moves, killing 1k monsters of every kind or replaying game at least 4 freaking times! - for different politics chosen). It's not something to enjoy, after some time it's just getting repeatable and it's pain to do.I finished already this game 7th times + infinite tower (not whole but 30levels), just because I made a mistake in politics and achievements didn't pop up... twice. If there would be ""Mixed"" review I would definitely use it, but since there's nothing like that, I'm RECOMMENDING this game as not everyone is achievement hunter, it was still great to play once or twice.

												I've been playing this game since it was in Beta.  I'm not normally a big Match-3 guy (more into MMOs and FPS, etc), but one of the reasons I have stuck with ReignMaker is that it has a lot of extra elements around the Match-3.  The lite citybuilding is fun, and I like seeing how my citizens are going to look different after I make several policy decisions for the city.  And making matches to have spells shoot out and kill guys attacking my tower is a lot more interesting to me than a puzzle game where I am making matches just for score.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to add a little more strategy to their Match-3 game.			"

												It has the most basic of town building mechanics.  It is very reminicant of the facebook games that take time to build the resource or building,  for example if you want to harvest lumber, you would click on the lumber mill to harvest lumber, and it eould start a countdown timer until the lumer is ready,  this seems like an odd choice for a game that costs money, and does not have micro transactions.  Also the buildings placement and type are pre-defined, and the only choice you have is what order to upgrade them in.  The match 3 game part of it is kinda neat.  Matching 3 in a row sends over bolt of magic a t advancing mobs, but it is more of a frantic rush of tring to find a match.  it is more about finding any match then choosing matches to make a chain reaction.The devs have made some updates to this since launch so thank you devs, but it is still not an interesting enough game for me to recomend			"

												I really enjoyed  this game. I like the developers there friendly and offer advice when people get stuck. If you enjoy a match 3 game then your going to love this game. The graphics are bright and cheerful and the sounds are very good as well. The game has some head bosses but those are mostly able to be beaten very easily. Others take more planning and work.The game does have an Easy mode so that almost any age group can play and have fun. Over all the game is just a lot of fun. After a tough battle you sometimes get to set policy on what to do with an individual you found killing birds to the Boss you just defeated. Should you really grind his bones to dust and throw them on  a fire? I have had a ton of fun of playing this game. I would give it a 9/10 I really enjoy it. I almost deducted a point off because of a boss bug but they have stated that they will fix this bug in a upcoming patch and it can be beaten and passed as its an easy boss to kill.Just as I wrote this up they have fixed the boss bug. So there u go great developers who care and fix things. Another small edit I have finished the game on Easy. I had a ton of fun beating the game and the ending is really fun as well. Will more then likely try it on normal next.			"

												ReignMaker is a match 3 game with a bit of strategic city building and crafting thrown into the mix.It's one of those games where I wish steam had a point based rating system and not this recommend  yes or no. I would give it 3 out of 5 points then. It is fun, but not great and If I hadn't been given it for free in apromotion I wouldn't have bought it. I think that the boss levels are too hard generally. Even on casual some of them are a pain to beat and require lots of grinding earlier levels to gather the resources you need to prepare for those levels. On top of that they are very luck based. If you get a bad board you are screwed.So I can only recommens this one if you get it REALLY cheap on a bargain.			"

												This game brings more to the traditional Match-3 genre.  While the main gameplay centers around that, it also concentrates around the city that you establish and develop while trying to defend different 'towers'.  Your city, as it grows, helps you with defending the towers more easily, and as you defend the towers, you get more resources to develop your town.  There's also a policy system with a sort of random story element, which also gives hidden bonuses depending on which paths you pick.			"

												Fun casual game in the ""match-3"" puzzle genre with a cool twist. You make matches to ""shoot"" a variety of ranged attacks on approaching enemies. Some enemies are more resistent to different attacks (minor void minions are resistant to void rune attacks and I think the turtles might be resistant to water rune attacks). You can also use spells, weapons, and NPCs to defend your tower. You manage a town with automated resource gathering (a nice feature!), spending those resources on building upgrades, hiring NPCs, spell and weapon research, weapon inventory, and town population growth. Currently it seems that the demand for wood resource far outpaces your collection rate. Each farmer/lumberjack/smelter NPC hired will increase the gather rate for that resource by 1% (currently capped at 20%). Wood, food, and ore resources accumulate in real-time in each of their respective buildings. Just don't forget to click on ""Collect"" to move the resources out of the building because each resource building has a limited capacity and won't accumulate beyond it. Upgrade buildings to increase the cap.If you get too serious about gathering resources, this game can be a bit of a grind as you repeat levels over and over to earn triads (game currency used for equipment and upgrades) - so just relax! It's a casual match-3 game.The game developers participate in the steam game forum - they're quite friendly and helpful.			"

												ReignMaker is a casual game that combines tile swapping, tower defense, idle clicking (gathering resources for upgrading your village) and even some light-hearted decision making that might grant you some bonuses.There's some good potential in tile swapping / tower defense combo and I admit that some of the levels are pretty fun because the tiles are locked or corrupted etc. The reason I'm still giving this game thumbs down is that I didn't enjoy the town building stuff at all. At the point the levels finally offered some real challenge, upgrading the town and dealing with the seemingly pointless decision making started to get annoying. There isn't enough stuff going on in the village to justify the fact that it's a pretty big part of the game. The village mechanics are very basic and the graphics are unappealing. It takes time for the derpy villagers to gather resources and research spells, and the only way to pass that time is to replay old levels again and again until I finally get the upgrade I need. Maybe I'm just impatient, I don't know. Life is short.So yeah, the game's mildly amusing, but the village business slows things down. Just my two cents, though.  ReignMaker seems popular enough, so do give it a try if you can get it for a couple of dollars. (I personally don't think it's worth more than that.)EDIT: The resource system is definitely unbalanced. You can hoard all the money you want, but there's not enough wood. No matter how many lumberjacks you have roaming about your village, there's simply not enough wood. I would get that if this was a micropayment game, but there's no option to buy resources to speed things up.			"

												I've been playing match three games since I was a kid, although we didn't have video games back then, so it was mostly matching small stones and goat knuckles.  The point is, I've seen it all.  Aside from the things I have not seen, of course.  So what does ReignMaker bring to the table, that makes it good, or even gooder?  Well.There is the match three, of course, which is a very clear cut genre, but yoiu see, it is also a tower defense, as your matched blocks create magical bolts that fire upon the waves of attacking, um, evil things.  You can also learn spells that bolster your ability to blast molten death upon the deserving heads of the aforementioned evil things.In between bouts of match three tower defense, you can return to your village, where you as mayor, or whatever, get to improve buildings, hire workers, research items and spells, and even respond to situations by creating government policies, which can sometimes give bonus items, or cause new items to appear in your town.Overall, I find enough variety in ReignMaker to keep things fresh, and the only complaint I have is that lumber production is so slow it can actually slow your progress, as lumber is needed for anything you want to build.  That is fairly minor though, and the developers are actually responding to people on the forums, which is pretty amazing in this day and age where so many games are in early access, or simply released and abandoned, or abandoned in early access.Anyway, good game, check it out.  Or not.  Up to you really, I have no stake in it :P			"

It's half like Bejeweled, half like Plants vs Zombies. Literally. Matching 3+ on one side will shoot at the enemies on the other side. You can buy/use defenses & weapons to help the battle, too.IGNORE THE TRAILER AND SCREENSHOTS! The first half suggests this is a God game. It's nothing of the sort. The town hub provides upgrades in battle & in later stages this is a bit of a grind, but I've enjoyed MANY hours with this game because of the well-balanced core gameplay.			"

												Iniitially I really liked this game, but it quickly became tedious. The city-building aspect is on a timer and everything is sooooo slow; you can't just sit down and play, you have to wait for a really slow timer (like on a Facebook game) before you research items or have enough lumber to build anything. Some of the boss battles were also quite frustrating - I finally quit the came when I encountered a boss that I can't come close to beating, and don't want to wait the hours (literally, many hours) it will take for the upgrades I need so I have a chance to beat them.

												Enjoyed the game, played it to the end - I always like a ""two games at once"" game.Despite the words ""tower"" and ""defense"" occurring in the description, this is thankfully not a tower defense game. It's primarily a match-three game (Bejewelled etc), with the secondary game being destroying monsters that are advancing towards your grid. Each rune (jewel/fruit/whatever) you destroy by matching shoots out a bolt towards the monsters, so you [sometimes] have to focus on matching runes that are on the same line as the closest monsters. I was a bit surprised when things falling into a line of 5 does not have the special effect you get when moving things into a line of 5, but I think it's a good design decision, it makes the bonus effects more skill-based.There's also a 'town' section for buying additional powers and tools, which further adds to the depth of the game. Unfortunately it takes a small leaf from 'social' games in having resources which build up over time in addition to resources you earn. Both kinds are needed, which means if you play the game through to the end in a few sessions you won't have accumulated enough resources to try out even half of the upgrades.Missed opportunity; a boss battle in which you have to shoot the boss with particular types of runes would have been nice. I'd say wrong runes healing him 1/4 as much as the correct rune does damage, so that shooting wrongly is harmful, and the boss changing 'shield' color to the color you must hit with a second after each hit would have been a nice more-skilled touch. (Instead most of the boss battles were just ""match threes as fast as you can, near the boss row, and it'll probably work out"".) There was a boss that changed shield color and seemed to deflect shots sometimes, but it wasn't clear what the color meant and just shooting *more* shots protected you against the deflected shots so you didn't really need to figure it out.

												This game is a gem. A gem matching gem. Actually a rune matching, sorry. Great game with a lot of aspects: building, gear crafting, upgrading, hiring, researching, deploying troops. Sounds complex, eh? In reality ReignMaker is easy to understand. It's fun. Nice battle system, tons of achievements, casual addictive gameplay, challenging levels, that are (surprisingly) not repetitive. Also: BOSS battles that will increase your heart rate for sure. Puzzle Quest lovers will adore this game, I think. This is a second Frogdice game I heart.  8/10			"

												I really wanted to like this game, and for the first couple of levels, I was having a blast. Puzzle based combat mixed in with resource management and policy decisions was something that I really like about ReignMaker. Then I ran into the levels where it is possible through no fault of your own, to end up with a puzzle board that has no valid moves, thus dooming you to fail that level, and lose any units or one-time use power-ups you used during the battle. This alone turns an amazing idea into a broken, unfair game. If it wasn't for this problem, I would recommend this game whole heartidly, but I cannot.			"

												This is a bit different. It's a match-3 game, and your matches emit elemental force beams that attak the monsters which are attacking the tower within which you're making matches. If successful, you earn money and other thiings, if you're quick enough to click on the loot and treasure left on the battlefield.Then, it's back to the city, where you can spend your hard-earned loot on building up a city which will produce spells and items which, used judicially, can move tiles around,destroy one tile, destroy 5 at once, swap two tiles, etc. So, it's also a city building game. It's quite addictive, and highly recommended for a tougher-than-you-might-think little action game, with more depth than you'd expect,			"

												This is a great little game. I have had lots of fun playing it. You get to manage a town, collect resources, and battle to protect your town from invading monsters.The battle system is a classic match-3 style game, but when you make a match, it fires elemental bolts at the approaching enemies.So Match-3 + Tower defense sorta.You get money and resources from fighting, and you collect resources in town, upgrade your town buildings, manage your citizens, and make decisions on how to run things.The decisions you make affect your playthrough and can give you hidden bonuses (like I have moved my culture enough toward favoring magical research that I just received a ""discount"" on casting spells).Overall, very fun game. It's a good game to pick up, play a few rounds and put down, or you can easily play it for hours.Definitely recommend!			"

												Great idea, childish execution. I wanted to like this game more, it has a lot of potential combinding a match 3 with a castle building idea but there was just not enough polish on this game to make it fun. The mouse controls are just not as responive as you need them to be for this sort of game. It also has a bit of a learning curve you need to take. If there are no matches on the bottom and you have no magic to fix it you are screwed if you are attacked down there. If they spend the time to clean up the issues it would make the game 10x better			"

												This game is a cross between Bejeweled/Candy Crush and Tower Defense.  When you make matches, bolts of magic fly out from that row towards the oncomming enemies.  There isn't really any ""pathing"".  Enemies simply advance toward your city and start attacking your walls until you lose or you beat them.  You can also ""build a city"" that simply exists for you to unlock items, spells, and heroes to use later on.  The one downside is that you do not know how many waves of enemies remain, so it can get frustrating at times to plan out how you'll make some of your matches.There are a LOT of acheivmements in the game, but you get many of them simply by playing.  They are more about you playing like you normally would and you'll just magically get them.  There are probably only a few that take a little bit of planning.  During each round, you can get special missions that when completed give you a few resources.  In the end, they are often not worth the effort because you may end up losing resources when you are required to use an item.Some of the boards are very difficult to play since you have a narrow opening in which to make matches, making you rely on spells.  Spells are recharged by making matches, but don't cost any resources, at least.Overall, the game is fun and combines multiple game generes pretty well.  I recommend it! :)			"

												I've played the DRM free version A LOT longer than what my ""hours played"" status above says.This is a fun 'Match 3' puzzle game with light city building/management elements. You can research spells and items, recruit Citizens that help not only in combat, but improve your resource gathering and research speeds too.You can recruit Citizens from the town and take them into the Match-3/Defense puzzle. Each Citizen has different abilities. There are 5 types of Offensive/Battle Citizens in total, and each has 2 tiers, making 10 in total, which you unlock by upgrading the Town Hall. For example, a Tier 1 Scout will run out into the field and pick up gold and scrolls that enemies drop when killed, but a Tier 2 Scout will not only run out and collect more frequently, but leave a bomb which explodes in a few seconds, damaging/killing enemies nearby.You can also craft items that can be used in battle. To craft them you not only need to research them in the Armory, but have the resources too. A Dagger and Sword can be used directly on enemies to damage them to varying degrees. You can drop explosive pills on groups of enemies to kill them  all. You can drop barricades, training dummies, and oil to slow down enemies, and quite a few more.And finally, you can research spells at the Academy and use them in battle. The effects range from destroying sections of the game board, which launches the elements at the enemies, or perhaps rearranging the board completely. There's quite a few more. You don't need resources to research or 'craft' the spells, they only need money and a bit(a lot) of time to unlock initially. Oh, and the Academy itself needs to be upgraded in order to research the various tiers of spells. So the Academy needs to be level 3 in order to research tier 3 spells. Once researched, you can cast it as many times as you want, with a cooldown of course. By cooldown, I mean '40 Matches' or '80 Matches'. And thats matches as in 'matching gems', not entire games. Matches made when gems are cascading count too.When you actually go into battle, you're allowed to equip a loadout that can be changed at anytime outside of battle. You can equip 6 Spells, 6 Items, and 2 Citizens. Citizens and Items are depleted when used, so you need to craft/recruit them before running out. Spells aren't depleted, but you need to wait for the cooldown. All items and spells are hotkeyed to 'QWERTY' and '123456' for easy access, the Citizens are hotkeyed to '09'. All hotkeys can be changed.The 'Conquest Map' is where you choose your battles. On the map there are areas, each with 4 towers initially, and when you beat those, a boss battle tower is shown. Once the boss is defeated, a new area is unlocked.I really enjoyed this game, and definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Match-3 games and/or puzzle quest.			"

												TL:DR: A  match 3/tower defense with a *very* lightweight city builder attached. Lots of little goals plus achievements is a great bonus. It is similar bto the Puzzle Quest series, and fans of that series should  pick this up. It it really simple but the battles can get pretty complex. It seems to have been built for a touchscreen and not a mouse though. Its overpriced at $14.99, $4.99-$9.99 seems much more reasonable. Overall though, its fun if you like puzzle/RPGs.When I first saw this released, I ignored it. It looked like a casual puzzle game that was a mobile port. And it was pricy for that style of game. Then I saw a friends review who liked it. I've been really hard up for ANY games lately due to the deluge of mobile crap, so I grabbed it. Yes, I know, counter intuitive. But hey, I can't hate on something Ive never experienced.Normally I'm not a fan of puzzle games, but I did love and play the hell out of the Puzzle Quests (the first one was better than the second and Galactrix IMHO, but all are good), and also liked Puzzle Chronicles. All of those had some sort of strange addictive quality, even though without the RPG component, puzzle games are boring as hell and pointless in my eyes.  So I grabbed ReignMaker.For starters, the graphics are appropriate. They are bright, colorful, and cartoony 3d images. It lends the game a good feel that fits well with the game style. The music is cheerful and the sound is decent, although the doo-do-DO-DOO (the typical ""charge"" horn noise) that starts a battle is annoying as hell. Other than that, I laughed at the *very* badly narrated intro that starts the game. The images are cool, a stained glass style picture scrolling by and explaining the backstory. But the voice..oh god. It sounds like a wanna-be old man with a bad head cold attempting to do the stereotypical ""fantasy world king"" accent. And failing. I had trouble understanding some of what he was saying, and it sucked cuz there was no subtitles.So the gameplay. Its like an *extremely* light city builder/resource manager, mixed with a match 3 puzzle that is also a tower defense game. The city builder is simple. There are places you can buy using resources and the places help you. Theres also policies, which are little events. You have 4 different choices of how to deal with the event, and the results of the choice affect your city. I have havent really explored too much of the city building aspect yet, so I will update when I do.UPDATE: Its really simple. Half the buildings generate timed resources, the other half researches itemss. You can upgrade the buildings to get better battle items, spells, and troops. I hesitate to even call it a builder. More of a resource manager.The other aspect of the game is decently fun. Its the battle. You start, and you can earn items from buildings in your city that help you. There are many of them all with different effects. So its a tower defense meets match 3. On the left is your tower, filled with different elemental shapes and other icons that you match. Walking in from the right are enemies, many different types. They dont move up and down, but travel in a straight line towards your tower (at least at the stages im at now, dont know if they do later). When you match 3, a bolt of the associated element spits out of your tower and travels right, hitting any enemies in its path. Thing is, the bolt travels in the row you matched it in. So if theres an enemy in the 2nd row down matching an element in the 3rd 4th and 5th row down wouldnt hit it because the elemental bolts would be flying in the 3rd 4th and 5th row. There are also many other icons, both helpful and harmful/annoying. You can collect ""scrolls"". Each scroll creates an entry in a book where you can see the stats of each enemy and a brief description and images.In addition there are little challenges you can do to gain resources, such as ""match 4 fire elements"" ""use a heal icon"" ect. All of this plus a ton of achievements and other little things makes this overall a fun lgame.Its a little pricy for 14.99, but any fan of the puzzle quest type match 3s will love it. Get it on mobile if it exists there (Not sure, but judging by it it sure seems to be),			"

												ReignMaker is an interesting take on the match-3 genre, adding a whimsical personality to a game-type of which many may have thught no new game needed to be made. Well, ReignMaker did. Matching tiles means something: you are defending a world from hordes of evil. And not only are you defending it, you will see it grow and care for its inhabitants, as you run your own little town in this world.The town is a major part of the game. Here you train units to help you in your battles, create equipment and research spells. And you produce the resources with which to do all that. But more than that, you make decisions that will make the town feel unique: whenever you beat a new level, a policy decission will be presented to you, asking you to guide your town. How do you handle crop failure? Do you let that reknown berserker settle in your town? What do you say about theatrical plays that corrupt our youth?All these decission will affect your town one way or another. You may get a free scholar to help your reseach. You may end up with more rabbits around your town or piles of purple fungal mold. And your citizens may live in a republic or end up in an oppresive tyranny. It is up to you. Either way, it will be cute and humorous. Just don't listen to the random citizen who will want to move to Troj. There is always one person like that. Can't please them all.One warning though: this game gets really tough.			"

Really fun to pick up for a few quick games. It might get a bit grind-y on some bosses if you aren't wise with the money or resources you spend so keep that in mind and always think before upgrading a certain building.I definitely recommend it if you're into match-3 games with some quirky humor injected in it.

												This is a bizarre sort of castle defense game based on puzzle solving as the main combat mechanic. I think perhaps there are some design issues with the puzzle solving part though because it looks like you can die mostly due to bad luck with the initial arrangement of the pieces. The so called ""city building"" aspect of the game isn't real city building in my opinion. Personally I would recommnd skipping this one even if the price is $1 or less.			"

												Ever think match-3 games are boring? That's why Reignmaker is Awesome. This game adds rpg, town management, and tower, er, lawn? defense, and makes a coherent, fun, sometimes irreverant and hilarious experience. Basically, you start in a town that requires upgrades to expand it's production capabilities. You go to battle to get the currency resource, and the battles consist of the match-3 game inside of a tower, with baddies moving to attack your tower from one side, Plants vs Zombies style. As you make matches, bolts fly out to hit the incoming mobs, and bigger matches obviously deal bigger damage. Chaining combos together never had so much meaning in a match 3 game. Town upgrades allow you to bring clickable weapons, spells, and a couple of soldiers (of all types, from healers, to scouts who run out and grab coins, to archers etc) to battle. So, battle helps you build the town, and upgrading the town helps you battle. In town you choose what buildings to upgrade first, what spells and weapons to research, who to hire and so forth. Often when you win a few new battles, you will return to the town and have to make a Decision. These are mayoral type decisions that are often the lesser of two evils, or some other difficult decision, but generally, the answers aren't at all punishing and simply offer one buff or another. The writeups are really fun and playful. The townies are 'cute' and often catch you off guard by saying things you didnt expect. ""I, FOR ONE, WELCOME OUR NEW OVERLORDS""   --freakin best Simpsons quote ever! Yeah I caught that! Sorry for the spoiler. moving on.. Some of the battles are quite challenging, and you will find yourself trying different tactics and mixes of spells, weapons and units to overcome a boss. Or the ""O"" shaped towers. Those are the worst. Often I'll just launch and jump into a normal battle, and there I am, simply playing match 3, but at the same time I'm building up my resources and stuff. If I recall correctly at the time I write this, it's a ""drag the window to resize it to anything"" game, so it's super easy to play in a window, which is nice if you're a multitasker like me. There's over 100 achievements, a monster database, and other odds and ends to collect & achieve. On a side note, the only negative I can think of is Lumber seems to be the bottleneck for resources. This is a game where some resources continue to build even when the game is closed, so many times I've launched the game just to gather the lumber even when I don't plan on playing. So, the only negative I can think of is easily worked around through the natural mechanics of the game. Seriously, if you play ANY match-3 game, I can't see why this wouldn't be at the TOP of your list. It's great!			"

												If you like Match-3 games you'll probably like ReignMaker. The meat of the game is in the battles, where you play match-3 on one side of the screen while monsters attack on the other. The matching is pretty straightforward (you get some spells you can cast to shuffle or destroy tiles, you get bonuses for matching 4 or more at once, there are locked and frozen tiles, etc) but the combat side is pretty interesting - at first I just ignored it and focused on making matches at the bottom of the screen so that matches on top would happen automatically, but it's actually worth paying attention to where monsters are and trying to line up matches in the right place, especially against later bosses when you need to keep them stunned to avoid being hurt. Also, items can be used on the battlefield side to deal with monsters, and they drop a lot of loot and collectable scrolls that are worth getting.The town part of the game has good parts and bad parts. Resource production happens in real time, so you can just leave the game running and make as much ore and wood as you need (though money only comes from battles). This is where windowed mode would have been nice. After every new level you beat, your town faces a new dilemma you have to choose the outcome of. The dilemmas are well written but don't seem to have any actual gameplay consequences.Steam says I've played 4 hours, and I've beat almost half the levels, so I'd guess the total playtime will be 10 hours for one play-through. There are different towns you can play as but they have only minor differences so replaying with a different town wouldn't be too different of an experience.Update: Frogdice thoughtfully contacted me and corrected some screw-ups I made. The big one is that there IS a windowed mode, it's the last option on the options screen, and I managed to completely miss it. Another one is length: I've now done 34 levels (out of 50) with 8 hours played, so the game could end up being around 15 hours in one play through, not just 10. There's also an infinite tower after beating the game, but I can't speak to that.			"

												Ever wanted to play a game that crammed so many sub-genres into it that it became its own genre of game? Well ta da! It’s happened! Enter ReignMaker, a game that has a horde element, a match 3 puzzle element, a kingdom sim/management aspect, conquest map, quests, RPG elements, tower defense, political management, and more. What doesn’t this game do?The creator of ReignMaker is Frogdice Inc. The following is a quote from them that I think sums up their games very well: “Core meets casual as we combine many different styles of gameplay in a fun, immersive experience.” ReignMaker and Dungeon of Elements are the two games that Frogdice Inc. currently have available on Steam, and today we will take a closer look at ReignMaker. 30 Second Review+ Match 3 puzzle game+ Easy-to-learn gameplay+ Kingdom simulator- Must enjoy casual gameplay- Will require a lot of time to unlock everythingClick the link below to read the full review!http://everydaygamers.com/2014/06/17/review-reignmaker/#more-30041 "

												I picked this up as part of a bundle and was initially fairly intrigued by the concept. Sadly, upon playing the game, I was quickly disappointed.The city building aspect is lacklustre and feels more suited to a Facebook game, with only a few buildings available, no choice over which ones to build or where they are placed, and wait times to harvest the resources they produce.The policy decisions don't feel like they have any lasting effect though I'm still at a fairly early point in the game so I could be wrong about this part.The match-3 gameplay itself is quite fun, each match you make sends out energy bolts to attack the waves of enemies coming at your tower from the other side of the screen. You can also use the resources gathered in the town and money earned in battles to purchase spells, units and weapons to assist in destroying the enemiesUnfortunatley the difficulty level increases quite suddenly from stupidly easy to frustratingly hard, usually resulting in needing to replay completed levels repeatedly to grind enough money to purchase units, upgrade the town, etc..., which gets old fairly quickly.If you find this in a bundle, or on deep sale, then it's not a bad little game to waste an hour or so on every now and then but I really can't recommend it at the current price point.

												Rating: 6/10Addictive Match 3 game with a twist. Like Gyromancer/Puzzle Quest, this game adds a lot to a game that would've otherwise been a simplistic puzzler. You get to build and manage your own city, and make some decisions regarding your policies as you progress in the game. The mechanics here are simple and basic though, so don't expect this to be a city simulator like SimCity. The Match 3 puzzles are mixed with a Tower Defense mechanic - It basically destroys the monsters in the lane you create a match. There are plenty of spells/power-ups here so it doesn't get too monotonous and has some strategic depth. The graphics are charming and has a Fable-like feel. So this pretty much is the ideal game for you if you want to get into puzzle games.			"

												I'm typically not a big fan of match 3 games. But I do like building up cities and Reignmaker combines this with a very addictive version of the match 3 tower defense genre. The city building portion provides you with resources (such as spells and equipment) that aid you in the match 3 aspect of the game. As you build up your city, It also has a roleplaying element where you determine the city's polcies and the game tells you what the outcome was. Bottom line: the game is fun.			"

												I was able to download this game this morning and start playing.  It seems to be a well thought out, well planned game.  It is more than just the typical match 3 game where you spend your time pounding out combinations without any other depth to the game.  It seems that they drew on some of the best elements of what makes games potentially great: (1) solid core concept, (2) great design, (3) outer elements from the core to keep it interesting.While I have only played for an hour, I anticipate that I will keep playing.  This was a good purchase and one that I would highly recommend.			"

												While I haven't been playing this game long enough to come up with a well formed opinion about it, it does look like it could be a lot of fun. It seems to combine between three main gameplay elements: colony management, match-3 puzzles and tower defense. I'm not sure how well balanced the game is for my taste, I still have my doubts about how long it can keep me interested, but then again - it's too early to tell. I promise to update while I accumulate more game time and form my opinion.			"

												ReignMaker is a match-3 game similar to Bejewled or Candy Crush Saga, where your matches are used to kill invaders coming after you. Overall, this game is a mediocre time waster that falls way short of its promises. I'm going to copy/paste the first line of its Steam store page: ""ReignMaker is a city building political strategy game with match-3 tower defense combat."" Calling this game  a city builder, a political strategy game, or a tower defense game is a serious insult to those genres, and this is coming from someone who enjoys those types of games.You technically build a city, yes, but the ""city building"" is little more than waiting to collect resources and upgrading buildings. The only choice you make is what order you build things in. There's no real planning, no infrastructure building, and really, nothing interesting at all about this city building parts. They only serve as a vessel to get you upgrades, and are absolutely no fun on their own. Also, resource collection is really annoying. I never had nearly enough lumber, so I had to wait for hours, checking in every 30 minutes to harvest. Another annoyance is the gold, which appears on the ground as you fight. It spawns so frequently that it's a huge distraction from the puzzle, and you won't get nearly enough if you don't pick it up. Scouts are a necessity if you want to progress since they take that element out, but that's one fewer person you can take into tough levels.There is technically political strategy, yes, but it amounts to a series of questions, one per level, that almost never have any consequences at all. When there are, they're minor at best. It has all the depth of an Internet quiz. After making choices, you can find out your city's ""culture"", which matters none at all, really.When it says it's a ""tower defense"" game, though, that's completely misleading. In a tower defense game, you place towers strategically to impede and attack units that are trying to get through, and that's not what this game has. In this game, you defend towers with match-3 combat.Now, for the match-3 elements. The core match-3 gameplay is present in this game, and it does provide some challenge. The spells and the people you hire are interesting additions that shake things up. This game suffers from poor design decisions overall, though. The difficulty curve is a mess, with a huge spike at level 10 before varying wildly between really easy and very difficult. The boss battles are mostly luck; you have to attack very rapidly with matches and spells and hope that you get enough combos to win before your opponent murders you (even worse, you can defeat the boss but still lose the match and be forced to replay). Also, some of the levels are excessively long, which really sucks when you run out steam and lose 20 minutes in to a level.This isn't the worst game I've played, not by a long shot. I still played this game to the end, probably just because the match-3 combat was enough to hold my interest for a while. This game is really heavily flawed, though, and it spectacularly fails to deliver on its promises. Sadly, this game is little more than a time waster, which isn't good enough for me. It looks like this game is still being worked on, however, so hopefully some things can be ironed out, but it will never be a ""city building political strategy game"" with ""tower defense combat"". Ultimately, this game is just a second-rate Puzzle Quest. This game's a joke at $15. I think I can only recommend this game if you can find it for $2 or less.			"

												""It’s a pretty hectic game and certainly not the “Match-3″ cut and paste product I was expecting.  The town management aspect is simplistic, perhaps a bit too simplistic for my tastes.  I do appreciate what it does however in that it gives me a sense of progression.  Earning and spending resources gives me a reason to keep playing and luckily, you can grind earlier levels should you come up against something you’re not ready for.  It would have been better (in my opinion) if the resources were gained over time automatically as opposed to prodding the process along manually every few minutes…though this is a minor complaint.  I have to give the game credit though for trying something new…”ReignMaker” is unlike anything I’ve played up to this point.  For that reason alone, you should probably give it a go.  The game is currently retailing for $14.99 on Steam, which is a fairly good price for the content offered.""Full Review: http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/reignmaker/Gameplay Video:

												7.4/10I recommend this game in my opinion. It may be a matching game, but still. It has the potential to be at its' greatest with it's Rpg Graphics and City Gameplay. My time in gameplay may change, due to it's somewhat addictive content this game have. Some suggestions for the makers is making an Rpg Game somewhat like this game like Tower Defense, but with movement dealing with WASD or Mouse Clicking. With these graphics, the game can be very good if they put a lot of work into it.			"

												I just got done playing this for like the last hour or so. I'm having a lot of fun with this game and it goes beyond just enjoying a match 3. In a normal match 3 you're focused on the board so you can discover opportunities for 4s and 5s or better, but there is a lot more to this game. You've got monsters creeping up to your base so you've got to make the matches that line up with them to destroy them and they might even drop some loot. Of course, you have to click on it to get it. Do you have time? What about that special gem you just scored on the board? Click it? The monsters are wailing away at your wall so you better decide fast! It's a lot to take in all at once. That's just the battles. In between, you need to rule your kingdom with policies and deeds, improve the city buildings, train citizens, and much more. The improvements to the city result in the ability to earn even better weapons and spells for the battlefield. What more could you ask for? Troops? Got it! Now, you can deploy troops on your wall and I must say they are smashing (people who have played will get it). When do you deploy those troops? Do you take archers? Healers? Scouts? What about your equipment? Dummies? Swords? Exploding capsules? There are tons of combinations to let you deal with the battlefield and a great ""RPG Interface"" for improving them. The city is an absolutely awesome addition to this and really makes it a lot of fun.Just when you think aww, man is this thing just gonna be a match 3 grin--WTF is that?! An enormous boss stomps onto the screen and the fight is on. This is no easy task and it gets harder as you progress to many different and interesting bosses. Luckily, the art is totally charming so the journey is enjoyable and it is really livened up with a solid soundtrack that sets the mood. The writing is fun and the game seems very appropriate for kids and adults alike.			"

												ReignMaker is a super adictive puzzle game.  You're given a board full of tiles with a wave of oncoming enemies off to the side.  All you do is make matches and watch the bolts fly.  The city building provides you with resources to build weapons, learn spells, and hire warriors to aid you in battle.  The sim part is lighter than I expected, but it hads a fun element to the game.  Each time I beat a level I get presented with a decision to make as leader of the town.  Once, while I was away defending the kingdom, one of my villagers basically invented Candy Crush Saga.  It was almost the downfall of my civilization.  Not to mention the abilities of the higher tier druid allow them to send exploding sheep straight for your enemies.  In general, I really enjoyed this game.  I do think that the resoruce gathering needs a little tweaking, as it took me a lot longer than I would have liked to build things.  So I would just find a level I liked and play it over and over to kill time and earn gold so I could buy more warriors.  Certianly a good buy if you like these types of puzzle games.  It was the entire reason I bought a Humble Bundle.			"

												There are good match 3 games - Puzzle Quest (especially part 1) if you enjoy rpg elements, Bejeweled 5 if you want more puzzling less spells. This is neither. The game feels like a concept of a fecebok game - click on your mine to collect materials, it givs you 1 gold/second and holds max 35 gold. You can upgrade it to hold more gold. Sounds familiar?The gameplay looked like fun, only to turn out to be imbalanced. You can approach a boss 20 times and fail, only to switch a lucky rock and unleash a barrage of bulets obeliterating everything in its ay. Sonds like fun until you realize that it has nothing to do with your skill. It's pure luck game.Pick this only if you like slot machines gameplay: start a game: ""nope, start a game - nope, ... start a game - aww ysss I am awesome!""			"

												I really REALLY wanted to like this game. I was really anxious to pick the game up because of the number of achievements.  I though I would enjoy several play throughs to earn them all.  After 10 hours,  I'm grinding through just to finish the campaign to call it done.The novelty of match 3 meets tower defense meets city builder wears off pretty fast.  I've left the game running hours on end for resource collection for the city building.  The ""battle fields"" can present you with un-winnable scenarios without serious item and magic grinding.I think the game is just ""ok"" in too many categories and not really good in any one.

												Simply put this ""easy"" 3 in a row game because nothing but a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for me to play. To click on a stone and switch it with another takes nearly 10 clicks to move it or have it even recognize your existence, the town is lame and adds nothing to the game except for a farmville feeling. The campaign was decent until you get to the Obliterator who insn't fair at all, making you hit his infinite minions who require 3 blasts to take down and there are nearly almost 10 on the field at the same time. Not including how insane the campaign gets after that. If you even focus on the town at all you will need to push through the soggy later campaign to get those little triforces to do anything in the game. The situations you get to do is so lame and even doing the right thing or finding a clever way to solve it does nothing but show a +1 for something and you get no satisfaction out of it, making it a waste of time.  Getting stuck in the campaign with no way to progress or get items because you sunk your triforces into the damn farm means your stuck having to pray you dont find yourself stuck without any combos or switch's and believe me it happens. I can't believe you cant BUY triforces for this $15 game because it reminds me of a bad Candy Crush ripoff with a new twist that makes you want to hurl. Will I play it again? Yes, because this♥♥♥♥♥♥is addicting like heroin, but in the bad way that makes you curl up in a ball and cry about how pathetic you are for continuing something that hurts you so internally. In other words, if you like poopy games that will have gnaw at your brain until you play it again by all means, let's shoot up together.			"

												Reign Maker is Match 3 game set in tone with casual gameplay and rpg aspects. Gem matching, and tower defense combined into one, and done fairly well, with some minor issues on the side. The town building side can be a bit too grindy but the spells off set, to a point the some what random nature of Match 3, and it fits well together.

												Gotta love random sales from steam. Didn't expect to play this as much as I have been so far. Usually casual games i'll play for a little while and then put them down, but having a citybuilding section added a unique flavor to this game, so now I leave it running on my second monitor and play between smite matches while I let my food/lumber/ore build up.I want that big spell so I can DEVASTATE the creeps muahaha.Good work!

												ReignMaker is a match three game where the novelty is waves of attackers coming from the side of the board - meaning you need to focus your mathcing areas at the right height. This basic mechanic is pretty good, and quite well balanced for the most part - the only problem with it being that on bigger board, clearing the bottom row mindlessly is usually enough. In addition to that there's a ""home village"" which you grow as you clea boards... except it grows more like a free to play town.I don't recommend it though for a few reasons:- It has little ""quests"" (clear 5 gems, launch 30 attacks) that mostly frustrate and are often impossible (randomly requires certain equipped items or match 5s where the board is only big enough for 4s.- A gold collection mechanic that means constantly having to click tiny piles of gold on the other side of the screen from the board. Very irritating.- Free to play style resource collection (even though there are no IAPs). The progression feels totally wrecked and resource collection is oh so bad.- Skilled at landing chains? Doesn't matter. Chains only count for basic damage, and if you pop a line of 3 to chain react a 5, the 5 will not count for anything. No bonus gems, doesn't count toward quests... argh. Oh, and get a ""match 30 quickly"" quest? Chained matches don't count. Same for ""match 5 airs"". This seems... well, broken.In summary, this game is so very ""below average"" in every respect, that you'd be better getting some other match 3 game.			"

												Ehhhh.  It's alright, but the difficulty spikes pretty quickly, and then it just becomes a long grind waiting for your town to build the resources you need to reliably win fights.  The progression of grind is so blindingly predictable I immediately got fatigued when I noticed it, and that was basically game over.It's not a bad game, it's just not a game I want to invest the hours into.

												A real-time match-3 strategy game with rpg aspects! Sign me up, right?!Unfortunately, while there are a ton of great ideas in this game, the consolidated execution falls flat. Let's start with the good:City building make you feel more involved in the story. After each mission, you're given a choice which affects the destiny of your city, adding characters and benefits to it, and allowing you to choose the feeling of your city. There's a variety of research spells and items you can use during combat. There are tons of achievements.Now the bad:Pacing: While the real-time adds to the frantic feeling of the game, a lot of the time your efforts are wasted. In many early levels, you find yourself matching for no purpose and no reward except to maneuver the board. A lot of the time you just sit there waiting for the next enemies. Boss attacks are generally too fast to counter. It's hard to maintain view of both your puzzle board and the enemies.City building timers make this feel like a facebook game. Seems like they planned to go the F2P route at one point. Limited resources make you feel like abandoning the city building aspect altogether. Items are single use, and generally worthless for the resource cost. Most of the spells seem ineffectual, and not grand. Achievements are too easy to get: 1/3 of them shouldn't even be considered real achievements as opposed to markers of playing the game.Overall, there's no oomph to this game. It lacks the polish and urgency of a speed match-3 game. It needs more audio or visual feedback when you kill a creature. The city building, spells and equipment aren't complex enough for a strategic game. It's above average in ideas, but it's all too visible flaws make it not worth it in the long run.Recommendation: pass.			"

												Its ok, nothing special.  I was a little disappointed.  The policy decisions didn't feel like they did anything at all.  They sometimes added or changed the people/animals/monsters walking around town but that is purely a graphical change.The building fill their resources in real time, as long as the game is running, so just letting the game sit and do nothing is a valid strategy.  Not interacting with the game being valid seems like the design went off the rails.Also the town choices don't feel like anything.  You always get the cheapest upgrade because that is always where the most bang for the buck is.  The upgrading of buildings feels like an arbitrary slowdown.Its OK but if you want to scratch the same itch as PuzzleQuest keep looking elsewhere.  If you want a generic bejeweled with random town building elements it'll do.			"

												It's amazing how this is totally the same idea as 10,000,000: a match 3 game where the matching helps you defeat monsters in a fantasy setting, and including a persistence in the form of a town or base, and yet this plays really differently.In this, when you match 3 or more blocks they fire magic missiles out of the side of the puzzle area to take out invading monsters. So be warned, it's real time and can get frantic.I didn't much like the devs' earlier game: Dungeon of Elements (not on steam yet), as that had a Dr. Mario gameplay mechanic. This though is great. I love it.It's a bit pricey at full price though. I bought it for 5 uk pounds.			"

												I like it. It's an interesting combination between match-3, tower defence, questing and city building. The core concept is there: match runes to defend your town, harvest resources to upgrade it. It's still heavily unpolished: the graphics aren't very clean, especially for the runes, and city building takes a long time. It's clearly still in alpha...beta...testing phase, but at this moment the developers are responding fast to problems and pushing out fixes.			"

												I've been following Frogdice for a number of years now, and one of the delights of their new games is callbacks to old games. There are a few names in the game that reference other games, and you can see conversations between characters named after other characters in ways that end up, at times, hilarious.But the game does stand alone, in terms of actual playing. It's run in two parts: match-three combat and town building. The latter influences the former, the former funds the latter. The game has a few points where it can get a bit grindy, but there's no penalty to playing a level more than once; and you can try for a better ""score"" (shown by banner color) on a previously-won level.

												It's a match game, but you battle hordes of enemies and even bosses. Plays VERY much like a mobile game, your town and items you buy/make take time to be created which is a pain on PC cause well I'm on the computer to game and not to wait for a new spell to be created.Most of the boards are fun however there are a few which make me want to quit the game, yes they are that bad and annoying. Stated earlier it's a matching game, well some of the boards are not square, or have parts missing that make it hard and sometime near impossible to make a match. While monsters are beating down your towers you're fumbling around trying to make a match to damage them but there is no way. I guess this is why the spells are in the game, they can even out the play field sometimes however they take ""matches"" inorder to come off cooldown. While some spells are 5 matchs (these are pretty crap-tastic spells) the better spells are 50-100 matches till you can use again. It's a fun game but there are a few maps that I beat and felt LUCKY to do so. You have to bring all the items you can, perfect selection of spells and even hire some people in town to help fight on the walls. It's a fun game and worth checking out but has some downsides that I thing the developers could have handled differently.			"

Posted: November 28, 2014
												I'll preface this by noting that ReignMaker is overall enjoyable, and has interesting and unique features compared to other match-3 games that I've played, but overall not worth the full asking price for the game.The core of the game-play is a ""targeted"" match-3 tower defence concept. You will have enemies approaching from the side of your screen and must make matches in the same ""row"" as the enemy. (skeleton approaching at the next-to-top row of your screen? At least one of the element tiles in your match has to be somewhere in that next-to-top row to do any damage to the skeleton.) Matching tiles destroys the tiles, sends out an elemental bolt or fire/water/darkness/whatever ball streaking directly to the side that the enemies are approaching from. Any projectiles that hit an enemy do damage, and some enemies take more or less damage from different elements. This is an interesting change from the usual ""make a match anywhere"" of most match-3 games, but it can get quite frustrating on some of the boss fights where you need to deal a massive amount of damage to a relatively narrow area on the battlefield. Part of the game's charm, but also part of the frustration on harder bosses.Most of the enemies are of the ""advance across the screen and beat upon the wall"" variety, but the bosses have some unique mechanics (such as throwing fireballs that you can destroy if you happen to make a match and toss out a fireball in the exact right place to impact the boss's projectile). These add some definate flavor to the fights, but the relative difficulty of preplanning where the tiles are going to fall make these boss abilities more of a ""counter if you can"" situation and can at times turn downright deadly (if a chain match suddenly bounces a bunch of your own shots off of a boss's reflective force field).To help with this, you can use the resources you gather in town to research/craft/hire various spells/items/defenders. As you level up certain buildings in town, you gain access to more potent enhancements.The spells are reusable abilities with no limt to number of uses but which require you to make a certain number of matches to ""charge up"" the spell. The charge level for each spell carries over from match to match, so you need to make decisions whether to use a spell to help finish a battle or save it to open with on the next battle. Spells can destroy tiles (dealing damage to enemies), heal your fortress, shuffle the board, etc.Crafted items are consumeable (multiples can be stacked, but each time you use the item, your total available is reduced by 1 and you have to build/purchase more before you can use them again). Item effects range from stunning opponents to damaging them to preventing them from moving forward for a short time.Defenders are guard units that walk up and down along the top of your wall, and heal you or shoot arrows/roll bolders at enemies or run and grab dropped treasure, etc. Like items, defenders are consumed on use, and more must be hired to keep a steady supply. You can have two types of defenders active at once (and only one of each can be active at a time).All of these enhancements are bought/researched through the town building minigame, which feels very lackluster. Gold, food, wood, and metal are used as resources for upgrading buildings or purchasing items, etc. While gold is gathered on the battlefield, the other resources have to be gathered in town, by waiting for the appropriate resource-generating building to slowly (and automatically) fill up with a resource, choosing to harvest what's available, and then slowly letting the resource fill up again. While resource building structures automatically fill up with a resource, they do not automatically harvest it, so you have to remember to manually harvest your pumpkins or ironwood or the building will just sit there useless until you empty it out. This plays more like a freemium mobile game's time-limited resource production, and can get quite frustrating later on, when battles take significantly less time than needed for your crops to grow/wood to be milled. It gets quite annoying to have to log on every so often just to gather your resources so you can eventually afford the new spell/stonethrowing guard/shiney bomb that you're waiting for to tip the scales in your favor for the next boss fight.Also with the city building, there is no customization for placing buildings where you want, or adding buildings to enhance particular resource production. You have one place to gather wood. One place to grow food. One place to research spells. Buildings grow as you level them up, but you can't move/rotate/remove/anything. There are a few different ""town themes"" but you can't do any significant customization.The one feature of the town itself that isn't terribly boring is the townsfolk, which wander around and sometimes have thought bubbles that you can click on for an amusing quip. Also, the townsfolk react to some of your victories by asking for ""policy decisions"" where you can pick whether to protect forested areas, anger your local druids, be lenient with thieves, send a beaten boss monster back to a far-away forested area or kill her off, etc. Most of these are humorously written, none seem to have ""wrong"" answers, and none have any effect on game play as far as I can tell.Even with the sometimes-frustrating fights, ReignMaker is a fun-for-a-bit casual match-3 game that's easy to pick up, put down for a few weeks, pick up again, etc., but it's not something that really grabs attention for hours on end. Between that and the lackluster town interface, resource gathering, and research/crafting system, I can't recommend paying full price for this game, especially compared to the asking price of some of the other match-3 games on Steam. If you can get it for 75% off or more (or part of a really-discounted bundle), it'll be an enjoyable game for occasional play. Just avoid buying it for full price unless you really MUST have every match-3 available.			"

												You run a village and defend it from invaders by playing a match-3 game. It adds quite a lot of extras though like making choices about the future of your village, resource management and loads of spells/units/items to use during battles. My only gripe is that enemies approach your castle and you have to match a square on the same row as them to destroy them. This is fine but the maps get a bit... creative, and it can be really difficult to match on certain rows. There are some maps that are diamond-shaped and the top and bottom rows literally only consist of 1-square. It makes it very difficult. Oh, and I think the bosses are a little too hard, as you pretty much always take a lot of unavoidable damage, and your rating afterwards depends on the health of your castle. But mostly it's pretty fun.			"

												This is a Match-3 game with tower defense and minor city-building aspects. The Match-3/Tower Defense is an interesting spin on the genre - matches shoot bolts to the side of the screen, where monsters are attacking, so you have to make matches in the right positions.  It makes the top and bottom really hard to defend.  There are 50 levels, plus an infinite tower, and some are really difficult (and the game starts to get vindictive around table 40).  The gameplay itself is fine, although the time-based resource gathering makes it veer a little too close to Farmville, and the focus on buying perishable defenses (defenders survive for only one round at best, and offensive/defensive weapons).  Recharging spells are nice though, and being forced to choose only five at a time adds some extra strategy.  It took about 13 hours, and lots of replaying earlier levels before I was able to finish.			"

												If you like Match-3 style games then this may be fun. I enjoyed the early stages, but getting further along the game goes from casual fun to plain tedious. Some of that is just the usual match-3 luck of the draw where the player's actions are not necessarily related to the outcome. I may also just be terrible at this kind of game.The ""city-building"" and ""politics"" are largely tacked on. I enjoy the politics aspect, basically after winning a board a random (?) event occurs and you are given several thematic options on how to handle the event. Some choices might just give you some flavour dialogue, other choices will add decorations to the town, some choices will give you a one-time resource boost, while other choices may give you a permanent, though minor, buff to some aspect of the game itself. If you choose enough of a particular thematic choice your town will ""become"" that thematic element (nature lovers, republic, militaristic, etc.) I enjoy the politics and choices though they are just a sidenote in the game.You may often find you are unable to make matches in certain areas, which allows the enemies that are coming at you to destroy your tower unimpeded. You can hire and bring up to two different unit types into combat with you, but I often find they rarely are useful in defending the tower in the areas where the player may not have much ability to. You can also bring in spells and items, which can help at times, though the items tend to be resource intensive, which is problematic when resources in the game are gained in real time. Resources also can, and will, hit a maximum storage capacity in the resource gathering facility, making it so you have to check in often early on if you want to be able to get enough resources to upgrade buildings and research spells and items, which also happen in real time. The resource aspect of the game is off-putting to me as it feels a great deal like a pay-to-win, mobile game, despite the fact there is no premium currency in the game, which is great, I hate games doing that, but in a full game it just feels out of place and tedious.The game isn't bad, it just isn't good. I find myself going back to play every now and then, it'll take me a long time before I 100% it, should I ever, but I just can't recommend it. It is a test in patience more than anything a lot of the time.			"

												I'll preface this by noting that ReignMaker is overall enjoyable, and has interesting and unique features compared to other match-3 games that I've played, but overall not worth the full asking price for the game.The core of the game-play is a ""targeted"" match-3 tower defence concept. You will have enemies approaching from the side of your screen and must make matches in the same ""row"" as the enemy. (skeleton approaching at the next-to-top row of your screen? At least one of the element tiles in your match has to be somewhere in that next-to-top row to do any damage to the skeleton.) Matching tiles destroys the tiles, sends out an elemental bolt or fire/water/darkness/whatever ball streaking directly to the side that the enemies are approaching from. Any projectiles that hit an enemy do damage, and some enemies take more or less damage from different elements. This is an interesting change from the usual ""make a match anywhere"" of most match-3 games, but it can get quite frustrating on some of the boss fights where you need to deal a massive amount of damage to a relatively narrow area on the battlefield. Part of the game's charm, but also part of the frustration on harder bosses.Most of the enemies are of the ""advance across the screen and beat upon the wall"" variety, but the bosses have some unique mechanics (such as throwing fireballs that you can destroy if you happen to make a match and toss out a fireball in the exact right place to impact the boss's projectile). These add some definate flavor to the fights, but the relative difficulty of preplanning where the tiles are going to fall make these boss abilities more of a ""counter if you can"" situation and can at times turn downright deadly (if a chain match suddenly bounces a bunch of your own shots off of a boss's reflective force field).To help with this, you can use the resources you gather in town to research/craft/hire various spells/items/defenders. As you level up certain buildings in town, you gain access to more potent enhancements.The spells are reusable abilities with no limt to number of uses but which require you to make a certain number of matches to ""charge up"" the spell. The charge level for each spell carries over from match to match, so you need to make decisions whether to use a spell to help finish a battle or save it to open with on the next battle. Spells can destroy tiles (dealing damage to enemies), heal your fortress, shuffle the board, etc.Crafted items are consumeable (multiples can be stacked, but each time you use the item, your total available is reduced by 1 and you have to build/purchase more before you can use them again). Item effects range from stunning opponents to damaging them to preventing them from moving forward for a short time.Defenders are guard units that walk up and down along the top of your wall, and heal you or shoot arrows/roll bolders at enemies or run and grab dropped treasure, etc. Like items, defenders are consumed on use, and more must be hired to keep a steady supply. You can have two types of defenders active at once (and only one of each can be active at a time).All of these enhancements are bought/researched through the town building minigame, which feels very lackluster. Gold, food, wood, and metal are used as resources for upgrading buildings or purchasing items, etc. While gold is gathered on the battlefield, the other resources have to be gathered in town, by waiting for the appropriate resource-generating building to slowly (and automatically) fill up with a resource, choosing to harvest what's available, and then slowly letting the resource fill up again. While resource building structures automatically fill up with a resource, they do not automatically harvest it, so you have to remember to manually harvest your pumpkins or ironwood or the building will just sit there useless until you empty it out. This plays more like a freemium mobile game's time-limited resource production, and can get quite frustrating later on, when battles take significantly less time than needed for your crops to grow/wood to be milled. It gets quite annoying to have to log on every so often just to gather your resources so you can eventually afford the new spell/stonethrowing guard/shiney bomb that you're waiting for to tip the scales in your favor for the next boss fight.Also with the city building, there is no customization for placing buildings where you want, or adding buildings to enhance particular resource production. You have one place to gather wood. One place to grow food. One place to research spells. Buildings grow as you level them up, but you can't move/rotate/remove/anything. There are a few different ""town themes"" but you can't do any significant customization.The one feature of the town itself that isn't terribly boring is the townsfolk, which wander around and sometimes have thought bubbles that you can click on for an amusing quip. Also, the townsfolk react to some of your victories by asking for ""policy decisions"" where you can pick whether to protect forested areas, anger your local druids, be lenient with thieves, send a beaten boss monster back to a far-away forested area or kill her off, etc. Most of these are humorously written, none seem to have ""wrong"" answers, and none have any effect on game play as far as I can tell.Even with the sometimes-frustrating fights, ReignMaker is a fun-for-a-bit casual match-3 game that's easy to pick up, put down for a few weeks, pick up again, etc., but it's not something that really grabs attention for hours on end. Between that and the lackluster town interface, resource gathering, and research/crafting system, I can't recommend paying full price for this game, especially compared to the asking price of some of the other match-3 games on Steam. If you can get it for 75% off or more (or part of a really-discounted bundle), it'll be an enjoyable game for occasional play. Just avoid buying it for full price unless you really MUST have every match-3 available.			"

												I'm writing this review for anyone that might be on the fence - give it a try.  I'll qualify by saying that I don't think I would have paid $15 for it, but if you can get it on sale or in a bundle, it's a good little game.What you will have to do is go into it without high expectations.  The graphics aren't outstanding and it's not going to break any ground in the match-3 space, but I've found it challenging enough to keep my interest.  The short version of the gameplay is that you match symbols which then allow you to attack rows of incoming enemies.  Sounds easy, but it's more difficult than it sounds.  I died more than I thought I would, which is actually OK because the gameplay is fast-paced and doesn't feel like a chore to play a level again.The city-building isn't spectacular but it's simple enough and gives a good little break in-between the core game.  And the decision making aspect is amusing enough.Overall - give it a shot, it will grow on you.			"

												It's really boring and hard. Sometimes you can't do anything to save your City, you can just wait until it gets destroyed. You need a lot of itens to win so the principle of diamond row is completly ruined (itens aren't a bonus, they are the essence of the game, it's incredibly frustrating). There is also this city management that's pointless and annoying... Big messages in a row and you can't even figure what's the point... I really hate it, sorry =/			"

												ReignMaker is a game which takes the match-3 gameplay and rolls with it.  With the game's design, different boards can result in completely different strategies.  For example, certain situations may result in the player making matches on certain areas of the board in contrast to keeping just a high frequency of matches.The game offers ""power-ups"" through magic spells (charged by matches), NPCs and disposable items (bombs, blockades).  Both elements are useful but for a generic playthrough I found that most boards could be completed using only magic spells or just straight matches.The difficulty balancing is not perfect - one of the levels I had the most difficulty on was only halfway through.  Yet I managed to perfect levels much later on without issue.It'd definitely recommended for someone who enjoys the Tower Defense and Match-3 genres.			"

												Pretty okay game I guess, if you like mediocrity.The game pretty much is divided into 2 parts: The city and the conquest. In the first one you manage your city and by that I mean that you just upgrade your buildings, research magic and do pretty basic stuff to be stronger in the conquest.Now the conquest mode is where you fight, earn money and the main part of the game but it's pretty much bejeweled with a twist that it depends on where you combine your 'runes' because those are the tiles that shoot out the magic to kill the enemies. It seemed at first like it would have been very interesting but when i started the conquest mode, I just knew that there wasn't much to be expected.It is a good time waster if you just want to pass time and are looking for something that isn't very complicated. Kinda like mobile games.			"

												An interesting take on the Match-3 Puzzle 'Genre' that is sure to keep your senses occupied.Take your standard Match-3 game with the usual difficulty of adding special tiles with certain requirements to clear.. now tie that mechanic to a 'tower/base defending game' to introduce even more difficulty as well as a bit of strategy. Add progression through town building and management, where you can build, craft, recruit soldiers and even decide on policies that will affect your kingdom as well as how your story will unfold. That's Reignmaker in a nutshell.As someone who likes this particular sub-genre, I have to say this game may have just become my new top favourite amongst it's kind. The extra layer of difficulty and depth by adding and combining it with elements from other specific genres compliment it very well. That said however, this is not a game where you can just sit back and relax for a casual game of matching colors. It starts out easy, getting gold and perfects on the first few towers but the difficulty ramps up pretty quickly.I could elaborate on that.. but basically what it comes down to is that your eyes, hand(s) and mind will be having a field trip with this game. If you're a fan of match-3 games or love a good 'action' puzzle challenge, I'd say it's definitely worth the price.			"

												I want to like this game a lot more than I do.Probably described best as a real-time Match 3 game, with light combat and city building elements. The combat means you have to match 3 on row/columns where neemies are attacking, the city-building is the same earn gold, click on upgrade, wait x amount of time of your standard Facebook game. After every combat, you make a political decision that sort of affects your town. These don't seem to have a strong bearing on much of anything--perhaps that changes deeper in but it seems unlikely. Regardless, these decisions appear to be rather innocuous/harmless.I think the general problem is the game tries to do too much. Good Match 3 games usually have one core conceit mixed with one supporting element--especially if they're real time, it's hard to concentrate on much more. I would point to 10,000,000 (Match 3+item use); Puzzle Quest (Match 3+mana types); or even Hunie Pop (Match 3+...never mind).This game has way too much going on. For example, in combat, you're looking at your usual Match 3 grid and spotting enemies on a 'line' with those matches, but also using weapons, allocating troops, casting spells, and picking up loot off the battlefield. It makes it really difficult to enjoy any single element of the gameplay. I guess if you really enjoy multitasking this would be entertaining--but in that case, you're probably a hardcore RTSer... so I'm not sure who the audience for this game is. Long story short--it ends up hard to do anything *well*, which leads to a fairly dissatisfying feeling in the game (even when you're playing well).I hate to criticize the devs... this just feels like a decent variant on the Match 3 that genre that grew muddled through the addition of too many design elements. I'd probably play a sequel, but after repeated attempts, I keep bouncing off of this game.			"
