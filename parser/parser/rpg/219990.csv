Early Access Review
								First of all, this game is inspired by Titan Quest. However, it is NOT Titan Quest, don't be fooled with the title. I will compare it with TQ time to time but basically just to show differences than similarities.Is it good or bad? Neither. It is just another game. It inherits many features from TQ - the same engine (that's what makes some people to think the game is just a masked TQ), dual mastery system, basic skills ideas, itemization principles, inventory management and others. However, gameplay and overall feeling is not the same. I wonder why some people look at Grim Dawn as at skinned TQ because it feels very different in terms of pace, combat, quests, athmosphere. It is... err... faster. It's the best description I can imagine. Everything happens quite fast in the game. You start to feel your character powerful relatively fast - pretty since the first level. Many things support this feeling - from the actual raw power to hits animation which makes you feel impact on most of your hits. It could get boring soon if you would not unlock new skills with levels so you still will have something new to play with :)Basically, it's the game about doomed and dying world where mankind was pretty much eradicated by two powerful magical races. You're one of few remnants survived the just happened Apocalypse and trying to establish themselves in the changed world. So there are lot of remaining ruines and lore in the world. I actually like the way Crate has placed world information and story in the game - it does not come in forms of long quest dialogs but as pieces of paper here and where which you can read if you are interested or skip if you are not interested in learning the story and want just to kill things. I tried both and must say the story is very well-written which is rare case for ARPG genre. Just try to read that diary of the dead child... The world is also well-detailed with many small pieces adding the feeling of doom pretty everywhere. Overall graphics is probably not that detailed and eye-catching as it was in TQ but I guess TQ had it somewhat excessive while GD looks just fine for the fast-paced game where you won't pay too much attention to details most of the time anyway. It is still look fine when you stop for a while and zoom in to see details like a doll on the stairs. So the graphics is just fine on my taste. It looks much better with AntiAliasing and AnyzotropicFiltering turned on though ;) Overall story and graphics is much more mature than TQ with some of dark humor and some serious emotions it causes but much less pathetics. Bad guys actions are basically better reasoned and logical based (if you bother to read the story pieces).Quests. They are various enough to not get bored. You will meet those ""kill X monsters"" and ""collect Y pieces"" things along with exterminating big bad guys, securing areas (the last looks quite stupid with the monsters respawn but anyway), finding lost people and even uncover the treachery... or cover it. Yes, some quests seem to have several endings. Crate promises that you will meet consequences of your decisions later. Quests aren't necessary to finish the main story except first few ones which you will need to complete to get access to the stash. You can do even without them though - in my first playthrough I have got that access only after finishing the act as I just did not found the way to sewers to complete one of these quests :) Basically, if you have done what the quest requires already and then got to the quest giver, it will offer other dialog and accept the quest. Quite a reasonable system on my taste. You can just go forward and kill everything on your path and once you get to the end you will complete most of quests - just get back to the town and talk to people.Advancing the game. GD has other ways to advance than TQ had. First of all, the game is not linear. You have a single base and move in various directions from it but still return there for supply and rest. Second, directions you move are not a narrow long path but quite wide areas where you can just move along the road skipping pretty much about 60-70% of content or go exploring. In the last case you will find many optional areas some of which offer significant rewards. So you are free to advance fast from riftgate to riftgate or stop in the every area until you find everything in it. Or you can advance fast and then return to the areas you've been already to explore them in details. The last way has the hidden benefit related to monsters level scaling. You can find new more dangerous monsters in the previously explored areas.Monsters scaling. Monsters have limited scaling their levels with player in GD. So you can either advance to next area or just re-run the same one to find monstes have higher levels and you still get enough exp and better drops to advance in levels. Some people find it good, some blame the game for it. I personally think it is good because scaling is not infinite and if you run the same area for 3-4 times you usually will outlevel monsters there. So you still can feel yourself a stomping giant in you want :) Or you can just move forward as fast as you can - monsters will be either equal or slightly higher level than you. The system looks very well balanced and entertaining.Monsters. What can I say... incredible. Especially considering this is only Alpha (close to Beta already) and the first act of the game. Monsters variety is amazing. You will find about 8-10 basic types of zombies and other Aether corruptions (almost every type includes 2-3 variations with distinct look and properties), the same amount of mutated animals types (again, with several distinct variations inside every type), two semi-inteligent races, two types of human enemies and two types of Chaos creatures (all of these type groups have several variations as well). There are lot of hero monsters (they exist for every monster type in the game) with unique abilities which offer much greater challenge with an increased reward (sweet loot :)). Believe me, combat never feels boring and you never will think ""ahh, these zombies again..."" - GD has almost infinite surprises to you :) Moreover, as I said above, if you return to the area you've been already when you get 3-4 levels you most possibly will find new monster types there. Some of these types are unique to particular areas and don't meet anywhere else in the game. So if you want to see all enemies be sure to revisit areas you've met every unique monster type when you get max level.Combat. It is quite fast-paced but yet is quite controllable and leaves enough time to think your actions. Impact feeling is great due to various animations and screen shaking on crits. Crate has entertained new feature opposed to potions spamming - out of combat health regeneration (OCH). This feature is still questionnable and perceived differently by players. Some praise it while others blame. What does OCH mean? When you not get hit and don't hit for 2-3 seconds your health starts to regenerate rapidly and get to the max in 4-5 seconds. Some players are against it because think it can be abused and make the game too easy. Others argue that if you want to play reckless you can just continue hitting mobs instead of running around and avoiding hits. Anyway, this system really makes potions an emergency solution and rare used. Besides that, there are many ways to replenish your health during combat. I myself love this system and was upset when it was nerfed once already. However, we'll see what it will look like in the end of development. Comparing to TQ, combat looks ages ahead. Ah, I almost forgot about the new targeting system! Be sure to uncheck ""Classic targeting"" option in the game menu and try how it feels. I can't return to classic system now. The new one is pretty much the same you could get in Diablo 2 with right mouse button. Well, I could say more but seem to run out of space :)			"

Early Access Review
								Grim Dawn is one of the most richly detailed and beutifully sculpted unfinished game I've ever played! It's definitely one to keep your eye on.I'm a massive Action RPG player/addict with 1000s of hours in Diablo, Path of Exile, Torchlight, Van Helsing & countless others. Hell, I've even made a career out of making YouTube videos for them. Grim Dawn was little more than a curiosity to me when I first checked it out in the Alpha. But since then I have repeatedly come back to it whenever a new build is released and each time I play it I fall a little more in love with it!Development progress has been slow, I wouldn't expect a launch this year, but the quality of updates has been phenomenal. The devs at Crate have their finger of the pulse of the community and have a very clear vision for the game they want to make - it's the game they want to play. I recently spoke to Mediera one of the developers and he said that he barely even played Titan Quest when he was developing it - but while developing Grim Dawn he can barely tear himself away from it, with 100s of hours spent 'playtesting'.This game is the spiritual successor to Titan Quest, with some of the developers that originally worked on the game now making up the indie dev team at Crate Entertainment. The game is built on a heavily modified version of the same engine Titan Quest was built on. You'll notice the similarities between the games if you're a fan. But this game is not Titan Quest reskinned - it's a much better game in my opinion. It's taken some of the best features and mechanics from that game, put them into an immersive post-apocalyptic world and expanded themin interesting ways. Grim Dawn is the type of game early access should embrace - supporting great and communicativbe developers make games the fans want to play. Keep this one on your radar!If you want to see more of the game and my thoughts on it you can find me on YouTube & Twitch as 'ZiggyD'.			"

												As a veteran player of aRPGs, I want to share my feels about Grim Dawn with you, after about 90h of gameplay.Features I like:+ Involving, dark story.+ Beautiful graphics and style,+ Atmospheric soundtrack,+ Very satisfying and 'meaty' combat model,+ Faction system with bounties and nemezis hunting (though I've never faced any),+ Devotion system,+ Festival of loot,+ Good crafting system,+ Lots of components, aguments and item-granted skills which provide wide variety of builds,+ Day/night and wheater system,+ At some point it's quite challenging (over 70 deaths druing 90h of gameplay),+ I haven't try multiplayer yet, but I am sure it's very, very fun (instanced or FFA loot, combat with friends, etc.),+ Easy, reasonable travel system,+ Vast locations filled with details and less linear than in most aRPGs,+ Lots of hidden treasuers, places and secret quests,+ Possibility to rotate and zoom camera and map,+ Modding tools with huge possibilites,+ Class dualism..+ .. but it would be awesome to add new classes (TQ:IT had 9). However, it's definitely great with 6 various classes at the moment.+ One of the best price/quality deals,+ Hardcore mode.Features I'm neutral about:* Consistent world - I couldn't feel Cairn division into acts,* Lack of character customization (only male/female - same as TQ),* Absence of shrines with buffs (present in TQ), however I think they're not necessary here,* I have a problem with memorizing locations, NPCs and major bosses names,* Lack of Polish language,* After 90h of gameplay my character is at lvl.. 78/85.* After creating new character it doesn't show up instantly - player must go to options and come back to main menu to see it.Things I dislike:- Aetherfire (green flame on the ground) and poison pools are bit overpowered,- Few animations should be improved (e.g. stonetusks),- Sometimes vision gets too dark,- Ocassionaly crashes at alt-tabbing or game exiting.Incoming first DLC - Crucible - is a hope for a better endgame content with a chance for ranking rivalry and source of loot (hopefully also new).I believe that future content will make this game one of the best aRPG's of all time (for me it is now).A must have - not only for aRPG genre lovers!9,5+/10 "

Early Access Review
								Pros:  Rough around the edges, but still an excellent value.    If you loved Diablo, Torchlight, & Titan Quest then this is the game for you.    Combat is solid, the story is well presented, monster design is top notch.   Spiffy animations.   Art direction takes a few cues from Fallout 3 & Borderlands.    A few shout outs to H.P. Lovecraft.    No crashes for me & almost no bugs.    Very stable game! Cons:  has pretentions to being a 'Ye Olde Skool' hard core ARPG game.    Thus the game lacks modern rpg conviences like quest markers.     Expect to wander lost for stretches at a time.    Game balance is nightmare.   Playing a caster is easy mode.    Loot drops are a bit sketchy, but it is getting better.    Crate employees are swell & willing to listen to feedback.   Crate fans on the other hand...     Well, let's just say they are a bit defensive.    Saying that there are flaws with Grim Dawn is tantamount to calling their baby ugly.    The Crate Forums are going to be very interesting when the final product ships...In conclusion: post apocalyptic, low fantasy that doesn't pull any punches.    Some of the game design choices are real headscratchers, but they're being ironed out.     Crate entertainment is a pretty decent indie outfit  & deserve support.   It's a work in progress that takes you on fun, brutal journey.    8 out of 10, Above average.   B+   Four Stars out of Five.			"

Early Access Review
								In-Depth ReviewPrepare for a long read!First off the Story:Grim Dawn is full of interesting dialogue and well written textbooks that truly immerse you into the game. Furthermore there is a multitude of sidequest that often allow you to make meaningful decisions and sometimes even determine the fate of a whole village.Unfortunately these stories are hard to follow for someone who doesn't read through all the text. As much as I know the devs plan to voice the main story towards release.Atmosphere:The graphics present you with a harsh and sinister environment which is further emphasized by the great music and sounds. The handcrafted maps are quite large and feature hidden passages from time to time. It also feels great when you encounter hostile factions attacking each other and follow the transformation of Devil's Crossing from a small survivors-enclave to a small town as you progress through the story.Only downpoint for me was the repetitiveness of some maps, especially the 3 swamps in act 1 and arkovia/broken hills in act 2. I was told that the devs are planning to rework some of these areas though in terms of visuals.Gameplay:Gritty, fun combat, just as you would expect from an ARPG. The constitution system makes sure that you don't just wait to regenerate and the scarcity of potions underlines the fact that you are survivor of a perished world. Unlike Diablo 3 leveling feels rewarding and presents you with relevant decisions that influence your progression later in the game. The dual-mastery system of Titan Quest opens up a ton of possibilities and will further improve the more classes are available. The locational damage will probably not suprise TQ-veterans, but for ARPGs in general it's a really noteworthy feature that adds further depth to the game. (On a site note: There is an existing faction system that will be dramatically improved in the upcoming build)Since build 20 there is a well-working multiplayer, unfortunately the damage monster deal is also scaled if you play together. Resistances don't show much effect if they are not pushed quite high and casts and even aoe skills can miss enemies. Coming from WoW I was never very fond of a ""accuracy"" stat as it pretty much forces players to cap it.Itemization:The game features a multitude of stats to choose from: many types of retaliation, skill bonuses, damage modifiers, resists, etc. etc. This and the fact that there are procs and even entire new skills on items massively increases the number of possible builds and the fun collecting every item. Unlike other games in the genre there are not only random rolled yellows and greens but also static epic items which helps to reduce ""bad luck"", legendary items will drop from 50 onward, but are not available yet. Like Titan Quest there is also a huge number of augmentations to further personalize your gear. The two unqiue blacksmiths to choose from make use of these augmentations to craft a bunch of new items and relics from blueprints found in the world. All items are fully tradeable with other players.It seems there are some apparently obsolete stats though: Armor and physical resist pretty much do the same and ""increase resistance x by x%"" isn't really needed either.Interface:The game has a multitude of options and a fully scalalbe interface, which makes it highly customizable. The data sheets are well categorized and easy to access.Sometimes the text on items can get a little bit long though.Same goes for several skill descriptions, some of which only offer vague information, e.g. Solaels Witchfire - what exactly do the 1st and 2nd rune increase? You will have to try that out for yourself.Content:Grim Dawn is not finished yet, but it already has act 1-3 which offer fairly much to do and even on the second playthough reveal some suprises. Hallowed Hill, Depraved Sanctuary and Steps of Torment provide some lasting ""endgame"" content, the latter even comes with a cohesive and interesting story. Due to the fact that the current maximum level is 40 the number of build possibilites is limited of course, nontheless there is plenty of them already. I'd say there's roughly 150-200h of playtime right now if you don't try the more fancy builds.Bugs:I haven't encountered many bugs which is refreshing for an early access title these days, here are the most prevalent ones:- Getting stuck especially when using teleports/charge- Hit detection sometimes doesn't work for aoe skills like ""shockwave""- Some attacks can clip though walls, both hostile and friendly- Items occasionally drop through the floor, especially annoying with epics* The devs seem to be aware of these bugs and will address some of them in B24To sum it up:- in no way generic or boring quests that offer real decisions; story may be hard to follow if you don't read through every text though- dense atmosphere, brilliantly handcrafted world that sometimes feels repetitive because of the lack of different textures- good mix of fun gameplay, diverse builds and multi-layered mechanics with only minor problems here and there- interesting and complex itemization with a few debatable stats- well done interface, many options, but sometimes useless skill/item descriptions- reasonable quantity of well thought out content, likely 150-200h- few bugs, very polished for an alphaI have never had so much fun coming up with new builds and testing them right away. The gameplay is mostly fluid, the graphics and audio help create a unique atmosphere that supports the many stories you find about the world of Cairn and it's residents. It may take some time though to see through the complexity of the skill tree and items and appreciate the thought that has gone into it. All in all I'd say that Grim Dawn even in it's currents state is worth every penny as it not only offers the usal ARPG features, but also comes with it's own fresh ideas and shows promise of even more.P.S. I have noticed that many reviews on youtube are from people/magazines who invested less than 20h and therefore don't go really deep into the many mechanics Grim Dawn has to offer. This doesn't do the game justice in my opinion. Please don't take those reviews seriously and give the game a chance if above points take your fancy.			"

												I have been asked by several people to rewrite my review, as my initial review (written several months ago) inspired some to buy the game and so they wanted me to stay up to date with the times and offer my insights therein. I will first offer my thoughts on what has changed between then and now, and then introduce the game as a whole to those who have never seen it before. At its core, Grim Dawn has not changed vastly so in the last several months; I do not mean to say that there have not been updates, as there have and the game is certainly better for them, but the gameplay is very much the same as it was at release (in February 2016). This implies more than it seems; it means that Crate, the developing studio for the game, is not keen on upsetting the way players play the game. Sure, some balancing tweaks have been made here and there, and some builds have been nerfed or buffed more than others, but it does not seem as though Crate has ever intended to force its playerbase into a particular playstyle. Some may suggest that this means the gameplay is stale, as over the span of 10 months the meta has only shifted ever so slightly. I can't claim to see it that way; I see it as meaning that the gameplay is stable (see what I did there?) and does not need to change. Following Grim Dawn's release, a world-sprawling quest containing a multitude of very tough bosses has been added (completable in all three of the game's difficulties) for free, as has the paid DLC of the Crucible, which is an ultra-difficult arena-style survival game mode. We will soon be receiving the third of the ""roguelike"" dungeons for free, increasing the explorable world further with yet more content. We've also received several 'endgame sets' (and I use the phrase lightly, so as not to instill fear to newcomers that sets behave anything as they disastrously do in D3 - they don't) to promote some alternative, niche builds. Still on the horizon is Grim Dawn's first expansion...But what is Grim Dawn? For that, I turn to a (slightly altered) version of my former review for the game:Grim Dawn is a hack-and-slash ARPG that does everything it needs to and so much more. It presents a nitty-gritty world ravaged both my man's mistakes as much as otherworldly invasion. The feel of this world is perpetuated in every facet of the design of the game. Skills and attacks - player and enemy alike - are brutal and satisfying. The UI is precisely what it needs to be to get the points of its contents across to the player; it is no fancier than that. The quests have a purpose to them - 'We feel threatened by X, fix that for us by slaying him/her/it' - but they do not go out of their way in their descriptions to make their completion any easier than a rough idea of where to go. This game is designed to be played solely by you, your inclinations, and you intuition, not to help you play it with omniscient developer input and assistance. But you get what you give, and then a little more. You'll hunt across beautiful hand-crafted landscapes for terrifyingly monstrous entities, read immersive and haunting texts scattered throughout the world, and develop a character of your own design, one of your own play-style and skill choices.OK, so that's all the RPG stuff out of the way. So how does Grim Dawn put the Action in Action-RPG? At the beginning of the game, it does not do so wildly. Nor should it; if you started a god then any godly things you did throughout the game would feel all the same. But eventually the combat of Grim Dawn picks up to be fast paced and as brutal as the world around you. Every enemy in Grim Dawn is designed to kill you with merciless potency, and you'll have in your arsenal an array of spells, skills, and items to decimate you foes with terrific effect. Rarely will you ever feel truly immortal; the world of Grim Dawn has more than a handful of foes tough enough to go toe-to-toe with the most dedicated players.Grim Dawn is not a trading simulator, as its loot system favors self-found play. Grim Dawn is not made solely for endgame; that is not to say it does not have one (I've spent 9 days on one character alone), but the game's focus is on the journey to that endgame. It is, ultimately, a game, and so realizes that it must keep things fun throughout the experience, and does just that. Prospective players are always quick to ask something along the lines of ""Would you recommend this over PoE/D3?"" I would do so, yes, but I would caution them to say that Grim Dawn has no intention of replacing either title, as there are vast differences in their respective approaches to the ARPG genre. I would argue that without a doubt Grim Dawn is the superior title, however; if there is any ARPG in existence better than Grim Dawn, it would be Diablo II, but the veracity of such a statement may be tested. Indeed, Grim Dawn may well be in a league of its own, which the ARPG market has so very much needed. Perhaps, yes, I am a fanboy in that regard; I've spent over $200 on the game/its DLC in purchasing it for myself and some of my friends. But I can solidly and unquestioningly say I have no regrets in that regard. If you've read this far and still have your doubts about the game, then there's likely nothing one could write in a review to sway your opinion, and I wish you the best; otherwise, do yourself the favor and pick up Grim Dawn for $25. You'll almost certainly love it.			"

												At first this game seemed like one of 'those' Diablo copies. But as I played through it, several positives that other similar ARGP's don't have become clear:Positives:+ Grim Dawn has six well-rounded premade 'classes' you can invest in.In Grim Dawn, you start out with all options open and you can choose from a big variation of offensive and defensive skills.+ Grim Dawn allows for Dual Class mixing.After reaching level 10, you can start investing points in another 'class' skill tree, allowing you to mix with even more offensive/defensive skills from that other class.+ Grim Dawn has an item for most skill builds.The items in Grim Dawn are unique, but also generic in a good sense. Flat bonuses to whatever type of damage your character deals are widely available.+ Grim Dawn has a massive variety of item-enhancers (called Materials).You find these in the world and can attach them to items to make them more powerful in a certain way, or use them in the extensive crafting system. They can be somewhat compared to 'socketable gems or runes' in Diablo 2, but every item has a 'socket'.+ Grim Dawn has a very extensive 'talent' system (called Devotion).In the world you find shrines that once defeated/something sacrificed to award a talent point. This can be invested in a very broad talent system. This has a slight downside for those who do NOT enjoy theorycrafting; it can be a bit overwhelming.+ Grim Dawn plays fluently.Now this may seem irrelevant, but for those who played Path of Exile and were thrown off by the 'clunky' gameplay (I know I was) will have a much cleaner feel of gameplay flow in Grim dawn that is almost similar to Diablo 3. You character feels very responsive to your actions and he goes where you want him to go.+ Grim Dawn has a good mix between realistic and clear art style.To make a game both pretty in a realistic way AND still be able to see what happens where is NOT easy, and Grim Dawn does a good job at it. The minimap, map and color scheme are all clear enough to see (I am r-g colorblind).+ Grim Dawn is fun to play with friends.Once set up, GD is a very enjoyable multiplayer experience. You can easily build characters that complement each other, or slaughter each other in a duel.+ Grim Dawn items can (usually) be traded/given to friends.Yeah, this is good. Not like Diablo 3 where every-****ing-thing is soulbound. Some items in Grim Dawn are also soulbound, but with reason.+ Grim Dawn ultimate difficulty is unforgiving.It may remind some people of Diablo 3 Inferno mode, which is not for the casual player. I put this as a negative and positive on purpose, as this is a matter of taste.Negatives:- Grim Dawn has a seemingly pointless mechanic of stat points.You are allowed to invest in Physique, Cunning or Spirit. Physique gives hp and other health bonuses, Cunning gives crit and hit bonuses and Spirit gives more energy to spam your skills. It SEEMS like a choice at first, but because items REQUIRE flat amounts of these stats (715 Spirit for that great caster item, 715 Physique for that awesome armor) this choice is an illusion. In fact, this can be very frustrating for a first playthrough; you might not be able to wear something awesome you find. Diablo 3 doesn't have this problem (but many others).- Grim Dawn tends to stutter a bit with large amounts of monsters and particles on screen.Played on a high-end PC (2016 built), with 3 Wind Devils, 3 Storm Totems, 1 Wendigo Totem and 4 packs of monsters can give lag, even on the best of machines. This is not any worse than on similar games like D3 or PoE.- Grim Dawn leveling can become tedious.After level 50, the experience needed to advance increases rapidly per level. Reaching max level on a character is an every-day, 2 week investment at least. - Grim Dawn needs portforwarding for most people to do multiplayer.Right now, hosting a game in GD requires you to manually open port 27016 (UDP/TCP). Although this is easy for me, it may not be for those less technically inclined.- Grim Dawn ultimate difficulty is unforgiving.It may remind some people of Diablo 3 Inferno mode, which is not for the casual player. I put this as a negative and positive on purpose, as this is a matter of taste.I hope you found this summary review helpful! Have fun :)			"

Early Access Review
								Let's get my opinion across to you as a reader as soon and as clear as possible. I genuinely love this game.For an early access game, it feels very polished and content rich. But then, it has been in early access for some time now.If you like Diablo, you will definitely like this game. Because it offers the same hack&slash loot fest gameplay as that game, but without the frustrating bull****, such as the permanent character damage of Diablo 1 and the excessively restrictive builds (And rare respec) of Diablo 2. The game offers at present 5 different classes, of which you can combine any 2 of them to create hybrid classes. There is the Soldier (Typical warrior), the Nightblade (Rogue with a melee focus), the Demolitionist (Archer type, but with versatile crowd control options and traps), the Occultist (Debilitation and pets) and the Arcanist (Spellcaster). There are skills in each class that well complement those of another, but a pure class build is just as viable.There are no skills that are purely support, since the developers have made a conscious decision to make singleplayer just as playable as multiplayer. Instead, most classes offer some form of skill that applies a bonus or ability to you, as well as an equal one to other players and pets, allowing increased power and versatility in multiplayer without compromising the viability of the skill in singleplayer.It's a lot less restrictive than most similar games in how each class can be built and still be viable, but it is worth putting some advance thought into your build. Skill points can be refunded if spent on skills, but not if spent on class mastery (Which increase your stats linearly and unlock further skills).Content wise, the game currently contains 2 full chapters of reasonable length and 2 out of 3 parts of the 3rd chapter. A total of 4 chapters are known to be planned for the full release. There is a lot of various equipment to find with interesting items offering unique skills to complement the arsenal of your chosen class. There is also a lot of varied enemies to use your weapons and abilities on, with especially dangerous (mostly) randomly spawned unique Heroes to contest with, each with their own special skills and abilities. Four difficulties are planned, each which will be unlocked for a character as the previous is completed. At present there is only two difficulties available, Normal and the optional Veteran. These two difficulties can be alternated between at any time from the main menu and share the same campaign progression. Completing the game on either will unlock the next one, once it's added.I strongly recommend playing on Veteran difficulty in singleplayer, as Normal mode is a tad too easy. In multiplayer, the game scales the difficulty based on the amount of players, making Normal mode offer a decent challenge and making Veteran very challenging. Enemies do scale to your level, but as I understand the scaling will be lesser in the full release and is only set as high as it is now to offer a continuous challenge for higher level players.  Right now, the maximum level is 40, which is still plenty enough to allow the construction of very interesting character builds that do end up feeling extremely powerful in spite of the scaling enemies. Story wise, the game features an original world by the name of Cairn, with has an Victorian-esque aesthetic and technological level. It offers you the usual swords and shields but also black powder guns, bombs and magic. In this world mankind is at the brink of extinction with the event dubbed the ""Grim Dawn"" as it's cause, where the otherwordly and malevolent Aetherials and Chtonics invaded the world. The Aetherials seeking the enslavement of mankind as hosts of possession, while the Cthonics would rather mankind be wiped out, as to deny their use by the Aetherials. These two factions are enemies and will actively fight one another, in addition to humanity. The Grim Dawn led to the total collapse of the empire, leaving only scattered groups of refugees and army remnants trying desperately to safeguard their own survival. You join one of these groups in trying to secure shelter, supplies and to strike back against the invaders and Cairn native monsters threatening you. All in all, it's an interesting universe that manages to put a somewhat new spin on the overused post apocalyptic and dark fantasy settings. The story also feels much more grounded than many similar works, with the player not being a chosen one destined to save the world but is just another survivor struggling to survive. This is reflected in the quests you undertake as well, with quite a few of them simply being about securing the base needs for survival, such as drinking water, food and usable materials for clothing. Unlike most games of this style, Grim Dawn offers choices with permanent effects on the world. So for example, your choices can decide who lives and who dies as well as influence what equipment you can access. Or they can even turn another faction of humans against you, for siding with their enemies. There is a reputation system, where you earn the trust of factions by completing quests and fighting their sworn enemies, with increased trust letting you access faction unique bounty quests and a store offering equipment unique to that faction. You also accrue a negative reputation with the hostile factions, where you face stronger opposition the more of a threat you become, culminating in them sending especially strong unique enemies to deal with you. The choices and faction system feel very well integrated and can only become more interesting the further along in development the game gets. A sense of personal investment in the world makes it unique from it's genre brethren. Of course, you might make a choice that ends with an outcome that you don't like, so if that's a concern you would need to refer to a guide to make the choice you want.The game does however suffer from some unfortunate bugs, primarily a tendency to crash. This combined with rather extensive dungeons can make for a frustrating experience where you lose your progress and have to start over. The characters however do save properly though, so it's not an insurmountable chore to go through those dungeons again. There's a few performance hiccups here and there and some minor graphical bugs as well, but it is an early access title and such things are to be expected. If you can't deal with that, stay away from any and all early access titles. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Do I recommend this game? Yes.But with the reservation that it is in early access and thus not yet finished and full of bugs. If you can deal with that, buy it. If you can't, then wait. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Important note: If you have a router, to be able to host multiplayer it needs to support Upnp or be able to port forward UDP and TCP ports 27016.

												You hear an alarm beeping, startling you away from your screen. You turn around and stare at the neon letters on the clock. It's 5:30AM. Birds chirp outside as the tentative first rays of sunshine creep through the gaps in your curtains. You've spent an entire weekend slaying hellbeasts from beyond the void and now you only have an hour to get to work. You haven't slept.That's Grim Dawn.			"

Early Access Review
								By far my favorite ARPG I've played since Diablo 2. I've had a craving for years for something fresh that borrowed as much as possible from Diablo 2 and implemented it well and Grim Dawn hits an absolute home run in that department. I enjoyed Diablo 3 and sunk a ton of hours into it, but man does Grim Dawn feel like what Diablo 3 should have been. It's that good. It's like everything Titan Quest and Diablo 2 did well had a baby and this is our result.I've been a supporter since 2012 and playing on and off since well before the game ever hit Steam Early Access and man... it's incredible how far this game has come.If you're a Diablo fan of any sort and wasted away who knows how many hours of your youth on Diablo 1 and 2, do yourself a favor and pick this game up. Even at the full price of $25 it's an absolute steal.10/10			"

I never imagined to throw faeces at enemies as a method of obliterationGame overview*Genre: aRPG, hack & slash*Avg length: ~25 hours (1 playthrough on normal)*Developer: Crate Entertainment*Publisher: Crate Entertainment*Release date: February 25th 2016*Platform: pc<<<Pros and cons>>>+ Indepth (but not overly complex) character building+ Ability to (partially) respec+ Exploration is greatly rewarded+ 3 difficulties to play through+ Faction system+ Appropriate atmosphere+ Multiplayer available+ Multiple little features to make life easier+ Insanely replayable+ Aesthetically, the game is gorgeous, but - Graphics seem a little outdated in certain places- The soundtrack is good, however repetitive at timesFull game reviewIt is almost a miracle. After about 6 years of development, Crate Entertainment's Grim Dawn has finally been released. A game that had been in early access on Steam for so long due to the developers experiencing some personal difficulties. Not only that, they also greatly expanded on the game's original content due to fantastic support by fans along the way. The result is a superb aRPG that is currently among the very best. Having owned and closely followed the game for about 2 years, looking at the (finally) complete game is a pure joy. Hold on tight aRPG lovers, because you're in for a most wonderful ride with this one.<<<Story>>>Enter Cairn, a dark and mysterious world that was once a great empire, but now on the brink of extinction. At fault are the overly curious arcanists who brought Aetherials into their world. These spiritual beings seek to use humans as hosts and consequently turn them into powerful, yet abhorrent creatures. If that wasn't already enough, survivors also have to battle the Chthonians: they have the malicious intent of offering as much blood as they can to their almighty god. You, the player, awaken at the worst time possible: a grim dawn. For a little while, you yourself were possessed by an aetherial and thus have no memory of your former life. This possession almost cost you your life. However, those aetherial remains dwelling inside your body seem to grant you odd, yet useful powers ...<<<Gameplay, fun factor and replayability>>>Grim Dawn is an aRPG like there are quite a few others in the genre: Torchlight, Diablo, Van Helsing, Path of Exile, Victor Vran, Titan Quest ... While each game differs and has its uniqueness, they all have the same core gameplay: run around, kill monsters, find loot. And all of that in an isometric perspective. Even though a bit repetitive in gameplay (which is no problem if you're a fan of the genre), they have great replay value, mostly due to their theorycrafting: how to create and finetune the 'perfect' build(s). In trying to do so comes a lot of experimentation and farming, which can take quite long.Unlike certain other aRPG's, Grim Dawn does not force you into a specific class. Mages don't necessarily have to wield wands and warriors don't have to wear heavy armour and shields. Every character has access to all gear. However, you are required to invest in specific attributes in order to wear different equipment. Another feature that is quite welcome, which was present in Titan Quest also, is how the game lets you combine any of the 6 available masteries to create your personalized class (= 2 masteries combined). A first mastery can be chosen at level 2 and the second at level 10. There are so many skills that one can choose to build around, that even within the same mastery, there is a lot of room for variety. This allows for an insane amount of experimentation and theorycrafting, which is sometimes even more fun than actually playing the game!One day, Crate decided that character customization wasn't deep enough already, so they released the devotion system. What is this system exactly? It is basically another (yet smaller) layer of customization where players have a total of 50 points to invest in certain passives (e.g. +10% piercing dmg, +20% elemental resistances etc) or actives that enhance your main skills. Those actives can be bound to certain skills and will proc under various circumstances (e.g. 100% to occur when critically hitting). Devotion points can be acquired by restoring old shrines that are spread throughout the whole world and between the 3 difficulties (normal -> elite -> ultimate).Seeing the amount of customization, being able to (partially) respec is a relief. Reallocating is done by visiting the spirit guide in one of the major cities and can be done at any given time, granted you have the currency for it. It starts out pretty cheap, but can get extremely expensive for those who experiment endlessly. Both skill and devotion points can be reallocated; mastery and attribute points can not. This allows for decent experimentation, but also reminds you to choose carefully when needed.Cairn is a place full of mystery and secrets and is not afraid to reward players who feel like exploring everything. Exploration is rewarded by various things: one-time chests containing extra rare loot, hidden devotion shrines and notes. More loot is always good to have (this is an aRPG after all), devotion shrines keep your character's customization up to date and lore notes inform you of the story - which was better than expected - of Cairn. Besides the deep character customization and satisfying exploration, Grim Dawn offers other features that may interest you. The first thing that comes to mind is the 'fast travel' system. Your character can use rift portals anywhere, anytime (except in certain challenging rogue-like dungeons), which sets the game at a good pace. Don't worry about picking everything up, as you can sell it right away by teleporting back and forth. Another feature that is a nice 'extra' is the faction system: by killing certain enemies and completing certain quests, you gain reputation. This reputation allows you to buy certain goods and complete certain objectives. A last feature that is definitely more than welcome is the ability to play with up to 3 other people. There are no dedicated servers though, since the game is more single player focused. But the fact that it is there, is what counts.<<<Controls, graphics and sound>>>Like many other aRPG's, actions are mostly executed via the mouse: killing enemies, opening doors, speaking to npc's ... everything's done with the mouse, with the exception of using your skills. They are activated by pressing the corresponding keys. All keys are rebindable if desired.Graphically, the game seemed a little outdated in certain places, however, it is not too bothersome. Aesthetically on the other hand, the game is very well made and really brings that atmosphere of eeriness and desperation to life. Most animations are ok.The soundtrack was enjoyable to listen to for the first x amount of hours and certainly added to the atmosphere. However, certain tracks get replayed over and over again in way too many areas. A little bit more variation certainly wouldn't harm the game. Tracks that are most excellent are the boss tracks. They sound exciting and make the fights more epic. <<<The verdict>>>Grim Dawn is one of the finest aRPG's I have played in the last couple of years - if not my favourite of all time. Victor Vran seems a little too simplistic, whereas Path of Exile can be overly complex. This game brings the best of two worlds together: being indepth enough without being overly complex. Therefore it is recommended to all aRPG lovers for 100%, but even regular rpg/hack & slash fans might enjoy this one, if just for 1 playthrough.			"

Early Access Review
								Since i have played Grim Dawn, Titan Quest and Diablo 3 a LOT, here's what i think about this game:Pros: - Skill system is similar to Titan Quest and very complex, allowing you to customize your character alot. There are obvious builds just like in D3 (Pet-master, Fire-builds etc.) but you are not limited to them.- No allways-online, you can in fact play this game completely in offline mode, characters are saved on your harddrive. (similar to Titan Quest)- Many items with the same system as in TQ where rare pre- and -suffixes can occur on normal items. Also Epic and Legendary stuff (including sets and abilities granted by items)- Farming: A combination of TQ and D3, boss runs are still effective (TQ) but there are also Hero spawns in normal locations that can be lucrative (D3)- Simple Multiplayer system, you can either host a game (and others might join you, you can set a password or kick others) or you can join a game yourself (direct join to your steam-friends or browse existing hosted games)- almost no bugs, the few that are there allways get fixed ASAPThings i personally dont mind but might be important to you:- performance issues when ALOT of stuff is going on (R9 290, 16GB RAM, i7 and dropping to 20fps on high settings, can be improved by lowering the settings though)- Multiplayer MIGHT not allways work, make sure you have administrator rights when searching for games or it can crash (just like in TQ)- even though they are not popular, you might find cheaters online (since save-files are on your harddrive you can just manipulate them). In that case just host a game yourself and kick them :P- no voice acting and average grafics might scare you. but keep in mind that crate entertainment is a really small studio (""Crate Entertainment has grown from one man with a dream to a team of ten with veteran developers...."") so what they achieved is actually really impressive.Conclusion: A really good ARPG. not a tripple-A title like D3 with millions of budget, still managed to entertain me more than D3 personally. If you like these kind of games, just buy it!			"

												Disclosure: Review Written at Level 25Do you miss Diablo 2? Do you miss skill synergy that matters? Do you miss abilities not being worthless, and having options?Grim Dawn opens up an interesting school of thought: You begin as nobody, and at level 1 you're given your official class: Are you the melee tank guy? Explosive experiment guy? Arcane knowledge guy? The angry zoo manager? Pick your class and begin to carve your way. But don't lose sight of What Might Have Been.At level 10, you are able to pick up a second class. No penalities. You become a Something / Something. Want to play a Tank / Mage? Done. Want to play a Caster / Pet class? Done. Pick your flavors, combine then, and destroy everything. Right now, I'm a Soldier/Demolitionist that is made out of tank and explosion, and when things come near me they go on fire, and if they hit me they go on fire EVEN HARDER.You will get your fill.

Early Access Review
								this is probably the best ARPG i've ever played. - coherent and in-depth lore- very unique dual class system that allows for tons of customization and all the replayability you could ever want- beautiful and well-optimized (still looks great on lowest settings and can run decently even on a toaster). the art direction is better than Torchlight/Diablo 3, kind of reminds me of the first Dungeon Siege or Diablo 2. plus, a rotatable camera allows for every detail of the environment to be admired- quests are interesting and fit perfectly with the game world (no ""collect 20 monster hides"" for no reason)- loot is abundant, and i mean really abundant especially in the higher levels- crafting is done VERY well. probably my favorite crafting system in any game.- it's still in early access and it's this good, which is awesome, especially considering the devs actually care about the playerbase and release updates regularly.GET THIS GAME--EDIT: a few extra points that add some more perspective to the game- fast travel system that allows for you to easily traverse the (considerably big) game map. there are waypoint portals you unlock after entering major areas, but you can also throw down your own portal at any time, if you're in the middle of adventuring and need to sell your loot. the personal fast travel point doesn't go away after you die, so you can also use these portals as a sort of quicksave before major battles. your custom waypoints don't save when you quit the game, though.- loot that is automatically shown can be filtered. if you don't want to see anything but legendary items, you can set it that way. if you want to see everything but the billions of common items that enemies spew forth, you can set it that way too.- NO pre-game character customization (your only choice is your gender, no appearance options)- you can respec for some money, either piecemeal or you can reset all of your skills. however, you can't change your class, the points invested your class (aka points invested in the class mastery and not class skills themselves), or your attributes (physique/cunning/spirit).

Early Access Review
								Grim dawn is a deep loot driven rpg, with a unique setting, and good atmospheric graphics running on a heavily updated and improved version of the titan quest engine. If you thought that developers won't invest in this style of game again, think again. Love has gone into this. You start with a classes character, if you are a titan quest fan - you know the drill. If you do not, you start out without a class, think elder scrolls. Then you pick up an item, do some damage, and eventually you get some gear. By this point you will have leveled up and you can choose your class. Usually the player chooses something depending on what they have picked up, however you can choose something completely different and scour for items to match what you are going for. Once you level up some more, you can choose a second class. Allowing for two to coexist concurrently - also like it's father titans quest. There are large number of class combinations. I don't find that every combination is satisfying, however most are at least interesting and fun to experiment with. One issue I have with the second class choice is that they are usually targeted at a specific item combination. For example, the soldier tree has many two handed skills, whereas the rogue tree has many duel wielding. That means you won't be able to pick the major skills in either tree. Since it's wasteful to be good at a two handed weapon and duel wielding skills. Unless you hotkey weapon switching. It's far better to just invest fully in whatever items you choose. Which means you are scouring the second tree for non-weapon based skills. It's not ideal.  However almost any combination you choose will be viable. And thats good enough. At least it represents freedom. If you want you can just stick to the one class. The loot system is solid, although it lacks the ""pop you got a legendary"" sensation that diablo managed. The melee combat, while being weaker than magic, feels better due to the hitting animations being beefy feeling good on contact. This may make you want to play as a melee character even though magic is technically more damaging. A little more balance in this area would go a long way. That said, you need to take into consideration that this game still feels better to play at it's worst - than many action rpg's do at their best. It's just not quite as crunchy as diablo 3. This game's freedom of choice and depth of systems makes up for that. But clearly it would be great to have the best of all worlds. I find that visually the game can sometimes be a little bit over dark. And on certain monitors it may be an issue for players. VA panels in particular. Overall, I think this game is great. I've spent 150+ hours in the game, and have only scratched the surface. Restarting and playing new builds before I even got to the second act. That's right, that's 150 hours of build experimenting and grinding. And I loved every second of it. It's content rich. It's systems are deep. It's carefully crafted in many ways, without being as limited as diablo 3 yet not as free as sacred 2. Combat feels better than van hellsing and sacred 2, yet not as good as diablo 3. Although not that far off. And the world is more original than all of the mentioned games.9.5/10 - A master class in game development. One of the best examples of early access on the market. I'd love to see workshop support.			"

												Update: The game is now released, and it still doesn't suck. 10/10 Early access review below:I very rarely do Early Access reviews, solely because of how quickly a good game can go wrong, and vice versa. So when I say Grim Dawn has not only met, but surpassed my expectations, I want you to get my full meaning.Long before Act 4 was finished, Grim Dawn was always a very solid and playable Early Access title. Crashes were rare, nothing felt glitchy or unfinished. You'd just hit the level cap, or hit the wall of the next unopened area.Which meant, even when there was only 1 complete Act and a couple of class choices, there was a lot of fun to be had. It stood as a testament to how the rest of the game would play, and Crate has delivered. It's been a long time coming, and I mean a solid 5 year development, but it was always consistent enough to never have felt abandoned or misled. A trait I'm finding more and more important with Early Access titles.I'm not going to compare it to other ARPGs, as I'd much rather compare it to other early access titles in general. We had notes for every patch and hotfix. Always updates on what will be in the next patch along with future updates. I am glad to have supported this game in its early days, and am excited to finally see it's release, because I can absolutely say it does not feel rushed or unfinished. Crate put the time and effort necessary for a quality release, instead of giving us a half baked game and selling us the rest later.Grim Dawn sets the bar for what we should expect from Early Access development and release. Bravo, Crate Entertainment.			"

								There are three things that matter in an ARPG. They are:Build diversityItemizationFun combatBuild diversity:The game features dual classing. I can play the exact same two classes as my buds and all of us would have a character that behaves and functions completely differently. Want to be a melee summoner? Dual wielding spell caster? Tanky totem user? Alright, we gotchu. Stuff just sort of works. Maybe not for the highest difficulty, but that's part of the fun of this game. Because playing it is actually fun.Itemization:I've gotten items for character ideas in this game I've never even thought of. I've gotten items specifically built for the character I'm playing as. A plus? They actually look pretty cool, too.Let me put it to you like this. I have a tanky totem guy who uses spells to tank and does vitality damage. There are items specifically for this. Do you understand how cool that is?Fun combat:Alright, so, let's be real here. You are going to make characters that just don't work. You'll get to a point and maybe you didn't spend enough points in to your mastery and just don't have enough health. Maybe you don't do enough damage. Maybe you just kind of walked around and made it to the final difficulty and now you're stuck. Well, you had fun doing it.And you had fun doing it because the combat is a blast. Oh, you want to shoot a laser beam at enemies? We gotchu. Want to use a shield to destroy your enemies? Hey now, I got something for you. Want to use that same skill but make it spammable and useable with two handers? Yeah dude, no problem. Want to put a bunch of mortars on the ground and run around like you would in the real world? Ayyyy, yep.This game has it all. And it's all fun.If you don't buy this game, I feel bad for you.			"

Early Access Review
								So, in the entire time that Path of Exile's extreme skill customization was a nice change to the Diablo 3 habits of hand holding style. With Diablo 3 and Path of Exile now being moreso known as the top two of these kind of games, there's in between Grim Dawn.Grim Dawn for one, has the same customizations like the old Titan Quest, you don't have any skills to start with and you have no class, you make your class by progress. What makes that so special, is that there isn't a single class to choose from, one character can specialize into two paths(You don't have to). Surely not all will be fully suitable for another, but it takes a little curve in knowing what to choose and why. Rather then a path being chosen for you, you can make yours from scratch.Along with this in terms of skill customization, the game features a nice amount of loot, along with the entire factions offering you their items for trade as well, given you are on their good side. As for the looks of the game, its like the name suggests. Its grim, dark and grimy. Nothing in this world is given to you on a silver platter, and don't think you'll be quick to make friends. Along with the nice bit of gunpowder skills and weaponary given to you, it gives another feel to the usual magic and swordplay world that is like PoE and Diablo 3, the combat is nice and beefy, strikes feel like they hit hard and enemies are plenty, either to be vaporized by magic or chopped to bits by a gaint sword.Having played this game a fair bit, I can say it bring back the old feel of Titan Quest, in a new and fresh setting, unlike the PoE and Diablo 3 universe. I can surely say, to those that enjoyed Titan Quest back in the day or want something different from the two big boys that are Path of Exile or Diablo 3 to check out Grim dawn, its not done yet, and its not perfect. But its a really nice change of pace and well done so far I can say.			"

												Writing with only 16h of gameplay:If you loved playing Diablo 2 as a kid (like myself), Grim Dawn is THE ARPG to buy!Just forget about Torchlight (and all the b@#$%&t about it saying it was made by the same team from Diablo 2). And forget about Diablo 3+ (and all the b@#$%&t about it saying it's the successor for Diablo 2).And go ahead and buy Grim Dawn.Here's why:I played both Torchlight and Diablo 3 (and PoE and Titan Quest), and they won't even come close to make me feel like I'm back in my teens playing Diablo 2 with my friends.Grim Dawn does it! All the ambience, the sound tracks, the atmosphere, the theme. All the darkness, the condemned world, the shading, the monsters, the bosses. All the item hunting, the items themselves, the skill trees, the character evolution. They all feel very much like Diablo, WAY MORE than Torchlight and Diablo 3 (and Path of Exile and Titan Quest and ... ).Sometimes when I'm playing I get this strong feeling that I'm finally playing a true new DiabloSometimes I get the same feeling I get when exploring a dark, hellish dungeon from Diablo 2.I strongly recommend this game if you like Diablo 2, and I want to say Thank you so much dev team for making this game! This is like a dream coming true for me. This is the Diablo sequence I was waiting and hoping for. "

								This game should not be overlooked by anyone who is interested in either Diablo 2,3,Titan Quest, or POE. While all of the games have fundamental differences in gameplay. Grim Dawn brings something fresh to the table that I have found lacking in POE and D3. The Pros:- Attention to detail (for example piles of burning bodies in fields and outside of burrwitch lead one to believe there was a major fight against the rampaging Aetherials, which leads me to my next ""pro"".)-The story telling ( while it does lack in lore like some of the AAA games (Diablo) it does  a masterful job at telling a story  without spelling it out for you. Different scenes you come across throughout the world really get you interested in what had happened as you put it together.-Itemization ( the loot is both unique and visually appealing)-The Combat (the melee and spells feel really good)-The MUSIC ( is just amazing, nuf said)The Cons:- The Combat ( Ranged combat is somewhat underwhelming, althought it has come a long way since initial release)-Skills ( while I am not one for super flashy skills like D3 some of the skills feel relatively underwhelming, for example the soldiers and cultist last tier skills, while useful, just don't look or feel all that impressive)- Multiplayer (multiplayer is not all that great as there are relatively few people who have public games open and the latency with the person hosting is often terrible, if one day they can have their own dedicated multiplayer server, it will be amazing!)-It's not done yet! ( just cant wait for it to release)Needless to stay it is still pre-release  and there is much that is being done to improve the game on  all fronts, when fully releases there will be much rejoicing. Highly reccommended			"

												*12-20-16 edit at bottomI recommend this title, only to true ARPG fans, with some very strong caveats. While I have had a lot of fun (and frustration) playing Grim Dawn, it's unforgivable weakness is in its late game balance.  Obviously GD draws a lot of comparisons to Diablo 2 and 3. While it is better in some regards, worse in others, as those titles, it simply does not have their longevity. I've clocked in just over 2,000 hours in Diablo 3. I have around 10% that time in GD, and I feel that I've taken it as far as I can go.  First, what is not as good as D2 and D3, as well as some other ARPGs: Loot and balancing.I have ran 4 different builds to the point I simply couldn't get any further. The difficulty settings of D3 is what allows for endless gameplay. In GD you start on Normal (with an optional Veteran difficulty that I honestly could not tell the difference except that there was less loot), then unlock Epic after completing the campaign, then unlock Ultimate after completing it on Epic. That's it, 3 difficulties, 3 times through the campaign, done. With level cap at 85, and no further options to continue playing, the game basically stops itself. However, of my 4 different builds, only one made it to the bitter end. And this is what I'm talking about balance here. What makes Epic and Ultimate more difficult is primarily the reduction of your resistances. So basically, you just die more often, xp becomes a grind, common minions often one-hit you out of nowhere, and some bosses (the trapped-in-a-box, no-retreat bosses) are simply unbeatable without the right build and very specific resistances. All that wouldn't be so bad, IF the game's claim that more difficult = better loot. But in over 200 hours of playing, I can tell you that it's just not true. If anything, I consistently got less good loot, but lots more junk loot. In every case, I was using the same equipment for 20 or more levels at a time for lack of getting anything better. Obviously, this is untenable when the monsters level with you. And the best gear I had was purchased, not looted. Over the course of 4 builds to Ultimate, up to levels 65 and 75 on average, I accumulated a sum total of 9 Legendary items, mostly unusable because of high requirements, or simply not as good as the epic items I already had from 20 levels ago. What this means is that I got rich, with just over 3 million iron bits on my final character, but with nothing  worthwhile to spend it on. So yes, GD is miserly with the good loot. Not a good feature when we all know that ARPGs are all about the loot. Even after the latest patch, I did a test run from middle to late Ultimate, and only got one legendary; the same gun that the Warden drops every time. Well I already had 3, thanks anyway. One could put the loot, or lack thereof, down to bad luck, but after 4 playthroughs, I can reasonably claim it's the system.Now, what makes GD better than D3: Character builds and skills.In D3 you get what you get as far as skills, they will be the same skills every time, they unlock at certain levels and at higher levels you can choose between them. That's it. This is the weakest point of D3. It sucks. GD has taken a step back with skills, more in line with D2, and allowed you to choose skills, then build on those preferred skills. And the passive skill tree is actually a constellation of skills that unlock new abilities or new attributes that you can then attach to whatever skill you prefer. This system allows for a high level of customization and control in your build, and is where GD really shines. The innovation of dual-class hybridization exponentially expands on the possibilities. Other good qualities are the lore, which is enough to keep you reading the notes, and the faction system. Factions are probably the best innovation to set GD apart from others in the genre. One other detractor worth mentioning: Performance. Even on lower settings, with reduced resolution, I constantly got lags and hitches, little micro-freezes. The gameworld is graphically nice, nothing extreme, so I think the problem is with distant LODs. It's as if the engine is trying to render too much at full detail, even long distance views and off-screen terrain. And shadow rendering seems to be glitched. They only look normal on higher settings. At medium and lower settings, the shadows glitch in a frenzied flashing of black triangles. Also, the game almost always freezes on exit, requiring alt-tab-del and a system reboot. This is extremely irritating and almost unforgivable in modern games.In summary, Grim Dawn is a ton of fun for the true ARPG fan. Just trying out the different builds and hybrid classes is what makes it worthwhile. However, the miserly loot system and terrible late game balance gives it a short shelf life. My hours in GD had many frustrating moments where I nearly quit for good. But the character options kept me coming back to try again... with the same results. Certainly, D3 had a much bigger budget and amounts to pure candy for the ARPG fan, while GD is grittier, tougher, less rewarding. D3 has longevity, you can literally play forever. But GD got the most crucial part right that D3 got wrong; the role-playing. And that has made it worth playing.*12-20-16 Edit: With recent updates addressing some of the issues I originally wrote about in this review, namely late game balance, I felt it warranted an edit. They have increased resistance buffs almost across the board for epics, making late game progression much more balanced and viable for a variety of builds. There have been many other improvements, but I felt this was the most significant. CrateGames has continued to update and improve this game, with more on the way, including two new classes, presumably in a free update. This kind of dedication to their game sets them apart and could very well make Grim Dawn my favorite ARPG of all time.			"

Early Access Review
 Grim Dawn  is one of the best  Early Access  games on Steam right now, and one of the few Early Access games that I totally don't regret purchasing. I'll be using a few comparisons to other popular games in the ARPG genre, and giving some reasons on how Grim Dawn differentiates itself.Grim Dawn is developed by  Crate Entertainment. They are only a small indie team of 7 or so, but they have some noticible talent from from titles like Titan Quest and Diablo 2. It's actually amazing what they have managed to accomplish with such a small team as the game was originally going to be a lot smaller in scope, but Crate had a fairly successful Kickstarter Campaign, which let them increase the scope of the game substantially.So what does Grim Dawn manage to do right? What are some key features that are different from most ARPG's?Huge Open MapGrim Dawn features one giant interconnected map. Every Act has it's own feel and tileset, and areas connect and loop back to each other in such a clever way that at times, it reminds me of the level design of Dark Souls. There are plenty of Dungeons and Caves throughout these maps to explore, usually rewarding you with a cool side-boss. The big map design is a really cool feature considering games like Path of Exile have really small maps in comparison.ExplorationMost other ARPG's mostly focus on the combat, which obviously--should be a big focus for any ARPG. But Grim Dawn kind of encourages you to explore and pay attention to the environment a bit more then the others. There are breakable walls in Dungeons (which are quite well hidden), but if you manage to find them, you tend to be rewarded with secret areas and enemies, meaning every Dungeon is worth fully exploring.CombatSince Grim Dawn is running on the Titan Quest engine (though, it's been modified and upgraded), there are some very satisfying physics and ragdoll effects.Monsters tend to explode into gibs!Combat is slower paced compared to games like D3, but it is responsive and punchy.Animation quality ranges from good to excellent. There are some really nice looking abilities, but I have noticed a few animations could use a bit of work. The monsters are fantastically animated though!Combat and movement in general is smooth.Monsters Drop Weapons They Are Using!This feature was in Titan Quest I believe, but I'm glad Crate decided to include it in Grim Dawn, as it's an awesome feature that most ARPG's should have.What this means in more detail, is if you see a creature holding a weapon that looks unusual, and you notice after it hits you, you were drained of some energy for example, there is a good chance that monster is going to drop the same weapon it used to drain your energy.This adds such a cool dimension to the game, as monsters can already have random affixes on them.LootEvery ARPG needs good loot. Good thing Grim Dawn delivers on that too! I'd say the loot system is a bit more old-school in it's design and approach, as there are a lot of % based modifiers, which is pretty standard, but a lot of items also have abilities attached to them. Other then that, you have your usual loot rarity system that are similar to most other ARPG's (Common, Magic, Rare, Epic) and Legendaries--which are not in the game yet.Looting in general is just satisfying as hell. I love how loot explodes out of chests, and you even get loot piñata's from killing bosses/mini-bosses.Crafting & ComponentsThe crafting system is actually quite in-depth and deep. It's perhaps not as deep as Path of Exile's crafting system, but it's not as simple as Diablo 3's either--it falls somewhere in between. One great thing is it's not as RNG focused as other crafting systems I've come across in other ARPG's.Components are basically upgrades for your gear. They are found and crafted, and they can be attached onto most armour pieces. Components can also have abilities attached to them. Overall, It's quite an interesting take on an upgrade system, as components let you easily fix some flaws in your builds.Sound DesignAbsolutely amazing soundtrack! It's probably one of the best soundtrack's for an ARPG since Diablo 2, and I don't say that lightly.There are some very well done ambient sounds, such as hearing flies buzzing around corpses, crackling around fires, etc--which adds a nice layer of detail to the sound design.The Combat sounds are quite well done. The guns are punchy, spells sizzle, and weapons thud like you would expect.Day & Night CycleThis really adds to the games presentation and atmosphere, while also adding a layer of believability.Now, some cons:Lack of Cinematics & Voice ActingThere is some voice acting, and what's there is actually pretty well done, but there is no voice acting for quests and dialogue. The writing is overall pretty high quality, but I think some more voice acting would help sell the story more. This is only a minor con imo, as I think Crate are planning to add in more voice acting towards the end of their development schedule.Slow StartI gotta admit the game didn't immediately click with me at the start. This seems to be a problem with most ARPG's, as you have a general lack of abilities and gear in the first few hours. But, it gets a whole lot better if you decide to stick with it for a couple of hours and get a few abilities.Lack of Visual CustomisationGames like Diablo 3 let you dye your armour, as well as transmogrify a peice of armour to look like another piece. Path of Exile has microtranscations for those things too. This is a great thing for games that are so focused on character development, and it's one feature that is sadly lacking in Grim Dawn. It does suck when your character is wearing armour that is not matching, with random colours and such. I'm hoping Crate adds a similar feature in the near future.Lack of Randomised Dungeons & MapsThere is a rogue-like Dungeon which is meant to address this, and admittedly it is meant to be a pretty kick-♥♥♥ dungeon (I haven't checked it out yet, but I have seen videos). Compared to Diablo 3's Rift System and Path of Exile's Maps, it's missing a lot of Enemy and Tileset variety.Development is a little slow...The game has been in full development since around 2012 (counting from the Kickstarter date). The general consensus seems to be that new builds take a little bit longer to release then most would like.Most of these cons were only minor cons for me, but can be major cons depending on how you feel about them.Overall, Grim Dawn does A LOT of things right. It has some features that should be standard for ARPG's, and those features make Grim Dawn feel like a very believable, detailed and rich gameworld. There is a lot of depth and replayability here, and if you even have a remote interest in ARPG's--Grim Dawn should be a no brainer.			"

												Grim Dawn let me make a sorceress with a shotgun. More than that it encouraged me to, because that shotgun happened to be the perfect fit for the build I was working towards. I could have given her an enchanted pistol, or a giant warhammer, or really any of the countless weapons to be found throughout the world, and made it work. But as I was dashing through the ruins of a seaside town, ducking in and out of crooked doorways to blow zombies and floating eyes to hell with burning buckshot, I knew I had found my calling. At least until I find a bigger gun.Freedom of choice is the chief takeaway from Grim Dawn, one of the most recent entries in the crowded ARPG/Diablo lootsplosion genre. Unlike its peers, Grim Dawn decouples weapons, armors, and even skills from specific classes, letting you be anything from an armored shaman with a lightning scythe to an arcane fire-slinging gunman to a demon-worshipping hammer-wielding assassin. The only thing limiting your gear choices are your level and your three base character stats, which all rise as your character grows and you invest in your classes. And yes I said classES because Grim Dawn lets you choose two of its six archetypes to mix into your character.The classes themselves can be a bit of a hangup for new players because of the unique level of control you have over your skill progression. Rather than unlocking skills at certain levels, each class tree has a Mastery bar for you to spend skill points on. This bar grants you important base stat boosts and unlocks your actual skills with enough points invested. Of course, then you have to balance spending points on Mastery or the skills, and across two class trees to boot. It can be a bit daunting until you realize your greatest gains come from your Mastery, so you'll generally want to one-point your skills until you unlock them all.Many of your skills are passive, meaning combat tends to be less technical than Diablo or other competitors. Indeed, more than a few battles are won or lost in the preparation of auras, toggle abilities, and weapon selections. You'll also find skills baked into the gear and upgrade components you find, some powerful enough to design an entire build around. In another liberating design decision, class skills are much more focused and specific while item skills are your more general fireballs and lightning novas, allowing you to make a pure caster out of literally any class combination.Unprecedented freedom means nothing if there's nothing to do with it, but Grim Dawn does not disappoint here, either. The world of Cairn is in the throes of a magical apocalypse, with ruined towns and valleys and forests full of unspeakable horrors to bludgeon. Enemies and allies alike are divided into factions, with new quests and gearing options availiable from those that like you, and new bosses and challenges from those who don't. The main quest will keep you busy for a good 30 hours just putting down one of the major threats to the world, but building reputation and uncovering new secrets can last you dozens more hours.And my God, the secrets! I'm a big fan of exploration in games and few reward you so richly as this. Unmarked dungeons and unique bosses can pop up just about anywhere, providing unexpected challenges at any level. Virtually every map has breakable walls and hidden chests, and much of the best loot to be had is found in hard-to-reach containers. I once found a secret dungeon beneath a side dungeon inside a completely optional dungeon! On top of all this, there's another character progression system called Devotion that uses points earned from hidden shrines all over the world, a genius system that more ARPGs would do well to ape.Grim Dawn doesn't hold back in challenge, either, with some brutally hard side dungeons and optional bosses right from the first few hours. The main quest is easy enough to get through for even the inexperienced, so you have your choice of difficulty through exploration as well. All of this is presented with a gritty, moody look and some meaty sound work, though the soundtrack is pretty lacking and gets repetitive in a hurry. The Lovecraftian themes are well-realized and there's a ton of detail to the world, from engaging lore to morally gray decisions to make. Even if there wasn't so much to work with in the gear and skills systems this would be a solid competitor to Diablo and its ilk, but the wealth of options and progression systems easily makes Grim Dawn one of the top titles in the genre.

Early Access Review
								I was and I still am a huge fan of Titan Quest. Grim dawn has exceeded my expectations by miles so far. I like the graphics, I like gameplay and I like the way you can improve gear by using collectable items. Gameplay is great, resources are not too scarce but its still a challenge. I just love it!Yeah, progress is slow, the game is still in early access state. That's because developers resources are low and mostly because they are doing it right instead of releasing a half baked thing. Where I live we use to say ""do it right, or it's not worth to be done."" You guys seem to do it just perfectly, keep on doing so well! And don't listen to the voices of impatient kids, they know nothing about hard work...After playing another 80 hours I have to say that it's getting even better. I have played around with several builds and it has not become boring yet. New Items with incredible stats and abilities keep popping up from time to time, which then inspire me to make some new builds.The faction system and the long promised changes that devotion will bring seem to add some additional depth to the game as well as some new goals. Which means it's going to cost me even more of my lifetime... :)			"

Early Access Review
								Hello. I rarely review.  40 year old gamer here.  Been gaming my whole life...TT and PC.  This is without a doubt the greatest RPG/ARPG I have ever experienced.  186.6 hours of play time later, I am still amazed at this masterpiece.  It may be the best PC game ever made...but I will stick with best RPG.  Seriously, the designers of this game have truly just created a work of art.  That is all.  Buy this game, play it to death and then play it more.			"

												This is one of those games where you can just feel that the developers poured thier heart and soul into its creation.  Solid from start to finish and challenging on the ultimate difficulty.  Skills are fun to use and the multiclass system adds additional depth to character creation.  If you enjoyed Titan Quest or Diablo 2 I would highly recommend that you check out Grim Dawn.			"

												MassDebates New Game Log - Grim DawnStart of Day 1:Saw an advertisement today and figured I'd buy this game to try it out for 2 hours. Looked like a new Diablo 2, but I knew not to get my hopes up too much after what happened with Diablo 3.  I'll log my thoughts occasionally as I play, so you can see a time-based breakdown and you know where the game is good & bad. 2:44PM-It looks pretty good. Graphics are nice; High contrast but I don't feel like I'm on acid (like some games) 2:56PM-Enjoying combat gameplay and found skill window hotkey. Really cool hybrid skill system. Must explore later. 3:02PM-I FOUND 3 RARE YELLOW ITEMS! BEFORE MY FIRST MAGIC! OMFG! LOOKING UP KEYBIND FOR INVENTORY NOW! 3:03PM-Discovered Inventory Hotkey. Items weren't rare. Angered, but still an awesome game. I'll get awesome ♥♥♥♥ later! 3:09PM-Had to stop gameplay to log a note. The plot is very well done. Story has got excellent writing elements, the characters really work well, and the lore is enoyable to read. I legit feel like I'm a savior to these people! No water, no food, evryone's turning into a total ♥♥♥♥ covered in evil green stuff... they were totally screwed before I came around. Great job, devs! 3:12PM-Found my first Enemy Hero. Luckily, I've got leech life for days. He looks tough, but I think I can take him! 3:15PM-DESTROYED HERO WHO EXPLODED IN A SLEW OF GREEN SET ITEMS- CANT WAIT TO SEE IF ANY MATCH!!! 3:16PM-Unfortunately, my gamer mouse seemed to have spontaneously crushed itself. Strange... Shooting over to the store for another. Oh, and minor, unrelated side note: Greens are not set items, apparently. 3:36PM-I've returned with a new mouse with metal-reinforced plastic and have resumed savior duties. 3:42PM-Discovered Devotion Menu after restoring first shrine. Holy ♥♥♥♥, this game's character building has got some serious kick! 5:18PM-Sorry, Haven't logged lately. Uh, games great and whatever. Hold on, I'll log some of the plot after I clear this Wasp Nest I found. I'm really close to getting a poison mod for shadow rush! 9:57PM-Uh... totally would tell you the plot but that's a lot of writing. Really in depth though, it's awesome. Better then reading a book ever could be. I need to head to bed soon, so I'll port to town, sell my latest loot, and continue logging tomorrow. 4:02AM-Ported to town and sold my loot. Sure, it was about 5 hours ago, but I said I'd continue reporting the day after, didn't I? This is for you, Steam Community. Remember that. 4:18AM-Discovered bounty table. Amazing feature for a game. Diablo needed this. Stepping outside for a smoke real quick after I port to town. It's that time, after all, and I gotta keep up with my Diablo 2 Tradition! 4:32AM-A bit late; stepping out for a smoke break real quick after I grab that chest I saw. (No room in inventory) 4:35AM-Collected chest items. Selling loot and then finally getting a smoke break. Nobody is ever on time for 420 anyways. 5:41AM-I've given up smoking. It is a dirty habit that takes away from the important matters in life. 8:04AM-Called in sick for work- illness is too great, especially with this reduced resistance curse on me right now. 12:21PM-Wow, did you know how much better the crafting is in this than DIablo 2? Horadric cube was bomb, don't get me wrong, but man, components, augments, rituals, and powders?GIMMY MY GRIMMY, Puh-LEEZ! 1:11PM-Girlfriend called me 4 times in a row. Can't she see that she only has to wait until I'm done with the mob I'm fighting!? At any rate, I'm super psyched- She's cooking my favorite cut of steak for dinner tonight at 5:00PM!! She also told me my parents were trying to get a hold of me since 3PM yesterday and haven't seen me. 3:21PM-I've quelled all immediate threats of danger for an entire town. When they were starving and eating rations of rotten, corrupt meat, I've given them food and the gift of fertile farmland. When they were too thirsty to sweat, I've demolished a river blockade and allowed irrigated water to flow. When they felt unsafe, I provided security. I've personally saved over 40% of this town single-handedly, sometimes repeatedly for the same villagers. and just now, when I find 3 pieces of some ♥♥♥♥-stained fabric handkercheifs in some hazardous-as-♥♥♥♥ ruins (because, y'know, fabric isn't anywhere else, apparently) after 15 minutes of searching, I finally gain enough trust to be treated as ""Friendly"".Ungrateful ♥♥♥♥♥.. 3:44PM-Found a new town. Cleaned up some worms out of a Farm. Very grateful people. I like 'Homestead' a lot more. 5:28PM-Girlfriend is furious, says that I lied to her about demonic forces taking over the local area and that I'm no longer invited over for dinner because she threw mine out after eating. After hearing Constance's voice while on the phone with me, she remains convinced that I'm hiding another woman on her. I said, ""Nonsense. She's a school teacher. I like my women promiscuous and sultry"". She hung up immediately after that while saying ""We're Done"". Why didn't she beleive me!?  I'll smooth it over with her tomorrow. 5:29PM-Phone died, but I'll plug it in to charge soon. 5:41PM-I've gotten up for the first time since playing to switch out the bathroom bags and grab the rest of my Mountain Dew & Dorito rations from downstairs Forgot to plug in the phone, but I'll get it on the next stand-up. 7:21PM-I've stepped foot onto the wastelands known as the 'Obsidian Throne' in my quests and my ambitions for amazing gear. This is one of the coolest areas so far. A whole new dimension, and better than Hell's Sanctuary was. 7:24PM-Girlfriend busted my room's door in while screaming about all sorts of stuff. She seems really ♥♥♥♥♥♥. 7:26PM-Just got to 2nd level of Cthonic Rift Portal, and got my first summon (from Devotion's Grim Reaper). I've mentally decided that I'm going to explore the Shaman and Occultist characters after I'm done with this one. 7:52PM-Girlfriend storms out saying ""I give up. I'm not even going to try. Tell your Mom I said thanks for the flowers, because I'm leavning for good."" and throws a vase at the wall. Even though it amazingly landed face up, unspilled and unbroken, it was still totally uncalled for.  11:59PM-I'm out of Mountain Dew, but I have plenty of Doritos left. If it were the other way around, I'd be really annoyed by seeing ""Untouched Meal"" every 5 minutes. 1:22AM-I'm now out of doritos, but there's still at least a half-cup of water left in the flower vase. I should be good to go for a while before I go downstairs to refill it. 2:44AM-The police have arrived at my place and are forcing me to shut off the computer before they take me in. I told them I didn't do anything wrong, that I have an alibi, and that it's all even logged right here! They gave me some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about a 'missing person' and that they have to bring me in for Fingerprints to make sure they know whether or not I'm 'the guy'.♥♥♥♥ing idiots... I wasn't missing. I knew where I was the whole time..Originally posted by author, days later:Please, if you value your life, do not get this game. I've been released after treatment for malnourishment, video game dependence-based anxiety, hallucinations, and an inability to separate fantasy from games. My gf and family have left me.

I'm so alone....Update: Found multiplayer "

												One of the best early access games I purchased. I love the world, graphics, combat, and skill trees. If you enjoy these types of games, you know how satisfying it is to think of a build and go for it, only to see it work better than expected. Good stuff.  In my opinion this is better than Van helsing series and Diablo 3,.. As of others have said, this is closer to Diablo 2 and what Diablo3 should have been. Also, you can play offline and online if you choose.			"

'If it bleeds, I can kill it‘Jarvis when confronted with an Aetherial that possesses a human__________________________________________IntroductionA world on the brink of destruction, plagued by aetherial spirits, demons and insane cult members fighting for power, awaits a hero to stop these evil hordes - welcome to 'Grim Dawn‘.To cut the whole story short: this game is among the best ARPGs that I have played to date and provides hours and hours of fun for fans of the genre and loot-grinding in general. It has a good amount of character customization (stat and skills points, the devotion system, active and passive abilities), an atmospheric world with a 'grim' style, some good lore and background information, a good amount of sidequests and secrets and of course: tons and tons of loot.__________________________________________Important points in ARPGsAt first I want to focus on some main points that are my most important requirements for a loot based ARPG game:The character creation should provide a good amount of variety and depth, there should be several different characters with lots of (viable) builds, even for endgame: Check!A fast-paced fighting system with interestings skills and combinations and a quite tough difficulty curve for having some challenge: Check!Loot! Lots and lots of interesting and varied loot plus crafting and augmentations (that awesome stuff you need to grind for several hours because your character REALLY needs those 25 extra points of DPS): Check!An interesting world with lots of atmospheric areas and some interesting lore: Check!Exploring the maps should feel worthwile and sidequests, secrets areas and mysterious stuff should await courageous adventurers: Check!An acceptable length plus additional difficulties and a hardcore mode to provide some long-term motivation: Check!A coop mode is always a great feature because every now and then it's more entertaining to grind for stuff with others: Check!__________________________________________Gameplay, builds and all the other stuffAs usual in every ARPG you run around, killing hundreds and thousands of enemies while looting every stash and treasure that you see on the screen. The fights tend to be very fast-paced and require some fine-tuning in terms of skills and equipment in higher difficulties.Grim Dawn does many things right. There are some visually very appealing areas, the soundtrack is fantastic, the atmosphere and style is splendid and there's a lot of stuff you can kill and loot aside from the main path. One of the most important points in an ARPG is certainly the character itself. You play with him/her for quite some time and you should be able to develop everything in the way you prefer it to fit your playstyle. Luckily 'Grim Dawn' provides a good amount of character customization:At first there's a dual class character system. You can combine two of the six classes to get one of the 15 available Masteries. This allows a lot of interesting options to specialize in different skills and mechanics and trying out new combinations is a lot of fun.Stat Points: Physique, Cunning, Spirit. Those are the three stats where the stat points can be allocated to. Not very special though, that’s basic stuff.Skill Points: the dual class systems gives you two skill trees with several levels and lots of passive and active abilities. That way you can specialize your character in different ways. Reallocating your points is possible though.Devotion: There are lots of stars on the sky and they belong to a lot of different celestial powers. While exploring the world you can find devotion shrines and by cleaning or restoring them you can get points to spend in the devotion system, another layer of character customization. There are many different signs and options that provide lots and lots of passive abilities or even new active skills.Equipment: It’s an ARPG so there’s a lot of equipment for sure. The common rarities (normal, magic, rare, legendary and epic stuff + set items) wait for fearless adventurers and skillfull heroes. Some epic and legendary items even grant your character new active and passive skills. Additional special attacks or even more passive or automatically proccing skills can make quite a difference when you face some nasty bosses and enemy hordes.Augmentations and Crafting: Yes, you will grind a lot for several ingredients and recipes. It will annoy you. But you’ll do it nonetheless to improve your gear even further. Add some additional damage, get some more resistances or provide other usefulls points by adding augmentations to your equipment – never say no to additional positive stats. You’ll need them. Those bosses are not known for mercy.So much for the character customization. With two classes you can try out really interesting combinations. Should your Soldier class get some magic power as well by choosing the Arcanist and becoming a Battlemage? Or should he fight with the skills of a Nightblade, annihilating enemies with two weapons at once as a Blademaster? Your choice.The character system is backed up by an interesting world with lots of secret areas, side quests and neat little stuff to explore and a very good atmosphere throughout the whole game. There are also several factions that you can side with and some of them (and some sidequests as well) require some simple decisions as well: choose option A and Side B will hate you or the other way around. Nothing too special but it adds some replay value.The story itself is (typically for the genre) solid but nothing more. The lore and the background information however are quite interesting (yes, I actually read the little journey entries) and increase the atmosphere of this mad world even more.__________________________________________ConsOf course there’s some shadow as well. The game is not always working completely stable, I had approximately 10 crashes in the hours I spent so far (funny: most of them while closing the game), though the last update reduced the amount of crashes a lot. As usual you need to grind quite a bit for upgrade materials and reputation points, the dialogue windows are somewhat ugly and… yeah that’s it. That’s all I can think of at the moment. Compared to the game‘s positive aspects it can be ignored easily.__________________________________________ConclusionWhenever I start the game I play more than intended at first. Every time. That’s quite a good sign as the game is a lot of fun and combines several advantages of amazing ARPGs of the past while providing neat little comfort functions (e.g. show only loot of a particular rarity or higher) and requires the player to actually read and listen to dialogues and journal entries because there are no quest markers on the world map (only on the mini map when you are close to them). That’s perfectly fine and encourages to run through areas again.Overall 'Grim Dawn' is among the best ARPGs that I have played so far and in combination with the mod support, the regular updates and the co-op mode it provides fun for a looong time. Sure, there are some rough edges that could use some more polishing (.e.g the dialogue windows needs getting used to, personally I think they are ugly) but even now I’d gladly rate it 9 out of 10 points as it provides nearly everything that you want from an ARPG.Okay, that was enough talk. Time to grind! Only 16 more chipped claws to craft that little component. Sweet!__________________________________________This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union,providing better standards for reviews and reviewers.			"

												I am a great fan of the diablo series, but this game feels like how diablo 3 should feel. You start off in some small city and from the first moment in, I felt it to be ''just right''. Even when they used the same engine as Titan Quest, the graphics in this game looks amazing and stunning. Its like the developers didnt want ANY place in this game to look like it has been created on a hurry. Every single bit of environment you encounter looks just right. The trees, the little abandoned cottages, the looks of mobs. As far as I have played, which isnt that much yet, even the most outlying places looks great. I am a fan of multiplayer, and the way this games handles the ''drop-in'' and ''drop-out'' of multiplayer works like a charm. Indeed, they dont support their own servers for multiplayer, but they did an awesome job here. No port forwarding needed. Just enter if you would like to play single player, multiplayer using LAN or INTERNET, or joining one of those. Everyone with a decent connection should not have any problems with this game playing over either Lan or Internet.The dept of this game overall is amazing. The skilltrees, the devotion points (Points that can be acquired through shrines around the world), the dual specialization, the different classes. The blacksmith who can craft amazing and lots of items and add-ons for your character. The shared stash tab, so you can share items between other characters instantly. Although Grimdawn is an ARPG, the different playstyles you can combine with or without friends feels so good. I have played a lot of RPG's and ARPG's before, but Grimdawn feels like something ''new''. Not the standard hack and slash experience, but something feels different in this game. All the variation in it makes it so great. You even have an option to turn your camera around, so if you're bored with this game (I cant image why), you could turn the camera 180 degrees and its like you're playing a whole new world!Would I recommend this game? Well definitely I will! And that for only 25 euro's? Thats amazing!			"

												Grim Dawn is a top-down Action Role Playing Game. I would have said Isometric if the camera wasn't adjustable though. With many similar gameplay elements to THQ's Titan Quest, the game has its own distinct art style and unique flair with plenty of modern day ARPG improvements. As I mentioned, this game is a great spiritual successor to Titan Quest and although it's a little slower paced than...say...Diablo 3, I'd say the rewards and overall character progression feels much more satisfying. At the time of this review I'd still say this game and Path of Exile are the two best ARPGs out there right now and I've played them all except an obscure few. Difficulty progression is along the lines of Diablo 2. Where you start at normal difficulty, complete it and redo the whole story again in the next difficulty tier and so until a 3rd, final playthrough. You can also enable a veteran difficulty option that makes your current playthrough even tougher.Let's get the bad out of the way first. The multiplayer can break your character if you're not careful, unless they've fixed this since this happened to me and my friend. If the host is further along in the game than the friend you invite, it will break your friends' quests and replace them with yours, making it possible to skip everything they haven't done yet and miss important NPCs and quest items with no way to return things to normal other than starting over. But as long as you stick together with fresh toons on the same quests throughout your playthrough, you'll be fine. The story is okay, it feels like it drags on at times but it is well told and thought out. With dozens and dozens (hundreds?) of NPCs to interact with as well as a few plot altering choices along the way, Grim Dawn manages to stay fresh up until the very end. Compound that with an amazing variety of multi-class options and skill selection mixed with all types of weapons and armor to supplement your playstyle, it's a joy to play. And hey, if you screw up your skill placement there's always an NPC that can fix that....for a price. There's also an added feature called Devotion, whose points are earned from shrines scattered throughout the game and can be used to further solidify your position as a walking weapon of mass destruction.Speaking of NPCs there are blacksmiths that will craft items from blueprints, faction based shops that will sell you items based on how friendly you are to the different factions in the area. A respec NPC, a few different types of item merchants and even a bounty system. There are tons of sidequests to be found along the path and given by NPCs.The music, sound effects and ambient noises mix well with the game's ""grim"" atmosphere. Everything fits together nicely. If you're interested I suggest looking up the Grim Dawn OST on youtube at the very least.More content is still being added, which is great. There will be an Illusionist NPC that lets you transmogrify equipment to look like other equipment you've found, much like Diablo 3's Mystic. An expansion on the way and there's already some extra dungeons and events like the Crucible that have been added over time too. Even for the full price I still think this game is worth it. I recommend it, highly. One of my all-time favorite ARPGs.			"

Full Review BelowHover to see my verdict-->Double Thumbs Up from Royial!Grim Dawn, a spiritual successor to Titan Quest (check that out if you haven't already) a new standard for ARPGs by Crate Entertainment, better than Path of Exiles, Torchlight 2, and WAY better than Diablo III.Full character customizationMix 6 different classes for different play-stylesExplore a HUGE worldCraft Gain reputation with several factionsReap great rewards and fight big bossesThe world of Cairn is gritty and dark, with interesting lore that definitely is inspired from Lovecraft and music that reminds me of the good old days of Diablo and Diablo II. All in all my new standard for all ARPGs, Path of Exiles is a great ARPG, Torchlight 2 is a goodARPG, Diablo III is not a funARPG, for me, Grim Dawn has everything and then some that all of these other titles don't have, and for that reason alone its worth the purchase. Need another reason? Its only$24.99USD, that is what I like to see on PC gaming, great games and great prices. Support these guys now!

								After 30+ hours of playing the first act i'm still having loads of fun! Plenty of replayability due to experimenting with different character builds, tactics, and the awesome dual class system. From what i've seen in act 1, the difficulty is good: A gimped character will die alot, as well as players rushing head long into the fray. Graphics are awesome, although carts on fire still eat up all my frame rates...Definitily buy this game if you are a fan of TQ, or if D3 wasn't enough to satisfy your hunger.			"

												I've been playing ARPG's since Diablo, am a firm believer that Diablo II: Lord of Destruction is the best ARPG ever made and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls is not a true successor to the series. Besides that I've also put time and effort in Torchlight II and Path of Exile, which I both found to be better than Diablo III but which still couldn't satisfy my ARPG need. Now I've purchased Grim Dawn early on but due to performance issues I was unable to play it at that time (which have been fixed) and I left it until recently.My experience comes from playing Act I in Hardcore Veteran mode, both solo and with friends in multiplayer. The difficulty at Veteran -which is a modifier to Normal difficulty, increasing the amount of ""Hero enemies"" and the rewards that you reap from them- is very solid. You will roughly level from 1 to 18-20 during Act I, during which I got the feeling that this game is quite well balanced. Sometimes you will feel weak, but most of the time that is to be fixed with reassigning your skills.The overal look and feel of this game is, like the name implies; Grim. It's dark and ""serious"", like Diablo II and Path of Exile. No cartoon art-style as Diablo III or Torchlight II. Personally I find this to be a big plus, seeing as this gives the game a more serious presentation. The unique point of this game is that you start the game without choosing a class, called masteries in Grim Dawn. Once you reach your first level you gain the option to select one out of six masteries; Arcanist, Demolitionist, Nightblade, Occultist, Shaman, Soldier. Each mastery has an unique and fun skill tree with enough skills to keep you trying out stuff for a while. Just like in Diablo II you will have to assign attribute points to either Physical (health), Cunning (melee) or Spirit (mana). A lot of gear you will find will require X points into Physical and either X points in Cunning or Spirit, depending on the kind of gear (weapon type, heavy or normal armor).This goes on until you reach level 10, at which the game presents you to choose a (optional) second mastery. You can choose to combine masteries to supplement your character with additional skills that would otherwise be impossible to get, or to ignore this and go deeper into your previously selected mastery. Based on the combination of masteries you've chosen, your character class title will change to something else. The option of adding a second mastery will stay definitely once level 10 has been reached. The current level-cap is 85.All in all this game feels refreshingly good and comes close to the feeling I've got while playing Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, but without the bots running all the games. If you need something different from Diablo III, Torchlight II or Path of Exile, this is it.			"

I would recommend 100% for any ARPG lovers out there... Only good things to come in the future. Very much worth the $30 CAD on the game, better than any ""Popular"" game in the RPG genre			"

								Holy S.h.i.t !   It´s not very professional to start a review like that but I really had to do this. I played Diablo 2 Classic Ladder on Closed Battlenet for like 10 years and I could´nt wait for Diablo 3. STOP. It was an Epic Fail for me, so i began to search and search for a ""better Diablo 3"" and i played games like Torchlight 2, Path of Exile and Others. Then I ´ve heard about Grim Dawn and I was like ""that sounds very promising to me"" Some months later I found it here on Steam and I was like ""Its an instant buy, you cant go wrong with that!"". STOP. After the first 5 minutes the game totally got me. Just like Diablo 2 did, years ago. The atmosphere is wonderful and dark, graphics are nice but not kick a.s.s, Sounds are also very dark and just fitting. The Skilltrees are the way they had to be in Diablo 3 and the whole itemsystem with blueprints (not yet working though!) is really motivating and interesting. So far I´ve played 70 hours, testing alot of nice builds, checking out fix ideas and such on this ALPHA on GREENLIGHT, which gave me TONS more fun than Diablo3 ever did. So to come to a conclusion: you CANNOT make anything wrong with this game, IF you are into A-RPG at all.			"

At the moment of this review I have played for 119 hours. Previously I have played to Diablo (I,II) Torchlight II, Path of Exile and Van Helsing II and this genre of game is not my favorite.This game has been in steam early access for a time, and the players feedback and testing were used to improve the game to the version that we can play today.Do I think this game is good and can I recommend it? YES, absolutely. I bought it on steam sale, but believe me, this game is worth at full price. A few words about this game? DIABLO 2+TITAN QUEST+PATH OF EXILE= GRIM DAWN. Is the game alive? Yes. Average of 4000 players/day  Steam database source  [steamdb.info]

Graphics: This game has a dark-gore-Victorian ambience that, personally, I love. All the decoration, the colors, the houses, roads, each cave, the entire map makes you feel that ambience. About that, the scenarios are not randomly generated, each map is almost the same each time you start a game: rocks, bodies, some enemies will change their position, but the maps don't change. And ""that"" is something really GOOD. Why? If you have been playing to torchlight or diablo, each dungeon are random each time you enter. But it lacks of personality. Here, you will find secret areas, secret caves, which don't appear in the map, are hidden from the sight, sometimes you need to find a secret lever to open the entrance. There are hidden areas, which you will unlock with some explosive help, runes or... well, I won't tell you all the secrets. There are letters and books that will teach you the story of Cairn, or simply a love letter from a dead body to his loved and beside that, the ambience, because here you feel the love that their creators invested everywhere, with little details like a tree, a clock, a sewer, the office of a doctor, the lair of a thief... You will think that you know a zone perfectly, but you will find secrets that you didn't notice that were there before, and THAT is surprising in this kind of games. The isometric view is correct, much more better than others like path of exile. The shadows, textures, details etc... excellent (for a game like this, don't compare it with Doom)Spells and attack effects? Really good. Fire and ice, venom, caos, guns, temblors... Just watch a gameplay and you will see it. Music: Do you remember Diablo 2 themes? Some tracks of Grim Dawn makes me remember those moments where I was following to the vagabond ""east, always to the east"". The atmosphere that the music makes, it's the right balance to this kind of games where you start to walk and your goal is to arrive to a point smashing and murdering everything in front of you.

Story: You begin your steps as the only man/woman that has been able to survive to the possession of a form of life from another dimension, the aetherial. Soon you will know more about this invasion from another world, that has upside down your world, from a prosperous empire to the actual moment, where humanity hardly survive fighting against the aetherial, their puppets, and their rivals, which are not your friends either. That has give you a reason to fight back and maybe you have become into the last hope of humanity. How much time to finish the main quest? More or less 40 hours. Depends if you like your class from the beginning. In my case, I played a conjurer to level 48 and liked it a lot but tried a warlock and I prefer it, so I have finished the game in normal with this one. Gameplay: Just... perfect. In other Action rpg games you lost your objective, and soon you feel like a monkey smashing the same button to kill hundreds of enemies. Grim Dawn with its two classes build style, allows you to search the way you want to play, for fun. At level 1 you will choose your class, at level 10 you will be able to choose an additional class. So, If you are soldier + arcanist you are a Battlemage, sword plus magic. But if you are soldier + demolitionist your are a Commando, sword plus guns. Each class can be played in a lot of ways and if you are interested, I recommend you to visit this forum, where you will find massive information about the different classes and possible builds, guides, gameplay videos... so you can see if that class is the character you will like to play.Build Comendium [www.grimdawn.com]Negative point: * There's no way to hide the HUD. Max you can do is to downsampling, change to minimal hud scale, hide the map and quest log. Crop and paste that shot.Besides, If you want to take a shot from another angle, you have to use a mod that allows you to move up and down the camera. That shows you that there's no sky, literally. The sky is black and the roof does not exist. No need to be there because you only play with isometric view xD* Sometimes when you exit the game, it doesn't, and you get a black screen. In my case, this happened when I used spanish language patch.* If you want to craft, you have first: get the blueprint (the recipe) then you have to craft the different materials but someones have a very low drop rate from mobs. This can get you mad but if you like this... it's not a negative point.			"

Early Access Review
								Edit:  Posting an update because we just got the final release (build 31), and I've put in about 200 more hours since my first review.  Multiplayer is much improved from a month ago.  We now have Voiceovers and an intro video.  It's hard to describe here, but the overall ""smoothness"" feel of build 31 is significantly better than it was in b29/30.  We have gotten some added content in act 2, drops were slightly increased for Elite and Ultimate, the skill tree has been modified significantly (in a good way), many items have been altered, many skills have been updated... overall, I'd say that, as good as the Early Access version of GD was, this final version is even better.  I'm so excited that I deleted my 81 blademaster, 80 witchblade, 70 commando, and 63 battle mage this morning, and started everything over from scratch.The game is going live in 2 days, on Feb 25.  I highly recommend that you buy it.Oh, and watch out for Karraz, Sigil of Ch'thon, he's gotten a huge buff.  He almost took out my 63 battlemage on Elite Hardcore last night.Below is my original review.I tried out Grim Dawn about 15 months ago, and it was still pretty rough.  However, I came back to it after b29 made it content complete, and it's now ready for Prime Time.  Grim Dawn takes so many elements from Titan Quest that I loved, and it mixes them up with the gritty flavor from d1 and d2.Pros:  ItemizationCustomizationGritty FeelVery Large WorldMuch more Polished than most games at releaseCons:Multiplayer could use some workOverall, I give it a hearty thumbs up.

Early Access Review
								After nearly 500 hours of early access playtime I feel i should weigh in on Grim Dawn. Also at 491 hours and rising it should tell you i've enjoyed this game greatly, and have paid for two other copies that i gave to my brother and a friend. Now lets get to the actual Review.Grim Dawn as a game does not hold your hand, in quests you are told to seek out something or someone at a location, after that you are left on your own to search for your objective, only once you get near your objective(about near the edge of your screen) does a marker show up. This encourages exploration of areas in full and i also reccomend that you fully explore an area there are many secrets in the game to be found, from loot, to quests, to bosses that may or may not kill your character when you first meet them.The world is also not sectioned off like say as it was in Titan Quest or Diablo, it is instead one continous worldspace, akin to Sacred, some complain about this giving the games world areas too similar to one another, i personally enjoy this as it creates a more cohesive world.As for the games story, i find it enjoyable enough, when you start the game your character was to be hung at the gallows for being possessed by an Aetherial spirit, said spirit abandons ship before it dies with you, you're cut down, then asked if you want to stay you need to earn your keep by assisting the settlement of Devils Crossing, i wont spoil much more, but another thing i would like to address about the games story is that some NPC's you meet arent helpless sods needing rescue, bar some casses. theres quite a few times in the game where you find the odd NPC camped out somewhere surrounded by slain monsters, I find this a refreshing change of pace compaired to other ARPGs. Lastly much of Grim Dawn's history, backstory, and lore are found via notes scattered throughout the world, some are journals from before the game, others history of the world, or just the odd bit of why a particular foe is with a faction. Again encouraing more exploration of the world.Now to the meat and bones of any ARPG, Character customiztion, progression and loot. Lets start with the Masteries, in Grim Dawn there are 5(and a 6th coming in the next build, Build 27) Masteries, Soldier, Demolitionist, Occultist, Nightblade, and Arcanist, and soon to be the Shaman. the Soldier is your melee specialist,  hearty and strong, a robust choice for someone new to grim dawn.The Demolitionist is all about explosions and fire. Like seeing the world burn? then this is the mastery for you.The Occultist Focuses on debuffs, pets, and debilitating attack spells. command minions to maul your foes or debilitate them with vile curses.The Nightblade is your melee dual wielder, focusing on speed, and very fast attacks, want to shred your enemies into ribbons? chose the nightbladeThe Arcanist is a pure spellcaster  that rains down destruction and devastation. the glass cannon of the gameEach of these masteries can be combined with another to create a dual class, covering one masteries weakness or bolstering anothers strengths. in my opinion this lends the game a great deal of replay value because i am the kind of person who will explore all avenues of play. with the varied skill pool of a single mastery there are quite a few dual class combinations you can take advantage of and explore different playstyles.The loot in Grim Dawn is quite good, the qualities ranging from White(basic), Yellow(magic), Green(rare or rare monster infrequent), Blue(epic) and Purple(Legendary, not yet in the game). Curiously magic rare and epic are competative, in some character builds a good yellow might be all you need to properly outfit an equipment slot,  while another can get by with some basic epic items, or builds looking to gear in all rare equipment. there are a number of affixes to suit any and all builds, as well as epics.There is also a Faction system in Grim Dawn, there are many groups you can aid, and many you can anger. Increasing your standing with friendly factions allows you access to their equipment and augments. these augments offer additional bonuses to your items and can be worth the effort to obtain access to them. Conversely further angering hostile factions makes them send more dangerous enemies at each threshold, culminating in the chance to encounter a Nemesis, a random boss linked to the faction you angered. these nemesis bosses while rare drop incredible loot, and assure an epic from their defeat, and once they are in the game, an increased chance of legendary drops.this last section I am going to adress some deal breakers: Many ask ""will there be secure servers?"" at this time there are no plans for such, it is however under consideration if Grim Dawn sells enough to pay for the required infrastructure and personel to maintain them. Tying into that, Grim Dawns files are all stored locally, every game file and every save file is on your hard drive, to those with the ability to edit and modify them, they can. this leads to seeing some oddities in multiplayer games, like players exceeding the current set level cap, items that are unobtainable legitamately, and stats that are likewise impossible. Grim Dawn is going to be moddable, this is why the games files are on our hard drives, so that once we have the mod tools we can edit the files as we please. Lastly while there is PvP, it is not the focus of the game and is not balanced accordingly, in fact most pvp matches tend to be whoever gets hit first dies. Grim dawn is primarily PvE and will remain as such.To close this out, if you want an ARPG that offers very deep character customization and itemization and great gameplay and atmosphere then this game is for you. If you want a secure multiplayer experience away from what you would consider cheaters this might not be your cup of tea.thank you for reading my long as hell review.see the full version on the forums here: http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?p=249496#post249496 "

Early Access Review
								Well... I suppose I'll write a review after testing the game for over 1k hours though after the game's release I will definitely update this.So. Let's start with the company. Crate Entertainment currently consists of a team of 8 people who not only communicate with the community (this is amazing) - but also know how to create a kick ♥♥♥ game. They started with only 2 people for quite some time while receiving off and on support from people they knew who also worked on TQ - gradually and with help from Kickstarter + Steam Early Access sales they have managed to expand and continue to amaze the fans who are eagerly waiting for this game to be released (even now it is defnitely worth it imo).Grim Dawn takes all the good things from Titan Quest and makes it better while also distinguishing itself in it's own way. The game plays and feels like Titan Quest while it also reminds me of Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 when it comes to the grittier/darker visual appeal. This to me is the ultimate combination of ARPG games and to be apart of the development process in testing and providing feedback for such a game is an amazing experience.Now to the game.Story - Grim Dawn is actually what the peope of Cairn (world of Grim Dawn) call what is pretty much the apocolypse in that an invasion of 2 otherwordly races have invaded the world. One race, the Aetherials want to possess everything that lives all the while pretty much terraforming the planet in order to make Cairn a more liveable place for them - while the other race, the Ch'thonians want to stop this from happening which means butchering those that the Aetherials are interested in possessing which includes you and any survivors that managed to live through the initial invasion.That is the overall plot in which the beginning of the game is more stressing the survival aspects of living in a now ruined world - while also building a foundation for future encounters with the Aetherials and Ch'thonic invaders. The danger is very real - and there are other nasty beasts, creatures and outlaws that also pose a threat to your survival.There are Quest Options for choosing different outcomes in a quest, and there will be factions that will be added later on in development (perhaps late this year or early next year hopefully).Combat - Very much like Titan Quest but having a faster pace. So far it's been quite good and the devs continually update animations, balance skills, and fix bugs with skills when they can. Definitely not Diablo 3 which admittedly has some good combat that flows very well (one of the few things that I'll give to the game) - but it's still pretty good. Hopefully as development continues whatever issues that people find will be fixed and improved upon.Characterization - Creating a character has only male/female options but this will probably change later when it comes to having different options for faces/hair as pertaining to a dev post. As this isn't hugely important it will be done later on I would imagine. However the main thing: replay value and creating Skill Builds. This is definitely there. Just like Titan Quest, Grim Dawn has the dual mastery system where you start off with one mastery/class at level 2 and once you reach level 10 you can choose a second one. With 5 Mastery's that is 15 combinations of either sticking with 1 mastery or using the dual mastery system. Itemization also expands character builds by a lot which brings me to...Itemization/Crafting - Really good. Common/White items are useful for the couple low levels in which you can then turn them off (making them more of a visual look when it comes to enemies dropping stuff they are wearing/using(!!!)), Magic/Yellow items are next in line which although not usually as powerful as later tiers they can roll a lot higher with their affixes, Rare/Green items have affixes that are unique and can be quite powerful, Epic/Blue items have set affixes with merely the rolls being varied + they can be set items, and Legendary items are not yet in the game.Needless to say the itemization in this game is fantastic and compliments both the skill building aspect of the game and the loot hunt part of the game.Level Design - Handcrafted world means the level design looks really good but of course trades that off with less randomization. Enemy camps can be randomized in some cases and there are randomized barriers which players can encounter and have to find a way to get around them via an alternate route - giving some slight randomization and also promoting exploration. The level design for each area is done in such a way that the player can continue on in the direction of the next area quickly - or spend time to explore the area for loot/dungeons/caves/quests. Essentially levels are short but wide - so later playthroughs you can choose whether or not to spend more time exploring or continuing on with the quests. The game isn't finished yet so content on Act 3 and perhaps the miniature Act 4 that may be added will also be quite interesting to see.Enemies - Are quite diverse and are also in their own faction which means you can actually see Aetherials and Ch'thonic enemies duking it out before you even get to the fight. As with Titan Quest later difficulties means secret bosses/challenge dungeons that would have been locked in the previous difficulty.Some more Positive things: -Modding - is amazing. Titan Quest and Diablo 2 both have great mods that I have enjoyed and since GD's modding tools will be better I am hoping for some amazing mods later on in the future.-Survival Mode. Sounds just like it says in that you need to survive against waves of enemies, modding can definitely expand on this.-Open World PVP. Though the game's skills/itemization isn't based on PVP modding could definitely create balanced PVP and probably some interesting game modes I would imagine.-Camera that is fully rotatable and has decent zoom.  Might not seem like that much of a deal but after playing GD - trying other ARPG's or even Moba's can be relatively frustrating due to lack of camera control.-Weather + Day and Night System.-Will be DRM free on release - for those that are wary about Steam and want to fully own the game.-No economy.Some possible Negatives:-Single player based with optional multiplayer. Single player mode is perfectly fine while multiplayer can be a bit iffy mainly due to it being just released - optimization will definitely improve on the multiplayer experience.-No closed servers. Like TL2 and TQ there aren't closed servers. Should the game do amazingly well the devs have expressed their interest in such a thing but they would rather spend money on more content before considering closed servers. That being said public games are usually pretty good and if someone joins in with a modded character you can always ban them from the game/server. A con when it comes to modding but the pros definitely outwheigh the cons.-No economy.-Slow development. Though I expect the game to be finished either early or middle of next year - the pace is relatively slow due to having a small team. That being said they do communicate well with the forum users and give updates every other Monday.-Costs $25. For some reason people really like F2P games but I'd rather pay a flat price for a full game rather then have a gimped free version of the game. For what you get out of the game $25 is super cheap even with the content that is available now.-Not optimized. Though I can run the game at max fine, that doesn't mean everyone can. Obviously lack of optimization is a given that will be improved later on in development - however both the devs and the community are pretty good in trying to help those who are having issues with running the game.Conclusion: Grim Dawn is definitely worth $25 if you enjoyed Titan Quest and perhaps Diablo 1 or 2.10/10 for an excellent Early Access game. Will update on release.			"

Early Access Review
								When I was a wee lad, I had an addiction to Diablo 2.  Sure, other games would find their way on to my 500 MB HDD, but they were just visiting.  That's where D2 lived.I waited 13+ years to Diablo 3 and, well, we all know what happened there.  I was left without a new ARPG that could scratch that itch. Then stumbled upon Grim Dawn.  It scratched.The visuals are stunning and gritty.  The atmophere is oppressive yet relaxing.  Hit detection is perfect.  Balancing seems on point.  Classes look and feel unique.  Skills are inventive and beautiful to execute.  Loot is expansive. Mechanics are sound.  MP community is wonderful.  Story is awesome.  Etc., Etc., Etc.Serioulsy, if you're like me and haven't been able to find that ARPG that satisfies that craving, this is it.10/10			"

												Think about a post apocalyptic world, but not the usual ""Mad max"" or ""Fallout"" ones. More the ""Diablo won this one"".Take basic archetypes. Mage, Druid, Warrior ... And mix them as you want !Finish the game once. That was tough ? YOU KNOW NOTHING JOHN SNOW !This game truly shines when you start looking at the depth of its gameplay and possibilities. Each dual archetype have multiple builds. Some are very laid back (hello Occultist summoner build, aka ""Pokemon master build"") some are way more active and hard to master. Another big plus ? MODS ! Another thing ? Additional content with free update !Trust me, an anonymous stranger in the crowd. It's a ""Good ol' game like we don't get anymo'e""			"

TITAN QUEST 2.0After 550 hours of playing Grim Dawn, I think it is time to write up my review.So, what is Grim Dawn? The short answer is that it is ""Titan Quest"" 2.0. The long answer is that Grim Dawn is an ARPG from Crate Entertainment. The game takes places in the world of Cairn, where it is basically destroyed by 2 supernatural warring factions (Chthonians & Aetherials). The Chthonians seeks to rid the world of all humans, while the Aetherials seeks to possess the humans and use them for their own gains. You are the survivor of one of those “possessions” and this is where you begin your adventures. The game has some great features (PROS) and not so great features (CONS), which I will be detailing below.In terms of greatness / Pros: 	6 core classes with the ability to select a 2nd class (at level 10) to further customize your character. (various character builds) 	Lots of customization for different playstyles & characters, including the Devotion system. 	Crafting systems is really cool, especially once you start collecting the difference recipes.  	Multiplayer is fun once you get a session started and are in a good group of players. 	Offline play / no “always online"" requirement to play the game. 	Modding Tools. 	Dev updates (aka: Grim Misadventure). 	Dark but beautiful world (dead bodies everywhere).In terms of lackluster/ Cons: 	Multiplayer can be frustrating as the connection can be subpar & some games are laggy. 	Graphic performance is underwhelming in some areas of the game. (i.e. Plains of Strife, where I get ca. 30 fps on a 980ti) 	Melee characters have a harder time, compared to magic / ranged based characters. 	Can get boring running through the same levels with different characters as there are no Pre-Generated levels/dungeons and depending on the player, the end game can be lacking. 	No “secret passage” like in TQ IT ;) This was a secret area in TQ: IT, where the bosses were named after the developers.  I am also aware of Dalia's SUPER SECRET QUEST, but for me it is not the sameConclusionGrim dawn is the spiritual successor to Titan Quest. They took the best of the core elements from TQ and improved upon them while adding new features (i.e. Devotions). In the end it is a worthy buy and I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a great ARPG set in a dark atmosphere.**********************SIDE NOTE: Another aspect, which I find interesting is that the developers have already stated that they are working on a survival mode and there is already an expansion planned for the future. This level of support for the customer is really nice to see and they are continuing with small updated to the game (i.e. patch 1.03 - Devotion changes)			"

												Since the release of Diablo 2, way back in the year 2000, basically every ARPG has been trying to be Diablo 3, yet none have truly succeeded, not even the actual Diablo 3. I'm not going to go so far as to say Grim Dawn is the 'real' Diablo 3, but its the closest an ARPG has come IMO.For starters, Grim Dawn (GD) has just about everything you would expect. Multiple classes, the ability to mix classes, an additional alternate advancement system, lots and lots of loot in different color flavors, and hordes of various enemies and bosses to slay. You can play solo, or with up to 4 others, and you can even enable PvP if you so choose. Perhaps its one outstanding difference is that the maps aren't randomly generated (for the main campaign, you can play custom maps, though I haven't explored that option), which initially felt odd until I just got over it and realized fully hand-crafted maps look better and are more logical than what even a good random generator can do. Will that hold up through multiple playthroughs? Not likely, but I've never been a huge fan of grinding an ARPG over and over again anyway.The graphics are very serviceable. They won't blow you away, but they also don't feel cheap, and there are some nice lighting effects and the overall style is a slightly different take on the traditional fantasy doom world full of zombies and other creatures. Same for the sound, which includes a bit of voice acting; its not top-notch, but once you get into the game you find that it all fits and works well-enough. The game runs well and I've only seen it crash once (on my wife's computers during multiplayer).The pace is good, and main storyline so far has been interesting (mostly told through lore text items you find), and I've liked every area I've seen so far. And since the maps aren't random, they all connect in a logical manner that gives the world of GD a more... worldly feel rather than just randomly connected zones. I think that last part is one of the major reasons I'm really like GD too; it has a better sense of progress as you uncover more of the world and the problems facing it.I also like that you aren't bombarded with abilities. Or rather, you have that option, as its very easy to focus-in on a few abilities that sound interesting and skip others during the leveling process. You can go so far as to only unlock and upgrade your auto-attack and passives/buffs, which means less button pushing but without gimping yourself. Again perhaps more min/maxing is needed at the highest difficulty, but for an initial run, that flexibility is there.GD is also pretty flexible in other areas too. You can undo spent skill points for a small cost, and many skills aren't exclusive to one type of weapon. So for example an auto-attack modifier will work whether you are using a 1h melee weapon or a 2h ranged weapon. That's nice and lets you switch up what gear you are using pretty easily as you find new and better drops. A constant flow of upgrades is a huge key to ARPG enjoyment, and GD nails this.Finally, the game is very co-op friendly. It will auto-party you if you select that option, and loot can also be personal until you drop it, making 'sharing' loot much easier. Simply scoop up all the stuff you see drop, and if you find something you think might be good for your buddy, drop it and they can grab it. Easy, quick, and painless. Quests also update for everyone in the party, so it doesn't matter who landed the last hit or who talked to an NPC. It basically feels like playing the single-player in terms of pace and function, only you also have a buddy running and killing along side you.If you enjoy ARPGs, Grim Dawn really is a must-play.

In the grim dawnness of Crate Entertainments' ARPG, there is only excellence...Grim Dawn has had one of the longest journeys through Early Access, I've been there right from the start, when it was a very rough and ready prototype with the first act, when the frame rate was choppy and the scenery was a little bit flat to say the least. But gods, the core gameplay was satisfying. It scratched the itch that only Diablo 2 and more recently Path of Exile had scratched in a very specific, and pleasing way. Over the intervening timeframe, it has grown, evolved, and refined itself, and matured into this majestic, noble thing. Scalable across a wide variety of systems, able to look beautiful on the very highest of rigs and still managing to look good on systems of modest means whilst maintaining a good framerate, the levelling and class development has grown with six base classes available, and the ability to dual class means that in effect you've the choice of no less than fifteen possible combinations from which to pick your build from. Twenty one if you decide for whatever reason to stick with a purely single class setup (which is eminently possible, but who wants to just go one way these days when you can swing two...). That's not even touching on the brilliantly insane devotion system, which unfolds like something that looked at Path of Exile and went ""You know, we can go one better...""And unlike Diablo 3 and Path of Exile, you can play THIS ARPG entirely offline.Waking to misery, trudging through despair, fighting through bleakness...The backstory of Grim Dawn is suitably black, tinged with plenty of sadness and horror along the way, and the story gets really dark in places, make no mistake, there's bits of the narrative which would serve as excellent nightmare fuel. This is going on for some of the less pleasant bits of Path of Exile, and makes Diablo 3 look like a nice and cheerful jaunt through the land of happy and merry. You -start- by fighting resurrected corpses and the recently raised villagers, sometimes loved ones of the very survivors you're actually trying to help, and things will only get -worse- as you take on demonic beings, aetherials and creatures dragged up from the very depths of whatever plane they saw fit to drag themselves up (or down) from.Despite this, the world manages to retain plenty of detail and colour, even if the overall atmosphere is unremittingly one of a world that has seen the coming of the end of days, and now clings on to existence by its' very fingernails. Villages are forced into fortified structures and natural defensive choke points, clinging to any kind of survival they can scratch out in this new, terrible world, everyone is on edge, and trust is hard to earn. This is particularly the case since you've had the ""good"" fortune to escape your demise by hanging as whatever posessed you decided to take leave, but in turn has left you the ability to create riftgates, these tears in reality are your fast travel around the world, but as it turns out, enabling them can just as readily draw aetherials to your location, a harbinger of what messing with such things might portend.The sweet rhythm of loot...On a mechanical level, the game will be instantly, and comfortingly familiar to anyone who has played Diablo 2 or Path of Exile, and reasonably familiar to anyone who has played Torchlight or any ARPG along these lines in the last five years. You move from place to place, picking up quests, clearing out monsters and champions, collecting escalating piles of loot, slowly building up your hero from a nobby nobody into a churning engine of destruction that can bring havoc upon the battlefield. In this the game works exceptionally well, the combat feels meaty, the skills are well balanced, most classes harmonise together in various ways (even class combos you wouldn't initially expect to work CAN work with the right gear and devotion star signs), and the loot drops at a steady clip. There's always new places to explore, new dungeons to plumb, new points of interest to look at, new shrines to cleanse and new things to -do-. Going back to your character is a bit like settling into a comfy sweater, it's comfort gaming at its' finest, and a great way to sink a few hours if you need a time out from the world. It's terrifyingly addictive and you'll find at every step of the way there's something to hook you in to keep you going just that little bit further, and it's not the skinner box approach, here it's the interest of ""what shiny will I grab next"" or ""what new dungeon will I get to see"" or ""What awesome new boss might I fight?"" or ""What will the story reveal?""This game eats time. It eats it with an appetite that borders on the scary. You'll sit down thinking you might do a quick session, you'll blink and two hours will have elapsed. It's that easy to get into, and it makes it that easy to just settle into a rhythm that is practically hypnotic. Don't play this game if you have deadlines to meet the next day, bad, bad idea.Closing thoughts...Crate Entertainment have finally answered the calls for a true blooded ARPG in the vein of D2 and D2X, a proper old school game that can be played whenever you want, wherever you want, that showers you with insane loot with all kinds of prefixes and suffixes, a game where builds are many and varied, where working out what KIND of Arcanist you want to be might need an A3 sheet of paper just to fit the devotion starmap onto, but would I have it any other way?Absolutely not. This is the ARPG that Diablo 3 wasn't, and Path of Exile, despite being -good-, sadly falls short with the need to be online all the time. This is the one I can take with me wherever I go. This is the one YOU can take wherever you go, that it's thoroughly excellent on top makes this a complete no brainer.Verdict : Essential "

												I haven't enjoyed an ARPG so much since I summoned my first Clay Golem at level 6.Ya know all those other ARPGs that have come out since then? Each one tweaked Diablo 2 just a little bit, and added or altered stuff, but never really quite hit the preposterously high bar D2 set. They were good games and I enjoyed most of them that I played, (except Torchlight, wasn't a fan for some reason) but they still left me wanting.If you can relate, Grim Dawn is what you've been looking for, its cherrypicked the best systems and ideas of all the recent well-done ARPGS, and basically jammed them back into a reimagining of Diablo 2 with great resultsIts the most worthy among a slew of competitors for the true successor to Diablo 2 (including PoE, D3, Titan Quest:IT, Torchlight 1 & 2)If you feel like this genre had gotten stagnant, like I did, this game will renew your hope.+1-4 player, instanced loot, trade loot, enemy difficulty/loot scaling by player+Atmosphere and feel of Diablo 2, but with guns+Class/level system of Titan Quest+Tons of components, crafting, and enhancements that significantly alter playstyle and can easily alter build path, like Path of Exile+Fantastic character build options+Shoulder slot+Totally needless amount of isntanced loot+good loot variety+good enemy variety+huge enemy groups, frequent enemy heros+fun, satisfying combat+Main quest is decently long, high replayability+reasonably priced=some pretty blatant recreations of Diablo 2 encounters (definitely more of an homage than a copy)=Class-granted skills are varied, but uninspired. (The excellent customzation comes from combining them with various other effects)=Lots of skills that prock on or or are dependent on % chance-per-hit-Environment variety isn't so great, simialr colors and titlesets pretty much the whole time-Summoners can only have one of each summon, no hellhound army builds :(-Storyline is meh. Not terrible, but clearly not its focus "

												Ok calling all RPG fans....Grim Dawn was made just for you if you likedDiablo 1 or 2, PreSkyrim Morrowind cycle, Throne of Darkness, Van Helsing, Titan's Quest, or any of their closest kin.The opening plot starts with you being possesed, tortured for inforrmation, and being hung. The hanging exorcises the aetheric infestation (4th dimentional being has no desire to die stuck in your body). Your rope gets shot down and the game starts with you enhanced body being asked if you're willing to redeam yourself and help save a small parcel of humanity. No spoilers there folks, watch the trailer (nicely done).The setting is as if someone took magical Renaissance era Europe added a touch of the old West, a dash of Tesla, and iced it all with some Soloman Kane.GraphicallyYou've got the 3 person top down angle camera view. And well folks... while the detail level isn't bad. This game is dark, grubby, and crumbling in looks. A while one occationally gets to walk through areas like this

I turned up my brightness. Cause everytime I was in a dark area at night. Even with light enhancing items, it was bloody hard to see. Which is realistic (and can be nice in a horror game) but I personally don't find it fun in a dungeon crawler.Audio 30% of NPCs have voice acting. The rest speak only in text format. The hacks, shots, grunts, ect are worthy; but nothing special. The background music is your typical ignoreable mood enhancer stuff.GameplayNow here's where it gets enjoyable. It's your standard mouse point directional walk, left click attack, right click ect.. with the customizeable 2 layered slots for potions, spells, special attacks, and the permanent spot for your personal rift portal (that your lovely modifed humanity grants you). A great class system and you'll get to choose 2 of them eventually. Then you get you devotional choices once you restore your first shrine (on a nice astrological skill map). Your inventory will expand with some quests. You have a storage chest and the ability to send items to your other characters. You get enhancement bits to add to your items. Once you help the blacksmith, the ability to craft. And if all that seams familar to you (to any core rpg player it should) there's the truth of this game. The developers have taken nearly every well working gameplay aspect from all the games before and used them.This isn't a bad thing even if it's not truly inovative. It's nostalgic without being hokey.There's also multiplayer available.........Overall I really think if you ever enjoyed a 3 person view RPG you should buy this. It's a premium experiance and a excellent dungeon grinder.			"

""Faith is the bird that feels the light when the dawn is still dark.""Grim Dawn is an action role-playing game (rpg) developed by the company Crate Entertainment with emphasis on hack & slash.Atmosphere & presentation:+ Convincing presentation of a bleak world after a post-apocalyptic event.+ Fitting background music enriches the melancholic atmosphere.+ Creative level and monster design with much love for detail.+ Diversified side quests with challenging boss encounters.+ Exploration of the locations and its secrets is awarded with good loot and interesting lore.o General layout and art direction of the game show parallels to its spiritual predecessor Titan Quest.Combat & gameplay:+ Fast-paced gameplay with a very good balance between combat and exploration.+ Elaborate dual skill tree system, known from Titan Quest, allows various class combinations, each of them supporting offensive and defensive playstyles.+ Alternative devotion system, basically a skill tree, adds further depth into character development.+ Well done crafting system gives the player a multitude of customization options, providing useful items and trinkets.+ Faction based bonus item system creates long-term motivation and additional customization possibilities.+ Broad spectrum of enemies with different strengths, weaknesses and unique abilities. + For the masochistic gamers among us, the legendary Hardcore mode is available.o The game follows the traditional concept of increased difficulty levels (normal, epic, ultimate), featuring tougher enemies and better loot.Characters & story:+ Interesting side characters provide the player with entertaining information about the current and past events of the game world.o Solid, slow-paced storytelling.o Limited identification of the player with the protagonist.Summary:Overall, Grim Dawn offers high-quality hack & slash gameplay with solid action rpg mechanics. It's a challange to reach the end and you can definitely end up putting a lot of hours into this. Addicitve and awesome all around.Amusing quotes:“I am fully confident that it will function as intended. Well, uh, there may be a slight chance that we will tear apart reality when the artifact is consumed by the conflagration… But chances of that are low. You’re safe. Really.”Trivia:In an earlier version of the game you were able to provoke the avatar of a god. In doing so, he would strike you with a lightning bolt, instantly killing your character in one attack with over 35.000 damage.Achievements:Estimated time for 100% completion: +300 hoursSingleplayer achievements: 80Multiplayer achievements: none			"

Early Access Review
								I actually had low-ish expectations going into Grim Dawn as I'm not the biggest fan of ARPG games, but I've really enjoyed playing this. This game has TONS of loot, many different class combos, exciting combat and a decent story to hold it all together. I picked this up when it was 50% off, but I would have still been happy having paid full price of $25 as there is a LOT of content here.This game is still in Early Access (full game due around Q1 '16) but you wouldn't know it while playing. The dev's have focused on releasing one act at a time, and releasing quality content instead of a full game of bugs and glitches. I've played now for about 40 hours and haven't encountered a single bug, which is quite impressive. The only negative I could think of is the frame rate gets a little choppy at times, but I'm guessing this is just an optimisation thing, which will no doubt happen before launch.In short: Great game and really good value considering the content within and the asking price. I totally recommend this to all ARPG fans or just RPG fans in general.			"

												It's like the creators went to the salvage yard, found the old and rusted remains of Diablo II, Titan Quest, and Fallout and thought ""Hey, I remember these. You know what, I bet we could make something out of them."" So they hauled them back to the work shed, where they were carefully looked over and disassembled, then they began to draft new designs and tinker with the parts. As time passed, what began as sort of a hobby turned into a real undertaking. And then a work of passion. Now, 6 years later, we are looking at the end result of that work, all new paint, polished up and ready to drive. So was the wait worth it? Hell yes it was. This game is a masterpiece. If you're a fan of ARPG's and don't have this yet. Buy it.Thank you Crate Entertainment. You have given us something truly special.			"

Grim DawnIm just having a blast with this game, I wish I had bought this game sooner none the less Its still worth every penny in my book. Seeing some friends playing it made me want to also delv in and enjoy the game, and that I most certainly am.The maps are huge, there are tons and tons of quests to aquire and complete as you play through, the lands are massive and beautifully detailed compared to what I have played in the past. There is stacks of items to pick up, crafting, and alsorts of stuff to do in this game, so much so Im so lost with it all. I mostly just equipt the best weapons and items  checking the stats then sell the rest, so I can stock up on health and energy vials. You can also store your items in storage places in the towns as wellYou get to make rifts (portals), but only 1 at a time, so I use this when out exploring hacking & slashing away while having fun, so if I die I can warp back to where I was or nearing a mission and OR a Boss fight. When you die you will loose your experiance points, so make sure you go back to your grave marked with a skull to reclaim them. At times I could not do this as I lost my place and or was a dare devil and ran through the green stuff, dont run through long paths of green stuff ok, try find a way round.  There are also pets you can earn to help you, I have 2 plus a pet that spawns on his own, dont ask me how I got them, I have no idea, but I have them now. Maybe thats why Im slower at leveling up in the game, because Im sharing my points I earn around to my pets, as they not strong yet. But they do help me out, I love my pets :)  Anyway there is just to much to explain with this game, and I cant possiblly explain it all, nor word it all appropriately. I just wanted to share that I am having a blast with this game, its addictive but only if its your kinda game. I will continue to play this game and hope I can finish it as well. Who needs more games ?, I now have Grim Dawn :)  Price wise to me its worth the full price, BUT if your patient wait for another sale, this game does not disapoint.;)  Just for the record, game plays great with the Xbox controller, but was a pain to work out how to get it all set up. I managed and I now play this with my Xbox controller :)  This is the set up guide for the Xbox controller, a friend was happy for me to share on my review for anyone looking for help in setting the Xbox controller up. Thank you @powbam for the guide and letting me share it as well http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?t=34072 "

Early Access Review
								Disclaimer, This is my first review.First and foremost, I was highly skeptical about this game before I bought it. I saw it and thought ""Re-skin of Titan Quest."" I am happy to see the spirit of TQ perserved while establishing itself as it's own Intellectual Property and its take on Action Role Playing Games. I was let down by the charactor creation (I spend a lot of time on charactor creation in games like Saints Row 3, 4 and Skyrim etc) and thusly wasn't able to creat a persona that felt like mine. However I've come to expect this from ARPGs so I wasn't to let down.  After playing Diablo 3 from launch and being terribly dissapointed by it's lacklustre story I was impressed by how fast I took to the setting and story being told here. In a nutshell you are a ""Taken"" and about to be hung. Once the game began I noticed zombies assaulting the town and was actually excited to get into the swing of things. 5 hours later, my wife is giving me the stare and the fog clears. This is the first ARPG to legit suck me into the zone. Story wise there are genuine choices to be had and content ""can be skipped"" (Zones have a minimum monster level however).Gameplay wise I've only played as a Demolistionist/Occultist but the skills are rewarding and the weapons have an oomph. One gripe i have is being unable to undo mastery points (Something I learned a little late) full on respecs should be a thing.Graphically the game looks well, the setting and the monsters fit in and match the games tone. I highly suggest this game to any ARPG lover.			"

												I love this game, its so addictive and I really enjoy farming there. But there is one issue and I'm stuck here.  I have a 85 lvl character and my attribute points were always oriented mostly on cunning. Now I realised that i need to change them on physique, but there is only one way to do it and it's that trainer program.  So please, add an option so players can reset attributes as well.			"

												I wanted to write my review when my Hardcore character dies, but he's still going strong and I'm about to reach the max level. Anyways, this game has all the best elements of an old-school aRPG game, with some new mechanics to keep it fresh. The environment is interesting, the classes are fairly archetypal but with a nice spin, and the hunt for loot keeps me excited. I liked the story, it kept me immersed and was my main incentive to finish the game. The graphics are very good - not amazing, but authentic for the type of game. Not cartoonish at all. The pace is great and there's enough play diversity to offer plenty of replayability. It's a great mix of challenge and depth - this game was obviously made with a lot of love!

								This is a damn fine ARPG that doesn't insult your intelligence. Every skill, class combination, and item has value. The Devs have so far avoided micromanaging the number of viable builds down to one per class like other ARPGS (looking at you D3). There's no always-online nonsense to deal with so you can actually play the single-player mode of the game you spent legal tender on without connecting to some corporations' server bank. There is no trade restrictions barring certain augments, which can be stripped beforehand to allow that item to be traded again.Combat isn't too flashy, which is good because the screen isn't filled with so much ♥♥♥♥ you can't see what the enemy is doing so you can avoid it. Skills can still be visually impressive but without the Michael Bay special effects barrage so common to latter-day ARPGs. It fits the artistic and narrative theme of the game while still letting your skills feel impactful but not so overwhelmingly powerful that you can't imagine why anyone would have died to the enemy in the first place. It just FEELS right.Furthermore, the story presented in Grim Dawn is actually quite compelling especially if you take the time to read through the dialogue and pick up all the scraps of paper left behind out in the world. There is genuine tension in the story as you piece together what happened to Cairn, and how you can help save it. Speaking of which, the world here feels connected and alive, without immersion-breaking nonsense like the copy/paste hero squads with yellow auras just in case you were too stupid to notice them or randomly-generated terrain that looks like someone emptied a jigsaw puzzle onto the table and scrambled the pieces up. There is even a legit lore reason why you are the only person who can control the teleporters too.All in all if you like ARPGs this game is worth every single cent of the asking price.			"

												TL;DR-  Grim Dawn is a fantastic game with an immense amount of depth that might intimidate casual players... if it weren't so Dag Nabbed fun and hooking right out of f***ing box when you fire it up.I've been playing since I believe March or May 2013ish... TBH, this game is the whole reason I initially downloaded Steam. For awhile, I wasn't a big fan of the whole Steam idea. Now it's a part of life. Strange how things work out. Anyway, deciding I should actually start supporting these talented small teams early instead of just crossing my fingers like I did with GGG, I backed Crate pretty heavily on Kickstarter (for me at least) and had to install Steam to test their Alpha releases. My opinion has, of course, wavered throughout the last few years. At the finish line, I can assure you that this is a top-notch aRPG that belongs in ANYONE's arsenal who claims to be a fan of the genre. My pet-peave at the moment is that with it's stellar reviews on big-name sites such as ign and such it is of course getting the indoctrinal ""which is better"" treatment.Grim Dawn is it's own beast. Path of Exile is my social aRPG. I play it for teamwork. I play it for that economical atmostphere. Sure, it still has a great single player feel. It's just a little more casual in that regard. And hey, if you're not a PoE fan, I can totally appreciate that. It's not for everyone. I just mention it here because the comparison between the two seems constant lately, and I happen to very much like the title and respect both GGG and Crate highly for their work ethic regardless(note to readers, I play PoE almost exclusively OFF steam, so my time logged is not correct, because I did not have steam yet when I started the game).Grim dawn is a more serious single player aRPG. I play it for those serious solo-theorycrafting craves I get sometimes. Sure, it has multiplayer, and it's great with friends. It's just more casual in that regard and wasn't really designed around it. It also will have amazing modding capabilities that PoE will never have (see below).Comparing the two games is really an easy thing to do since they're in the same genre, so I understand why all the youtubers do it, but it's actually unfair, get it? In reality, both games are not at odds for our attention at all, but actually are different enough to work in concert together. Basically what I'm saying is, I'm a fan of both. if you're a fan of one, it shouldn't mean you shouldn't be a fan of the other. Especially in what I'm convinced is the Golden Age of Action RPG's where a game like Grim DAwn can offer so much depth/complexity for half the price of what I paid for that disappointing night out with my GF to see Nolan's ""Interstellar.""***********************************************If you are wondering why I left out Diablo 3: Reaper of $ouls, it's because I'm only considering Professional Titles, not amateur ones.***********************************************-WHY 50% OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT ""HACKING PROBLEMS"" ARE WRITTEN BY IDIOTS-It's important to understand that there is no  Online Warden in this game like in Diablo 3 or Path of Exile and that seems to be upsetting a lot of people. It is the reason for 50% of the ""Negative Reviews"" you see above. Those people are ignorant, and let me explain why:Crate never wanted the game to be server-side. See, when they made TQ clientside last decade, they discovered something HUGE... that we as a community... are fricking amazing at supporting games we love. We took TQ and we 1. Patched it2. Fixed it even more3. Improved it4. Added voice overs5. Translated it into foreign languages like... I dunno Samarian & Klingon probably [chk source]6. New Mechanics7. More DLCs8. Even more DLCs9. User Tools for more fun10. ENTIRELY NEW SEQUELS11. ""HOLY F***, GUYS, SOMEONE JUST RECREATED DIABLO 2: LOD ON OUR GAME ENGINE!!! WE ARE NEVER EVER EVER MAKING A GAME SERVER-SIDE AGAIN. IN FACT, THAT GAME WE'RE WORKING ON NOW? GRIM DAWN IS IT? LET'S JUST RELEASE THE GAME WITH ALL THE TOOLS WE USED TO CREATE THE DARN THING TOO TO THEM. OUR FANS ARE AWESOME!!!""--This is the reason for 50% of the negative reviews. Because Clientside unfortunately means that, if you WANT TO, it's also really easy to cheat and have any item. Other great aRPGs use clientside too. Torchlight 2 does as well. The point is, who cares? Don't not buy an amazing aRPG in the Golden Era of Action RPGs simply because your friend MIGHT not have actually found his ""Sword of a Thousand Truths."" Get a new friend, I dunno.  You're getting an amazing game for $25. And if history with TQ taught us anything. In the next couple years. Us fans are gonna give you a few more amazing games for free with this engine too. FREE... provided you have purchased the GD engine, of course ;-)Lostman-			"

								I have one rule when it comes to games:  for every dollar I spend, there had better be at least one hour of enjoyment.  I can't tell you how many games I own that can't even live up to that very simple rule, and some of the worst offenders come from this current plague of ""Early Access"" games.This is the exception.  I've only put 8 hours into Grim Dawn thusfar, but I can already tell that I have many more ahead.  This is exactly what Early Access should be - an incomplete game that benefits greatly from the community involvement.  Grim Dawn isn't some barely stable trash that some useless studio decided to throw on Steam, it is a solid title with all of the meat and seasoning ready to go and all the developer needs now is, ""how would you like it cooked?""Get this game.  If you like anything about Diablo-esque games, you owe it to yourself and the gaming community to support the development of this title.			"

								Design.  That I feel is the key with Grim Dawn.  I wont go over the mechanics and options as they're fairly well covered here already, but I will discuss why I hope Grim Dawn is a big success.In something that seems increasingly rare these days, Crate have focused on making a quality product with solid design and a clear target audience, at the expense of 'mass market appeal.'A game not rushed, not relying on cheap tricks or addictive gimmicks, DRM free, moddable, with great communication from the dev team and attention to detail and feedback.Their approach should be rewarded, their integrity and honesty applauded.  This may all seem a bit 'fan-boyish' but the example they set here should be supported and encouraged.Will it be perfect at release?  No, I'm sure there will be balance issues as the wider customer base test out the limits of builds, but that's of secondary concern in a game where the focus is on playing through the content, not pushing leaderboards.  The end-game is limited, but you're missing the point a little if you're rushing to get there ;)			"

								Grim Dawn is what ""ARPGs"" are supposed to be. It's difficult - nee impossible - to write a review of Grim Dawn without comparing it to other, existing ARPGs. So rather than dance around it, I'll just do it: Grim Dawn is better than most. I'll compare it to games you might have already played. * It's harder than Diablo III, and has more punishing monster abilities that require more attention. * It's less punishing tha Path of Exile, with more focus on attack skills that make the game fun (rather than defensive skills that make you run around). * Similar to Titan Quest, you pick two paths and combine them into a unique gameplay style. And, similar to Titan Quest, you can seriously gimp yourself by picking two fundamentally incompatible paths.* The world is static, with loads of side quests if you want to do them, like Sacred 2. Unlike Sacred 2, the world remains interesting and isn't as generically massive. Fewer enemies have cheap tricks to one-shot you.I don't have much to say that hasn't already been said... this is an excellent game. I've tried many different characters and only found a few completely gimped builds (summoning is, as always, not balanced yet). I can't believe this is still in Early Access and it's already so good.			"

												Grim Dawn is the spiritual successor to Titan Quest, an ARPG set in Greek Mythology, only this time it is an original setting with an original story.  The game begins as you awaken from a hanging.  Your crime: being corrupted by Aetherial energy.  Coming under the influence of this energy gives the gift of superhuman abilities (aka the skill tree), but can also turn you into a shambling undead.  You are sent to investigate this Aetherial energy in a nearby cave to win the influence of the town that tried to hang you, and the story carries on from there.  There are 6 different classes in the game: Soldier, focusing on physical, bleed, and internal trauma damages with a focus on defensive shield-use; Shaman, a two-handed weapon focused character that deals a combination of lightning, bleed, and retaliation damage with defensive life leech and regeneration abilities, and can also summon a briarthorn beast; Nightblade, a very offensively minded melee dual wield character with a cold, pierce, and poison/acid damage focus, and can also benefit from guns or crossbows; Arcanist, the spell-caster with a bevy of elemental skills but is very strong with fire and aether damage, and uses damage reflection and damage mitigation sphere skills for defense; Occultist, a summoner focused caster strong with chaos, vitality, fire and poison/acid damage that uses a combination of acid retaliation and life leech for defense; and finally Demolitionist, a bomb tossing, trap throwing gun toting pyromaniac using mostly fire and lightning damage and uses a variety of stuns, blinds and fumbling attacks for defense.You pick your first class on your first level up, with the ability to pick a second class at level 10. It is highly recommended to do so as each class has multiple synergies with another and leveling up two skill trees instead of one provides you with more character stats: PHYSIQUE, CUNNING, and SPIRIT. Physique regulates your hit points and ability to wear heavy armor. Cunning regulates your pierce and bleed damage as well as chance to hit and critical chance. Spirit regulates your mana pool, and elemental damage.Another important part of your character is the Devotion map.  Throughout the game there are shrines that require certain craftable materials in order to restore them. Restoring a shrine gives you a devotion point.  On the devotion screen are many constellations, each a cluster of connected devotion points that provide themed skills and abilities.  Some of the skills gained from the completion of a constellation can be attached to a skill on your skill tree, making it more powerful.  It adds another satisfying layer of complexity to your character, and is absolutely necessary to master in order to tackle the harder difficulties.Crafting is very deep and involved.  At around character level 15 you recieve a quest to recruit a blacksmith. There are two different blacksmiths to pick from, one is stronger for magic based characters, the other for physical damage characters.  This blacksmith can make either a random magic weapon armor for you or you can find rare and unique recipes dropped by monsters.  The ingredients for these recipies are also dropped by monsters. The ingredients can also be infused into weapons to give them different stats and abilities.There is also a faction system.  Defeating certain types of enemies raises your influence with the 5 or 6 different factions in the game. Different levels of influence allow you to buy different tiers of equipment from faction vendors. It should also be noted that defeating enemies also lowers their standing with you, and you can even become so hated that special super unique enemies can spawn from that group of enemies, and hunt you down.Combat is very visceral and satisfying.  Critical attacks shake the screen and send send your enemies flying.  All skills have a unique animation and are very fun to use.  There are 4 Acts and 3 difficulties.  The max character level is 85.  I've been playing the game since build 15 and every build since then to the release and beyond has drastically improved the game.  I highly recommend this awesome ARPG. Editing for the badgerino.			"

												This might be the best value for any game I've ever purchased. I got it on sale for 15$, but after putting 200+ hours into it, I can say it is easily worth double or triple that. The only ARPG's I've played that can compare to Grim Dawn are D2, D3 and PoE. I'm not trying to debate which is better, but those 3 are universally recognized as 3 of the top ARPG's in the last 10 years. The only knock against grim dawn is that the multiplayer is a bit weak. This is a game meant to be played in single player, but has some multiplayer capabilities. It's not horrible multiplayer, but I wouldn't describe it as a MP game.There is what they call a dual class system. You have a skill tree for your main class and then at level 10 you can invest into a second class or put everything into 1 tree, whichever you prefer. There are multiple viable builds and tons of loot. Another negative could be that there is too much garbage loot, but still this is knit picking. For those ARPG veterans the game can feel easy until you have beat it once at which point it gets a bit harder. The objective is to beat it 3 times all the way thru, the 3rd time is pretty damn tough. It doesn't feel boring going thru it 3 times because various things carry over each time, you will also spot new areas you missed or couldn't unlock the first time thru. The DLC out is also really fun. It's basically a never ending mode of constant waves. Every 10 waves you can either leave and take your reward or keep going and risk it for a higher reward. If you even remotely like Action-RPGs then this is a must have title. If this game came from a well known company it would easily be selling for 2-3 times more. I know it might not look that great in the photos and all. That's what held me back for a while, but this is definitely one of the better games I've ever played.			"

												Grim Dawn is one of the best ARPG. You can make a variety of builds like pet army, magic caster, dual blade/gunslinger, or even a tanky afk build. 15 class combinations from 6 bases with over 25 skills per class, excluding lots of skills from devotion system and items.If you had difficulties with the game early on, there's a ton of guides or shared characters for testing purpose from Grim Dawn forums[grimdawn.com] (always backup your save files first). Sometimes you'll find a fun build that's yet to discover.If you like Diablo, Path of Exile, Torchlight, or Titan Quest, this game will suits you.			"

Early Access Review
								A wonderfully crafted Action RPG, by the makers of Titans Quest. The game has a very nice look to it and the gameplay is just a blast, tons to do and it feels like a dark fantasy version of Titans Quest, made with love and devotion. If you are looking for a arpg to play by yourself or with a friend, pick this up asap. It just got to 100% CONTENT COMPLETE today, so now is a perfect time to hop in and enjoy some Grim Dawn!These devs love the games they make, you can see that right away by playing Titan Quest or Grim Dawn, so much effort and love has gone into these games. There is a ton of content and it was really cool seeing this game get made along the way. Grim Dawn now joins Pillars of Eternity, Divinity Original Sin, Shadowrun Hong Kong and Wasteland 2 in the old school rpg resurgence we have had over the past few years.If you want an action rpg that has the atmosphere of say Diablo 2 but the gameplay and unique feel of Titans Quest, this game is for you! Tons of cool items to loot, a bunch of awesome characters to pick from and music that hits the soul.Now go get a friend and get ready to slaughter some baddies, explore a gorgeous and messed up game world! Grim Dawn is waiting for you and what awaits is a ton of fun! If I had 3 thumbs up I would give this 3 thumbs :)Having played about 20 hours of the full content version now, I must say thing game is even better. The huge variety of enemies and landscapes is unmatched in action rpg's, so much variety with everything!  The look and feel of every new area and all the new monsters/items is unreal. Grab a friend a get ready to party! I have been pretty worn out on action rpgs lately but I am loving this!			"

												That was a great game. Arguably one of the greatest ARPG's ever. The graphics were super cool, the story was interesting and at times intense, the action itself was seamless, the upgrade system was super deep and yet accessible. You could play this game countless different ways and have a great time. I put right around 40 hours into the campaign playing solo before finishing it, and after I was done, there was still another area at the top of the map to unlock, and probably 3 or 4 that I missed besides that. There is also an area called The steps of Torment which will challenge any hardened players, and that area features roguelike qualities. This game carries a lot of obvious influences as well, from Diablo 2 to Torchlight to even Dark Souls, and wears them well, while still managing to create it's own distinct personality.I'm thinking that I can still easily put in another 15 or so hours solo before I'm just grinding loot or decide to change difficulties. The game also leaves definite room for a sequel and/or expansion, and really, this is a game world that could persist for a long time. There were things said via notes in the game that absolutely open up other potential story arcs. The Aetherial Betrayer, Ulgrim, and quite a few others.So, some cool features of the game: you can dual class, and it changes your actual class if you do so. For example, I played an Occultist/Arcanist, which made me a Warlock. The upgrade system for the actual classes is broad enough to give you a lot of variety, but condensed enough that you wont feel overwhelmed. However, there is a second upgrade system that you get points for simply by cleansing shrines, and that my friends is as expansive an upgrade system as I have seen in a game. You could spend a while reading through all of them, and then you still have to decide what will best suit your play style. They are set up as constellations, and there are a lot of them! It can seem daunting, but actually, I dont think there are really any wrong choices, although some will obviously suit your preferred playstyle better than others, and a lot of them only unlock after unlocking constellations closer to the center, where you basically choose your upgrade arc. That was quite impressive and again, lends itself to a lot of experimentation. There is a respec NPC in the game, but I never actually made use of it, so I cant say how that works.Also, some merchants will only sell you stuff after you have gotten your town or faction disposition maxed out, and they of course have the best items, lol. You can sell to them, but I personally didnt max out any factions yet, so I havent been able to purchase those super cool items. You can also craft items via another type of NPC, and that system is also pretty deep. You can craft all the basic stuff, but you have to find blueprints to craft anything truly spectacular. Items also have one slot for gem/material upgrades, and the gems/materials can be made stronger by fusing as many as 4 of the same type together. This will often unlock a special ability like casting fireballs or gaining Aetherial defense, slams, and so on.There is actually a ton more to this game, but I think I will leave off for now and maybe revise this once I finish the map, play through higher difficulties, and/or play through this in co-op mode.I cant really find much in the way of flaws in this game, so I'm maxing out this skill tree with a 10 out of 10.

								Honestly? This is what Diablo 3 should have been. Crate Entertainment delivers a spirital successor to the magnificent legacy of Diablo 2 - with a blend-in of popular features from Titan Quest (they even had a designer from the former Diablo 2 team join them recently & Crate themselves consist of many of the old devs behind Titan Quest).Even the game being in early access (as of when this review was written) it already has kept me occupied for around 100 hours and there's still so much to do.Pros+ Rich storyline.+ Beautifully crafted environments!+ Choices matter - for example killing or saving a person will have different consequences, adding to replayability.+ Six classes to chose from & being able to combine two classes if you wish, broadening your versatility.+ Easy to respecc skills, allowing lots of experimentation.+ Addicting reputation-system (similar to WoW). Also enemy factions will spawn more bosses/heroes to fight you the more they hate you - while friendly factions unlock rewards, additional quests & even dungeons!+ Nemesis bosses! Once you've maxed negative reputation with an enemy faction, legendary bosses/heroes will hunt you out in the wild! Some of the strongest in-game! Run!+ Modding-friendly! Toolset to be released after the game is finished.+ Expansions/dlc planned! Bring on more content! My money awaits!+ Multiplayer/Coop-friendly (unless you play with awful connections, then you might experience desyncs/lagspikes).Cons- No character customization.- No hide helmet toggle (for the occasional ugly helmet).- Soundtrack does not seem complete (hopefully more songs are planned), too few tracks replaying over and over again.- More epic item variety would be nice, but I assume this will be added before the final release. Gief more content!! Now!Summary: If you loved Diablo 2 or Titan Quest, getting Grim Dawn is a no-brainer. Expect hundreds of hours of gameplay!Game is planned to be released at the end of 2015.			"

												Great game, encourages restarting and trying new builds, hearkens back to the old d1/d2 days.Pros:-Many varied build opportunities and it is fun to try things out-Fairly long level curve, love the journey not the destination-Great atmosphere-Lots of different modifiers on itemsCons:-Story ends a bit abruptly-End game has minimal randomization-A lot of the game will be played with 1-2 skills until you get to a higher level (for passive type builds)-You don't often seem to pass the power curve, that is, you never seem to completely destroy level relative enemies-Hard to determine what builds will work out due to huge number of modifiers and engame equipment (but not necessarily a con specifically to this game)I detailed the cons a bit more because these are really the only things I can pick out that become more glaring after spending some time with the game.

Early Access Review
								In the summer of 2000, a new era in video gaming dawned.Diablo 2 was launched. Blizzard was in their prime.The game was excellent and a year later they improved on an already polished product with the release of Lord of Destruction.Video gaming was never the same.Since then we have had many attempts on carrying the flame of D2:LoD.Torchlight honorably carried on the genre the best it could.And when D3 was announced, I got aboard the hype train and rode it to it's fiery crash.It wasn't D2:LoD. It didn't feel like a successor.Disappointment was rife. Later that same year, Torchlight 2 released.The balance in the genre was secured. The gameplay was solid, if not a tad too fast-paced.But with the disappointment that was D3, I greedily ate up all it had to offer.And now, we are here.There's a new dawn in this genre.It is a Grim Dawn.And grim has never been so good before.I do not want to give the impression that this game merely plays off the nostalgia from franchises before.Those at Crate Entertainment picked up the baton from other games and ran off in their own direction.The influence is clearly there and is masterfully done. But, being an early access game, they could take feedback from the community of players, and mold it into something we've always wanted.Another game to take the mantle of D2:LoD, and raise it to new heights.Cheers, Crate Entertainment and all of your employees.You have done something great here, and I thank you.

												My first review ever and English is not my native language so please bear with me.Grim Dawn is an awesome arpg that takes place in a fictional world. The game provides fast and smooth gameplay with intriguing lore to uncover. The game looks dark and grim which I found very appealing compared to the cartoony look other games may have. There’s enough diversity in the different area’s to explore. Some areas are looking absolutely gorgeous. Most of the game is hand-crafted  with some randomization. There a plenty of different enemies to fight against providing enough verity and challenge. Sometimes you have to prioritize to kill a certain enemy otherwise things may get really tough. What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG), which means that an enemy could have an epic weapon or armor equipped that you can see him wearing. So kill him and he will drop that item, however if he might be tougher to fight against as the item can grant them more power than usual.You can play this game single-player or multi-player with a party up to a max of 4 people. There are currently 6 classes which are called masteries in the game. They each have their own unique skills. When you reach level 2 you can choose a mastery to start with and at level 10 you can choose a 2nd mastery if you want. This way it provides enough build diversity for your taste. Melee or ranged and a mix of both it’s all up to you to choose. You can use 1 handed weapons and shields, 2 handed weapons, dual wield, pistols, scepters, focus and pets (summons). So you are not bound to a few skills you can choose from. Items like armor, components , relics, etcetera could also grant extra skills to use. And let’s not forget about Devotion, thought out the game you can find Devotion Shrines to restore, which grants you loot and a Devotion point on which you can invest in the Devotion Window providing more stats and skills to customize your build. You can use any item you want just as long as you meet the required stats for it. You can reassign skill- and devotion points but not mastery- and attribute points.There’s plenty of loot in this game which can be obtained from enemies, chest, bought at a vendor or you can craft items. Blueprints can be found to craft different items at the blacksmith.I like the faction system on where you have hostile factions with increased negative reputation against them, brings increased enemy spawn additional monster spawns, increased Hero spawns and, upon reaching Nemesis status, Nemesis spawns. With friendly factions, increased reputation unlocks access to the bounty table. There you can do small quest for a gaining faster reputation with that faction and that unlocks more items at the faction vendor.I love it  that certain quest can change the appearance a little bit of a refugee area. Bringing more survivors there and a cosmetic change. There are also quests that brings choice and consequence to your decisions. So the outcome for that quest could influence a small area.The lore is great for those who are interested in that like me. You can find notes in the game that provide more information about certain events. But also by talking to npc’s and reading the description in the devotion windows. There’s no magic arrow that points you into the right direction for a quest, only when your nearby you will see a star on the mini map that your close. Personally i think this is a big plus, i love to explore and find the area myself it’s way more immersive.There are enough options in the game to change the camera angle zoom in and out. You can set the loot filter to only show magic items, so that your screen isn’t cluttered with loot.Secret areas who doesn’t like them, i always have the urge to explore everything. Some secret areas are small others are larger. You can find them by breaking a wall or perhaps a hidden path to reach it. Explore and you shall be rewarded because there are plenty of secret areas to uncover.Small things that matter like kicking in doors or at barrels, destructible objects like furniture walls that collapse. Weather changing effect that make the area darker with a bit or rain or just a sunny day. Enemies of different factions fighting each other.Challenge dungeons  that provide a real challenge, where if you die you have to restart the game to start a new session. That means you have to redo the dungeon to get to the end. I play softcore so i won’t lose my character but still have the excitement of trying to survive and not to get killed.Modding tools are released, so expect the community to create their own content, items, classes and even entire worlds.The developers are very passionate about the making the game, since the Kickstarter the game has grown bigger and better with more features than they originally planned. There is even a free content update coming out soon!Some very useful links besides YouTube and Twitch:To find out more about the game i highly suggest to the a look at the official game guide at: http://www.grimdawn.com/game.phpWant to take a look at the masteries and the skills and plan your build than take a look here: http://grimcalc.com/.Want to know more about the items than you certainly want to take a look here: http://gracefuldusk.appspot.com/ "

Early Access Review
								An early access review for an early access game. This review is based on a playthrough of one character to level 25ish, partly played alone and partly played with a friend.Things to Expect: Action Role-Playing Games tend to lack role-play options that actually relate to game-play. Such situations do occur in this game, and can decidedly change your experience or even what equipment you can gain. Progression trees that do not exactly guide you in their use, but most of the level up choices you make can be undone to repair mistakes or to optimize. Crafters are decidedly useful, as they will always create at-level gear you can use for the same amount of materials (so far.) Gritty world, gritty characters, and a dark atmosphere. It is not exactly bland, but it's not exactly pretty. You can only duel-wield pistols if equipped with a specifc item. Damage can be sudden and it is hard to determine where it comes from or what causes it due to all the graphics and effects.Opinions:Kill, loot, rinse, repeat. You're a dude or lady that was nearly hung for being possessed, but was spared because of context. And now a gathering of NPCs look at you with hope/despair in wondering if you can save them from the end of the world. Which already happened, but they hope you won't make it worse. Given I've not personally completed the story, I cannot give a nay or yay regarding it.I can state that it does set the post-apocolypse in semi-fantasy land well. Everyone looks unclean and filthy, and your equipment is no exception. None of your equipment shines or glows, or looks elegant. It is rough or practical looking, and portays the scavenger look as you are picking up fantasy pieces in fantasy land. Most of the land is in ruins, garbage strewn about is a constant land image.The music is there, and serves its purpose but is lost under combat noise. I've not heard a track I would listen to outside of the game, but I've not had a reason to turn the music off.Playing as the Soldier class, 1 of 5 classes available currently (six planned), I have not felt the need to dual class. Though I played on Veteran difficulty, and was underleveled for the first boss, I managed to defeat them by myself with the skills I invested in and resources I earned/purchased. Healing potions did not ensure my victory, and I definately needed them. From my perspective, devoting time to gaining levels to match the boss or finding more appropriate equipment to defend myself would have made the battle easier. But ultimately, like all ARPGs of this sort, it comes down to loot/equipment.Loot in the game is not generous, but it is not lack luster. While my luck may just be poor, and I keep finding high qualities items that would better suit other classes, the pieces that I do find I have yet to replace. Add onto the componant items that can be collected and combined to impart even greater bonuses, which can be placed onto equipment to ensure their longevity, means there are always options to improve gear.In multiplayer, loot can be set to personal or shared. With personal loot, all loot seen by you is yours.There are tools within the game to help you determine what gear you need, though I personally find it hard to track incoming damage. It is hard to determine what enemies will attack what sort of defence immediately, and for me it was always trial by fire. And gear is not immediately available to immediately counter enemy attacks, it all has to be earned with time.But that's the point of these kinds of games: repeatedly charge into dungeons to find better and better gear, for multiple situtaions. And, to the games great credit, their NPC crafters are not simple gamble-based machines. Despite the random statisics on the items, they will always make gear that is at least at your character's level.One major complaint I have to make is the text box for NPC interaction is small, and that makes reading hard to do.Conclusion:I have not seen all of the game yet, but what I've played I have enjoyed. It is a game that asks the player to micromanage their gear to fit their needs, but allows them headstrong acts of determination to push through challenges at the cost of resources. Character customization benefits from augment gear, to dual classing for combining skill sets, to a mostly passive bonus system gained from exploring and slaying monsters.The game's look works. It does not strain the eyes, and sets the mood it intended to set. While more color would be appreciated, what I have seen I've not been distracted (beyond all the literal garbage. Loads of trash in places! Fantasy kingdom lacks littering laws.)The story is there, and while not bad it can be overlooked. This may be a dangerous thing, however, as a choice made in the first portion of the game drastically changes the loot available to you. And the game does not give you the luxury of making that choice's importance to you apparant. Squint your eyes to read that text, because it may make your adventure all the easier.This is a solid enty into the ARPG library. Not too easy, not unforgiving, but demands you pay attention.			"

Early Access Review
								Five hours into Grim Dawn and my Witchblade is happily swinging around a pipe with gears attached to the end of it with both hands after applying some parts that make it do poison damage. With his little buddy Raven flying behind him, shooting electricity out of his eye balls, my Wicthblade is demolishing every foe he encounters, waves at a time. And just when I think this may be too easy, I hit a boss level monster that makes me start quaffing the few potions I have. I finally crush the boss monster's head like a grape with my two-handed ""mace"" and get the loot. All is right with the world.I have a few Early Access titles in my game list, but Grim Dawn is by far the most polished one I have played. Heck, I've played big production titles that don't work this well (I'm looking at you, ""Rise of the Argonauts"").Add this to the fact that I played Diablo and liked it. Played D2 and liked it. Played Titan Quest and loved it, and add that I tend to enjoy apocalyptic game settings and that makes Grim Dawn something that will not be uninstalled for a very long time.For an ARPG, the writting is superb. The letters and dialoge are on par with what you would expect from a classic western RPG.I cannot reccomend this title enough, and although I am nowhere near being done playing this game I have to wonder with a benchmark being set this high: what will Crate do next?I am excited for the future.

Early Access Review
								I love H&S games. I played it only about 40 hours in EA because I don´t wanted to spoiler myself.After release I will change my home to a vault with plenty food and I will play this game til the Dawn of the Apes.Short: Best H&S gameProsHuge world to exploreGreat SoundtrackDual Class SystemItemizationQuests with choices and little consequenes like Dragon AgeNice challenges like roquelike dungeonConsMultiplayer still needs some polish.I am a guy who loves hack&slay games. I played nearly every H&S Game the last decade and my biggest disappointment was Diablo 3. It is not a bad game but it was not the sequel I was hopping for. The biggest issue D3 has is its degree of difficulty. D3 is less about skills. It´s about the equipment you carry. Then there is the repetition of all the dialoges in the game which makes me feel like I am in a limbo. Last but not least: D3 is not very complex. You walk a straight path-there is nothing to explore, you have some skills you are using depending on your equipment and thats it!Yes I know. Many H&S games are like that but I wanted more. Lets talk about Grim Dawn. It´s somekind of a sequel of Titan Quest (TQ). Back in the days TQ was having the best combat feeling beside Diablo 2. You were able to play a multiclass character which made the game very interesting for people who loves customization.Grim Dawn took all the good stuff from Titan Quest and enhanced it to a new level.GD is one of the few gems who deserve the titel ARPG.You have a huge world to explore. There are secret passages, hidden chests with epic items, pathes you have to unlock, breakable walls, shrines which gives you permanent buffs..There are quests where you have to take a choice. Later in the game you will see the consequences of your choice. There are many factions you can join. Its like in World of Warcraft. Each faction give you different benefits and quests.The combat is really awesome. It´s not as fast like Torchlight 2 but at least its nearly as good as Diablo 3.There are some interesting skills for multiplayer and because of the multiclass system there are a lot of skillsets you can try out. In one point GD surpasses the other games: You really have to use the environment to survive. You can take cover behind walls against enemy archers or you can use narrow ways to avoid to get flanked or surrounded by enemies. Some enemies are shooting in an arc or from the sky so you should take cover under a fabric.Lets talk about the music. It is one of the best fantasy soundtracks I have ever listened beside Age of Conan.It fits perfect to the game world, never gets disturbing and feels really unique.I would buy the soundtrack.Please guys, buy this game if you love hack&slay. I followed this game since it was announced. The Devs are really great guys. They are really active in the forums and they put so much content in this game. I can´t believe that a small dev team could create such a good game. They didn´t have a million budget like blizzard but they delivered something awesome.This game is like Diablo 3 should have been. It´s like Dave vs Goliath. BUY THIS GAME AND SUPPORT IT!			"

Early Access Review
								Grim Dawn is Incredibly well done. With an old school Diablo like feel but with a more modern asthetic. Personally I'm not a big fan of Steam Punk in most games. Grim Dawn however does a great job making it feel like a part of the world and not just ham fisted fan service. There is a great grit to the world that helps make it feel all the more real and in depth. Grim Dawn is yet another in the recently flooded ARPG Market but it sets itself apart with it's beautiful visual style and incredibly immersive world.    If you're looking for something to fill the void left in your heart by the ARPG classics of your youth, this is it. Enjoy.			"

												After 9 hours of this game I am very VERY impressed. The game feels like Diablo 2 steampunk version. I could say many things are made perfectly for my taste atleast.+Skill tree. You can combine two skill trees from 2 classes which is new for me atleast and you actually need to know where to put your points.+soundtrack. The music and ambient sounds are very good in the game.+So far the areas seem very nicely made. Act 1 was made dark and scary and full of scary monsters and enemies.+I like that the game has different difficulty levels. I am playing veteran and it really feels like veteran difficulty.+loot system is what it is supposed to be.The harder the difficulty the more loot, simple. So far I've been getting very good items which help me against harder enemies.+voice actors. I think this is personal taste, but in my opinion the voices fit for the NPCs.+crafting system. So far I've haven't tried it that much, but in higher levels my guess you will need it more.+You can remove one point from skill tree for a price which is good. You can try out other builds without starting new character.So far no cons come in my mind, but I am going to definitely recommend this game for all ARPG lovers. I bet if the game becomes more popular we might see a expansion for the game and the developers will keep patching the game to keep the game popular.			"

												If you like ARPGs definitely get this one. Also be sure to complete it on Veteran at least once, drops are much better in it. That being said, do try Normal when you want to test out a character build because once you chose your classes for a character they can't be changed. (You can still change how you allocate skill points in those classes though, but not mastery points those are fixed as well)Pros Dual class system makes each character play differently. A big world to explore and secrets to find Different factions, whose quests unlock as you increase your reputation with them. Good crafting system, and some nice abilities and passive bonuses can be imparted to your gear from components you find. Notes scattered around the world are well written.Cons No option to hide quest from being displayed at all times. (There's a toggle to hide the entire panel but no option to hide individual ones) Also quests once taken can't be abandoned. "

Early Access Review
								So, here I am, 400+ hours into the game, without a single forum post or a review. I feel like I own it to Crate to write one, so here it goes. I'll cover 5 topics: World, Story, Gameplay, Graphics and Sound.World: I thank Crate for not making world randomized. The map is hand drawn, same every time, but the boulders and obstacles block certain paths, so you'll never go the same way twice. The pros of that approach tie with the story.Story: The story itself is okay, much better than other ARPGs though (looking at you, Torchlight 2 :D). The best part about it is the lore behind the world. Random notes make world alive and some of it are really beautifly written, like mini novels all around you. Gameplay: The skills feel responsive and overall, combat is very satisfying. The punches are hard and spell effects make combat seem very fast paced. There are occasional glitches and fps drops, but this is an indie studio and an early access game, so I believe it will be resolved (I'm playing on a 8 year old toaster by the way, and i get 25+ on low/med settings, which is awesome). Skilltrees and devotion system make each individual character different. Components and relics are an awesome way for customizing your character further.Graphics: Crate didn't go for beautiful graphics and eye candy. Instead, what you get, is dark and grim world. The look of the game is awesome, Areas are distinct and every single one feels like it's the part of the world, not some random desert here and lush green woods 10 minutes further. Graphics are here for the atmosphere, not the beauty.Sound: Abilities sound great, even though the autoattacks could use some love. The soundtrack is awesome though, resembeling the Diablo one (overly reverbed instruments).Overall: This game is awesome. Buy it now. Support the developers and the game, you won't regret it. This is by far the best ARPG I've ever played. "

												I hesitate to make quite so blanket a statement as “this is the Diablo III that many Diablo II fans wanted”, both because there are key ways in which it’s not and because I can’t speak for people who’ve spent years memorising loot tables and now expect very specific things. However…Grim Dawn is a huge and slick affair which clings tight to a doomy tone, eschews online funny business and is careful to keep lore overload at arm’s length. A lack of overblown cutscenes aside, you’d never guess that it was made comparatively under the radar and on surely a fraction of Diablo III’s budget. The Titan Quest (with which it shares several developers) influence is as strong as that of Diablo, though sadly the Harryhausen monster aesthetic wasn’t retained. We don’t get many tottering skeletons or screeching harpies, but both loot and powers ramp up dramatically quickly. It’s rarely a question of if a murdered monster will drop anything, and more how the hell you’re going to fit it all in your bags. The same excess extends to the many and often wildly over the top powers. Grim Dawn, despite the downbeat title, is determined to make you feel good. It’ll keep you busy for a long damn time too, even if you only play it once – though, of course, for many there’ll be later playthroughs in co-op or at unlockable higher difficulties. I think it’s the desire to be the spiritual sequel to Diablo II which holds me back from heaping breathless praise on Grim Dawn, though. The need to be grim first and foremost forbids a clear personality from shining through, and the result is that I’m not sure how to finish a sentence which begins “Grim Dawn is that game where…”Well, other than “…I'm having a better time than I did in Diablo III”, anyway.

Early Access Review
								With the double-edged sword that is Early Access, it is great seeing that it does work when used right.It took me about 14-15 months to pull the trigger on grabbing this game, as I was not sure which end of the spectrum Grim Dawn would fall on. I am happy to say that - after being patient - this game is to me everything Early Access was called into life for.If you are an avid ARPG fan like myself, I find it hard to make a case against buying Grim Dawn, even though it is technically unfinished. The content available presently is quite fleshed out, considering how much more there is to come. I find myself collecting an insurmountable amount of items, just so I can prepare for the next character build I have in mind.  That is not to say the game makes you play alts in order to get the most out of it, rather it is a testament to how the build diversity makes you want to experiment and gets you excited to try other things. You are free to make a 'pure' build, using ony one class, or supplement it with one or more skills/passives of another class. Alter your skills' damage type to make it mesh better with your ideal build, or change the way it works entirely, making your big AoE skill a continuous basic attack. The Grim Dawn world is your oyster.While Grim Dawn has its flaws, like any other ARPG, it absolutely nails that which it strives to be. It's grim, very much so. Many of the choices you get to make during quests have a sense of moral ambiguity. Some more or less than others, but a refreshing breeze in the genre, which often relies on simple ""Kill X mob or boss"" quests as you trot down the storyline. Not in Grim Dawn. Well, at least not in its entirety. Many of these quests certainy fall into the well-known standard we all experienced. Others have you decide on lives and allow you to shape the game to an extent. You can end up with more or less people in the game as you decide on whether or not to save them. You may or may not get access to a certain item if you decide to choose a particular path. It certainly allows for you to experience a slightly altered world next time around, adding to the replayability. But what does all of this mean in the larger scope? We all look towards ARPG's for the same thing, I would think. Killing stuff, lots of it, in order to get stuff to kill more stuff faster and/or more efficiently. Grim Dawn certainly provides plenty of both. There are lots of armor sets to collect, some of which allow you to completely change your playstyle, sometimes in a way that seems counter-intuitive at first. It's in these details that the game shows its true self. The small mechanics that could change the way you think about some of the skills in the game, which you will likely only discover a good while into the game. Are you not concerned with these mechanics? That's ok, the game lends itself perfectly to those who simply want to barge through the game wreaking havoc. It's all up to you.For those of you who are on the fence about the game, in regards to its similarities with Titan Quest, I can only say this: Grim Dawn is no less than a worthy spiritual successor to Titan Quest. It adds plenty, from a new narrative, new classes and areas, to new mechanics and playstyles. All in keeping with its roots, and building on that solid foundation that many of us look back on so fondly. This is not the same game, but it 'was' built with the same eye for detail and the same type of devotion to the genre we know from Titan Quest. It was made by people who love the game, for people who love the game. If you ask me, that's how you get a good game. Which leads to my verdict as the game stands at the time of writing this review:A solid 8.5/10 Highly recommended for fans, certainly worthwhile still for those with a passing interest.If they keep up the hard work, and after implementing the announced features and planned content, I might bump it up to a solid 9/10.BUILD 28 UPDATEWe are now a good chunk further in development since my initial review. I let the game 'ripen' a bit and have not played much since build 24, giving me a wealth of new content to play around with.I have to say, I was not prepared for what I'd find. Including the Factions (with the Bounty and Nemesis systems), Devotion System and new class on top of the remainder of Act 3 and first part of Act 4 and the additional 20 levels there is so much to do. The ability to diversify to this extent will make this game last as long as you want it to.The prospect of almost unlimited replayability is exactly what I had hoped when I put down my money for an Early Access game.With Build 28 also came a much needed boost in performance, and some polish in the graphics department, giving me a buttery smooth 60 FPS across the board.Having seen this game grow from its infancy, where Act I was the entire game, to what it is now has been an experience that has made me truly appreciate the developers. I thank you, and all the other people who supported this game. Early Access is always a leap of faith on behalf of the consumer, with a trackrecord that is not without its blemishes. For a developer to follow through on their promises to this extent has been a breath of fresh air and spark of hope that this business model can produce wonderful products.I was reserving judgment for my initial review score, as the game had so much to grow yet. We are nearing the full release at this point, and I have only become more hopeful for the end product, as it truly feels like a full game already.It's easily a 9/10 for me at this point and a huge recommendation for anyone who wants to enjoy a new ARPG.There is no better time to show your support for a developer who has earned my complete trust and support. I highly doubt you'd regret it.			"

Amazing Hack & Slash ARPG !Man this game is so good ! Im a big fan of the Hack & Slash ARPG genre ! I'm just going to say this one does not disappoint ! The game has real good GFX and the games Engine runs real good. The controls are pretty much the same as in Titan Quest if you owned or played it. I myself have a dino of a comp at the moment and im running it full out settings wise with rez set to 1366x768 75hrz and the game runs 100% with no issues at all.The game has nice effects also like TQ's Ragdoll and being this game is newer they have alot of nice looking spell and death effects. I also like the lighting effects more in this one also.One thing that stands out in this game also is the Blacksmith ! You can make Weapons and Trinkets , Armor , Amulets , Medels , Relics and other stuff to help you. I dont think i seen that in any H&S ARPG!Me being a big Fan of THQ/Nordic's Titan Quest and knowing this game runs on the TQ's Engine, i just  had to get it ! I love this Genra being i have Diablo 1, 2 , played 3 and I also own The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing: Final Cut , Victor Vran ARPG and the new updated Titan Quest Anniversary Edition. So in short if you like Titan Quest or any of the games i listed GET THIS GAME NOW!! Im sure if you like or are a fan of Hack & Slash ARPG's you will enjoy this one just the same !			"

Early Access Review
Stay awhile and listenAfter the Grim Dawn, the world is in turmoil and everyone is trying to get by with what they can. There are death and despair everywhere. The world is big, based on a single map, and the game is semi linear. That make up for a great game experience! For the naysayers, I only have this to say to you[www.instagram.com]. ;)   Speaking for the game Graphics and design:Grimy, grim and rough. When it comes to graphics Grim dawn is spot on. The game is dark, and include the same type of gore and feel of doom that was present in Diablo 1. You can toggle the view of your camera, the game is in full 3D and plays smooth (not laggy/jerkily as it seems to be in the promotion video clip).The game stays simple yet effectful regarding to spells, skills and weaponry. There are colours, but not overdone and the gear are “simple” in design fitting within the context of the world. Even though the skills gets more expressive and effectful the more you level, it will never, as far as I know, become like the Diablo 3 roaming discotheques of coloured lightshows and smoke grenades I am used to. And I am greatly thankful for that.During Chistmas I only had my laptop to play on, and even though my laptop has a really poor graphic card the game runs smooth (but can barely handle Diablo 3 and absolutely not games like Cities Skylines). It feels great to play a new and good looking game that is not forcing you to buy a new computer.  Sound effects and music: The sound effects are really neat. My first character was a Pyromancer focusing around a gun build, and the swooping falcons have a nices punch to them, likewise the sound of the gun when firing. It is almost like you “feel it”. The music enhances the graphic expression of the death and misery that surrounds everything.Attributes, skills and leveling:The leveling of the character is in all ARPG:s, but apart from for example Diablo 3, Grim Dawn allows you to put out points after each level in core attributes like “Physique”, “Cunning” and “Spirit” affecting everything from health and energy to damages output and chances to hit and get hit. Each level you are awarded skill points to build your character in your chosen mastery/masteries. There are six masteries and if dual classing there are additional 15 different classes, each with a number of great synergy builds to create. I think the leveling experience is good. As used to Diablo 3's minor variations, I think the different build possibilities are enormous, which do greatly enhancing the leveling experience.Mechanics:As fare as mechanics goes, it seems to be totally transparent. I do not have that much to say on this matter. Yet again referring to Diablo 3, I think this fact is a nice change of pace. Inventory/backpack and stash/bank:The system for inventory and stash are as such: Inventory on the character are bigger then Diablo 3 and do I even need to mention Path of Exiles totally lack of inventory space? The inventory is expandable through quest rewards. As far as I have progressed, you have one personal tab in the stash/bank and four shared with your other characters. But as in all of these type of games inventory and stash space, even a great amount of space, is not enough. ;)Bugs:I have not noticed any major bugs. Miscellaneous:  Exploration: As I let on in the beginning, Grim Dawn are composed of one whole “overworld”, a continuous map that, for the most parts, are open and not depending on the game progression (there is no fixed acts like in Diablo 3 or Path of Exile, where A leads to B and B to C). This makes exploration one extra dimension of the game and the environments are nice; varies a lot with high level of detail. There are randomly spawn dungeons that does not show on the map, as far as it seems. This makes it harder to find them, but you do not need to enter them to progress through the game. It just gives a nice flair to the game. There are also lots of hidden areas that will not show on neither the mini map nor the big map. The dungeons has that great feel of dungeon crawl around, with some of them in a roguelike-ish style. In some extent it feels like Diablo 1 but with much better graphics.  Questing: As for questing, there is no holding hand style of gameplay. So do not expect a World of Warcraft path finding system for quest completion. This is more old school. You have to rely on your reading skills. Thus far I have never experienced any problem with completing any quests, and I find it nice for a change that the game is not playing for me. The “hardest” get around finding are the faction bounties. Even though I have taken to account the increasingly laziness of players, I do not think those are demanding in neither reading nor thinking skills.  Factions: The game as a faction system that reminds of the systems in MMO:s. There are different steps rewarding you with discounts at vendors and access to quartermasters. You gain negative reputation with your enemies resulting in increasing monster spawn, hero spawn and spawn of nemesis at the most negative stance.  Crafting: The game has a meaningful intriguing crafting system. During the game you can buy and find blueprints to learn new craftable items. At your Blacksmith you will be able to craft weapons, accessories, armor, components (things you can use in further crafting or to “enchant"" gear you have), consumables and relics.   Story: The game has a nice story and as you progress you can make choices through dialogue with NPC:s that affects the game in different ways. I have made some good ones, and some bad ones. One learn as long as one live.  Difficulties: There are three difficulties: Normal, Elite and Ultimate. The first unlocks the second after play through. For experience players I would recommend to play normal mode with “veteran” checked. Normal (veteran mode) will provide a greater challenge; stronger and tougher monsters in increased number of spawns.  Speaking against the game  No random generated maps, as far as I know. With that said I want to point out that so far it has not been something I thought about. If we are to be fair, the random generated maps in Diablo 3 and Path of Exile “are not much to hang on the Christmas tree” (Swedish idiom for “that's not much to boast about”). However I would like the game to have random generated elements in endgame, maybe in player open “rifts” or something like that (maybe it already exists… I have not made it to endgame yet).  No voice acting when giving a storyline, quest or lore. This I think is really negative. There are so much lore that it would be great listening to it instead of reading. I hope the rumor is true, that they are planning to voice the lore, but I do not know if that is the case.  Even though I like the storyline and lore of the game, it can be corny to some small parts. As I do not want to spoil the story for someone I will not go into it.  It is not a major problem, but worth mentioning: sometime the pathfinding could be better. I think it would do well from some polish, but otherwise I have no complaint regarding that.  I have played around 10 hours in multiplayer mode. The experience has been really good, but a couple of times we have gotten off sync for some minutes. I do not think this is a big problem, but when it happens it is a source of great irritation.  Conclusion I give Grim Dawn a clear thumb up. The game is an impressive achievement, and has huge potential for further expansion. When I look at the map, it seems like that game developers has prepared for an almost doubles sized map. I hope that is the case! :)			"

												Feels good man. Clocking in decent hours and enjoying it still like it was a good old Diablo game (first one was the true love in the early days of gaming, maxing all 3 classes multiple time and spending a fortune on dial up fees with modem). This is a game that keeps on giving despite me purchasing it on the very first week of the early access years back. I play it like a madman for a week or two and give it a good break for month or two and it always feels just as natural to come back to like Diablo series did. Easy to pick up and hard to let go off, the traits of a good game are showing up here.			"

												First of all: If you liked Diablo I and II but were disappointed by Diablo III this is the game for you. That said, here's my review:Very good ARPG, takes about 50 hours for the first playthrough on normal difficulty which is, in my opinion, decently difficult for an ARPG. The classes are expansive and interesting and you can even pick two of them for double the fun. Then there's the Devotion system where you get points for restoring desecrated shrines which you can then invest into different star constellations that give you passive bonuses or skills. So all in all customization is very in depth and requires a bunch of playthroughs to see all of it. Except for the part where all characters look the same bar differences in armour and gender.It's probably really fun in multiplayer but since I don't have any friends I can't judge that part of the game, though it is very fun in singleplayer.There's not too many different kinds of enemies which isn't great but for me personally it's not a huge problem though some people may grow tired of killing the same dudes over and over again.Overall it's a very solid game with many different ways to play it that'll keep you entertained for many hours. Remember to get Chaos and Aether resistances for the late game, or at least a pet.			"

												Bias: I am a dinosaur. I like to loot and smash things.This is probably one of my favorite games I have played this past year. Graphics, story and action were all very interesting and intense. I will admit I have placed 30+ hours in the game, I still enjoy playing it - still have not finished it completely on solo. I do have a second character I did start with a friend, which took a bunch of those hours as well. The game allows for different builds of characters, which can allow for replay-ability with different formats - with melee based, assassin-esque based, mage based characters. Cool feature is the ability to play as a dual class. Which allows for different combos and sets. There is an ability to respec as well via an NPC if you decide to reformat, so you can choose a different format if you find you are having issues.There are wide range of merchants that usually have the best stuff if you are able to friend a town, faction to the max. You can also hit certain areas again for possible drops, to help improve your weapons and armors. In addition, there are different gems to upgrade abilities of weapons - from shooting fireballs or causing poison damage. I personally, have nothing to complain about the game. I personally wish I had more time to play.I would give the game a 10/10, as it is one of my favorite games from this year.I do hope they create a sequel or even extend the universe more. "

Early Access Review
								Ok, I've put a little time into this game. Enough to where I can start to form an opinion on it. First off, let me precede this with a disclaimer. The game is currently in Early Access so parts may change once it hits the final build.This game does have a dark atmosphere similar to Diablo series of old. I've played around with several different builds to date and they all offer something different. However, the true magic happens once you can combine 2 professions to make your own hybrid class(think Titan Quest and you'll completely understand what I'm talking about). If you enjoy that idea and don't mind some occasional weirdness occuring during gameplay, then this game belongs in your library.Here is where I explain the weirdness I spoke of earlier. Controls can be a little wonky(there have been times that I've selected the enemy that I wanted to attack and my character simply ran over to stand next to them). You will occasionally come across an area that you should be able to reach but an invisible wall will prevent you(to date, I have only seen this a small handful of times and is nothing too major). Also, there is some popup issues where I had to be actively running to have an object appear in front of me.If the Early Access thing worries you, then I would state that they appear to give regular updates on the game. I'm unsure if they are planning a final pass once they finish the primary development of the title but since they are apparently trying to create themselves and have shown an openess to the community, I cannot see that they will leave issues remaining in the game.I currently cannot comment on the co-op as I have not yet experienced it other than saying that the game does offer LAN and Online modes.If you enjoy ARPG's of old and want to experience something both new and old at the same time, I would recommend this. If you are looking for a graphical masterpiece, then hold off. For myself, I fully intend on grabbing a few copies for friends once it is finished so we can all have a grand old time loot grinding.

Early Access Review
								Recommended : Highly YES, don't miss this true gemBased on beta B27Many devs from Grim Dawn (GD) are those who builded this nice Titan Quest immortal Throne (TQIT) from past. That mean they know what they do, they are one of best team ever to create this kind of game.This is addictive hack'n'slash with RPG based on 6 classes, full of skills in use in dual-class system like TQIT was.- Dual class system ; choose your gameplay style melee, ranged/magic/summoner based on 6 classes with tons of skills to unlock. You must balance your character between overpowering & protections. Classes are more experienced than TQIT- Generous loot system better than mostly others game on same kind. Rare/epic/legendary items, based on classes, with   20,000+ possible magical affix combinations and over 200 rare affixes.- Innovative quest system : you can choose your destiny which affect world. Choose which factions to help and those to fight. Make peace, make hell or stay neutral : but face consequences of your acts. Your goal is to rebuild world from human extention - Factions system : help factions what you want and be awarded with discount from merchants, exclusive items to unlock. When you help a faction, you automatically fight against others which are ennemy. Entire world is based on factions, except beasts. If you fight too much against a faction, this faction will give you more challenge in fight in future, sending to you better mobs & bosses to kill you.- Multiplayer : 4 players can coop or pvp.- 4 difficulties mode : normal, veteran, elite and ultimate, can be conbinated to hardcore game.- Great gameplay : fast-paced combat with many visual effects, freeze/stun/knockdown, furnitures to demolish- optional rotatable camera : always fight from the most optimal angle- Intelligent mix between open-ended world and corridor, with outside & underground maps, 20+ secrets passages, exclusive quest map (depending on your choices based on quests)- Bestiary : 200+ enemy heroes and bosses, hand-configured with their own unique arrays of deadly skills.- Additional rogue-like dungeons :  special challenge dungeons (require rare crafted key) where enemy levels increase as you progress and player can't teleport. Win or die.- Dynamic weather : - The world is brought to life with region-specific climates and a variety of weather effects. A sunny day can cloud over with mild rain showers that builds into a booming thunderstorm. Variable wind gusts blow grass and affect objects like windmills. - Crafting system  : with 250 recipes to learn (weapons/armors/jewels/potions), combining/salvaging components, augments- Respec system : cancel your skills allocation points to create new build based on same mastery.This is one best game ever. You can buy it, closed eyes, even in beta or at full price. You'll don't regret it.			"

												My first love is Titan Quest obviously. I reckon that is down to some deep, buried within, primordial memories we all share about ancient mythology. Dragons and Medusi and Tigers wearing armour. The Great Wall of China for heaven's sake.The Torchlights were pretty good to. Don't have time for Diablos.So, can Grim Dawn match the others and be worthy of hard cash in the hand thank you Ma'am? Short answer? Yes it is.Long answer? This is what swayed me.Story: ARPG don't really need one and that is more true for a Diablo clone. This one though gave me some surprises. First time around I did not even read the various bits of paper you find on your journey, they were just XP. I started reading them second time around and found them mostly well told. It seems the developers had taken on criticism about TQ and got proper writers in. What was happening and how it affected normal people was simply fascinating. Sad too. Some stories made me angry.Factions: An advancement on the other games. You come across a few towns and communities who for some reason won't sell you their best equipment even though you save all their children from torture. You save their farms. Kill a dragon. Save a virgin. Provide free dentistry. BRING THEM FRESH WATER.And the man from town still says NO!There is a reputation system where you gain points by doing quests and killing their enemies. The good bit here is that you can see in advance what reputation improvement can get you. For example if your character specialises in fire it's better to concentrate on the faction that can provide you with +fire damage equipment. Later on in the game you have to choose between factions and one of them won't like you very much.Strays: Every now and again you encounter some guy(s) and there are different options on what to do. Kill them. Talk them around. Give them money. It's interesting as it's not obvious what the consequences will be and sometimes not even for a while. Some guy turned out to be an evil piece of work despite that I saved him. Other people down right lie to your face. Character build and classes: I think the horizontal planner for each class make it more difficult to decide on where to make improvements. At first glance the classes looked very similar to me. I now believe that unlike in TQ the developers made each class viable in its own right. So there are no wrong choices. Whether that is good or bad you can decide. One of the classes for example seems to specialise both in two handed weapons and in magic which seems odd. Pets seem to be a real decent choice now where before they could have been considered as add-ons.The Devotion section allows you to tailor your character as reflected in constellations. You can only do this if you ""Cleanse Shrines"" and once done gain valuable points to tweak your perfect killing machine. I found it a bit complicated and you can think of this section as a puzzle. Once you start thinking and planning on what choices to make here you will find your character become supreme ruler of the universe. As you complete a star sign you get a points bonus which in turn helps you to access the star signs towards the edge of the sky - they can be very powerful indeed.Gameplay: I like the new mechanism where you don't have to chug potions all the time. After battles your character will renew health automatically based on their constitution which can be increased by items and skills and renewed by finding food and some items. Good stuff. Since you don't have to focus on health *that* much, combat can be more tactical than in TQ and even I managed to train myself to click on a few different combat skills. I consider this quite an improvement as one of the criticisms of these type of games is that combat is ALWAYS THE SAME. Death by 100 of the same clicks.Now we have 100 different clicks!The world is grey and brown and missing the bright colours of other games in this genre. There is no grass breezing in the wind and no butterflies. I suppose the colour scheme is dictated to by the setting and story and part of me wonders what the engine could do if the chains are taken off. There is a decent variety of baddies to fight and a large section of bosses. Later on in the game your resistances become important and I found it handy to keep a decent collection of armour and items that cover the whole spectrum as it is unlikely your one set of equipment can cover them all.Some of the end levels in the various Acts are pretty large and sprawling. Larger than I expected which was a surprise. Towards the end of the game some of the levels feel like boxes and have nothing of consideration in them except trash mob baddies which make me think the designers spent most of their time in the beginning levels. In summary I think this game has hidden depths and statisticians can fully enjoy meaningful conversations about +% this and that. It's a good update to TQ and I can't give a bigger compliment. Would like to see a bit more variation in the environments but builds and items and classes and devotions seem to hit the spot. "

I think Grim Dawn really carries their legacy forth  and improves on nearly every aspect of it.And the best thing is: With every hour I play (260+ now?) I enjoy it even more and want to try different thinks.It's simply a must buy for fans of the genre!			"

												As somebody who loves Diablo 2 with a fiery passion that edges on peverse, and someone that just couldn't get into Torchlight 2 for some reason, and was utterly uninterested in the world and characters of Van Hellsing, Grim Dawn has finally satisfied my needs for a modern Diablo 2.I think the biggest thing that Grim Dawn gets right that most other D2 clones fail to recognize is having an actually interesting world with a good premise. It starts off by just throwing you in blind and doesn't tell you much other than you were possessed, but as you explore the world you find journal entries that give you insight into what happened.Much like Diablo 2, Grim Dawn has a dark world where horrible things have happened. You awake in the apocalypse, the world is ending and only a tiny sliver of humanity remains to fight back. The world is filled with gruesome tales and your decisions(that's right, you actually get to make quite a few as you progress) can frequently have nasty unintended consequences.In other words, the setting is wonderful.The second thing this game does right is have a good skill system with satisfying special abilities. Too many Diablo clones fail because their progression system just feels dull, here you are always eager to level up because it gives you new or more deadly abilities.The combat has a lot of weight to it, and when you smash an enemy with a crit or a special attack it feels super satisfying as their corpse flies away from you with an explosive thwack!Length: no idea, not even done on my first play through, wayyy over 30 hours worth of content though. At 25 bucks this is a steal.Loot system is basically Diablo 2's, maybe not quite as good as D2's but that may be the nostalgia talking. There is a ton of loot to find, and it encourages you to try other classes and builds as you find epic loot for those classes.Overall, this is a fantastic game. And if you've been waiting years for something to scratch that Diablo 2 itch like I have, then this is definitely a game you need to try.			"

Early Access Review
								To sum up Grim Dawn, imagine Diablo 2 crossed with Titans Quest, with a tiny hint of roguelike thrown in.This game is being developed by some of the developers from the creators of Titans Quest, and is using the Titans Quest engine. However, within the engine they have managed to change the game enough to make it distinct from a Titans Quest mod. Think similarly to Unreal Engine. It may not be as flexible, but god damn if Crate can't bend it anyway.The game heavily favors exploration, with secret quests, bosses and chests hidden around the world. Its fun to find new stuff, and even more entertaining to blow a friends mind by showing them where a level 30 boss is in a level 18 zone. Yes, he will destroy you if you aren't very prepared.There is very little hand holding inherant in the game, however the community more than makes up for it. Due to a previously successful kickstarter, there is a large community who have been helping guide newbies, and also to just have fun together. I would highly recommend joining the forums, and atleast reading the developer journals 'Grim Misadventures' as they provide sneak peaks at upcoming content.Yes, this game is incomplete currently, however, what they have released so far is well worth the price in my opinion. Torchlight 2 was a similar price, and may currently have Grim Dawn on play length (I think it would actually be close however) but only up to Act 3 Chapter 1 is currently playable.The build system will be similar to anyone who knows something about Titans Quest, with the combination of two different skill trees, i.e. Demolitionist+Nightblade=Saboteur.  Simply put, if you enjoyed older ARPG's, filled with secrets and crazy builds, then you will most likely enjoy this. Atleast give the forums a peek. - Ham			"

								It may only be early access at this point, but the game deserves massive props. On first playthrough, there are scenarios that are placed that will try to deceive you and force you to use your better judgement. Using your judgement incorrectly can force you to kill otherwise 'mostly' innocent NPCs (Julius & Helen in Arkovia for example). Things are not always what they seem with the setups.The class system is brilliant for an ARPG, two characters playing the same class-combo can end up entirely different depending on playstyle. It's a fairly new take on things that ARPGs have been building on for decades now; For example, two Blademasters (Soldier+Nightblade) can end up with one being a two-handed using tanky warrior type, while the other ends up more like a dual-wielding assassin with an arsenal of area effect abilities at their hand. All the skills are fairly decent and there isn't a wrong way to build your class --and if you feel you have built it 'wrong', you get a second chance with skill resets whenever you want.The game is also very fluid. Other than the given glitches that will most likely be fixed in full release, I have no complaints about this game.			"

Early Access Review
								I believe this game has much to offer the ARPG genre in terms of over all presentation. Its the hardcore ARPG with its veteran's mode and you can progress with a challenge and get rewarded with extra loot. Plus they still have the rare item hunting and rewards for farming with a twist. Look up Monster Infrequent (MI) for more info. Extensive crafting and personal economy that can be traded with friends or the community. Lots of storage space but you will need it when collecting your components and crafting with them + storing your great finds. You will be challenged as much as you want wile farming with a modest level scaling feature.The first 2.5 acts are out. 3 acts are confirmed there have been rumors of a small 4th act. You can level to 40* with its 116** skill points available to spend once you figure out your build idea get ready for some choices as your allocating 3 skill points a level you can respec your skills but not your mastery level so choose wisely between stat and mastery rushing or leveling your primary attack skill, aoe skill, defenses, auras, debuffs, cc and more. I would recommend with your 116 skill points aim for having at least 1/2 of them in your mastery and you will want to focus mastery > skill ups to a degree for the first 15~ levels. Ideally you will want to have a good lead in your mastery level, it should be 10+ points past your current level and you should feel safe and have the stats you need to scale your damage and HP.* 40 is the current level cap, I have no official news on the final number but they say it should be close to 50 - 75 at last estimate but I assume closer to the 75 side.** 116 skill points is 3 a level (for now I could see it drop to less at closer to the 70+ mark. 1 bonus skill point for the current game we may get more skill points before we progress to the second difficulty. So final number of skill points and skills to be determined, build ideas over 9000, sorry had to.			"

												What can I say? I'm 6hrs into this game and I'm already amazed by its complexity and variety in skills and builds, only surpassed by Path of Exile.This game is the ultimate ARPG cocktail. Titan Quest's and Diablo 2's perfect child.Only thing that I really don't like about this game is the monotonous atmosphere and the very limited color palette that the developers chose for the artwork. Every single zone seems to be the same as the previous one. But the fantastic gameplay itself compensates for this flaw.Pros:- Huge variety in skills and builds, only surpassed by PoE- Every character can have two classes at the same time and you can combine their skills and traits- Many different upgradeable items, armor and weapons- Very interesting boss fights- Faction system, where you can get reputation points for doing quests/slaying monsters for each faction- Huge replay value, your decisions matter in every playthrough + you have to try all the buildsCons:- Monotonous artwork and atmosphere- Questlines can be confusing, you can get stuck and might not know where you should go nextI would totally recommend this game to any RPG/ARPG fan, especially ones who miss the good old Diablo and Titan Quest days, and the game has a reasonable price as well!9/10, Nashud			"

												In my opinion this is the best ARPG currently on the market. It plays a lot like Diablo 2 and Titan Quest but with nice graphics.It is a loot-based game which focuses on boss farming to acquire good loot (like in Diablo 2 and not like in Diablo 3 where you farm whole areas to get loot). While your character gets better when you level up and spend points on your stats and skills, you can be godlike when you have godlike gear. The game has 6 ""pure"" classes with its own skill tree. You can dual-class which gives a total of 21 possible classes (15 dual classes and 6 pure classes). The skill system is very in-depth but still easy to understand and the possibilities of different builds are very enormous. The max level is 85, after finishing the game at normal difficulty you will be around level 50 and there are two more difficulties.There is also a Hardcore mode, multiplayer, an extensive crafting system and an achievements system.Overall a very good game, I would recommend it! The replay value is really high and if you like ARPGs you can expect a few hundred hours of fun from this game.			"

Early Access Review
								This is honestly one of the best games I've played overal and easily the best ARPG. It's obvious to see how the developers are in this to make a great game they're proud to put their name on, and they rightfully have a lot of loyal fans who have been with them since the Alpha or some point in the Beta. I started playing in late Alpha, and the game was rather good even in that early state and they only continue to vastly improve it. It's really great to see developers not try to get away with the minimum amount to make X sales but pay great attention to detail and continue to go above and beyond of what would be an 'acceptable release'. I can't wait until this game is finished, if you enjoy ARPGs at all this is a MUST buy.You pick a class at level 1, and once you reach level 10 you have the option to pick a second class, although you can do it at any level after 10 as well if you're not sure what to pick. This allows you to have some really great hybrid builds with huge replayability potential. There are currently 5 classes, so the combinations you can make are quite large, and they plan to add at least 1 more class in every expansion.Grim Dawn has a great mix of C'thonian elements, undead and other demensional demonic enemies. The environment is beautifully crafted and the plot/quests are well thought out, the additional info diaries you can find are fun to collect and read, although not a nonsense mundane task like some games make finding such things to be.  Grim Dawn has a good difficulty level and can further be increased by choosing a Veteran mode, and later when the game is released more difficulties will be released.10/10			"

Early Access Review
								Let's get this out of the way, is this game worth buying even in Early Access? Yes. Why? Well, first of all, it's further along than most early access games. I've already put over 40 hours into the game and still haven't seen most of chapter 2. The amount of content is huge.But while content is king, gameplay is God for most. The easiest way to describe the game is to compare it to Titan's Quest, but improved. It makes sense since Crate Entertainment is made up of some of the same people who worked on Titan's Quest. It's also built on the same engine, though that's been improved too. The art style is more how I wanted Diablo 3 to look, and I absolutely love it.Unlike Diablo 3, in Grim Dawn you can have two skillsets or you can just stick with one, but each level only gives you three points to spread over the skillsets, so you have to choose. You also are able to choose your attribute points, though there are only three choices. It's simplified, but not to the point of Diablo 3.The game has a faction system that looks like it could be promising later on, but at the moment it's simple and mostly meaningless. You gain fame and reputation through killing big bosses and monsters which can open up other side quests, but you'll usually open these up just from playing normally and not paying attention to your fame stats. I dropped $58 on this game during its kickstarter, it was money I had saved for Diablo 3. I don't regret a penny, and after picking up Diablo 3 on sale, I think I made the right choice. But, it is in early access so there are chances for bugs. I haven't ran into any since they've released  Act 2, but keep in mind it's still a work in progress, but even then it's better in my opinion than some full release games.If you love ARPGs then you owe it to yourself to pick up this game, especially when it's only $25.

												To start, I've played just about all of the major ARPG's. Diablo, Diablo 2 and 3. Titan Quest and expansion, Torchlight, Torchlight 2 and Path of Exile.I saw numerous reviews prior to purchasing this stating the game was easy and had no difficulty. They either played a different game, or only tried the lowest difficulty. I just finished the main game on Veteran(2nd difficulty), first playthrough. I had at least 100 deaths. The game brings a huge challenge on higher difficulties, especially if your gear is behind and your build is not optimized. Which brings me to my first gripe. You picked 2 classes of the bunch as your character. The max level is 85, which equates to around 228 skill points I believe. Each class has 20-30 skills with ranks going from 1 to anywhere as high as 12. So to rank 1 skill to max you have to use 12 skill points. For me, I have never been good with theorycrafting so this is a big challenge for me and a stresser. There aren't a ton of builds out there on the web to go off of, so you kind of have to make good choices or your character won't have enough resistances or skills to kill the bosses. If you love theorycrafting and TONS of different options for builds, you will love this. It's not as complex as Path of Exile, but there's a ton of build variety. My next few gripes I will lump together. There's a weird level scaling system in place. Some areas have a max level for scaling while others seem to not, or have a higher threshold. If you find yourself getting slaughtered by a boss, and go level 4 or 5 times and come back, the boss will still be 4 or 5 levels higher than you. It makes it hard to want to keep going sometimes, because you feel like youre on a stairstepper that doesn't end. I occasionally had crashes/freezes. There is also some line of sight issues with ranged abilities. I also found the navigation to be buggy sometimes when dealing with areas with multiple platforms or levels. As this game was made by the people who did Titan Quest, this game throws mountains of loot at you. 99/100 pieces of the loot will be useless, but it's good for making money. Which you'll need to buy lots of potions, and some nice gear upgrades from the reputation vendors. The game has reputation factions which you gain rep with and each rank of rep has different rewards. It's a nice side grind/progress checker. The music, level design and art is great. I found the main theme to be very nostalgic of Diablo. I finished the game in just under 30 hours on my first playthrough and managed to get to level 50. I found myself wanting to keep progressing each time and keep finding those upgrades and getting that next level so I could get a new skill or new buff. If you enjoy ARPG's, you really can't go wrong with this game. I am glad I bought it, and expect to try to get a char to max level and try the harder difficulties. I do not regret buying this what-so-ever, and fully recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the genre. There's a ton of stuff to do, the areas are huge, there's tons of loot, great music, great build diversity, and it's quite challenging.			"

Better than Diablo?tl;drThis game is a very well-executed ARPG. From the vastness of the customization to the richness of the gameplay, you're bound to have a fresh playthrough, even mulitple times. The world's atmosphere is also inviting and imaginative, even if the story is difficult to grasp. 8.5/10. GameplayThis is where the game shines. You have six different masteries (classes). You choose your first at level 2. You choose your second at level 10, and you can harmonize them. You feel in complete control of your character and what sh/e does best. This is refreshing. Diablo was tons of fun, but the character development is a bit locked. I mean, you can choose what kind of demon slayer or barbarian you want to be, but you're still just that character and nothing more. And as you level in Diablo, you get stronger and unlock more skills, but there feels like there's always a best way to play your character. With Grim Dawn, you don't feel that way. Choose a class, and then have seemingly complete control over what that character does best. You level the character's abilities, but you have a choice between what skills the character employs. You don't unlock one skill at a time, you unlock a handful as your progress through your mastery, and you can ignore one for another, or choose and level all of them.You also come across shrines in the game. Cleanse the shrines and you get a devotion point, which can be used to further enhance your character's abilities by choosing a constellation to populate (it'll make sense when you play it). Choosing the right constellations means that as you progress you'll become even stronger. It's like leveling inside leveling, and is definitely an added plus. Fighting, attacking, talking and looting are all typical for any ARPG, which is fine. The Diffculty: Where is the Blacksmith?The difficulty options themselves are typical. There are three levels, Normal, Elite and Ultimate. You unlock each difficulty as you beat the game, according to the wiki. But, if any of the diffculties are too easy for you, you can toggle the ""Veteran"" modifier, for those who are veterans of the genre. More enemies, more elite and champion enemies and better loot. Torment mode in Diablo seems more fleshed out, but this is a streamlined, simplified process for the same thing.Another neat point of emphasis is that, like Diablo and Torchlight, you can find characters that give you even more to work with. The blacksmith can make weapons and armor, vendors sell them. One person allows you to unsocket a gem, etc. What's really cool is the ease with which you can respec. It's available fairly early in the game from one of the characters. ""Wait a second. Why did you begin this section asking where the blacksmith is? Didn't you just say he's there?""Yes I did. But what's neat about this game is that you can miss him. Or even if you find him, you don't have to send him to town. And so it goes with at least a handful of the characters I've encountered. You can just not ever find him/her and progress the game anyway. This adds an enriching aspect to the gameplay. So, you're forced to fully explore areas, but not merely for loot. This is huge. Diablo at points (particularly when you're a lower level and especially before the DLC) felt like it had you running through areas simply to find loot. That's ok, I guess. It's cool to find stuff, but it feels like it's just extending the game.Not so, with Grim Dawn. Fail to fully explore an area and you might miss something very important. How many ARPGs can boast that? I mean, I killed the boss in Act I and was merely searching for scrap in an area I already ""cleared"" (enemies return) to advance the story. I ran into a note while on this endeavor, and it eventually pointed the way to a challenge dungeon. An entire challenge dungeon would have been missed if it weren't for my proclivity to sell all the scrap I get.This adds to the diffculty and makes playing the game feel exciting. You never know who or what you'll find so long you look in every nook and cranny. Oh, and there are challenge dungeons (hehe). They contain good loot, and they level as you level. The boss of the area is always several levels above you. Good luck. MultiplayerMultiplayer does its job. Play with up to four friends. Enemies get stronger and loot gets better with the more players you add. This is cool. What's especially good about multiplayer is that you don't need to play with a friend. Although, it's much more enjoyable hooking up with a friend on Curse (Steam chat sucks) and playing this together, you can search a vast list of servers and join anyone who's decided to host an open, passwordless mulitplayer game. So, you can play with friends, or you can make friends and play. Win/win.StoryI want to make it known that it's clear the developers put a lot of effort with the budget they had to make a vibrant world including characters that are full of life coupled with an immersive, if flawed, story. I mean, I came across an NPC that was about to commit a terrible act, and I could either fight and kill him or talk him down. The tension was adaquately palpable; I had a very real feeling that I could influence the story. You don't get that very often, even with games that offer so-called choices. But, I'm playing with my third character where I've reached level 20 (I haven't yet finished the game, just trying different builds), and I'm finally starting to get a grip on the story. And it still somewhat feels a bit convoluted. Part of the reason this review begins asking if this is better than Diablo, rather than outright saying it, is because in Diablo the story is laid bare. Perhaps slightly less immersive, it's at least very easy to follow. It's easy to sort of get caught up in the fighting and looting and miss the lore the devs worked for in Grim Dawn.Now, being that this is an indie dev, I understand why much of the story is relayed to you via Lore findings. Instead of having a budget for tons more voice acting, much of the story is given by finding a journal, book or text that tells you what's going on and what happened in the area. It's not that I mind reading per se, but you have to stop in the middle of the action and read a lenghty discourse about what's going on.Controller or kb/m?First off, this game works well enough with the Steam Controller. Good job devs on including a comprehensive default donfiguration.But, the controller versus kb/m debate is still there. There are two dominant aspects of the game: Exploring and Fighting. The tool you decide to use clearly shines in one aspect or the other. Controller is by far preferable when in the midst of a fight. You can map your unlocked skills to the buttons (in-game!) and very easily just press that button when you want to execute that skill. But where the controller falls short is exploring. Moving is made better having a stick, but it just feels like a chore to click the right pad to get my cursor to appear, then move the cursor before I do essential actions (traveling to an area, opening character screen, talk to NPC, picking up items, etc). Kb/m shines in this area, but fighting is slightly more work.Also, every time I go to change controller configs (using Big Picture Mode), whenever I return to the game my controller doesn't work anymore. I have to restart the game to get my controller to work again. It saves my config changes, but this hinders the ability to change configs on the fly, which is a defining characteristic of the Steam Controller.The VerdictScore: 8.5 of 10Controller or kb/m: Kb/m is better, both work fine.Single or multiplayer: Does both well! Good job, devs!Buy it?: $25 is a deal. A great buy if on sale.Replay it?: Yes.			"

Early Access Review
								As a Diablo I/2/3 player, current PoE player and past Torchlight I & II player - it's safe to say I thoroughly enjoy the genre. Grim Dawn has since been added to the collection and thus far I have absolutely no regrets.The game provides appropriately 'grim' visuals, complemented by a very catchy and memorable soundtrack, all of which makes your impending murderous killing spree (in the name of questing and loot) all the more enjoyable. Having said that, Grim Dawn does a few things differently compared to the above commonly referenced titles. The lack of handholding is welcomed, as are the various but noticeable quality of life improvements that are easily underappreciated. In addition, gone are the procedurally generated maps, opting instead for a lovingly crafted world that throws in randomly spawned locales and dungeon entrances, alongside numerous quests with different outcomes and consequences, as well as picking a side between warring factions -- all of which ensures that despite the more 'static' settings, you still have uncertainty spliced with a bit of randomness and replay value - enforced through multiple difficulty settings of gameplay.Class/character building is a decent mix between repairable/configurable stats/abilities, and permanent decisions. It is also pleasant how you can essentially mix together two classes to form your own hybrids, rather than pick X and be stuck with it, adding onto the replay value thanks to all manner of class potential and experimentation in your mission to explore and survive in the absolute highest difficulty.In short, Grim Dawn is as familiar as it is unique - a 'must try' for fans of the genre looking for a nice mixture of all that is currently on offer today, with its own twists and turns.There are negatives, sure - but they are drowning in a pool of competant and well handled positivies.

Early Access Review
								This is one of the best games I've played in a while and it's early access! I got hooked on this game hard. The graphics, sound, abilities, combat, inventory management all fantastic. The upgrade system for enhancing your gear allows for a lot of variety. I explored every inch of every map, hacking away at the endless relentless hordes of evil that plague the beautiful and varied landscapes. You start in zombie infested swamplands. Then you unlock the other side of town and it's like something out of the wild west. There is strong variety in enemy design. The ability to open rifts (teleports) anywhere in the game is a dream come true for inventory management. You don't have to make tough decisions about what to carry. Just teleport back to town, sell stuff, and return to where you were. Monsters don't respawn from teleporting. This also makes tough boss battles easier. Sometimes I would die repeatedly to a boss, but a rift in that room let me return back to it quickly. Another great feature is that enemies don't regenerate health, so you can eventually whittle down even the toughest challenges.A few downsides are that the grind can get tiresome due to the extreme amount of enemies standing in your way. They don't respawn  unless you exit the game, however, which is nice for keeping track of where you've been as the maps are enormous. You can't save the game, which makes it hard to play shorter sessions. If you start exploring a map, you're in for the long haul until you either clear the entire area or find a new rift. Otherwise, the next time you log in you start at the city and all the monsters you cleared on a map have respawned. Exiting the game removes any existing personal rift you left behind also, so no quick teleporting to where you left off on a map. This was the most frustrating feature for me, because I can't always play for hours at a time and would have to play something else when my play time was shorter.Sale prices of items to shops is really low. Buy prices are really high. It needs better balance. It's not that huge of a deal, since the best items keep flowing from combat loot and treasure chests.I also felt we don't get enough points to boost our skills each level. The game boasts combining two classes but it takes around 40 skill points just to cap out tier 1 abilities in one class. You only get 3 points per level. So you have to sacrifice boosting your main class just to scratch the surface of the second class. I pointed out a handful of downsides, but it is early access. It's in incredible shape for an EA title, most of which we all know aren't that well off. I highly recommend supporting the game. I played 42 hours before I ran of content as of May 4. New content is coming soon according to the developer notes. In the meanwhile I started  playing Titan Quest, an older game from the same creator. I just can't get enough!			"

								Honestly, it's like what I wanted out of Diablo III, with the ability to mesh together two classes and become, in essence, what I want to be.In my short timespan in the game, I may have hit the end of the 'content' but I didn't quite hit the end of the 'content.'  There's far more to the game than just the main quest.""I wonder what's in this cave?  Oh, a nice demon thing and OMG IT'S 8 LEVELS HIGHER!""'We should run.'""Nah, we got th-OMG okay he hurts.""'Nah, you got this!'""No, we should ru-OW!""'Okay, maybe we should go....'""Oh hell naw, this guy's going down now.""You'll run into that.  Numerous times. "

								Sometime ago I promised a review to the dev, so now I'm going to correct that mistake.Grim Dawn is a great action RPG title from the ex-Titan Quest dev (also a great ARPG), with a lot of offering in terms of very good graphics, multi-class characters and a lot of depth in gameplay. Even though Grim Dawn looks like a classic Diablo clone, it is actually a lot more than that, because of the several reasons: the world is much larger; you have an ability to create a balance in the world between the factions (if one faction likes what you're doing, you can buy cheaper stuff from the merchants etc.); and dynamic weather - which is an awesome visual feature.There are areas that could be somewhat improved, like combat animations and an ability to move the inventory around the screen, or at least to choose a position of the inventory in the GUI.To sum it up, a very good ARPG offering.

												Grim Dawn has been worth the wait since its Kickstarter campaign ended four years ago. Using the Titan Quest engine provided that essential first step to greatness, and it helped create awesome locations populated with diverse monsters. The levels are huge and joined together in a cohesive manner. The inclusion of faction alliances, and numerous written logs, helps strengthen the role-playing aspects. Character customization, class combinations, equipment upgrades and Devotion skills allow for a titanic range of viable builds. Once you finish the game, additional time can be spent with bounties, faction quest, and exploration of obscure areas. If multiplayer was more polished, there would be nothing holding it back from being strongly recommended. For solo adventurers, there are few better hack-and-slash games than Grim Dawn with its tremendous depth and excellent world design.Read full review[www.newgamenetwork.com] "

								If you don't like to sleep and want to throw away hours of your life agonizing over different item and talent builds, then buy this game. The depth and replayability are insane, yet it's easy to get started. I haven't been this hooked on a game since early WoW.			"

Early Access Review
								Diablo 3 is too simplified and baby-tier.Path of Exile requires six spreadsheets and a bible to pray with.Titan Quest has a weird Greek theme to it and needs mods to run as intended.So why not play Grim Dawn? For starters its offline so you're not waiting on anyone else's servers or connections (unless you want to play multiplayer) and while it isn't free like PoE its much cheaper than D3 and you don't have to run it through a redundant client. Everything you need to play Grim Dawn gets downloaded through Steam which shouldn't be a selling point but in today's time not coming saddled with DRM or always-online requirements is quite the bow on the box.As for the game itself its typical ARPG fair. Find monsters, bludgeon them until they die, pick up loot, rinse and repeat. Grim Dawn manages to make that pretty satisfying though, on par with D3 actually (although the gritty aesthetic does appeal more to me than D3s aesthetic) and much more so than PoE where a lot of attacks seem to not even connect. It uses a tri-stat system and is very similar to a finished, polished, and reskinned Titan Quest with more stuff in it. Making a return is the two-class system which is pretty good fun and encourages lots of replay to see what each combination feels like in play (even if you can see, on paper, how they appear if you go looking.)The mechanics encourage a wider variety of things than D3s 'Add more to your primary stat' equipment. A lot of the time you have to think about things and make sure that the extra +5% Physical damage bonus is worth the loss of 3% of your armor value and all of your Cold resistance because you don't know the next time some random frost-covered skeletor is going to show up and hand you your ♥♥♥ on a plate. There are hardly ever any 'pure upgrades' if you keep upgrading your equipment consistently and the crafting system helps this out a lot.The real shocker is that making equipment is actually worth your time instead of the usual 'I can just pick it up off the ground, why bother?' mentality that plagues most ARP games. A lot of the time you can make better items than what you find so you're going to be almost always short on supplies and currencies which is really pretty unique considering the mountain of gold I'm sitting on in D3 and the bank stashes full of PoE currency items. There just seems to be a lot of attention to detail to make the game better than its competition.I can't make a sales pitch to people who don't know the genre, you're going to just look deep inside yourself and find out how much grind and loot hunting you're ready to commit to, but for everyone else? You're looking for the buzzwords of 'Its better than Diablo 2' but I'm not here to give you that judgement - I'm here to tell you that its better than everything else in the modern market.If you want to know if it beats out the classic D2? Try it out.			"

Early Access Review
								Highly recommended game for fans of any Diablo game, Path of Exile, Titan Quest, Torchlight, Fate etc.The things that drew me to this game was two things:1) It has single player (offline with no latency or disconnect issues)2) Dark atmosphereOther things that are awesome about this game:-Grim Dawn developers have paid high attention to details, both visually and also dialogue. Graphics are very nice (although needs optimizing, but that always happens just before actual game release) and dialogue is quite good and sometimes funny as well (serious funny, not childish funny (not that there's anything wrong with that)) and there are no inconsistencies as far as I have noticed such as how Leah in Diablo 3 is powerful enough to open a gate, but the main hero is not, yet can defeat Diablo etc.-The game is friendly to people with certain disabilities such as sufferers of motion sickness (option to turn off camera shaking) and people with colour blindness (several clolour blindness options to suit the type of colour blindness you have). I cannot tell you how well these options work as I do not actually suffer from these disabilities, but I really like that the developers pay attention to this.-So the fact that the environments are not randomly generated like other ARPGs worried me a little but they are a large part of what keeps a game interesting for me, but I can assure anyone that the environments do indeed stay fresh because of a number or reasons. There are all kinds of debris that can block your path in one game session, then in a different game session it'll be elsewhere (they vary per game session) meaning you still have to explore the map a little further. There are also many caves/dungeons that are optional but there are many and exploring them does reward you nicely, adding high satisfaction to the gameplay.-Again, the darker atmosphere of this game is not necessarily scary, but it is indeed gloomy and people who enjoy Diablo will particularly enjoy the atmosphere of Grim Dawn.-I have not looked too much into the lore, but what I have heard and read about does make me want to look into it further. The idea of the game taking place after a recent kind of apocalypse is always cool and it does make you think of Fallout 3 in that sense. You meet characters in the game who are struggling to survive in the post apocalyptic environment with dangerous monsters (and people) roaming the wilds that were once safe in the past.-Like a lot of people say, the game is built on the exact same engine that the game Titan Quest (awesome ARPG from 2006 and STILL very good and quite up to date with newer games in every aspect, including graphics). You can easily tell as most of the UI also looks very similar in both structure and art style as Titan Quest. Not only that though, the physics feel exactly like in Titan Quest and the character animation has the same kind of heavy feel to them as well.-Items. Similar affix system as you get in most ARPGs. Random stats will be applied to each item that you pick up. It's nothing revolutionary, but it's a system that is used in many games because it works and actually manages to keep the game fresh for a while. There are magic items, epic items, legendary items, all that kind of stuff. It's all good though!-The game has factions similar to ones you see in World of Warcraft. You complete quests for a certain group of people and you increase your reputation with them, making them respect you more and there is a meter in the character menu so you can keep track of it. It's exciting to see what more the developers will do with this as there are a lot of possibilities they could play around with in such a feature.-Levelling, stats and abilities. Most abilities are cool, but I have not explored it much because I have only played 1 character for about 19 hours as of this review and another small character for less than 1 hour. I can say though that you always anticipate the next level you reach in the game as you get to apply point into stats and also abilities and you do actually feel that your character grows every level. As of this review, the level cap is only 40 which will increase as more of act 3 gets accessible (I think act 3 is the final act..?) but I don't think anybody knows what the max level will be yet but it seems to me that the developers want the game to remain fun and add endgame. They have mentioned on their website that after release they are planning on implementing a game mode where you defeat endless waves of monsters and then you can test how far you get etc, although not much detail has been provided yet.-Another thing I would like to mention is that the developers do not believe in pay-to-win or small useless DLC updates. However, they do want to create expansions to the game after release (paid expansions such as Lord of Destruction, Immortal Throne, Reaper of Souls etc.) which is awesome really.-Music is very good.The developers are very active and update the playable game regularly. Check out their website http://www.grimdawn.com/ for information on the content and features of the game on the Game Guide menu.Very good game. Happy I contributed to supporting the developers.9.5/10EDIT: I would like to add some cons about the game as to not be too biased towards the game.-So obviously the game needs work on the optimization but that always happens near the end of development.-Combat COULD improve in a way but is not a large problem. I feel (as a melee character) that not much strategy is involved. My class does not really use energy (mana) and I have never ever run out of it before. A lot of monsters' movement speed is faster than you so you cannot avoid their attacks and it ends up with you using potions. The frequency of using potions is similar to that of Diablo 2, give or take, depending on how much healing your class is capable of. I am okay with this, but I do enjoy the way that in Diablo 3 it is balanced in a different way where potions are an emergency heal with a long cooldown, rather than your main source of healing. Basically the combat could do with slightly more strategy as the only strategy I do is to run away from mobs real quick, heal, then go back but it is far from ruining it. It is a smaller problem than I may be making it out to be. Also it is in beta stage.-User Interface is not that smooth, but it was not in Titan Quest either but easily forgivable as it is not a huge issue or anything. It isn't unresponsive or anything, just not smooth in anyway, although the placement of the UI during combat or any activity is good and does not get in the way.Might update this review as time goes on, if I remember ;)			"

												This is one of the best ARPGs I've ever played.  The graphics, sound and music create an atmosphere that just keeps drawing me in.  The story is not deep, but it doesn't seem to detract from the enjoyment of the game.  There's must be something drug-like about melting, blasting, and generally laying waste to everything that stands in my way.			"

Early Access Review
								I LOVE this game. But then, I already had a good feeling I would because I have also loved Titan's Quest so when I heard that Grim Dawn was also being developed by the same development team, I was super excited!Staying true to their roots, Crate is bringing the best of what made TQ so fun and keeping true to a very similar class system that they used for Titan's Quest where there are base classes, in this game six I think, each combine with one another to form masteries but I've seen plenty of gameplay videos that show just playing through as a pure class is as viable as is mixing it up to create the masteries.So besides the fact that this game takes place in a really gritty, dystopian reality,  this is also the first ARPG where I actually experienced choice and consequence!!  Before now, when playing the typical ARPG like Diablo or Torchlight, I'm so used to just clicking through text because none of it really matters, it all would lead to the same thing, so imagine my surprise when I was doing just that and found out I managed to annihilate an entire settlement, who were just trying to stay alive best they could, but my sloppiness ensured their destruction, of course I got another quest out of it that I wouldn't have received otherwise but still, I know for a fact I have never felt so guilty before EVER when playing an ARPG in the past so now I'm more careful when I read through text because it doesn't matter if you quit the game and come back to farm loots, that poor rickety shambles of a village will still be just as dead as it was when I destroyed it so carelessly the first time.  That is simply AWESOME!!! And on top of that,  there is faction gameplay as well so you can align yourself with certain powers that be which will give availability to cool gear and items you wouldn't get otherwise but also increases the replayability as well, over and above what the class/masteries provide alone.As of right now, it's not possible to choose factions that could possibly royally screw over the first settlement where your character starts and is accepted into for story reasons. Even so, with the factions mechanic they already have in place, I wouldn't be at all surprised if a future expansion or dlc will make such a thing very possible because your starting area is coveted by many, so this faction gameplay they've added to Grim Dawn makes the future possibilities of the game's potential really exciting!I just can't recommend this game more highly!!

Early Access Review
								This review is based on (Build 28).UPDATED 11.29.15Have you been looking for the next ARPG to try?  If so, this game should be at the top of your list.  When I first read a Grim Dawn article from RockPaperShotgun.com a long while back, I was left with hope for an ARPG that would deliver a gaming experience akin to mashing up several characteristic of some of my favorite games:Diablo/Diablo 2 - Loot Variety / Quality, Rune/Rune word system, and the dark, mature, and savage atmosphereTitan Quest:IT - Graphics, Class system, Essence system, Relic system and Loot Variety/QualitiesGames of the late 90s era - Innovation and challenge at the risk of appealing to a niche / mature audiencePath of Exile - Deep passive skill tree offering immense amounts of customization and replayabilityThus far the game is delivering a very enjoyable gaming experience.  Below i've touched on the aspects of the game I've enjoyed most.  However, recently Crate overhauled their website and added a Game Guide [www.grimdawn.com].  This guide provides considerably more depth into the masteries and systems which build the foundation of this game.  If you're on the fence about the game poke through the guide to get an in depth view of what the game has to offer, read on to get a flavor of what my experience has been, or read both, but don't waste too much time; the game is begging to be played.  The current 5 mastery choices are bound to provide an option to suit almost anyones play style and to top it all off Grim Dawn uses a dual mastery system that provides excellent character building depth and game replayability. The Component System is Grim Dawn's version of the Titan Quest Essence system or Diablo's gem, jewel, rune system, which offers the ability for players to collect components dropped by enemies which can then be combined to create components with greater stats and sometimes active skills when socketed to armor, weapons, or accessories. The Forge system is an enhanced version of Titan Quest's Enchant system, which now allows players to craft relics, gear, and accessories from completed components, scraps, and iron bits. Relics which require formulas are Grim Dawn's answer to Diablo 2's Runeword system.  The forge is a much more engading/indepth version of Diablo's Gambling system and Diablo 2's Horadric cube crafting system.The Devotion system is Crate's version of Path of Exiles' passive tree.  Notable difference that I find more enjoyable is the means by which one obtains devotion points (passive tree points).  Instead of being given the passive point on each level; the player must first find the devotion shrine and either restore it with the requested materials or kill whatever has been locked within it.  This system provides the player with even more reason to explore this atmospheric world and additional challenges to ""fix"" the shrine thereby adding more depth to the enchancing your character instead of just purely leveling.  The loot system is addicating and gratifying. Loot erupts from slain enemies and chests and glistens on the ground begging to be picked up.  The qualities range from ( Unique Item sets, Purple - Legendary, Blue - Epic, Orange - Components, Green - rare, Yellow - magical, White - common, Grey - broken).The post apocolyptic dark and gritty fantasy victorian environment is splendid!  I really enjoy all the detail of the graphical assets for this game so far; they are varied and really don't feel over used. The lighting and shadow system is done in a way that makes the environment come to life and feel real.  The weather/atmosphere system is very appealing and includes aspects such as day/night cycle, fog, lightning, rain, etc. and the ability to mix it up to varying degrees to create climates/weather patterns for different regions within the game.  I also appreciate the graphics tuning options that allow me to crank up the visual details for my desktop rig, and allow me to scale it all down for my outdated laptop. The ambient soundstage and sound effects is probably one of my favorite aspects of this game. Between this and the grahic asset detail the immersion is top notch.  Here are some examples:Ticking of an old grandfather clockPopping and creeking of old wooden floorsCrackling of a roaring fire incinerating coffins and the deadThe buzzing of flies over a rotting corpseHissing wind and the babbling creeksCrows squawking and monsters growningMetallic reverberating undertones (sounds a little like deep church bells in the distance with overtones of ringing metal being pounded on by a blacksmith.)The combat sound effects are extremely satisfying! The character actions/skills seem to integrate flawlessly with the sound effect in a way that just seems to ""fit/resonate"".  For example flaming musket shots crack as they leave the muzzle of the weapon and sizzle/ignite as they penetrate the target's flesh. A landed melee attack has a solid satisfying thud the seems as if it were capable of shattering bones. In previous builds of the game I found the soundtrack left a lot to be desired.  It was distracting and felt repeative and grating.  I'm happy to say the soundtrack is changing in a very positive way, now blending and interweaving into the ambient effects of the game.  It's really starting to fit the atmosphere and rhythem of the game in my opinion.  Overall, I'm happy to say I have zero reget being an initial founder for this game. I'm also glad I cancelled my Diablo 3 per-orders and upped my support for this small indi developer when it became a Kickstarter project.  I have full confidence Crate will deliver a highly polished finished product boasting an amazing challenging, replayable, and indepth ARPG experience that other games of this genre will be judged on. It's definitely worth the asking price of $25 as it stands, and I expect it will become an even greater value as more content is added, adjusted, and balanced.        Many thanks to Arthur Bruno and his Crate Entertainment team for continuing to deliver on his original vision dating back to 2010.			"

												Grim Dawn is an awesome hack-and-slash RPG, and here's why I like it:- neat-looking graphics;- post-apocalytic atmosphere: badass, stylish armor, quests and written pieces of lore that help you submerge;- decent soundtrack;- 6 playable classes with possibility to combine any 2 of them, creating the array of different playstyles;- secrets everywhere;- soiled trousers (an epic item).Nothing special about the story, though: we're saving our world from the Great Evil again, but with the difference that the Evil has almost won by the moment we begin. Though, in process we discover that there is another, even greater Evil, so we fight it too.I barely tried multiplayer with random people, got no friends to walk through the game with.Grim Dawn is created on the same engine as Titan Quest, and they have a lot in common, but Grim Dawn feels more serious and deep. I'm enjoying this game, and so will be you if you like hack-and-slash RPG genre. 9/10 ragequits on hardcore character death.			"

Grim Dawn; rather, The Incredible Adventures of Titan Diablo's Exile.More specifically, take the oppressive atmosphere of Diablo I; the addictive gear-hunting and build-planning of Diablo II; an expansive passive ability system a la Path of Exile; the visceral spell-slinging and skull-bashing of Diablo III, an aesthetic befitting of The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. Beat gently in bowl along with the engine of TItan Quest. Makes one game worthy of the title of Diablo II's spiritual successor.Even more specifically, the sound design is excellent: Matt Uelmen-esque electric guitars and drums are accompanied by eerie ambient noises to create a genuine dungeon-crawling experience, and the environments are wonderful and befitting of the setting and mood. Maps are not randomly generated, meaning every cave and cellar is hand-crafted by the level designer, and worthy of tireless exploration.Your character begins as a blank slate- you decide on a class only after you've cut your teeth, and acquire a second class to progress in alongside your first. This makes character building more unique and provides you with access to new playstyles that incorporate different skills. In addition to this, finding shrines and offering them the right item rewards you with points with which you can progress in a Path of Exile-style map of passive effects ranging from small stat boosts to useful procs and playstyle modifications.Finally, the loot system and available gear consists of item tiers typical to the ARPG genre, but some rarer items heavily impact specific playstyles to the point entire builds can be centered around one. This, coupled with the fact no item is class-restricted, means your character can develop in several different directions at once to suit how you want to play. Grim Dawn is visceral, addicting and packed with eye candy that will satisfy for a long while. Stay tuned for its proper release, but don't hesitate to buy now to experience the game yourself.			"

												I love this game quite a bit. It's probably my third favorite Hack and Slash RPG ever after Diablo 2 and PoE. Why? Because it understands what makes the genre so great and so beloved by so many people, and it delivers on all that. Like most ARPGs, the story is nothing special, and isn't really the main focus here. However, the world that the game is set in is very unique and intriguing. It's sort of like the old west mixed with fantasy and the post apocalypse. It really reminded me of the world of Stephen King's Dark Tower series, and that in no way is a bad thing. Grim Dawn's world is, as you might imagine, dark and grim and desperate, and that desperation comes through in the world design and in the people you talk to. I also think that this game nails something that most ARPGs forget about, and that is the actual role playing. While only a few NPCs are fully voiced (this is clearly a budget game, and is priced as such) most NPCs have interesting things to tell the player about the world and their place in it. Furthermore, there are several points in the game where you have to make choices, for instance, whether to trust a certain person, whether to hire this blacksmith or that one, etc. Some of these choices are minor and others are more serious, but they all feel important and weighty when you are making them. But the gameplay is really the star of the show here, and the reason why you are buying Grim Dawn. And it's great. Your hits feel meaty and visceral. Your enemies are fiercesome and unrelenting. Your skills feel useful and powerful, and there's a real sense of progress as you level up. You are given tremendous freedom in leveling up your character; you choose two classes to specialize in as you level up, and then can choose freely from both of those classes' skill trees. The great thing is that all of these classes feel interesting and fleshed-out on their own, but when you have the ability to combine any two, you get some truly unique combinations. You can be a powerful warrior who swings a two-handed weapon and throws molotov cocktails. You can be a gunman with dual pistols and a pet raven. You can be a battlemage with a sword in one hand and a spelltome in the other. Pretty much any combination of classes and/or playstyles is viable here. I don't think I've played any other game that offers so much freedom in how you build your character. You might worry that because this is a budget game that the loot system might be bare-bones, but that isn't the case. There's tons of different weapons and armors that can have tons of magical properties, and that's not even counting the game's rare and legendary items. Whatever type of weapon your character uses - pistols, rifles, one or two handed melee weapons, magic off-hands, you name it - the game has tons of variations on it. This is game is a spiritual successor to Titan Quest, and like that game Grim Dawn also has crafting materials that you can combine and add to your gear to give you new skills or better attributes. I could go on and on about all of the various things that this game does right but I'll just say this: Grim Dawn is fantastic and if you like Hack and Slash RPGs, you must own this game. Even if you've never played a Diablo clone before, I think that you would enjoy this game if you give yourself some time to learn the gameplay systems. Grim Dawn is, in short, a masterpiece of the genre.			"

												Grim Dawn, the hidden gem. With all the hype of AAA games nowadays, it is easy to miss the release of smaller games. I am grateful I got recommended Grim Dawn, as this is an excellent ARPG. The game design is super impressive, with the subtle changes to the game world, to make it feel like you are making a difference, the intelligent and organised UI to the beauty of the world itself. This game is fantastic for its price. I give it 9.5/10. Well done Crate Entertainment, you have a new Fan.Pros:- 6 Classes, you get to pick two which makes your actual sub-class. (Soldier + Nightblade = Blademaster etc.) 15 Total. + The Devotion Tree (almost like a third class).- Massive Customization for Skills- Playstyle is unrestricted from class. Play how you want to play. (Firebreathing Dagger Warrior? Duel Wielding Pistol Demonologist? No problem) - You can see physical changes to game world after completing certain quests. (I love this one)- NPC Voice acting feels real. (main quest only)- Can be played online with up to 4 people. PvP is an option for servers. (Also works on Hardcore, although Permadeath still applies)- Can trade between characters and other people online.- Singleplayer / Multiplayer can use the same character.- Massive amount of items & crafting.- Armor & Weapons have different skins and effects depending on the item.- Easy Weapon Switching + Hotbar Switching.- UI has neat tricks. (Auto Show Loot Filters etc.)- Account Shared Warehouse (for loot transfer) + Personal Stash- Teleport system for quick travel and trading. (Can make a Personal Rift (Portal) from anywhere.- Multiple difficulty levels. (Normal, Veteran, Elite, Ultimate) + Option of going Hardcore (Permadeath) aswell.- Grim Dawn is Mod Friendly. Neutral (Can be both depending): - The game is abundant with RNG. Items & Skills.Cons:- NPC Voicing only in main quests and could be completed.- No character customisation. Limited to Female or Male.- Game sometimes crashes, (not often, three times in 40+ hrs + has auto report crash function)Conclusion:If you are a fan of Diablo or Path of Exile or would like to get into the ARPG genre, this game is for you. For its current price, it is definitely worth it. All in all. Phenomenal game.Don't forget to rate this review! "

												If you are on the fence about this game, just get it, i have 700 hours played and i see myself getting many more. It class customization is huge, for example, there are 6 classes, you choose 2 of them, each class has atleast 2 types of damage, and some have 3, they are also releasing an expansion soon thats bringing 2 more classes. If your thinking you are just gonna go play D3 instead, don't, D3 has 1 or 2 sets per class that are viable, but there are sooo many more viable combinations and variety in this than in D3.

Early Access Review
								I'm not typically compelled to write a review, but after playing about an hour and a half of Grim Dawn, I'm totally drawn in. I was a huge Titan Quest fan back in the day, and it's great to see this format of ARPG in top form.Grim Dawn is basically Titan Quest mixed with Bloodborne, and the combination is pretty intoxicating. It's a bit rough around the edges (some clunky UI and voice acting) but from the little time I've spent with the game, hits hard where it matters. Really satisfying combat, compelling classes and systems, fully realized world, and most importantly, controller support. What surprises me the most is that the game was made with some constrained resources and circumstances and with a relatively small team. Congrats to Crate and I hope this thing takes off. It's a really fascinating game.			"

												Complete list of reasons not to buy Grim Dawn:1.  You don't own a computer.2.  You don't like ARPG's.That's about it.  Everything about the game is solidly well done.  The skill trees feel like fun, meaningful upgrades.  The combat animations are rewarding, and I mean that turning something was once a large fanged monster into a pink mist with your big hammer feels like you'd want it to.  It's well polished.  Abilities do what they say they'll do.  Bugs probably exist, but I haven't experienced them.I played it for about 40 hours so months ago and felt like I got my money's worth, got bored and put it down.  What made me start playing it again?  Well, I re-installed Diablo 3 the other day, and it made me miss Grim Dawn.  Diablo 3 feels like a Zynga game compared to this.I suppose the question you're really asking is ""But how does it stack up against Path of Exile?""  And that's a reasonable question.  In terms of quality, I don't see where one is better than the other.  The meaningful difference is simply that while Path of Exile aims for a sandbox-y feeling emphasizing customization by randomizing absolutely everything, Grim Dawn takes a much more traditional, structured, approach.  I couldn't really say one is better, but I prefer Grim Dawn.Probably the only criticism I have the game doesn't really innovate at all.  You've a few classes with skill trees, you can dual class and use 2 skill trees, and there are shrines you can find that give you points to put in a secondary skill tree system.  There's loot with stats.  Better stats let you hit things harder and kill tougher things to get better loot to kill tougher things.  It's arguable how much that matters.  I want something more innovative, but I recognize that most attempts to re-invent the wheel end up wrecking it, so I can't really blame developers for just creating a really good standard wheel.So, the bottom line is:  I bought it, played it, and enjoyed it.  If you like ARPG's, you'll get your money's worth out of it.			"

								I can sense it; you've come here for asylum after getting man-handled and betrayed by other action rpgs, and you lie awake at night wondering, ""Will I ever love another action rpg the same way again?""  Don't lose hope, you WILL love again, and your love may blossom as soon as THIS VERY MOMENT.  After all, the night is always darkest before the dawn, and Grim Dawn will make you praise the sun once more!  What's good about Grim Dawn?  I'll try to avoid direct comparisons to other games in the genre, but here are some of Grim Dawn's highlights:+the game feels impactful.  Every strike against an enemy is accompanied by a satisfying thud, and ragdoll animations send enemies flying all over the screen in tiny bits+there is near infinite levels of customization.  The game awards you plenty of skill points, but not enough to to able to invest in a wide variety of skills.  You'll have to plan carefully and pick your favorites, which increases replayability.+There is a hardcore option.+There is multiplayer+There is a huge variety of loot.  +Making a functional build requires thought.  +crafting exists.  If you're having trouble finding the item you need, you can either craft one using a blueprint (which you can loot randomly), or by having the blacksmith craft a random piece of gear. +There are plenty of side areas to explore.  Exploring is almost always worth the time, since you may find unique bosses or Devotion Shrines which grant you points to use in your devotion skill tree.  +multiple difficulties are available to the player.  Every character you make progresses through normal, elite, and ultimate difficulty.  Once you beat the game on normal difficulty, you can play Elite difficulty with that character, and once you beat Elite, you can play Ultimate with that character.  +The world changes in meaningful ways as you play.  Your choices in sidequests have a lasting impact on your game, and aiding the npcs in town may cause them to treat you differently. +Factions exist in the game.  For example, the first settlement, ""Devil's Crossing"", will only tolerate your existence at first.  As you prove yourself to the settlers, you will gain access to new quests and new equipment sold only at that settlement.  By contrast, enemies also have factions.  The more that a specific enemy faction grows to loathe you, they'll throw tougher monsters at you. +the game is moddable+The plot is extremely good for a game of this genre. +Last, the developers of Grim Dawn are extremely receptive and transparent. So what are some of Grim Dawn's flaws? -drop rates for rarer items are low.  I personally like the droprate though.-Even on pc's with good specs, some people have framerate issues with lots of enemies.   Some users do not experience this issue.-stash space is limited.  If you are willing to mod, this is a non-issue.-it takes FOREVER to reach ""nemesis"" status with enemy factions (this is the highest status possible). Overall, the game is a solid 9/10.  If the developers can manage to further optimize the game and improve framerate, I would give it a solid 10/10			"

												Great game. Despite the tag, doesn't feel like an indie to me; everything is crisp and well made. I only have minor complaints, mostly issues of personal preference. Not actual flaws with the game design. I enjoy PoE and the Torchlights, but for my time Grim Dawn captures my attention far better.No cheap deaths or useless skill selections, unlike Torchlight 2. Has a variety of endgame builds and choice, unlike the narrow builds, unnecessary ""complexity,"" and illusion of choice in PoE, though you can definitely still screw up.I perused the negative reviews to see if there is anything I could address. Just about every one is pretty laughable. Two people with 1200+ hours giving negative ranty reviews rambling on about PoE. You had more than 50 full days played on a game before you realized it was bad? You paid $25 or less for 1200 hours of gameplay; even if I hated a game by 1200 hours, it was still compelling enough to keep me playing all that time and warrants a recommendation (unless the game is entirely different than when the player played, in which this game is not). Bunches of people complaining about enemy hero difficulty or energy regen problems who clearly couldn't be bothered to choose their skills a bit more consciously or stack some regen stats/skills, and not try to facetank hard hitting heroes with low defensive stats.All in all, I had a blast playing this ARPG and will come back to it for DLC and random playthroughs in the future. Best $15 I've spent on Steam in a while.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Crate Entertainment Publishers: Crate Entertainment Initial release: Feb 2016Genre: ARPG, Loot#Worth/NotWorth: #SortofWorthBSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): Every ARPG ever. Diablo/Victor Vran/Torchlight/Van Helsing and the like but namely Titan QuestExposition, Concurrence and SummationNow, Grim Dawn is an APRG. Should you not be familiar with this genre tag it basically equates to a dungeon crawler wherein you control one character, kill monsters then apply skill points into a specific tech tree or build of a certain style of play. All the while trying to land some, and please excuse my verbiage, “sick drops and hawt loot” in order to kill stronger enemies faster; rinse and repeat. Grim Dawn is from Crate Entertainment which is comprised of old members of the now defunct Iron Lore  Entertainment who are responsible for Titan Quest. The remnants of that system are still quite apparent.To be upfront, I'm slightly dismissive of this game because the way I see it. It's a very good “one of those”. And doesn't really do a ton to stick out above the rest. Here are some complaints in comparisonOften, the argument I hear against what I'd considered to be the most recent and prominent ARPG, Diablo III: Reapers of Souls is that it takes away proper character building. Allowing the changing of abilities and runes at will with no cost. Well, I'd argue that Grim Dawn does the very same; re-specing is basically of no cost (should you not posses the iron bits or aether crystals, it's nothing a few moments of grinding can't fix) and can be done at any time back at devils crossing which you can  return to at no cost and at will stay from Chthonic Rifts which are rare. An additional thing about classes is that in Grim Dawn the classes are chosen after starting a few levels into a new playthrough. Each class uses a spirit gauge regardless of what you decide to level into; Dual class or not. As an example, in Diablo 3 the Demon Hunter alone has 2 gauges to pull from and must be managed throughout play and style of build for the abilities chosen to be effective. This isn't a real complaint, it just is sort of antithetical to this idea of proper classes being something that you need to build and somehow the ability to change that build quickly negates it's enjoyability. Another thing is that is takes a very long time to even remotely level deeply into one class. I also had an issue and this is another small complaint but I feel it should be said, there is very little direction for objectives to be completed. By the end of the game I had so many side quests I was unable to locate and had leveled past that they were literally spilling off screen. A little direction would have gone a long way. But I digress, Grim Dawn is again a very good “one of those” so if ARPG's/Dungeon Crawlers aren't your thing this will not change your mind. However the game does have full gamepad support. So during your tenure of monster slaying you can get real lazy bones about it. Additionally, through the weapon sets and control schemes you can essentially have four hotbars at your disposal. The art style is very nice looking, the environments diverse. There is some faction play which is relatively interesting but doesn't hold a ton of interest in the long haul unless you become deeply involved with the narrative. It seemed very “not Diablo” to me. I wish there were more cut-scenes to be honest. They adopted this sort of Darkest Dungeon look, a sort of Gothic cartoon that I'd have loved to see more of. THE GISTGrim Dawn is a good game, I just don't think it's as inspired as it has been made out to be by Diablo 3 detractors. If you are looking for a Torchlight replacement that's a bit more “adult” and dark. This is it. Follow my curation for more "

Early Access Review
								I have been following this game for years, and have been playing since the first available released Alpha. It has come a long way, trekked through many zombie infested bugs. It has true potential to be a successor to the Titan Quest series. The Dev's are friendly and listen to most of the community and the community has been mostly awesome back. Dev's take bug reporting seriously and will remedy a BIG patch with each build update, unless there is a serious bug that breaks gameplay they will push one out fast asap. The game just keeps getting better and better as time goes. I dont play it all the time, i do go on a week like binge and take a break here and there. Yes everyone knows its a Diablo esque hack & slash loot game. I see no problem in that. Just lots of SHINIES! :DGameplay - Its improved and fantastic!Story - Is very interesting (probably matter of opinion because some spots can seem bland) with a good amount of lore in between. Soundtrack - its perfect, goes with the atmosphere of the game.Loot - is ever improving and some amazing stuff drops yet the loot table is not even 10% available at the current build!Classes - Whether main specing or dual specing its impressive to see what kinds of character builds we can come up with and what skill combos we can do to make our characters pretty unique.Multiplayer - OMG we have multiplayer! Its a little buggy at times but we have multiplayer! And its fun!P.S. Dont let your friends break the game making OP characters, my friends are no longer friends XD			"

												In early access I said this game was already a top contender for best ARPG sense Diablo 2's Lord of Destruction. Now well out of early access and looking at an expansion in the hopefully-not-too-distant future I can say without a doubt this is the best ARPG I have played. The loot system feels rewarding for a single player game without it being too easy to aquire loot or too hard to get the items you need. The lore is strong with a H.P. Lovecraft vibe and well written characters. Highly recommend this game to any fans of the ARPG genre or wanting to give ARPGs a try!			"

												Grim Dawn is an amazing ARPG game, built on the Titan Quest engine. With all the best elements of classic and newer ARPGs, such as Diablo 2, Path of Exile, and Torchlight. GD smartly avoids the tedious mechanics present in some games (PoE), and the way D3 forced you into certain builds if you wish to be viable at the highest difficulty. GD's class building system is extremely customizable, with its multi-class system and giant devotion tree on top of that. The class building possibilities are extreme and you will find yourself comming back again and again starting new classes and builds to try out. Hopefully finding a playstyle or 2 that suit you well, you will be in store for about 100hours of content, through 3 difficulties. So you will be playing through the same world / map at least 3 times. If this is a big problem for you, then some of the more randomized ARPG games might be better for you. Yet the designers of GD have done a good job at keeping it interesting and exciting, with higher chances of more Nemesis bosses spawning as you progress through the difficulties, and of course the LOOT you will find better shinier gear as you move up from normal - elite and finally ultimate where the majority of epics will be found. There is also a faction reputation system, allowing you to buy useful items from faction vendors as you gain reputation completing quests for them and killing their enemies.The loot is always an important factor for ARPGs and this is another area the devs have excelled at. The loot is varied and many pieces have their own usefull skills. Playing a soldier / demo / nightblade but want to summon pets to fight with you? You can do that, provided you find the right items. There is a crafting system which is the standard fair and includes an extrensive socketing system with components which you collect, combine and craft into more powerful components. Eventually culminating in what is called Relics, the most powerfull of which will take you many many hours to be able to complete and bring powerfull benefits to your character. It is my opinion that GD, is the gold standard for ARPG games, it's basically what fans of the classic Diablo 2 wanted out of Diablo 3 without the online-focus. While online play is definitely available and working in GD, it is a very fun game with a group of friends (4 player co-op). Beware though, the more players and effects on-screen the more powerfull of a computer you will need. Even with high-end hardware, I need to turn down the settings in-game when I plan on playing with friends who use a lot of special effects. (lighting, effects). I have also experienced very rare crashing, about 3 or 4 times in 150 hours and this only when I was multi-tasking having multiple other applications running. Other than that there are of course few others issues with the game, somewhat limited inventory space specifically early on. The over-abundance of trash loot, which if you are a compulsive looter might be annoying trying to vendor everything all the time with limited inventory. Certain bosses, feeling over-powering when playing specific class builds and certain crafting items / components seeming particularly hard to aquire. GD's faults overall are very minimal and easily over looked when compared to the fun gameplay and depth of content.Get this game if you are a fan of Torchlight, Diablo 2, Path of Exile. Consider passing on it if you already have and enjoy the game design of Diablo 3, as this isnt your casual friendly ARPG with class-based loot drop systems and speed-leveling. There is also a full expansion being developed if support for the game is a concern of yours, you can rest assured the devs are still at work and supporting this product. Mod support is also open, with many creators working on new classes, items and game balance for your customized desires.			"

Do you like Diablo I and II? So you know Grim Dawn. No? Well, you should!Before you begin read, let me say that I will make a short review. Long reviews take the pleasure of discovery!Unlike this review, Grim Dawn is a game that you know will be long. Despite the rapid introduction with you surviving the unexpected and forgetful, the game has long texts (some dubbed), with every detail of this world and explained dramatically motivated missions. This can scare the novice in ARPG's this kind. Especially the assembly of your character, the amount of power'ups, weapons, armor, spells, special attacks, is huge and as if this were not enough, your character does not have to follow a pre-established trend (classes, professions or races). They exist, of course, but you can choose more of a trend, or path, or simply, after all ready process, reallocate skill points. The possibilities are very varied. Same!The story of Grim Dawn, as the name warns us, is very hard and sad. Sometimes bothering. Demons, undead, natural evil forces, ancients spirits. All this seems to have destroyed life as we know. And the places look all destroyed and abandoned of human life. You are a kind of chosen who survived a possession experience. Now you help those who saved and you and earn your trust, making increasingly dangerous and difficult missions. There are rescue missions, destruction, killing or collecting.The art of GD is stunning and thorough. The scenarios you visit are very well looked after in every detail. The destruction and appearance of evil seen everywhere is clear and thoroughly planned, as the paths where you can walk and where you cannot. The models both the character as the enemies are incredibly well done. The items in addition to carefully designed, when equipped appear in the character changing their appearance. Amazing! The monster design itself draws attention to the variety of creatures.The sound is immersive and dense. The songs are wonderful! Some seem Orchestral other acoustic, or heavy metal guitars. All with a very somber mood. The effects are also first-rate. Do you recognize the kind of monster that is in an area without even seeing it. Some dialogues are voiced and the voices are good. Not fantastic, but they are good quality.The gameplay is as I said: Diablo II, mostly. The game takes you a lot with the assembly of the character and crafting. And loot, loot, loot and more loot! There are portals that facilitate their progress around the world, as you will want? Back a lot to places to sell loot and buy items. It's a huge world! Beautifully decorated for the apocalypse!A single default hanging over our heads in GD. The story is so dense and sad that sometimes becomes unattractive and you will skip some text or get a little bored.If you like big games and that make you go terrifying scenarios to look for loot, Grim Dawn is waiting for you!Art: 9/10      Sound: 9/10	        Gameplay: 8/10	       Fun: 8/10         Total: 8.5			"

												Just: Wow! I bought Grim Dawn last evening when I saw it first on Steam (didn't know it was in development and that there was an Early Access version), and now it's getting morning. 10 hours straight, that happened last to me when Diablo 2 came out.Great combat mechanics, good graphics (no D3 like cartoon style), interesting classes, class combos and skills, very nice level design, motivating reward mechanics, easy learning curve, good balance, never frustrating and simply fun. It's a 10/10 from my side ... I have no clue why this is less than €20.00, it already entertained me more than many of the so called ""AAA full price"" titles.			"

								Pure ARPG goodness and bliss. The game is like an onion with more and more features unlocked as you play. Before you know it, you have a very deep, engaging ARPG on your hands. The character progression rivals Path of Exile's and is better in some aspects. The builds are almost endless in scope so you won't see as much cookie cutter (though cookie cutter isn't necessarily a bad thing as long as there are other optitons - and, boy, are there options). The maps are huge and varied with as much to explore under ground as there is on the ground. The story is solid with actual choices that affect a lot of gameplay. There are even factions to grind rep with that give you access to gear and other helpful items. Have I mentioned the bounty board that each faction owns? Bounty boards give you access to more difficult quests without a lot of help from quest text that offer more xp and rewards. Think ""daily quests"" mixed in with the monster hunting from FF12. The best part? Crate is giving access to their builder which will allow player's to make their own enemies, maps, stories, items, dungeons, etc, basically increasing the lifespan and depth of an already endlessly deep experience. I cannot reccomend this game enough if you are a true APRG, dungeon diving			"

It's unreasonable to assume they're not going to be coming out with plenty more,  but what makes these games so awesome is the different unique items you can deck your character out with.

												TL/DR:Easily the best ARPG on the market today, and easily in my top favorites of all time.I give it a 10/10 - not something I do often. It's got a few minor flaws, but nothing I consider to seriiously detract from the game.Real review:What with this review having been originally written when the game was still in Early Access/Alpha days, I knew I would eventually need to update it. I chose to wait for 2 particular milestones:200 hours playedActually beat the main story.I originally put over 100 hours in between Alpha and Beta, and mostly set the game aside for a while after that, to allow myself the ability to return to it 'fresh' after the full release. My main character on release has cleared the main storyline, along with most of the side quests, tracked down every shrine in normal, etc. It's taken I think about 40 hours or so, and I tend to be a map-clearer, plus farm on occasion and get distracted.So, if you plan to obsessively full-clear the game once, you're looking at 30-60 hours of play depending on your play speed and style. IMO, that alone is a decent amount of play time for the price.For an ARPG, Grim Dawn has a fairly solid storyline, I mean, it's no story-driven JRPG or the like- but it's a little bit better than ""Hey look, BBEG, go kill it and save the world."" Followed by the expansion going ""Oh, look, even worse BBEG that we totally didn't know about, go re-save the world!""Without spoilers, or spending an hour explaining it, you start out an expendable goon being sent to your certain death to prove yourself to a small community of survivors. Stuff ensues, you find yourself in the middle of a war between otherworldly factions and eventually get sent to stop a ritual to summon an Elder God in to the world. Once you stop the ritual though, the war is still going. The immediate danger may be passed, but no rest for the wicked.They launched with 6 base classes, for a total of 21 possible classes. Each of the base classes plays similar to some classic ARPG fodder, but most have their own spin on it. Unlike Titan Quest, each of the base classes stands alone pretty well, for at least a while (eventually I suspect that you will start to suffer for sticking to 1 class, probably somewhere in the 40-60 range), and none of the class combinations feel supremely broken or underwhelming.There's a ton of room, both as far as storylines and in the world itself for expansions.They also have a faction system. In addition to the 2 BBEG factions, there's a number of additional lesser evil factions, and a few various survivor factions- some of whom are at odds with eachother. Lower reputation with the evil factions makes them spawn more bosses against you. Higher reputation with the survivor factions unlocks quests and unique items for purchase, plus discounts on wares from that faction. It's pretty simple, sure, but it adds another layer to the world.Original review follows:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The ARPG genre has evolved over the years. I was introduced to it in the days of Diablo, yes the original, and have beeen addicted ever since.I've played a good number of them, only a select few have grabbed me the way Diablo did. My top three of all time are Titan Quest, Diablo 2 and Sacred- in no particular order, I love them all for different reasons.While only in Alpha, Grim Dawn may find itself with a rare honor. Being named my favorite ARPG ever. I don't name something my 'favorite' lightly, because my mood may change, or there may be something this other one did better so I like it better for that. Grim Dawn is no exception, but the parts I do like are vast and done super well.Grim Dawn plays like Titan Quest, no surprise same people and same core engine. It's fast paced and chaotic, bodies fly everywhere. Unlike Titan Quest, it actually likes to challenge you, you run in to bosses that actually slow you down and make you rethink the ""run in and hit it until it dies"" strategy.The class system is definitely a throwback to Titan Quest, only improved. You select your first class when you ding 2, and at 10 you can select a second class. On launch there will be at least 5 masteries, which translates to 15 potential character options, and each one of those has several build options.Unlike Titan Quest though, in Grim Dawn your masteries are all complete classes and you do not NEED to take another to actually be able to play the game. It is balanced such that any combination is a viable build, and even most build options within each combination are viable.Loot, they've done away with the crappy 'broken' items, limiting it to only 'non magic' and better, which come in 5 flavors. Magic, Rare, Unique, Set, Legendary. Magic items have 1 or 2 enchantments on them, but can have really good enchantments, Rares have multiple enchantments but don't have the same maximum power as magic, sets and uniques are self explanatory to anyone who has played an ARPG, Legendary are basically uniques on crack.The world is one of my favorite parts of Grim Dawn. Victorian Post Apocalypse with an occasional light steampunk aesthetic. It's gritty, it's dirty, you feel like it's really a world that's been attacked and nearly destroyed. The dead are piled like they've been given up on, bodies are burned to prevent them from coming back, buildings are half destroyed. Survivors are taking refuge in a prison, because it's one of the most secure places left.The economy feels apocalyptic too, even basic items are expensive, and the currency is no longer gold, it's iron. A staple resource needed for many things. While the game has iron coins, I like to think of it as scrounging scrap bits of iron from those you defeat and trading that, coins are simply used because ""Iron junk"" is kinda an odd currency.There's a few minor issues with the game, but I'll wait to reserve judgement on the negatives until after the final game launches. In the mean time, I consider even the alpha alone to be well worth the $30 it costs. I backed it on Kickstarter for $85 and consider myself to have already gotten more than my money's worth out of it.			"

Early Access Review
								Genre - Fantasy/Steam Punk Action RPGI was put under peer pressure to buy this game as I couldn't see if it was worth it with Path of Exile on here, getting regular updates. However, I am glad I invested in the early access as it is different enough to be a whorthwhile purchase.I did a quick survey on the discussions page where people rated it against several other action RPGs. The general feeling was it was in most people's top 3, especially as everyone dislikes Diablo 3, which I actually enjoyed as a single player experience.You get more character customisation here than Diablo 3 but not the amount of Path of Exile. You pick one class and then later on pick another to make a hybrid. A simple but effective concept for making the character you choose. Although PoE Ascendecy is doing something similar now.It is fun to play single player and I haven't tried any multiplayer yet, but I don't tend to online with Action RPGs as you get too many loot grabbers.I think if you had the choice I would go PoE as it is a completed game and free, with cosmetic pay to look good options. If you want a new Action RPG to trial then your money won't be wasted here. This game has potential and I feel I will definately get my monies worth overtime, but whether it ends up in my top 3 Action RPGs is another matter...			"

												A lot of love was put into the development of this game and it shows. It offers the very best of the genre, providing fantastic build diversity and character development depth whilst also offering a satisfying set of mechanics and great combat - something that you must, up until this point, have chosen either one or the other in this genre.Plot is decent, if somewhat lacking in focus and general flow but it is better than most ARPGs. Writing however is great and the game really shines in the smaller stories it tells, which add in building this fantastic world.The biggest plus for me is the fact that you can play this game offline! No more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers killing off your HC characters and no more desync ruining your experience. I'm not the person who has played games like PoE or D3 competitively so the lack of a competitive scene does not effect me in any way so this is a BIG positive for me.My one criticism is that many skills are very similar to each other in playstyle (at least in the early game), and many skills just augment the basic attack which, to me personally, is very boring. However, the Devotion system does add a new dynamic to these skills and it does emphasise the minor differences between skills, so this criticism may be unjust.Also, modding tools are to be released so time will tell if a modding scene will exist but if it does, then any question of longevity will be eliminated.

								A promising ARPG that has set its sights at surpassing the Diablo franchise, offering the old-school ARPG formula and mixing it with new gimmicks such as Constitution (health regen based on how satiated you are), Devotion (another layer to character progression and building), Factions with the Reputation system and many more. The gothic setting, with a pinch of Wild West and post-apocalyptic atmosphere, appeals to my tastes much more than the mythologies presented in Titan Quest. It is still a bit rough around the edges (for example, the intro and ending cinematics are missing, the NPC's are not voiced, some bugs remain to be squashed and the overall balance of the game is not finite yet), but that won't stop this gem from reaching its full potential once the game exits EA in February next year.If you are a true fan of hack 'n slash approach to the ARPG genre, with a couple of innovations to freshen it up and a nicely crafted world to explore, and if you're aching for some loot hunting, then this is the game for you. Buy it and enjoy the best bang for your buck, you can thank me later.			"

Early Access Review
								I have never been compelled to write a review for any game and I have been playing pc games since the Commodore 64 came out.If you could take the good parts of the Diablo series, Sacred series and Titan Quest and combine it into one game you would get Grim Dawn.I have played over 1600 hours and still haven't scratched the surface yet. There are so many builds I want to test and gear to try out. It really is amazing what a small group of dedicated developers can make. Even though it's still early access the game is very polished.This game has grabbed me the way Diablo II did. And that was the last game I was truly addicted to. For me the biggest plus is replayability. Diablo III didn't have it (not knocking the game but replay value was low for me). As I stated I have 1600+ hours in and not even close to being bored or wanting to take a break yet.If you have enjoyed Diablo, Sacred, Titan Quest, Torchlight, PoE etc you will enjoy this game. And for $25 it's probably the best game investment you could make.			"

								Grim Gawn is very fun, and from a guy who didn't like other ARPG before ( Diablo 3, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing ), I think that means something.I'm not 100% sure about the setting of the game but basically, Aetherial came, ♥♥♥♥ happenned, end of the civilized world. Your character got posessed by Aetherials but, as the peoples of Devil's Crossing were about to hang you, the Aetherials left you alone, for some reason. So here you are, with mad powers and ♥♥♥♥♥, to save the day!You can level up your character in two different classes and each class have enough skill so you won't be able to get them all. This allow for a great customization of your character along with with the items that can help you improve your build even more.And one of the best thing in my opinion is that the stats system is not totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Your stats climb linearly with levels. The three main attribute are Physique for health, Cunning for physical damage and hit chances ( both yours and your ennemie's ) and Spirit for magic damage and energy. You'll probably end up maxing one or two but you'll have to find something in your build to make up for your lack of health, hit chances or energy.Hero Monsters are also something I thinks is very fun. They are like small bosses with unique name and design and most of them actually feel like they have an unique twist.On top of this, Grim Dawn is set up in a dark world with well done characters, complex backstory and factions, amazing areas to explore and secrets to discover. If you are into ARPG or want a new game with a nice dark setting, you should try this!			"

												I've been playing Diablo 2 for the past 3 or so weeks and then decided to spice things up by giving other ARPG games a try, and so I came back to Grim Dawn.Let's get one thing out of the way - I think Grim Dawn is a great game environment and story wise, it's a game I was expecting Diablo 3 to give us. Dark graphics with terrifying aspects, great and appropriate variation in music regarding areas and a great variation of character skill trees, splitting between them having it simple, yet complex at the same time, so you have the opportunity to create whoever you want, adapting to any playstyle with a lot of variation.The first 30 hours were fun, but at the same time, I was kinda peeved by the fact that gameplay/loot/leveling mechanic wise, it feels like a revamped Titan Quest game, which don't get me wrong, from the developers side it is good, they took inspiration from Titan Quest in that regard, seeing that it's way easier and a lot more adaptable to play, with more possibilities and flexible character creation, compared to a lot of other ARPG titles of it's time (Diablo 2 for example). I think that was the right choice, at the same time, it took me some time to look past that, seeing that they did keep a one con of the Titan Quest game, which is that once you have a set character at the middle game with the playstyle you were aiming for, you kill everything in sight, except for some high burst damage/tanky enemies that you either don't notice in the high numbers of enemies later on, or you just don't react quickly enough. Additionally, because of this you try to buff out one ""skill tree"" and just a few skills from it to have a good combo and rotation between them so you don't die. The issue with this is, if you are new to the game, you just wanna jump in and go on killing stuff while creating your character and don't take interest in any of the atmosphere they put so much effort in, you will get bored by level 30-50.My suggestion - try a different character, with a different/opposite approach and try getting yourself interested in the story, give it some time and play it with a new look and some fresh air, you will have fun with it.If you give this game a try and read the different pieces of lore, pay attention to the environment, story, characters, read dialog and so on, you will enjoy it and the ""Normal"" mode of the game is going to be a nice breeze through, after that I'm guessing you move on to the actually start of the game: farming items, trying out different skill trees, etc. (Haven't beaten the game yet, can't tell you.)Compared to let's say PoE - you're not as dependable on the community and it's not as much of a grind. Depending on what kind of ARPG enthusiast you are - casual, medium or hardcore player - you will find this game worth your time, unlike PoE, which is difficult to get into in my opinion and eventually just makes you want to give up, unless you are set on trying and retrying different gear/gem/skill sets and have the time to grind for them.In short, this is a great ARPG title, especially from indie devs, seeing that they took the inspiration and best qualities from our favorite titles. This is a game you have to appreciate in whole, otherwise - you won't enjoy it.			"

												I play a lot of ARPGs. Over the years, I've probably lost more time hack n' slashing than playing all other genres combined.That being said, Grim Dawn is fantastic.There's great build variety, choices to be made that effect the world, and piles of great loot. I would recommend this game to all fans of the genre, and anyone who likes RPGs in general.I need to wrap this up so I can go start all over again.			"

Early Access Review
								One of my favorite games in the genre.The soundtrack, the environment, the artstyle, everything about this game is dark and gritty. People are comparing it to Diablo 3, but this game doesn't take a page out of Blizzard's World of Warcraft artstyle that looks like it came straight out of a Disney cartoon. Instead it tries to show you a bleak world where there is little hope of a better tomorrow.The story isn't spoon-fed on a silver platter, but instead small notes you read along the way really set the tone of the game. SLIGHT SPOILER: It starts with a sense of mistery. You WANT to know what happened to fallen kingdoms, forgotten cities, destroyed families. The notes you read at the start only give you clues to the events that befell the world around you. It really grabs you and immerses you into the world (if you actually try rather than just mindlessly killing things). This isn't an ""MMO"" like Path of Exiles or Diablo 3 claim to be. Instead this is more of a single-player game WITH multiplayer elements (CO-OP). Even in its early state this game is worth the money since it already has a large amount of playable content that will keep you entertained.The gear is great, the abilities are fun, and combat is good. I did experience some crashing when playing in CO-OP though. Overall, if you like this genre and like the dark setting Diablo 2 had and enjoy a decent story then this is definitely a purchase you can't pass up.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is really awful...First of all it has loots. Many loots... I have found white, yellow, green and blue loots, so many that I got confused. I know that if blue and yellow loots fall in love they will make green loots, but what about the white ones? Are they just really old?Also, the game is very violent. I took a stroll just outside of Devils Crossing and a giant insect/bug came out of nowhere and threw up bile and acid in my face. At first I thought it was an accident, but whwn I moved to the side it turned and did it again... The only way to make him stop was to kill him. I'm a pacifist, and I just wanted to give the poor thing some pepto-bismol and get on with my questing. For some reason everyone in this game is very angry and just want to pick fights with you. You will also meet people that come out of the ground. I guess they are dead and has risen, but it's not very realistic... I have seen pictures of Jesus when he was resurrected, and he looks all handsome with wavy hair and a well kept beard - these guys looks like they fall off the ugly-tree and hit every branch on the way down.I have searched everywhere the game lets me so far, and I have yet to come across a unicorn. All games should have atleast one unicorn!! If you don't know, unicorns are awesome, they look just like horses - only they have a big shiny carrot on their forehead. Unicorns comes in all colors, and I would really like to find a pink one because pink is my most favorite color in the whole world. I guess unicorns will be coming in the last part of act three.There is also a lack of romance in this game. I play video games to escape reality, and in real life I'm not very good with the opposite(or the same) gender. Therefor I was disappointed when I couldn't find a special someone to share my nights with. This is also something I guess the devs will make available later.The game has some good things going for it though. Water for instance. If you squint really hard and look at water on your screen from about an inch away it looks almost wet. I also like the sound of rings falling from mobs as it reminds me of my cooking timer. I like food. This is good.Last, but not least - I would like to say that the game would benefit from some more customization. I would like my Demolishionist to sport a nice Lacrosse turtle-neck, slim fit jeans and perhaps some RayBans. None of these options are available. I found some helmet-thingy with sunglasses attached to it, but they looked more like protection a welder would use, nothing Prada about them.TLDR; Awesome game, just buy it and never look back!This is what Diablo III tried to be, and more!It's still in early access, there is no end-game, and yet it's the most fun I've had i years. I love this game.Can't wait to see it progress and mature. GOTY 2015 - easy.			"

								One of the Greatest Action RPGs ever. Kudos to the devs.Bundles the best elements of classics like Diablo 2 and Titan Quest into one awesome package.__ Good variation in character classes and skills. __ Infinite build possibilities. Dual class system , Items, componenets/enhancements , skills , and an alternate skill system called devotion really open up the possibilities to build a truly unique hero.__ Combat is meaty and challenging.__ Satisfying loot. __ Beautiful aesthetics and sound design. __ Modding support.__ Early Access done perfectly. The one thing I wish this game had , is Steam workshop integration so mods are easier to find and use.If you like aRPGs , just pick this up already.			"

								I played this game for over 1000 hours and it's still in early access!I beleive that the strenght-s of this game are :1.  Really good itemization --> Sure there is epics and eventually we will get legendary items but ""rare"" items also have a chance to be the best in the game with good affixes!!2.  Exploring is part of the game. In fact whether you want a specific component or a specific Monster Infrequent item or a specific challenge, there is specific location accross the world for them all!3. Build diversity! There is a lot of build diversity that WORKS! With the upcoming Shaman, this will be even better. And later on with the Expansion (which is assured from the Kick Starter!), it will add even more diversity / more masteries!4. Depth.  We can talk about the mechanic of the game, build diversity, or even the upcoming Devotion System which will add another layer of customisation for the skills!!! Yes this game as quite a nice lvl of depth and I like that!5. Rogue-like Dungeon. We got one yet, Step of Torment. But we can expect to have 2 others :D ... Also we will get a Survival mode which will send the players against increasingly difficult waves of monsters !!<3  Grim Dawn  :) "

								From someone who loves the ARPG genre, maybe too much, this is one of the best games out at the moment - even in early access.  The gear and character customization has much more depth than Diablo 3, but isn't as overbearing as Path of Exile. Three friends and I bought the early access and are having a great time running around, getting very interesting/exciting gear, and smashing enemies. The one who didn't like Diablo 3 at all loves this game. The one that really hates how complicated PoE is loves this game. For me, the one who likes them all... I love this game. Get it.			"

 Great ARPG, but with certian flaws.	 Crate entertaiment are the same guys behind Titan Quest, which was a love letter to D2, and so it Grim Dawn. Positives:+ Deep customization. Rivals PoE (Path of Exile) in terms on customizability.Level 2, you choose a class, level 10 you choose ANOTHER class, doubling your skills, ablities, and creativity.You also have another layer ontop of it, called DEVOTION, which is well thought out, 'cause it rewards you for exploration.DEVOTION is another big skill tree which adds passive skills ONTO your active skills.You can also add stat points onto your character. It's really dull, 'cause you only got 3 stat points and you get 1 stat point per level up.Physique (Health and armor)Cunning (Damage)Spirit (Magic damage and Mana) + Lots of replayablity.Your first playthrough will get you to level 40, but the level cap is 85, so you got lots to progress towards.Lengthy campaing consisting of 18-22 hours + Has co-op. Negatives: - Environment.Areas in this game can feel very samey, leading to repetition on long play sessions.""Oh, I'm in a green forest, oh I'm in cave, oh I am in another forest, oh I am in another cave, oh I am in a crypt,"" yadda yadda. - Optimization.Everyone has iffy frames on different kinds of builds, even mine 970 with 8350 chokes really hard, dips to 30's and 20's.This can be damaging to certain people who want to play 60+ at all times.Main culprit I can think of, could be that they are using same engine they used in Titan Quest (PathEngine) which is already old. TL;DR	Long and replayable ARPG with more customization than you could ever asked for, low side for having repetitious enivorments and enemy variety with ♥♥♥♥ poor optimization.Worth buying full price.

 Review of: Grim Dawn  ~ by Silvio  The successor to ""Diablo II"" I've been waiting for over a decade! Little overview for all you nice people reading:- 1) Overall- 2.1) Character-creation in Main-Menu- 2.2) Character-creation In-Game- 2.3) Character-Info In-Game & Difficulty- 3) Factions- 4) Recipes (also: Crafting)- 5) Story and Voice-Acting- 6) Conclusion 1) OVERALL: Now, what does this game have?For me, it's dark.Like Diablo II dark back in my childhood.From its ambience, the soundtracks, the graphics.When my character hits someone, it feels heavy. Like that ""I-connect-my-fist-with-that-monsters-face-violence"" heavy. 2.1) CHARACTER-CREATION IN MAIN-MENU: There is not a lot of selection going on when you first start the game up to create your character. Which isn't bad in my book. I'm not playing Skyrim here. Dis an ARPG yo!You can enter a name for your character, you can choose between male and female and if you want to go hardcore.If you go hardcore and get your character killed, you will be notified that ""You are dead"" and you will respond via button with ""Okay"". After that your character remains as a ghost on your character-list (not able to be played any further). 2.2) CHARACTER-CREATION IN-GAME: There might not be a lot of selection during the character-creation.But......damn.When it comes to choices how to develop your character? These developers hit the nail on the head! You have the freedom to choose between six classes/masteries:Soldier, Demolitionist, Occultist, Nightblade, Arcanist and Shaman.You need to put skillpoints into a mastery first, before you can access its skills. For every point put into a mastery, you get buffs for attributes, health and energy (da new/old-mana thing). You best look here for more in-depth information:http://grimcalc.com/ Exactly at level 10 you can choose a second class to complement your first choice. But that is optional and completely up to you! There are enough skills in just one class which want to be maxed out to cause devastation. You get 3 skillpoints for each level (just 2 at level 50 and on). Maxlevel currently is 85. But from what I understand (and I don't understand much - haven't enjoyed a lot of education) the developers want to create an expansion. So maxlevel might get a raise there. You get 1 Attribute Point for each level. Attributes are: Physique, Cunning and Spirit. The Items. DA ITEMS! They range from (in that order and in increasing rareness (that a word?)): White, yellow [magic], green [rare], blue [epic] and violet [legendary]. You can equip items in the following slots: Helmets, chest-armor, leg-armor, boots, bracers, shoulder-armor, belt, 2 rings, necklace, relics and ribbons. They can give you access to unique skills and you can add to them... Components. There are so much of them. It's like sand on a beach only with diamonds instead of sand. Every component is unique and again, they can give your character access to unique skills with which you can bust these monsters nuts in.For more depth about this topic best look here:https://gracefuldusk.appspot.com/items Devotion: As if picking two classes from six available ones were not enough, you can devote your character to certain paths. You can gain so called ""Devotion-Points"" by cleaning shrines. Once cleansed, you gain a point.I should note that you can set skill-/devotionpoints back for a price (Iron - the ingame currency) at a vendor. I found a lot of iron so I assume that's no issue. Only problem is, that you can't redistribute attribute points and no masteries/classes that you have already invested points in, since you can't respec the points put into a mastery. 2.3) CHARACTER-INFO IN-GAME & DIFFICULTY: The developers included a lot of information about your character that you can check upon at any time through your inventory/character-window. You will find it necessary. Especially when you hit the next difficult modes after ""normal"": Elite and Ultimate. With each rank of difficulty your character suffers from a 25% penalty to some resistances (resistances are: Fire, Cold, Lightning, Poison & Acid and Piercing, Bleeding, Vitality, Aether, Stun and Chaos).If you're playing on normal and find it to easy for your likings, because you're to pro for that ♥♥♥♥, you can switch to veteran mode. Harder enemies, more heroes, more loot!Vereran mode is not available on Elite- and Ultimate-Difficulty anymore however. It's veteran enough there, you power-hungry being. 3) FACTIONS: You can side with factions! There are eleven in total:- Aetherials [hostile by default]- Chthonians [hostile by default]- Conley's Gang [hostile by default]- Devil's Crossing [friendly by default]- Homestead [friendly by default]- Kymon's Chosen [hostile or friendly; depends on a choice in the game]- Order of Death's Vigil [hostile or friendly; depends on a choice in the game]- Rovers [friendly by default]- The Black Legion [friendly by default]- The Outcast [hostile or friendly; depends on a choice in the game]- Undead [hostile by default]If you're an enemy to a faction and gained enough hate (through killing members of that faction or fulfilling quests with factions hostile to them) a nemesis will spawn. These beings will blow your character away like a firecracker if you are not prepared. Now I might not have enjoyed a lot of education, but I have never met an enemy that powerful yet rewarding like a nemesis in a game!If you have gained enough trust with a faction, you can waddle-daddle to a ""faction-vendor"". He, she (or it) will sell items unique to them. Like... 4) RECIPES (also: CRAFTING): YUS!There are recipes in game. You played Titan Quest? You know what I mean!If not, let me explain:You find a recipe through farming (busting monsterheads in over and over) or through methods mentioned before.You read it and then its knowledge is saved forever. You can access it as often as you want. No real need to find it a second time.If you have the right ingredients (that you have to farm and gather first as well), you can craft whatever that nice and beautiful looking recipe promises you.At a smithy. Now theses NPC's have special bonuses unique to them. So wherever you craft your thing via recipe, these bonuses will be applied. 5) STORY AND VOICE-ACTING: The story is nice, I guess. The game is set in Victorian-times (for my defense > no education). I don't want to tell much (if you are even interested in the story at all) but you start as a ""Taken"". One being which's body has been invaded by a powerful spirit called an Aetherian. The ones who ruled the earth before they have been banished by the gods of the humans.And now......NAOW they want IT BACK!And it is up to YOU to stop them!But overall I have to say I enjoy the little notes you can find here and there. They add alot to the atmosphere and tell you how it came down to this apocalypse.The Voice-acting is nice. Main characters will speak their lines. Though most of them seem a little to silent for me. Might be just a problem on my end. So that's no minus there.Bit of a problem can be, that, if you are playing multiplayer, only one of you can talk to a character at one given time. So if one accepts a quest, it is not readable for you anymore. 6) CONCLUSION: Overall, I have to say my thanks to the developers here.Obviously my paid 24,99€ are not enough to compensate for the fun you have given me, so I wrote this review to tell people about what great of a gem you created with your dedicated work.Seriously, every punch I do ingame is like a massage for my soul. Whenever I had a stressful day, I just gonna play.Grim Dawn.			"

												Grim Dawn is a fantastic ARPG with a unique design and very interesting, almost lovecraftian, lore.While the game borrows heavily from the developers privious game, Titan Quest, Grim Dawn has added several new features and improved privious features, such as the new crafting through the Blacksmith. While the game is still in development, it may be too early to list any pros and cons with the game as issues are being fixed constantly. However, if the final act(s) of the game are anything like the first 2 then Grim Dawn would be a strong contender for the best ARPG of all time, along with Diablo 2 and Torchlight 2.			"

												Hello all and welcome to my review of Grim Dawn. This game is a third person aerial view action game where the object is to save the town/world from a menacing invasion or two. Like mostly all games of this style, there are four flavours of bad guys; your peons, which are there to die in droves, your lieutenants which soak up some damage, but are otherwise disposable, heroes which usually soak a lot of damage and dish more out but not extremely so, and bosses which both deal out and take a tremendous beating. When you level, besides the attributes you can increase Mastery level or skills. You have a limited amount of points (255); you might hear people whine that “I need more points for this build”. Ignore them; just realize that there is a budget in this game for your points, and that you can’t always get what you want. But if you try sometime, you just might find you get what you need.One thing I would like to point out if someone is interested in this game; there is no ‘right’ build nor is there a great need to find one. Certain skills are meant to work together with good synergy and you can choose a less-optimal skill selection, but if you want to play a certain style you can. For example, a ranged character is just as viable a character as a melee character. A ‘tank’ can play just as well as a ‘DPS’, if a bit slower at times (I’m assuming that you if know what a ‘tank’ is, you know this already).There are also many builds out there, “perfect” builds where “this build absolutely needs these 7 purple items of lvl 75 to work”; ignore these people. If a build requires Nemesis to work, it’s not a build. What I would recommend is have an idea of what you’re looking for in a game (do you want ranged or melee? High armour or high deflection/maneuverability? Slime and snails or puppy dogs’ tails? Thunder or lightning?) Most classes can do most things well enough that in Normal/Veteran you won’t be that put off. By the time you hit Elite, either you know what works, you can find out what does, or you make a new char and try that; it’s all good. I have played multi-player with friends and I find that quite fun and highly recommend it if possible. Pro’s:•	The ability to play how you want (within reason)•	Fast paced•	Lots of different bad-guy selection/abilitiesCon’s:•	In Elite/Ultimate, gear dependency increases and efficiency becomes more important•	Some skills are pointless (or ‘not as efficient’) to increase above one point•	Much higher requirements to get heavy armour than to get ‘magic’-type rings or amuletsOverall, I highly recommend this game. It’s not perfect, and there are things that could be done better, but it’s a fun game to play and I enjoy my time playing it. The first act is very good for easing someone into the game. The classes are all quite different and all provide something fun and exciting to try.			"

Early Access Review
								I waited until I had over 300 hours in the Early Access version of the game so I could give it a fair opinion. The game is excellent. Especially if you like ARPG's such as the Diablo series, Path of Exile, Titan Quest, Nox, etc. Fans of hack and slash RPG's will be more than satisfied with the purchase. There are now all 6 classes in the game as of Build 27 and each one has a distinct style of gameplay. I chose the Soldier for that old school sword and board melee feel and I couldn't be more than happy with my first character. First, the obvious comparisons to the other giants in the genre. The game feels a lot like Diablo 2 with the Diablo 3 improvements such as blacksmithing, heroes, nemesis mobs, etc. Whereas D3 was more of a go-faster, kill as fast as you can while hoping you have the resistances to avoid this chain of boss mobs and Path of Exile leans more toward competitive gameplay, Grim Dawn has that explore, kill, dirnk a  potion and continue feel of Diablo and D2. It also has larger acts and a loot system that rewards you often (and just enough) to help you build a character you are happy with much more quickly. There are also is a deep modification system that allows you to make your gear fit your gameplay style. I never felt like I would never get the gear to make a certain build and I did not have to follow a certain build to be able to finish certain content. Currently in Early Access the game is worth the purchase price. It is complete through ACT III and I experienced no crashes and no bugs that killed my immersion or frustrated my gameplay. The graphics are excellent for an ARPG with enviromental damage, destructive enviroments and spell effects. Plus the devlopers have promised more polish. While on the subject of the developer I would like to add that they have continously fulfilled their promises throughout development. Crate is a very small developer at this point and have been extemely transparent and communicative about the game. It is not a game you fear won't reach full release or continue to be supported with additional content.One thing I wanted to address in previous reviews I have read stated that there was no voice acting in the game. There is. While the quest and lore content is not voice acted you will hear the familiar, ""That skill is not ready."" and various shouts and chants from the enemies such as ""Kill the non-believer!"" throughout the game that make it feel fully complete. There are not hours and hours of lore and quest text so do not be daunted thinking you will spend more time reading than playing. It is a true hack and slash with multiple systems to modify gameplay that gamers have come to expect.As you can tell from the review I have been very happy with my purchase and if you can pick it up on sale it is even more worthy of a buy. Hidden areas, large game map, crafting, faction and reputation rewards (including quests), excellent loot and an interesting setting with highly varied mobs all combine to make it a worthy competitor to the other, more well-known ARPG's on the market right now.

												Titan Quest was better than Diablo 2 in many ways.Grim Dawn is better than Diablo 3 in almost every way. What gave me pause was how similar Grim Dawn is to the absolutely stellar Titan Quest. So after four hours or so in to the game, I looked up Crate Entertainment, the guys and gals behind Grim Dawn. Turns out that they're made up of a lot of the people behind Iron Lore, the company who did Titan Quest and Dawn of War: Soulstorm. Why is this relevant (besides me being happy that this gives me everything I love about Titan Quest)? Because with Grim Dawn it shows that these guys have done this before, and done it well with Titan Quest. Dawn of War shows that they are familiar with the Games Workshop IP. And this all ties in to the big statement as to why I love Grim Dawn:It's like Titan Quest and Warhammer Fantasy decided to mate to breed the perfect child. Is Grim Dawn perfect? No. Is it almost perfect as far as ARPG's go? Yes. I would even say that it is the better of them. It is much better than the Diablo games (I love those too, so this isn't bias), it is better than Titan Quest (the world feels more vibrant and steeped in history than even the historical-fantasy setting of it's predecesor) and it sure as hell beats out all of the other Diablo Clones I have placed since Diablo 1 came out.It follows the same formula, but I feel like it is better balanced, with a better setting, a cooler plotline, and much better skill/stat progression. And do also like how every stat is useful to every class. And thus far I like every skill I have unlocked.TR;DR: Buy this game. It blows Diablo 2 and 3 away, and is also better than it's ""predecessor"", Titan Quest.9/10, which is SOLID for an early access game. I cannot wait for the finished product.UPDATE: Now that the game is finished, and I have about 90 hours in the game, I can say that this game is an absolute gem.			"

Early Access Review
								From the people who brought you Titan Quest comes another great ARPG. It's currently in early access, but there's a lot to do in game, as they just released the first part of Act 3, and multiplayer was added a few patches ago. The first thing you will notice is how fun combat can be. A common issue in ARPGs is boring combat. As fun as Diablo 2 and PoE are, the combat can feel very boring. In Grim Dawn when you attack stuff you see the enemy corpse really take damage, you see the gore and the corpse fly off depending on what you hit them with. The sounds are also good quality which helps make each hit you do feel powerful and rewarding. With good combat, the return of Titan Quests unique skill system, and a dark world to explore, the game is very much worth buying even in early access. The devs are good about responding on the steam forums and their own, so you can easily follow the development as this goes towards release.			"

												this game is the ultimate games of ARPG genre, the dev combine all the good things in Diablo franchise, Torchlight, and Path of Exile and of course their own game Titan Quest, and makes a masterpiece in an ARPG history..GRIM DAWN..the Pros:+ Loot, Fight, Loot, and Loot...+ Dual Class with hundreds of posibilities+ huge world+ nice graphic, great atmosphere, great audio, ambiance+ hundreds of GAMEPLAY for a cheap games+ you can try many combination of build, and skill choices, and class+ HUGE replayability+ this is an AAA Games Quality (in a good way)+ HUGE array of Loot+ Great Single Player experience+ STABLE performance, smooth at @60fps with all setting maxed out in 1080p.this game set a new standards for ARPG genre, it's fresh, it's addictive, and promise a lot of gameplay hours with the huge map and the class combining feature greatly encouraging you to play it again and again with different way to play your hero..and this is the cons i think from this game:- Multiplayer servers is not that good if you into the multiplayer- our own character doesn't have a full voice- minimal customization to the character looks, we just given a gender option, lol ( but not a big deal, since the important things to see is the gear, not the look of her/his face :) )- the voice acting is not that good, but not bad.- this game is risked being monotonous and repetitive if you try too rush through and to the people who new at this genreoverall, i give this game rating95 / 100why? it is because the game is so content-rich, AAA style games with a CHEAP price..!NO NEED to wait it until SALE..BUY it right NOW..you wont regret it..it is indeed a MASTERPIECE..

												I sit in my office, sippin' a bourbon and smokin' a gasper, thinkin' about some hop-head I put in the slammer last night. He kept going on about a Mr. Grim. Said ""I might throw his keyster in the jug, but I'd get mine when Mr. Grim came knockin' around."" Well I gave him a good bit a chin music for throwin' around empty threats, and he clammed right up. But something wasn't right, sure some snowed-out dopester's usually on about some crazy malarky any time I pick 'em up. This felt different, and it was making me sweat, so I decide to make a trip back over to the joint, see what he's on about. Just as I drain my glass and flick my butt in the ash tray, this leggy dame walks through the door like she's giving somebody a tour of the place. I ask her if she'd heard a knockin' but she puts out her hand and introduces herself, in that self-assured way of a girlie who comes from money. She says her name is Dawn, and she has a case for me. I say I ain't taking cases right now, my library's full-up and until I shut some of them up, I ain't handling any more. She ignores me again and starts chinning about this supposed case she's got.  I'm annoyed but I figure I'll tip another one down, so I pour myself another whiskey. I ain't much hearing her as it's the usual talking about her husband. I assume the cat's cheatin' on the broad or playing the Bruno with her, knocking her around, and she won't have it anymore. That's nine out of ten women who walk through my door anyhow. But it's the opposite. She's complainin' about she loves him so much and he just won't let her go. So I interrupt, saying ""Doll, I don't hear a problem here, you're acting like pulling the Dutch act, why? 'Cause you love a 'fella too much?""But she says she don't wanna love him so much, there ain't else she can think about and everyone who meets him is the same way. She wants me to pop him. I shake my head at her going all goofy on me. Just when you think you met the craziest broad in town, some nut goes and ups her. I'm about to go tell her to climb up her thumb when she slips in the cat's name, ""Mr. Grim."" I nearly flop off my wheels. ""How's that,"" I reply. And she says it again, ""Mr. Grim, surely you've heard of him, he's running the new game in town."" Well, I tell her spit it out about the bird and she does. Telling me when you meet him you start out weak, but he builds you up in whatever way you want. You wanna learn to build things? He's got that. You wanna learn to shoot? Fight? Even give someone the old Harlem Sunset,  he'll show you that too. But you have to work for it, you've gotta complete jobs for him, but it's worth the reward, and when you wanna stop, he'll let you, but only because he knows you'll be back for more. He's running all the people in this town, and apparently I'm next. Well, that convinced me. I gotta find this trouble boy before he finds me. I nod to the broad, grab my coat and my heater and take it on the heel and toe. I knew this one would be different. This Grim Dawn case was going to consume me for god knows how long.11/10 Would hard-boil again.If you liked this review, please check out my other steam reviews "

												****Review summary at the end****I bought Grim Dawn about a year ago, when it was in Early Access. I played it for a few hours, but didn't give it enough time to realize the beauty hidden underneath the upgraded Titanquest game engine.Because, up to this point, Path of Exile has been my absolute favorite ARPG, I follow ZiggyD on YouTube. He posted a video about how the game was just about to be fully released in a couple days, and recommended the game for people who like PoE and ARPGs in general, so, remembering that I had the game in my library, I figured I would actually give it a real shot this time.A few hours in, and I realized this game had a lot of potential. About 43 hours later, I'm now realizing this game is incredible. One of the things that bugged me about the game initially was how my character movement sort of felt like I was gliding over the ground, instead of actually being affected by gravity like someone in real life. It's the same phenomenon you can experience in Bethesda games like Fallout 3 and Skyrim, if you zoom out to third person (haven't played F4 so I don't know whether this has changed). However, this is a very minor misgiving that I quickly got over. I soon realized that the game has a lot of other really, really good things to enjoy about it, and truth be told, the engine ain't all that bad. In fact, I think they did a great job on the lighting and some of the particle effects in the game, especially the blood, vitality, and chaos effects.Enough graphics talk, though!The action does feel very good, and it doesn't take long for your character to start feeling powerful. I feel like Path of Exile struggles with this. While maybe not as pronounced as Diablo 3, Grim Dawn does have ragdoll physics and great sound effects to make combat very enjoyable. There are also nice additions like combat numbers that aren't in PoE.The class system is fantastic - you'll be able to choose a primary class at level 2, and then at level 10 you'll choose your secondary class. You get to combine two of the six classes in the game. Initially, this doesn't sound groundbreaking, but the skill trees for each class have so many different options that it opens up an incredible amount of builds that are possible! I've only made 2 characters so far (one of which was my first one, a year ago), only one of which I really count, so I can't wait to try out some amazing builds!I have only completed normal difficulty so far, but one thing I love about this game is how I have been able to experiment liberally with my build, without being severely punished for doing so. I feel like Diablo 3 makes builds completely trivial, while on the other hand Path of Exile has a ton of amazing build options, but is harshly unforgiving if you make a mistake with your build.Grim Dawn (again, so far - because I haven't played the second two difficulties) strikes the perfect balance between the these two extremes by adding a small cost to each point you refund in your skill tree. This gives you the ability to experiment, but doesn't trivialize character builds by just letting you swap them out whenever you want.Another thing the game has going for it is the exploration. Normally with ARPGs, I reach the endgame quite quickly and start the usual grind. It's to be expected that you'll be grinding for gear in this genre. However, I feel like I get burned out leveling new characters quickly these days in ARPGs. Maybe this is my own fault, but a lot of times there just isn't much reason to explore, so it becomes a race to endgame.In Grim Dawn, the game gives you great reason to explore every nook and cranny, because there are actually secret areas that spawn randomly. These areas may even contain questgivers and new hero monsters to fight, and they must be found by searching around the map for hidden walls and other places that are not indicated by the map. This really makes the leveling process enjoyable, and it gives you a reason to explore the game!The loot is also great. I feel like they found the right balance between frequency and rarity. Fun loot drops all the time, but not so much that it isn't exciting anymore.Summary:Visuals: 8/10Sound: 8/10Visceral-ness of combat/Character combat feel: 9/10Lore: 8/10Class system: 9/10Loot system: 9/10Replayability: 10/10Overall value/bang for your buck: Off the charts!If you like action RPGs, stop thinking and go buy it!

												TL;DRIf you've ever enjoyed playing similar games, then you'll love this. It follows the formula in a fairly straightforward manner, but it's impeccably refined – one of the best, in my opinion.My bullsh*t:I'd had my eye on this game for a couple of years, frankly, but the thought of playing an ARPG in delayed, unpolished segments seemed miserable. After reading that the game was 'content complete' with the release of Act 4, I decided to finally dive in (it was also on sale, which was sweet).To be clear, I love this genre. Diablo, Titan Quest, Torchlight. Loved 'em all. Hell, I even like Diablo 3 (because I think its streamlined nature makes it an amazing local co-op console port, but I suppose that's besides the point). All of this taken into consideration, Grim Dawn, as an all-round experience, is better than some of the most prolific titles of the genre.To start, it offers a wonderfully refined balance between the min-maxing ARGPs of old and the mash-to-win fair of today: the gameplay is modern(ish), character-building is back-to-formula without being too overbearing (respecs are cheap, and the dual-class system, in addition to being damned fun, provides a lot of versatility), and the questing is considerably deep for the genre (a blend of story missions, side quests, and bounties – there's always something to do). The late-game also incorporates Factions, which adds another layer of (admittedly shallow but nonetheless enjoyable) immersion – and a good amount of gear, at that.To the benefit of its well-crafted content, level progression is such that you never find yourself grinding, and gear progression is perfectly consistent, even at later levels.  As a result, the game plays fluidly, offering us junkies a true-to-form “Wiki-this” experience whilst maintaining an almost action-adventure pace. This is in part due to the impressive amount of content, which keeps the game from ever feeling wanting for ideas / challenges. Like all ARPGs, the progression is certainly linear, but this game does a better job than most at making its limitations unnoticeable.  Moving on to the artsy side of things, Grim Dawn looks pretty great. Others have likened the tone and art direction to Diablo (going so far as to label it a “true successor” to the series), but I think it's really carved a style of its own. Unlike other games, Grim Dawn never seems overtly “fantastic” - even as you're having your kneecaps mauled by an outer-dimensional being (borrowed straight from the pages of Lovecraft, mind you). As a result, the early, critter-laden environments contrast brilliantly with some of the wierder sh*t down the line. This grounded atmosphere allows the escalating doom-and-gloom to feel genuinely threatening, which is something I haven't felt since my first encounter with D2; however, unlike the Diablo series, I can't say the game ever felt “scary” at any point. Dark, for sure, but never scary.In line with the game's intriguing atmosphere, there is a clear effort invested in the environments (evidenced by the player's ability to rotate the camera 360 degrees – a rarely utilized but none the less cool and welcome feature). As a result, the environments never feel paint-by-numbers or overtly themed (looking at you, Torchlight 2), and the game does away with the randomly-generated levels of yore that, while intended to keep things ""fresh,"" really just end up being a pain in the ♥♥♥. The only bit that I'm not terribly impressed with are the characters, themselves. Player models, as well as most other NPC humans in the game, just don't look that great. Passable, but not great. What's more, the gear, perhaps in keeping with the game's relatively down-to-earth aesthetic, just never pops or impresses the way it does in other titles (a disappointing lack of dishwasher-sized pauldrons, for certain), and because of the necessary mish-mashing brought on by the dual-class system, there's never much visual differentiation between classes.I know that nobody really reads this crap beyond the “buy it” part, so I'll go ahead and close this off with the usual: 11/10, would die in aetherial fire again. But seriously, if you're a fan of the genre, this is worth a look, especially when it's on sale. It's business as usual, no doubt, but it does everything just a little bit better.Stray observations:Other downsides? Maybe crafting. Crafting is always either a miserable grind (every title but Diablo 3) or an oft-disappointing time-sink (Diablo 3), but this game manages to make it altogether irrelevant, minus a few relics. Keep in mind, it isn't necessarily 'bad,' but it's the one thing that feels sort of phoned in.Also, I'll admit that I haven't dabbled in the multiplayer AT ALL, and I've read less than favorable reviews regarding this aspect of the game, so if you're looking for a more social experience, I'd recommend checking out Path of Exile (which, despite being free-to-play, is excellent in its own right).

												Early Access combined with Indie developers prove they can hold their own against the heavy-weights.  Grim Dawn is a great ARPG, akin to Diablo, Torchlight, Titan Quest and Path of Exile.It is grittier than Torchlight, more refined than Titan Quest, less buggy than Path of Exile and more customisable than Diablo 3. It's good. Really good, even for an Early Access title. If you have even the slightest interest in the genre I highly recommend it.Jimbo Rating: 9/10			"

Early Access Review
								Without a doubt one of the best dungeon crawlers available!  This game is still in its very early alpha version, but everything that made Titan Quest great screams out bigger and bolder in GRIM DAWN.  It has been a long time where a game has pulled me in with its story and its ambience, from the momnet you step foot in Cairn you are part of the story, its fantastic!  The multiplayer is set to drop in early 2014 along with the second act but don't let that deter you! This is a brilliant title already and its only going to get better! if you are still hating on the epic disaster that was diablo 3 and need something to scrath that dungeon crawler itch then get in now and become part of the community, I don't normally do these review things but everyone on my friends list needs to get this game it is AWESOME!

												Bought this game on sale and it's amazing.. totaly worht the price. So here are my pros and cons:Pros:- maps are just HUGE exploring them takes time- if you played Titanquest you will enjoy this to :)- you can combine classes - you can combine skills with the 'god powers'- ther's a LOT of contetn- some equipemnt offers usable and passive skills to..- i like the post apo tuch + magick and hordes of nasty creatures- you can shoot guns :D- i enjoy the combat , you rush with the 2h-sword into the enemy horde casting lighting bolts all over the place and enjoy the flying body parts all over the area :)- i like the graphics , the developers did a nice job creating post apo environment + the little details ... love it- you can craft stuff- you can upgrade your base of operations doing quests and helping the survivors- you can play this olnine Cons:- there are some map glitches like  geting stuck in the middle of the stairs for no reason- i do not like the animated avatars in conversations they are terrible, would look better if they were just drawn- the enormous maps + clicking all over makes my hand hurt :P-  due to the enormous maps i don't like the diablo like save system implemented here- the bounty questst are kinda boring and do not offer anything special atm.

												Awesome game!! I won't compare it to all the titles that are getting tossed around in here but if you want a fun hack and slash ARPG this game will not disappoint. Great character development, loads of items, and so many things to kill!! Another big pro for me was the low price, very reasonable :)10/10			"

Early Access Review
								As it stands, in Early Access, Grim Dawn is full of potential to be one of the best ARPGs.  Allow me to give a brief history of the development team, which is comprised of seven developers and some of those developers are former Titan Quest employees.  Since we are on the subject of Titan Quest, please keep in mind that because you may have not liked Titan Quest, that does not mean that you will not like Grim Dawn.  Grim Dawn is not Titan Quest reskinned.  Repeat:  Grim Dawn is NOT Titan Quest reskinned.  It is a completely different action-RPG unlike Titan Quest.  The only similarity that they share is the fact that Grim Dawn runs on a heavily modified version of the Titan Quest engine.  Grim Dawn captures the spirit of the setting with excellent mood, tone, and atmosphere. From the lush marshlands overcome by the walking dead, to the dark, damp caves of the lowering isle, accompanied by the tactful display of gore among the hollowing darkness, Grim dawn sets the mood and tone as you traverse through the hauntingly well-designed maps.  The themes of Grim Dawn consist of medieval and steam punk inspirations that lends to the game's attitude and style.  Whether you're a fan of Torchlight 2, or the fantasy-like Diablo series, you'll find a nice blend of attractive themes that cater to the action-RPG genre crowd.  Weapons and artilery like muskets to shields are within these premises and stick well to the underlying themes.  Given the chance, the player can dual wield a shield with a musket and cause mayhem while taking a physical beating by a horde of monsters using your shield.  The combat sticks to the same ARPG formula that we have grown to appreciate and love from the genre.  Why ruin an established formula that works?  Grim Dawn is just that.  It is not attempting to claim new innovations and ideas.  At its core, it sticks purely to the ARPG formula.  The player can invest points into attributes and skills as they rank up.  The skills is represented in a horizontal matrix intead of the typical ""tree"" design.  This allows you to really customize your character the way you want without making faltering mistakes, yet it allows you to adjust accordingly to your playstyle.  Didn't like the ""firestrike"" ability?  Invest horizontally in another branch of skills and don't waste any more of your points.  When you use an attribute or skill point, you have a chance to ""undo points"" before you finalize it.The musical score in Grim Dawn is rhythmic and it underscores the layered aspects of the game in spectacular fashion.  Any composer and or musical artist that can utilize an electric guitar to capture the sense of dread on a soundtrack and quickly lift you up by giving the player hope in a frenzy of battles has my vote and wallet.  The soundtrack is beautiful and unlike anything I have heard of before in a video game.  Instead, it uses a nice blend of many instruments over the overly used ""epic score"" or immediate type of music that typically tries to replicate an adrenaline-like feeling.  The soundtrack is excellent.The screenshots and video gameplay that have been released for Grim Dawn does not do it any justice.  The graphics and visuals are great.  With all of the video options turned up, you're getting a crisp-looking game with a rich amount of detail.  The video options consists of several high and very high settings (on maximum settings).  Based on this, you know that the developers are pushing the graphics as far as they could on this specific engine.  You won't be disappointed with the aesthethics, considering it was one of the aspects that I was little concerned about, although not the most important.  You can breathe easier knowing that the game looks really great on max settings.  There is are no concerns in this department.Despite being in Early Access, Grim Dawn has a ton of potential to become one of the best ARPGs around.  You can really tell that a lot of work, heart, and passion went into this game's development.  It truly shows in a product that is not even finished yet.  Imagine when it is complete.  I have played Diablo 3, Path of Exile, Torchlight 2 (which I think is the best ARPG to date as a finished product), and other action-RPG, dungeon crawlers and I honestly believe that Grim Dawn has the potential to best these video games in the genre.

												Not many A-RPGs are being made these days and out of the few available, not many are worth mentioning. I have played most big titles these past years (Diablo III, Path of Exile, Titan Quest, Torchlight I&II, Grim Dawn...) but have been able to stick to only two of them over the years: Path of Exile and Grim Dawn.What I like about Grim Dawn:- It's playable without an internet connection which means no lag and no disconnects.- The campaign is pretty long- The classes are interesting enough to provide plenty of replayability- The gameplay mechanics are pretty solid (not as complicated as Path of Exile but still allowing plenty of customization).- Crucible expansion that finally offers an alternative to playing the campaign over and over again.What I dislike about Grim Dawn:- No real incentive to play multiplayer- The campaign is too long and the game can get boring when playing higher difficulties.- The crucible expansion could have been so much more exciting and is getting boring quickly. - Graphics could be a lot better given the technology we have these days and that the game is mainly offline.In a nutshell, Grim Dawn is a dark themed game with a long campaign. The game mechanics and controls are good and the game was mostly designed for offline solo gameplay, although multiplayer is available via LAN / internet. The skills / attribute system is decent but the devotion system is what made the game more interesting. PVP is, like in all ARPGs, pretty pointless. I love traditional C-RPGs so it's hard for me to love a game that doesn't really have a rich storyline and well-developed characters but the gameplay is interesting enough to keep you addicted for a while. I've played GD for about 700-800 hours over the years and the only regret I have is that the Devs could have made the crucible DLC a lot better and the animations / spells could use some eye-candy given that the game is played mostly offline. If you like laid back solo gameplay and don't want to get a headache, Grim dawn is probably what you're looking for. If you like number crunching, optimization and endless possibilities, then I recommend Path of Exile.			"

Early Access Review
								A great Diablo-like, in the vein of Titan Quest. It follows genre conventions pretty closely despite all the prior talk of the open world and faction system - it is separated into discrete, linear acts much like D2, and the factions are so far more of an afterthought than a central game mechanic. Despite that, it's a lot of fun to play if you're into the genre - combat feels good, and the staggering amount of options you're given for how to build your character give it a lot replay value. Like in D2, some items offer you unique abilities that you can base entire builds around, and loot in general plays a big part in hinting at spurring new playthroughs. If you're like me, it's not rare to find a rare item and have your mind immediately start to consider how its unique bonuses could be ridiculously abused with the proper build.I'd highly recommend it if you like the feeling of your character getting stronger, the feeling of finding sweet loot and the feeling of taking out huge crowds of angry monsters in ever more efficient and spectacular ways. It's a bit easy to begin with, but that at least offers you freedom to experiment - and the game is fully moddable, to boot. I'd heartily recommend this.			"

												Since comparisons to Diablo 3 are inevitable, I'll just give my two cents about how I feel on the matter. Just note that I play both games exclusively on hardcore.Diablo 3's fun is in the crazy power fantasy of sets and legendary powers. All of your time is spent at level cap maxing out gear and attempting that next Greater Rift. Unfortunately if you want to stay competitive you'll probably have to take a build from the internet.Grim Dawn's fun is all about figuring out a new build with each new character. I never felt the need to find a build online because the game isn't about pushing leaderboards. I feel that the game really rewards people who like to min/max but don't want to get all their builds from the internet.Grim Dawn really is a very different game from D3, but I enjoy both. Do you play a little D3 each season and get bored two weeks in? Afterward return to Grim Dawn for more build experiments and tinkering. To me the games work very well in tandem.			"

								First heard about this game back when I was hooked on playing Diablo. I saw five minutes of it and thought it was just a clone.

								I've always been a big fan of hack'n slash games: Torchlight II, Diablo 3, Titan Quest, Path of Exile, Van Helsing and so on. I can assure you that Grim Dawn is superior to most of them. Despite of still being in early access, this game is solid and already has a dozen of well-designed game mechanics like crafting, factions, and multiple choices quests, which is rarely seen in ARPGs.Pros:+ post-apocalypse Victorian world! SLAY ZOMBIES WITH SWORD AND REVOLVER BAM BAM BAM!!+ 6 different skill trees, mix any two of them to according to your playstyle.+ challenging and rewarding at the same time.+ character development system is free and interesting, and it's not as complicated as Path of Exile's.+ the atmosphere and artstyle is perfect and very immersive. Cons:- it's still in early access (though nearly completed!)- no randomized mapThe game definitely worths $24.99. If you are interested in it, buy it now to support their 8-member indie studio.			"

												I've been playing this for months now in early release.  The developers have always been spot on honest throughout the process.  If they didn't feel the next chapter was ready, they didn't push it out period.  Such a refreshing change.  They didn't rush the development and didn't produce a turd (*cough* Unity and Arkahm Knight *cough*)  The class system is a ton of fun to just tinker with and, as many others have already said, doesn't leave you feeling crippled for choices you make.  Loot drops are satisfying on a whole, gear sets are out there to grind for, bosses to beat repeatedly, and new random ""elites"" pop up more and more in the regular world as you progress and ""earn"" faction hate from undead and others.  So many options and so much flexibility leave this such a pile of good time to play.			"

												This is not Diablo 3 and it is its best point ever.D3 where everything is streamlined, you are garantee to have loots for your class and chances for dropping lengedaries are fairly reccurent. Grim Dawn doesn't do that.It's back to the roots of Diablo2 where you WILL collect tons of crap but suddenly get super excited that you droped a specific loot. You will hoard tons of stuff for your other characters ""just in case"".Also, a point I love above all, I don't freaking have to be connected to Internet to play. It helps for Steam Cloud save, but it's by far not mandatory. You won't have game server crash on you because it's unstable, you won't have your instance suddenly go poof while playing because the lag spike.This is a game for the ppl who liked D2 and disliked what D3 had become.Plus, multiclassing is quite fun, there are 5 classes and you can mix and match 2 of them. Wanna play a summoner tanker ? Go ahead ! A master of the arcane shamanist ? Sure ! Is all build optimal ? Nope but still you can go and have good 'ol fun with them.			"

Grim Dawn is an excellent addition to the Diablo genre. In fact, I definately prefer this to the Diablo and Torchlight series. The whole thing is very polished and creates an overall really great playing experience. The universe that Grim Dawn is set in is really cool and definately has me and my wife hooked. For those that are not familiar, games in this genre basically boil down to grinding for XP and better loot. It's very fun. You crush a dungeon and then upgrade your stuff. The underlying premise is that simple.Pros:+Great universe with metric tons of lore and personality+Everything is very high quality - from the music to the artwork to the game balance (which can make-or-break games like these)+The controller support is awesome+I love being able to multiclass; it breathes so much more replayability into it+I love all the graphics settings - I can play it on my gaming rig in all of its splendor, or on my laptop and still get smooth play+The new DLC is fantastic and even adds more replayability+The user interface is well done; there is a bit of a learning curve for any game like this, but that curve is definately reduced with the intuitive interface+Multiplayer is super easy to set up and a lot of fun+Super cheap for the quality and valueCons:-Some of the voice acting is 'meh', but honestly, just the fact that they have voice acting at all is bonus to me-Yeah it is grindy; all games in this game areIf you are fan of Diablo-esque games, this is a no-brainer.

As a arpg fan you MUST buy Grim Dawn !And even if you're not ! :)I play GD for quite a while now and I must say I'm enjoying it since the fisrt day, even if at that time the max level was 15 !I always felt the great potential of the game and Crate, an eight guys team with some Iron Lore Entertainment veterans (Titan Quest dev), never dissapointed my hopes and beliefs. Those guys know their works and they always interacting with the community since the begining of the development. Results ? Even in Early Acces, GD is more polished than lot of released games (unfortunately) : Mature, dark and beautiful, the world of Cairn is a wonderful place to hoard your lootsFive very nice classes with great synergies allowed by the dual class system (check the  skilltree [grimcalc.com])a little rpg aspect with some consequences to your choicesa very insterresting Faction system that will start to shine in the next buil (b25)a crafting system that's getting deeper and deeper since the begining with a recipes based crafting for equipment and consumablesa great lore with a variety of monsters and numerous hero monstersthe modding tools coming at release will increase the game longevity... maybe a new ""Lilith"" will come !the game is FUN ! :)and it will be even more fun at release !The only cons for me is the limited stash tabs (4). For hoarder like me it might be frustrating... but mods will save our loots !Grim Dawn took the best of Titan Quest and Diablo serie and add a lot of great additions that make it mandatory in your games collection ! So don't hesitate and help the Crate team because they deserve it. Really.""You are one such individual. Blessed, or perhaps cursed, by the touch of Aetherial influence, you have powers and strength beyond that of normal men. It is now up to you to take this fearsome potential and use it against the enemies of humanity. Will you be the one to save Cairn from its grim fate?

								Short review: Three thumbs up!Long review: Polished and approachable even in Early Access. All the possible combinations of skills and gear make this a highly replayable action RPG even with its linear storyline. The way the monster levels are handled you can easily go back to previously visited areas to level up your character (I hesitate to use ""grind"" as it doesn't feel like that) without getting bored  because you're too overpowered, and they have thrown in a few optional elite areas which you can visit to really test your mettle (and build).Feedback from fans and players has resulted in tweaks here and there, especially when it comes to balancing the skills. There is some work needed in that department still, but nothing game-breaking, especially not if you're a pretty average ARPG player like me.The classes are interesting and have varied skill sets. You can combine two or stay true to one for as long as you like. Thanks to the stash system you can easily transfer gear from one character to another, and you can augment your equipment so you have more control over how they function. Players of Titan Quest will of course be familiar with this (improved) system.You will get more than expected for the Early Access price (and with 50% off it's a steal) and they are constantly improving and adding more content. An experienced development team I was more than happy to support on Kickstarter; a gamble which paid off in abundance and the game's not even released yet.			"

												After six years of waiting, four of those since a successful Kickstarter, I find myself asking; was it worth it? Yes. Yes it was. I thoroughly enjoyed my 80hrs romp through the grim gritty post apocalyptic hell that was Grim Dawn :D This was pretty much everything I ever wanted from an aRPG .. Loot. Loot. More Loot. Made by some of the same developers of the legendary Titan Quest, it's not hard to understand why they managed to get the formula down so well, making the experience a true joy to play through and not just an arduous, dull, slog. The visuals were nice, not exactly CryEngine levels of pretty but the art design and overall atmosphere was delicious, and the audio was really good too - though the VA was a bit hit and miss at times. Tons of quests, near infinite replayability due to the Bounty system, and with six classes that can be multiclasses to create more combinations, there's always something to play for. Everything that made Titan Quest great has been improved, in my opinion, most especially the overall feel and weight of combat.My only serious laments would be the frankly appalling performance mid/late game, sadly caused by the aeons old engine being hamstrung with its legendarily bad multicore performance (100% on core0, 0-15% on cores 1-3) and a small dev team without the ability or resources to really pump into optimisation. My system is no slouch, being a 4Ghz i5 2500k and a GTX780, but the framerate dropped down to mid 20s during heavy combat and that is simply unacceptable. Sadly the Steam build also plays host to some nasty anti-piracy ""triggers"" that the devs put in, despite the fact that they're also releasing DRM-free builds on competing services.Lastly, the ending, or lackthere of, as once you beat the final boss.. that's it. Nothing. You barely even get a single paragraph from a quest giver and... that's it. Such a huge letdown after an otherwise fantastic experience. It feels like the entirety of Act 4 was just slapped together too quickly, and finished even quicker.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who loves loot-focused aRPGs, such as Diablo, Torchlight or the predecessor; Titan Quest. Just don't go in expecting a world-class story or any real ""ending"", the obvious goal is the character building.			"

+ The gameplay is a ton of fun, espeically if you are a fan of ARPGs like Diablo, Path of Exile, etc. TONS of enemies to slaughter, challenging bosses to face, dungeons to explore, loot to find, and an epic journey to complete.+ A very dark and gruesome atmosphere that really helps to emerse you into the world. Lots of demonic / satanic themes.+ While having co-op features, Grim Dawn is primarily a single player focused game which to me is a good thing. Everything seems to scale around your level as you progress, and every battle seems to be scaled well in difficulty.+ An OVERLOAD of content. You can easily invest 50 hours+ and still crave more! Feels fresh from start to finish.+ The game is very challenging, especially if you choose to play on Veteran difficulty early on. This makes your enitre playthrough feel very rewarding from start to finish.+ Lots of hidden areas and secret dungeons / bosses + At no point did it ever feel like a ""Grind"" even while playing on Veteran difficulty. + There is weight to every attack, and enemies will literally go flying back, dismembered, with loads of gore.+ Large enemy variety which keeps the game interesting. Seems like every area / cave has something new waiting for you to slay.- The story...unfortunetely falls short. It's almost not even worth paying attention to once you get a few hours in. (probably due to a lack of cutscenes / story moments)- You can not reset master points. You can easily screw up your build if you invest too many points in mastery over your skills.- Just a small note, but instead of gold the currency in the game is ""iron""... personally...this just did not feel as rewarding - For the most part, you only use one or two combat skills throughout the game as it's typically a waste of points to invest in others until late game especially considering you must level them up far enough to be worth while.

								A truly excellent ARPG, which you can tell is made by true fans of the genre. These folks were part of the Titan Quest team, and I have to say this game eclipses that one. Titan Quest has a great setting, but even if you are a fan of classical Greece this game is better in every other way!Every gripe I've had with almost every ARPG since Diablo 2 has been addressed, along with lots of wonderful and original innovations.It still feels and plays just like most other ARPGs - you choose a class (or two), level up, loot, hack'n'slash (or cast) your way through several acts... yes, it all feels familiar, but in a pleasant way! Even the music is heavily reminiscent of the classic Diablo 2 score, which is some of my favourite game music of all time, but with its own weird west flavour. The world and its lore is lovingly crafted, with some wonderful twists on typical conventions. I'm having a real blast with my main character so far; she is basically a post apocalyptic sheriff with a brace of six shooters dealing out fiery death and lobbing canister bombs at the bad guys!Considering this game is still technically early access (though content complete at time of review), I'd say it already hands down beats Diablo 3, Path Of Exile and every other ARPG I've tried in the past decade or two. Every time there's been an update, things just get better and better.If you're a fan of the genre, this is truly a must-own!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is an absolute win all around. I found out about it through an ad on Facebook. From what the ad said I thought ""Hmm.. this game sounds too good to be true."" I bought it and am still amazed at what a great find it is. In my opinion this game outclasses Diablo, and every other ARPG out there. The build potential is basically limitless, and I really love the aspect of action/consequence (I'm a huge Fable fan). I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys any kind of rpg. Best 25 bucks I've ever spent on steam. I'd R8 it 8/8, tis gr8 m8.			"

Early Access Review
								Just... easily the best ARPG since Diablo 2. I loved D2 played thousands of hours, this game ive already got 50+ in a couple weeks and im not even 17 anymore.Combat is soooo smooth and fast, charge - shout - blade arc boom, 2 seconds, then in the next instant shadow strike to the next pack of mobs and crush them. You can zoom way out and fight huge armies of monsters at once, unlike PoE w/that super close up awful view.Game isn't super easy, have to pay attention,The feel/look of this game is just so perfect for me, 10/10 easily. This is easily my favorite ARPG and the best game ive played this year.			"

Early Access Review
								TLDR; More complex than D3, less of a ball-ache than PoE!This is pretty much my take on Grim Dawn at this stage 'b19'. Don’t get me wrong I’m a huge fan of PoE and D3 but I feel GD has managed to plonk itself nicely in the middle.It does still need quite a bit of work though, comparing a beta to two games released for several years is really unfair... so.. stick it on your wish list for now ;)further..There are far more damage types and intricate bonuses than D3, which makes the itemisation really interesting, unlike d3 which is flat and over simplified. But its not over the top complex like PoE.. which after a while just becomes a real ball ache.This translates into an overall more enjoyable experience for me, I really REALLY like the new introduction of more 'stats tabs' revealing more in-depth information, this allows a great overview of what exactly is going on with my build, offering the opportunity to have a good chew at the stats when I want to theory craft or min max, but is simple enough that I don’t have to think too hard about it when I just want to have fun.The ability to modify EVERY ITEM with a whole range of things really is a breath of fresh air compared to D3's socketing system. The 'gems' in GrimDawn's case offer far more variance and innovation resulting in your character feeling like your own build and your own character and not just a copy/pasta of kripps currently build.Unlike gems in D3, the 'gem' can roll a wide range of random stats, meaning you still want to pick them up and collect them for future builds and they are also used as materials in crafting. In GD they aren’t really gems, they are more like bits and pieces of materials you find reflecting well the gritty 'salvaging' wasteland kind of feeling the game gives. Gems to me belong in a puzzle game not an aRPG.The crafting is more complex than d3, but in an 'easier' way than poe, for lack of a better way of putting it. You don’t feel as if its absolutely necessary in order to enjoy the game but there is enough meat n two veg to satisfy anyone who needs breadth as well as depth.Graphically, I LOVE d3, while I do like a gritty envoiroment PoE was just.. I cant put my finger on it, but I really didn not enjoy its style it was trying to hard to be d2. I know PoE players will hate me for saying it, but I really didnt like it! sorry. GD is even more gritty but curiously more appealing to me. The envoirment is highly detailed compensating for the not so detailed player character models. which is fine considering the vast array of gear available. It doesnt have 'random' maps like d3 or poe, but I feel that it is better in the end, since random maps in d3 and poe.. well, they dont seem 'THAT' random and making them random is at the expense of an intricate, detailed envoiroment that a mapped out envoiroment can provide.it IS of course still beta so there are quite a few issues with polish, for me personally the graphics engine needs a lot of work in the optimisation department, which I'm sure will come. If I were to guess I'd say the game is about 60% done. It needs at least two more acts, another 30 or so levels, multi player functionality and.. I PREY it will have some on-line functionality. Titan Quest, which the game is based from, was easy to mod, hack n crack and couldn’t be used for ladders, race's or leagues. I suspect ladders and the like will never be seen in GD, which has its up sides and down sides I suppose. I would dearly love that feature, but in the absence of that second on my wish list would be an in-game version of the TQCollector mod. The amount of items in TQ was Vaaasstt! and I loved doing the collector thing. Much like I love collecting achievements (hint hint)Hope this isn’t too long, I’ve been quite negative about GD in the past and I'm genuinely impressed with the progress so far.Defiantly one to keep your eye on!

												I've tried Diablo 3, Torchlight 2 and some others and all of them don't keep me interested unlike Grim Dawn. Usually I play them for a few hours then get bored however I've played Grim Dawn for 44 hours and have owned it for about a week.It has good graphics with a grim art-style with most dungeons being really dark.The controls are good with bindable keys. You can also change your skills on the hotbar (mouse, 1 to 8 and then 9 & 0).The character progression in the game in terms of points is skill points (your points for active skills or passives for your class (also this game lets you choose 2 classes for 1 character) and you gain 3 of these points every time you level up.There are attribute points that you get from leveling up and you get 1 per time to go into either of the 3 primary stats; Physique, cunning or spirit.The last is devotion points which you get from finding shrines in the world. To get the point you either need a certain item, activate it's trap (basically kill a few enemies and maybe a hero) or just get it anyway. These points go into the devotion tab that grants mostly small passives with some bigger ones and active skills.In the world you find rift-gates which allow you to teleport there at any time, which are usually found in / near the cities or in some dungeons.You've got the loot system that has an armour stat, and with how common they are (common, magic, legendary, epic, ect) which give extra and greater stats.The game allows you to do the quests in basically any order you want and you're not required to do them at all, you could just find loot and kill things if you wanted to.This game features multiplayer too. It's mostly a single player game but the multiplayer works really well and I play online most of the time I'm on.Overall I rate Grim Dawn 9/10.There is also mod support coming out soon and there is at least 1 DLC expansion promised to be added.

								I would highly recommend this game to anyone. It is one of the best hack and slash games I have played in a very long time. And it's good to see a game in early access that is so complete for what has been released. Even though the acts are still being worked on, the content out is great and I haven't seen too many bugs, and none that are game breaking thus far. If you are looking for a good hack and slash game I would recommend you to buy this, you won't regret spending the money.			"

Graphics looks great although a bit rough on the edges but that's ok; sometimes you don't want a diablo 3 polished game. Good pace, great classes\characters to build and lots of loot :)One thing however: i can't find that cave that makes the game crash ;-) "

												What Grim Dawn does is make us focus on how ARPGs once were. It is not the fast-paced click-fest leaning towards accessibility that Diablo 3 is and neither is it the complex behemoth that Path of Exile has evolved into. It is a reminder. It is a worthy successor of Titan Quest and a game that, despite using tried-and-tested methods, will scratch the itch of those who cried in disappointment when Diablo 3 came out and not only them. It is capable of appealing to any ARPG fan, because there are plenty of items and sets to discover, there are enough classes to find one suiting your playstyle as there is a world plunged into chaos and darkness that needs saving. For a price of 25 euros, you’ll get an ARPG in the old-school sense of the word that has the potential to keep you clicking for at least 40 to 50 hours and you can definitely do much worse than that.

								Over 200hrs and counting! This is just as good as Titan Quest and possibly, Diablo II. If you like a true spiritual successor to the genre, this game is for you.Pros:- Classic ARPG style; Choose a build you wanted to play and farm epic loot- Character progression freedom. You take control on how you want to build your character from attributes to skills- Wide variety of itemization keeps you hunting for more gear- Unique faction system offering rewards and access to faction-based gear depending on who you side on- Unique devotion system (skills/passives unlocked via constellations) adds flavor to existing builds- Smooth combat- Good graphics, dark and has real world-like art style- Great soundtrack matching each and every location's mood- Awesome story. the idea that you are not the sole savior of the world is refreshing- DRM free!!!Cons:- Lack of skill animations due to outdated game engine (no jumping, no spinning, etc..)- Crafting system can be improved- Vendors seldom sell good items and often costs too much- No vanity/item enhancement system currently in place (transmog/enchantment)			"

												One of 2016's standouts of the year.  The spiritual successor to Titan Quest and what the Diablo series were modeled after, this game delivers. With 6 classes to choose from and then the ability to dual class after hitting the 10th level, the options seem limitless.  The skills themselves with each class are well thought out and it hardly seems that one is better than the other.  At this point I don't think there is any 1 direction you ""need"" to spec yourself out because every skill seems equally viable.  Heck I found myself holding skill points because I simply did not know which way to go and ended up leveling 5 times before spending any!The mood and atmosphere settings for each locations are wonderfully detailed.   The one complaint I may have is that in some areas it can become extremely dark even with lit torches around. There are things that happen within the game that will make a profound impact to your game.  Rescuing a survivor from the area he may be at may not be the best idea...Although the main world you will be exploring are all pre-rendered maps, there are extra dungeons in which are special challenges that are all very much roguelike and different that require a special key to enter.  Trying to find these places are what makes the game that much  more fun to explore and check every nook and cranny for something cool. I was pleasantly surprised to find sooo much meat on this game to indulge myself with and even after several playthroughs with different combinations of classes, I still found myself having loads of fun.  This game is a must have!

Early Access Review
								Grim Dawn, the indie-format heir of Titan Quest, takes its hereditary dispositions and gifts us with a contemporary continuation of the oldschool dungeon crawler-colossus that TQ was. Those of you who are looking for that dungeon crawler that fulfills your biased needs for a nostalgic and yet modern and revised game, have come to the end of your journey. Grim Dawn will challenge your mind and your skills as it used to be and is supposed to be today. The possibility to combine different classes allows the player to craft his own individual synergies and master the game the way he likes it and is not constrained to go a predetermined path, like the developers of Diablo III have chosen for their game to be.The world is beautifully designed, the style and atmosphere of the content is captivating and solely confined by the small budget the games development team(wich is composed of seven individuals) disposes over.It is my opinion that Titan Quest outmatches of what has become of the sequel to Diablo II in many points, and TQ was published 2006, and(!) had the budget of a big company to cover it.Now imagine, if already TQ outmatches Diablo III, how wonderful could a Grim Dawn with a bigger budget become?This is only my opinion, I don't want to offend anyone with it.10/10 for Grim Dawn, please support it as much as it lies in your possibilities.

								It took me like 15 minutes to love this game. One of the best singleplayer experiences in a long time.I have hundreds of hours playing Diablo 2 and 3. And thousands of hours playing Path of Exile.Grim Dawn is so much better than Diablo 3 in every aspect. It looks awsome. The worldmap is huge and is so detailed and just looks hand-painted and very beautiful. I love the music. It has day and night cycles and a wheather-system. Effects are very beautiful and the artwork is dark and dirty and colors are so atmospheric. Grim Dawn lets Diablo 3 look like a game for 6years old.It has a rotatable camera, thats not just a gimmick but really enhances combat and the quest for hidden boxes and stuff. The skill system is pretty deep. Not nearly as complex as in Path of Exile of course, but still quite versatile. Combat mechanics are very complex too, so is crafting. It has a fractions-system, lots of game-changing decisions to make, very high replay-value.I play it on hardcore-mode with perma-death and item-loss and its just as intense as in Path of Exile. As far as multiplayer is concerned, Grim Dawn doesnt have such a brilliant and outstanding ingame-economy like Path of Exile. But as a single-player experience its really hard to top. This game is still in early access but runs really neat. Its rediculously cheap and you get a very nice balanced and polished AAA title for that little money. Its hard to believe this game was made by a seven-person indie team. Cant recommend this gem high enough.94/100			"

								Grim Dawn is an ARPG heavily inspired by the Diablo series pre-Diablo 3, as evident by the fact that it is nearly identical mechanics-wise to Diablo 2, though improved upon, and the itemization is also very largely identical to Diablo 2's in that low level items are absolutely viable and even sought-out for high level characters. I can safely say this is what Diablo 3 should have been. The grim, hopeless atmosphere is back, the ugly aesthetically displeasing monsters are back, the loot that feels meaningful from level 1 to max level is back, and the absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing awesome music is back somehow.Probably my favorite thing Grim Dawn expanded upon from Diablo 2 is the classes. Each of the 5 (Soon to be 6 upon the full release) classes have clear cut specialties, but the big twist here is that you can combine two of any class together to help shape a specific type of build you have in mind. While you may feel encouraged to play a hybrid double-class character, it's entirely viable and possible to play a pure single class character. It's just really ♥♥♥♥ing great.It's crazy, because the game isn't even finished at this point, and already it feels like it's had more thought and care put into it than the entirety of Diablo 3.

												I bought this game just want to overcome my boredom on the weekend, and i was enjoyed previous action rpg games such as Torchlight 1 & 2, and especially Diablo 2 as my very first PC game when i was in primary school (even though i never finished it). I cant compare it to recent action rpg games like Diablo 3 or PoE cause i am never played it yet everyone compares it and they said Grim Dawn was slightly better. For me it was an good game to play for fun, its offers many combinations of class (20 classes) and devotions, huge world, dark-gruesome atmosphere, nice graphic, crafting and looting with so much prefixes, co-op multiplayers, lot of character customization, hardcore mode, choose factions, and small details that enchance my experience in this game. well all things that you wished for from this kind of genre, but dont expect this game delivers such as solid deep storyline (dont expect witcher 3 story, lol) or online competitive environment.So that if you like spending time to slay numerous monsters with fancy skills, you dont mind to spend hundred of hours for crafting, looting and playing with your friends, and you have been familiar in this genre, this game simply will worth your money. 8/10.

												First of all: I bought this game mainly for playing it in coop mode. In reminescence of the old days with Diablo 2 we chose this game and we certainly weren't disappointed. The whole atmosphere is really dark, somehow you cant really believe that everything is going to be okay someday. At some points I had to stop and wanted to enjoy a flower or something beautiful because this game only gives you darkness (the music supports that).The most outstanding feature in my opinion is the shere amount of possibilities to build your character. 6 classes from which you can choose two and freely combine the abilities. Plus the devotion system which you are simply overwhelmed by (might be seen as a contra). And you have no restrictions within the classes, there is no classical ranged combat class or a typical tank/berserker/whatever. Unfortunately you cant always see in detail the love that was put into the monster design. You are confronted with masses of enemies and dont have the time to really look at the bosses which is kind of sad when you check the FB-page of Grim Dawn and see all the neat monster art.  The aspect with the consequences of your choices isn't really dominant. We often talk to people with quests and after a while we notice that we maybe have spoken to them in an earlier stage. Probably made some decisions but we cant remember because the NPCs arent memorable. They are somewhat interchangable and dont stick to you. Overall:+ great game, awesome atmosphere, gigantic character build, satisfying perks and abilities, cool concept art- unremarkable NPCs, a little bit to few weapon designsRecommended.			"

								This review is for Early Access Build 29 of Grim Dawn.Pros:+25 different specs to choose from+30 plus hours of gameplay+Lots of loot+Set pieces of gear+Continuous updates from Dev+ARPG fun+Lots of quests+Able to respec (see con)+Gameplay driven; not story driven (see con)Cons:-Crashes (a handful in my playthrough)-Balancing issues-Minor sound issues-Limited Stash for excess gear (can buy more space with in game currency)-No wardrobe / outfitter system-Respec is limited (you may need to start the game over)-Mildly Story driven in text format with no voice acting or cut-scenesGrim Dawn is an ARPG and completely nails it.  It was extremely good and there are so many different types of builds to choose from and it's fantastic!  There's a total of four ACT's to play through, 25 different builds to choose from and 4 different difficulty settings.  The first is Normal.  Then Normal Veteran.  Normal Veteran is Normal, but more monsters per group and more champion monsters show up too.  GREAT for getting those green and blue drops!  After beating the game on Normal, Elite opens up and upon beating Elite, Ultimate difficulty is available.It took me 30ish hours to beat the game (all quests) on Veteran with a Conjurer pet build.  The current build for this game at the time of this writing is 29 and with this build the game is now content complete!  Build 30 is supposed to be the official release and will have achievements enabled along with bug fixes, balancing tweaks and Mod support!  The game has a lot of loot for all possible specs ranging from guns, melee, spells and pets.  After you log out of the game and then log back in all monsters, including bosses, respawn.  You can do boss and elite monsters runs all night long to farm specific gear of your choice.  Speaking of loot, while you're out and about killing monster after monster your bags are gonna get quite full.  You do have your own personal portal to fast travel back to town and sell off or store the gear you don't need.There's also a lot of quests to do too!  Some quests allow you to gain stranded people out in the world to come back to the starter town and build it up with blacksmiths and more quests.  Blacksmiths can make you new gear for Iron (in game currency) and mats.  Mats (materials) are found from killing monsters and drop quite frequently.  Iron and mats can also be used to respec your character, but beware, respec is limited to skill & devotion points only and the price of Iron goes up with each respec.  You can not respec your mastery points (mastery is your class IE: soldier) or attribute points once distributed.  Every level you gain 3 points to put wherever you like until level 50 and after 50 you only gain 2 points.  With these points you can upgrade your class or start picking skills and/or upgrade them.  Once you put points into your Mastery you can not undo those, but if you pick skills for your mastery and decide later you would like to try different skills you can do so.  You also gain attribute points every level too.  These points are seperate from the 3 points you gain for your mastery or skills.  Attribute points are side points you can place onto your character in your character stats.  Once distributed you can not undo these.There are tons of builds online to help you plan a build ahead of time so if you do mess up a build you won't have to start over.  The below link can help you plan out a class build:http://grimcalc.com/Finally, there are devotion points.  Devotion is fairly new and are bonus stats you can place on your character.  These stats include more damage done, resisting a certain damage type like poison and even new skills!  Devotion points are found throughout the world from shrines.  These shrines can be activated from mats or from fighting montsters.  Once Devotion points are placed you can respec them, but with cost of Iron and mats.There are factions in the game too.  Factions will provide you with very good gear to choose from, but you'll need reputation from them for them to grant you said gear.  Rep can be farmed from killing monsters or doing bounties (quests) for them.  This gear is quite expensive and you will have to grind for Iron and rep for quite a while.  Factions also provide scrolls for the blacksmith too so he can learn more types of gear to make you.If you're looking for an ARPG similar to Diable 2, Path of Exile or Torchlight this is the game for you.  There is a story and it's all in text format with no voice acting, but it's something.   Despite the minor flaws this game has it still runs very good and has plenty of hours of enjoyment.  Especially just playing around with all the different builds.  Recommended!			"

								I have played nearly all of the action rpgs available, past and present.  And by this I mean the very specific isometric camera, third person, loot grind heaven that is my holy grail of games.  As it is right now, Grim Dawn is very high up on the list of my favorites of the genre.Fighting feels wonderful, tactile and with the ""oomph"" you look for in a game like this.  It is also quick and fluid, unlike Path of Exiles (which was really my biggest gripe about that game).  The skills are all fun, and the leveling system and how you pick your skills is a great nod to customization, replayability and feeling like you have control over who your character is and how they play.  I don't play these games for story and couldn't tell you much about this one, other than the atmosphere is dark and, well, grim.  There's a prison, and a warden (a staple of these games now?), and a bunch of dudes that want you to go kill things.  Crafting is actually interesting, a sort of extra bonus to the loot dropping and helping you build your character with the bonuses and strengths (even some skills) you'd like.Wish there was more to it, can't wait for updates.

								This game is amazing, from the developers of Titan Quest (one of the best hack n slash games ever made) comes another unique addition. This game has very similar concepts with some new ones that again are refreshing and super fun. Most hack n slash games are rather linear on the grinding, but this feels different and fun, as with the combination of the graphics, mechanics and the skills, it literally makes killing shiz quite rewarding. Honestly I don't want to say much more to ruin it, but it's a fantastic addition to the hack and slash genre, it honestly rate it better than diablo 3. + With the recent release of multiplayer, holy moly it is progressing along nicely.

								We were waiting for a game like this for years, since TQ. A massive map, interesting and hard to choose skills, awesome classes, big ♥♥♥ bosses. It's unique skill system lets you play the same class more than at least 3 different ways. Combining classes, changing play style makes this game very highly replayable multiple times. Waiting for expansion packs already! 10/10			"

												Grim Dawn.Man, at first I was iffy on this game. I looked at it back when it first was coming out, and thought to myself. ""Myself, this looks an awful lot like Titan Quest. Remember that game? Yeah, of course you do,"" Then I just passed the game by, because well; Bad memories associated with Titan Quest. Add another fifty hours onto my PoE playtime and my buddy all of a sudden pops up on STEAM playing Grim Dawn. I'm just sittin here like, ""Are you for serious right meow?"" He was; Dead serious actually. Apparently he'd seen a streamer playing it, and decided to pick it up; I'm a sucker for H'n'S games and frankly dual class systems get me wet. So I buy the damn game.Right now I'm sitting four hours shy of four hundred hours played. Which isn't a lot in comparison to the 1.6k+ hours played of some people, holy crap Batman! I've played a grand total between two accounts 1.5k hours in PoE and in my near four hundred hours played of Grim Dawn, I can say that I've had more fun and a lot more success with Grim Dawn than I have ever had with PoE. Let me break down some pointers for you.Grim Dawn{PROS}Has a Single-Player experience, which presents a lag free environment.In Offline(Single-Player) mode there is even a pause button to take a break, or an emergency stop.Multiplayer is not based around a complete server with lots of people, so it's relatively lag free.Multiplayer servers are hosted by players, connection speed determines connection issues. This potentially eliminates rubber-banding or desync issues.Dual-Class system allows for lots of replayability and uniqueness to each individual character you build.A high enough level-cap to get a Godly feeling on a character that's well built.{CONS}A lack of current high end gear makes certain builds feel lacking and not as unique appearing as others. As of current there are only so many classes that a person can potentially create, 21 in total.Current game design has flaws when trying to create 'Movement' skills that don't require a target.While classes feel unique in comparison to like-classes in other games, their skills are rather lacking in when it comes to classes.(Most classes feel similar after a while.)[OVERALL]Great game. Very well done by the awesome people at Crate Entertainment. Can't wait to see what you have in store for us on the other side of that bridge. I also look forward to seeing what the team is going to throw at us as far as new Legendary and Rare gear. Personally speaking I would love to see something like Mythical gear, which would be Orange or Rainbow text. Some crazy epic items that just make your character over the top Godly.			"

This game has it all- fantastic loot (though it could hugely benefit from a smart loot system), very satisfying leveling and a deceptively complex character build system. The bosses have clear required strategies and the regular mobs are fun to kill; it doesn't easily get boring. Either way, I Just wanted to show my support for such a great game.

								The game is a lot of fun, shows so promising and unique concepts that are nice to see in a modern game. This game truely is a throwback to my youth and has done well to bring me back there with some great new concepts and awesome combat, the endgame is non existant as of right now and the ending is rather underwhelming and it finnishes at act 3 but you will have a lot of fun up to that point.Improvements could be made but overall impressed with the game so far and this game truely puts diablo 3 to shame.

								ARPG is really what got me into gaming years ago, and Titan Quest was one of my favorites just because of the theme and storyline but it also played well. Grim Dawn has been a good follow up to that effort. This just feels like a really solid game right now even in early access. I feel it could use some tweaks in some areas but overall it is a very good game already. Only thing is I got to the end of the content yesterday which was a huge bummer!

This game is a blast I would recomend this game to anyone who like games like Diablo, torchlight and path of exile, This is one of the best games that I have ever played. I feel like the developers have pulled out all the best features of all games like Grim Dawn and put them all into one game. Also guess what the game isn't even done yet they are still working on it, so imagine this game six months down the road it'll be even better than what it is now.			"

								Grim Dawn is a hand-crafted ARPG. For me, that makes it the best. The world, the monsters (fodder, elites, and bosses), and all the loot are made by a person. Sure there are some random elements, but nothing makes an ARPG more enjoyable than this hand-crafted feeling. Other games (read PoE, d3) are just painful by comparison cause you are trying to compare 2 items that have a bunch of random stats thrown together. You are just running maps looking for exits, killing elites without any care for what they are. In Grim Dawn, you get a much better feeling of progression and accomplishment.			"

												I'm very happy with the overall design of this game.  My favorite features are the large map and lush scenery.  Also, I like how you don't have to keep buying town portal scrolls (like in other games) - you just get to cast a portal for free as part of your basic controls.  The inventory design is a bit retro, with each item consuming a certain size and shape of your pack space.  This adds to the challenge of inventory management.  Another cool aspect is one of the reasons I bought Grim Dawn - the skill tree allows you to combine traits of several character classes instead of being locked into one set of abilities.  For example, I can have close combat abilities from my Nightblade PLUS the option to summon creatures with my Occultist.  The only thing I dislike at this point...is my personal portals disappear when I exit the game.  This means I have to make it a goal to reach one of the preset portals in an area before closing the game down.  Sometimes, it's just not possible - I have to re-clear an area's enemies the next time I boot up the game.  When I have to leave for work, I gotta go!  No time to make it to the nearest area's portal.  I bought this as a huge fan of Torchlight II a similar game which I've put at least 300 hours into) and I'm very satisfied with Grim Dawn so far.  I'll give it a 9/10 with a point off for the inconvenient thing about portals.  I highly recommend Grim Dawn, with highlights for replay value!			"

												By far one of the top games I have ever played. I can see myself logging hundreds of hours on this as I already have 25 within two weeks of owning it and I am not the slightest bit bored or dissapointed. The gameplay is fantastic and like many others have said forms the perfect blend between many well known ARPGs. I have started up 3 different characters so far each of a different class and I enjoy playing each of them equally, theyre simply all a blast to play. The difficulty the game has to offer is great, currently I only have Veteran unlocked but my Buddy and I are going through the game on it and it creates some intense moments. The loot is varied and has in my opinion the best drop system I have seen in a game in a long time. What I mean is the rare items drop at just the right intervals, you dont need to spend hours farming to find good loot but that doesnt mean it drops so often that it takes the fun and excitement away. While I have not yet seen any of the top tier legendary items (they drop at 50 and my highest level is 35) I can say that the variety of loot and the unique skills / attributes you can find really make the games replay value shoot through the roof. Im constantly finding items that completely change or even define the build im working on and thats great. Overall, I am enjoying everything about this game, the story, the atmosphere, the gameplay, the multiplayer, the singleplayer, I literally cannot think of one flaw. Shoutout to Lord Lulz for buying this game for me, best thing I've ever gotten for free			"

								Even though i dont have the most hours played in the list of reviews i feel obliged to at least write something good about Grim Dawn now when its coming to release. in a genre where Diablo III is on 1 end of the spectrum and Path of Exile on another Grim Dawn still manages to hold its own very very well in terms of build diversity, customization, gearing and the diversity of devotion points it might even be on par with the complexity of Path of Exile. Now where the game unfortunately lacks is in combat, some skills being nothing more than basic attack modifiers some are still really really great feeling and there will be something to fit every playstyle. It also makes up for that with the best imo quest lines and stories coupled with glorious exploration which is what makes this game really really shine. i got 1k+ hours in d3, 5k+ in total on poe and i want grim dawn to be up there with d3 and poe in play hours cause it truly deserves it. Also as a little sidenote this game will have full mod support later when it releases and it has multiplayer if you're into that.			"

												Until I played this game I did not think that Immortal Throne could be beaten.You can very much feel this games Titan Quest heritage in its play and feel where the music gives it more than a little feel of diablo II about it. At higher levels some of the room clearing spells are just spectacular (Oleksa's flash freeze (Arcanist), Cannister Bomb (Pyro) and Eye of Dreeg (Occultist) are all good examples). Plus you can mix up the character classes harnessing the combined strengths of any two classes similar to the mechanics of Titan Quest.As for loot... I've now got so much stuff that is just too good to sell that I've basically got thirty sherpa's to support my characters.I am still discovering new things about the game (only recently deciding that I actually liked the Arcanist after discovering flash freeze), pretty sure that there are still many places in the huge world that I have not found yet. I see no end to this games replayability.Definitely a game that is destined to be regarded as a classic. "

Early Access Review
								This is a great RPG game that is related to Diablo III, Path of Exile, and Titan Quest combined. There are so many things that I can say about this game.1. Devotion points are just great. - Adding points give you celestial powers which can even make your build more effective and powerful the way you want it to be. Devotion skill tree is huge and has a variety of stats you can add for your character.2. The components are just similar to how Titan Quest was. - This game is just like Titan Quest but very unique and awesome. You just can't imagine the similarities between Grim Dawn and Titan Quest on how the components were in that game.3. Relics remind me of Titan Quest. - Do you remember the day when you were playing Titan Quest and saw how runes gave off skills and stats well now that Grim Dawn has that content to this game it is so fun.4. Out of all, Grim Dawn is still a pre-released game that will be released in February but when it get released, I just can't wait for it to be released since the game is content complete but the game might still add more content and you may never know there might be exciting stuff in the game that might surprise you. Well good luck to you people who are new to this game and haven't played ARPG games like Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, Diablo III before and I really recommend this game since it's so fun and yet so exciting and interesting in some way. :)Continuing on with the good things I'd said about this game, I'd love to tell you about the Arcanist, Demolitionist, and Nightblade. 1. Arcanist - This class uses PURE Spirit for stats. Uses one - handed weapons such as wands, swords, daggers, or maces. Known as the ""manifestation of magic."" Uses Elemental Damage. Ues Fire, Physical, Cold, and Lightning Damage. Has an advantage of long - range attacks. Uses long range skills such as ""Fanetti's Replicating Missile, ""Trozan's Sky Shard"", ""Albrecht's Aether Ray"", and ""Devastation. The ""Fanetti's Replicating Missile"" is basically the default skill for the Arcanist that can split into fragments which will eventually increase as you level it up. Also it comes with modifiers that will enhance this skill. The ""Trozan's Sky Shard"" is basically a large meteorite that can kill groups of enemies. I would really recommend using this skill too since it has a modifier that can Freeze Targets and enable you to have the advantage of killing enemies long range. I'd also say this would work with bosses too but not all of them. The ""Albrecht's Aether Ray"" is basically an aether laser or beam that you can contiually hold to instantly kill enemies over time. The only thing the Arcanist would suffer from is the Energy per Second that this skill uses. So I'd recommend using an component called Ectoplasm which gives you more Energy, and Energy per Second that will reduce the amount of Energy you use for your skills. Lastly, the ""Devastation"" is one of the ultimate skills of the Arcanist that will cost a tremendous amount of Energy to use. So use it wisely. This skill is basically raining embers of ""raw pure energy"" that will rain down on multiple enemies making them take Aether Damage. I'd really recommend going for Aether Damage, Elemental Damage, and Elemental Resistance for this class since this class is really focused on all the elements. The only thing that the Arcanist suffers from is HP. So I'd also recommend picking another class to get the passives and auras from to support the Arcanist and make your life so much easier when it comes to HP and losing HP causing the Arcanist to die so quickly. So far this is what I know about Arcanist and what it uses for advantage, and the types of skills it uses.2. Demolitionist - Hell yeah, this class is my favorite. This class uses Physique and Cunning. There are items and runes that has a passive that grants the ability to duel wield one - handed guns at the same time. Now, this is what I call a freaking Gunslinger. Phew, phew, phew! Lul. The default skill of this class is the Fire Strike and it does Fire Damage, and Burn Damage Over Time to a single enemy. The awesome thing about this skill is that it has 4 modifiers. 4 Freaking Modifers! Yeah, thats right. Well as you can see the 4 modifers are ""Explosive Strike"", ""Searing Strike"", ""Static Strike"", and ""Brimstone."" I know the first three sound all similar but they pretty much fairly give different bonuses. The first modifer ""Explosive Strike"" gives bonuses to Fire Damage, a Meter Radius so it can damage multiple enemies, and especially more Burn Damage over Time. So pretty much Hellfire on all the enemies that are suffering and your like ""Burn baby burn, yeah yeah yeah!"" Well yeah, once I see multiple enemies getting burned that's what it reminds of. Lol. Alright the second modifier ""Searing Strike"" only works on a melee or two - handed ranged weapon. This modifier grants tremendous bonus to Total Damage, Crit Damage, and Skill Cost. At level 1, ""Searing Strike"" grants +15% Total Damage, +25% Crit Damage, and -33% Skill Cost. I just find this so overpowered that you can literally level up this modifier even more to see the true power of it. Good luck to people who use two - handed ranged weapons or melee weapons who are looking forward to using this modifier. The third modifier ""Static Strike"" says it all. This modifier has a Chance of Knockdown Target, Additional Lightning Damage, and Chance of Dealing Lightning Damage. This is pretty much pyrotechnic. You see what I did there huh. Wink, wink. Alright, the fourth most overpowered modifier of Fire Strike is Brimstone. This is pretty much an occult power. Man, Demolitionist you didn't have to steal the occult's power didn't you? This modifier grants Fire Strike the ability to split into 3 Fragments, Additional Fire Damage, and also Chaos Damage. Wow, look at all those bonuses you can receive if you literally add these modifiers to Fire Strike. This is why I use Fire Strike and this is why I'm in love with Demolitionist. So far this is what I pretty much know about Demolitinist and I just wish there would be more skills to be added for this class so people can eventually create unique builds that will inspire them and show how enjoyable this game can be.3. Nightblade - The freaking assassin. This class has a skill called Dual Blades that grants you the ability to dual wield one - handed melee weapons at the same time. The awesome thing about this skill is that it has 5 modifiers. Wow, 5 modifiers! I didn't really expect that much! So these 5 modifiers are called ""Belgothian's Shears"", ""Nidalla's Hidden Hand"", ""Amarasta's Quick Cut"", ""Whirling Death"", and ""Execution. The first modifier ""Belgothian's Shears basically has a chance to be activated while using your default weapon attack. Just remember to use the default weapon attack with the one that has the sword to see this in action. This skill basically does a 165 Degree Arc which basically spins, Hits Up to 3 Targets, Additionial Pierce Damage, Stun a Target, Additional Poison Damage, and Weapon Damage. It's so much bonuses that I find it so overpowered for a default attack to activate this while killing enemies. The second modifier ""Nidalla's Hidden Hand"" is very different to the first modifier. It basically doesn't proc or have a chance to be activated but it modifies these three modifiers ""Belgothian's Shears"", ""Amarasta's Quick Cut"", and ""Whirling Death."" What the heck? A modifier within a modifier? Where did that come from. Well as you can see this is what the modifier does. Sooo, well that's my point. So this modifier grants Acid Damage, Poison Damage over time, and a chance of Slowing Target. Wow, how Deadly can this be. I guess that was very punny of me to say deadly when it relates to toxic, poison, or any deadly green substance. Well now that I've reached the writing limit, this is what I love and know about the game Grim Dawn so far. Awesome job on the game though and keep up the great work! :}			"

								The game even in early access almost feels like a complete game (besides of course some lacking content and story) it just feels very solid and stable. The gameplay is very fun and addicting which of course is what matters the most. The game keeps on getting better and better with every new update that comes along every other month. I understand there will not be character wipes when the game is released so there's nothing really to lose by playing now. I would recommend buying it and start playing right away (this also helps the developers getting some cashflow - as it's a VERY small team).I can definitely recommend it as is.			"

Early Access Review
								Made from a small group of people from the dev team for Titan Quest, Diablo II, and some other organizations, Grim Dawn is the next chapter in the way we play Action RPGs. The way the game has you roll your character is uniqe in the way that you don't choose your class when you make your character. Once you reach level 1, you are asked to choose one of five different classes to play, but thats not all. Upon hitting level 10 you are prompted yet again to pick a second class the merge with, but you do not have to pick this time if you dont want to. This leaves the game with 15 possible ways to play.The current level cap on a character is 50 but that will most likely take you more than one sit down of the game to level. There is a slight lack of end game content however, at the moment there are only 2 end game dungeons which are quite dificult but can get somewhat repetative. these two dungeons are rouge-like however, which adds an aspect of caution as there isn't a real disadvantage to dying yet. (Rouge-like meaning once you die you have to start at the beginning) Over all, I recommend checking this game out and playing with friends always enhance your experiance. There is easily 100+ hours here for you, if you are in to these kinds of games.			"

												Grim Dawn is what d3 should had been but never was:- Combinable classes which enables great diversity.- Bossmonsters in almost every area.- Challenging difficulty tiers. (Start at veteran if your familiar with arpgs in general).- Outstanding loot and build diversity.- No smartloot ! Unlike in d3 your not fully eqipped in two days here just to feel bored then.- Excellent longvity and replayability.- Very appealing ingame atmosphere, graphics and detailrichness.- Great communication of devs to the userbase.- CRATE !! Its sheer unbelievable what a great game they designed here out of a nowhere kickstarter project.End of song: If you ever liked d2 you will LOVE this game - worth every cent asked for it.5 ***** purchase recommendation. :)			"

												I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys or is familiar with the ARPG genre.I've been an avid ARPG fan since Diablo II, including Path of Exile, Diablo III and a few others not worth mentioning.This is my favorite one of all.  It's still new, and not finished yet, there seems to still be a need for a little bit of balancing, but I still highly recommend this to everyone.What makes this game unique in my opinion is the Skill tree (or whatever you wanna call it) for example, my first character was a Shaman/Occult summoner.  He summons monsters to fight.  His talent trees support minions. Pretty simple.My next few characters died, and finally I decided to play Standard instead of Hardcore difficulty, because I die alot.  My newest and favorite character so far is a Pyro/Arcanist.  At level 38, so far I only have Arcanist to support my massive mana needs.  He's basically a sniper, who wields fire magic as passive along with his sniping/blowing everything up ability.  For the skill tree, I made it so he generates whirlpools of death (25-30%) chance to proc just by attacking things.  Check that with the abovementioned blowing everything up ability, it's pretty damn fun.He still dies sometimes.  I wouldn't suggest anyone to play hardcore difficulty at this time unless you have an extraordinary amount of patience, far more than me to occasionally charge in and die.  Cause you die really easy sometimes.  And sometimes there's no escape from a losing fight.Diablo II I loved it, but it's dated.  Right.  Diablo III I loved it too, but it was pretty simple and basic.  Path of Exile just kindof infuriates me, because it's not really a hard game, so I play hardcore difficulty on it, its fairly easy, until some random obsurdly hard creature kills you out of nowhere.  So I just can't get myself to play that anymore, the randomness is horrible.I have not yet played multiplayer on this game, but I want to.  The few times I've tried to with my hardcore characters I couldn't find any games.  Maybe standard difficulty will find some.Some of the things I said may seem like downers, but don't get me wrong:  I love this game.  I've only been playing it for a few weeks now and there's been big updates since I started, so they're coming in regularly and that's great.  There's voice acting for a lot of it now, even a cinematic sequence when you start the game.It's worth the full $25.  Great game.			"

												**Note : This is going to a very detailed and lenghty review , so I will put a TLDR at the end of this review. Grim Dawn is an isometric ARPG made by Crate. I first bought this game on my other account back in 2015 while it was still in closed beta. From all the ARPGs I have played, mainly D2 & 3, Van Hellsing, TL2, Grim Dawn stood out as one of the best ARPGs I have played in my entire life. Grim Dawn offers a dark atmospheric world where iron bits are worth more than gold, which is why that is the main currency here. The graphics are amazing. Dead bodies hanging from trees? Checked. Blood and gore? Check. Amazing spells? Checked.Here are the pros and cons I feel about this game.Pros : - Items have skills that can be utilised all the way to late game.          - Awesome soundtrack. Really fits the dark and grimy atmosphere.          - Amazing art and graphics.          - Build optimization. You can build your character revolving around your skills, certain items or your devotion             system. ( A special system where you unlock by slowly restoring shrines in the world. )          - Devotion system actually have interesting concepts. Much like the skill tree of Path of Exile, but instead of              adding stats, there are skills and passive skills you can unlock.          - Dedicated developers. They delivered as promised during their kickstarter journey and made every cent              worthwhile.          - Incredible storyline. Amazing nuff said. Scattered around the world are mysterious journal and notes where you             can collect and gain insight and deepen the lore and plot of the game.          - Did I mention dual class systems?          - ♥♥♥♥ ton of secret areas. Omg.Alright, before ya'll get your pickforks and start calling me out for giving only positive reviews, here are some cons I felt the game had.Cons : - Confusing for new players. There are many aspects in the game that require attention to. Physical damage,                         pierce damage etc. There are too many elements and might be confusing for starter players.           - Voice acting. There are only few voice dialogues in the game. Actually understandable because the Crate team               isn't huge and implementing voice dialogues might be a little too taxing and delay updates.           - New content. They recently released a new content which is great, however new content can be a little slow as                                    mentioned, they lack manpower.           -Character customization. You can't customers your characters face etc.All in all, this game is amazing. I bought one during early access and bought another one for my girlfriend to play. This game does not provide DLCs so the only way I feel I could contribute back to the developers is to get more copies. In all seriousness, this game is amazing. Get it if you haven't already. TLDR; get the game. It will make you understand the spirit of ARPG. "

								I was pleasantly surprised by this game. Bought it expecting a bit of casual fun, played for a couple of hours and wow, I'm hooked! This is the first game since Diablo 2 that has given me the same feeling Diablo 2 did. It's difficult enough to be challenging without being tedious or overly complex. Crate did an absolutely fantastic job on this.			"

								tl;dr Buy this game right now, full price if you have to, it is worth every penny and then some.You know when you look at a game and you go, oh yeah I can dig that. Then you buy it, and then look at the clock and you just spent the last 14 hour straight playing? This is one of those games. That should sell you enough without even reading on.So heres the obligatory pros and cons listPros:1. Graphics are very nice and detailed. Much detail went into a lot of the textures, and environmental effects to enhance the feeling of the zone you are in. Also the granularity and amount of settings to tweek would make any enthusiast gamer smile.2. Skills are almost ripped right out of titan quest. Mix and match up to two different skill trees to form your own classes!3. The current story is rather intriguing, and for a game genre not typically inundated with dialogue, it offers nice story depth, and ""bioware-esque"" branching diologue.4. The sounds and music are very well created to the atmospheres you travel around to.5. Closest thing I've ever come across to an open world ARPG. It gives a general direction to head in, and several winding paths and side dungeons to explore, making the map feel massive in scale.6. Fledgling ( Currently ) crafting system which uses upgrades as a currency for crafting multitudes of items. Very exciting to see where they take it from here.7. Offline and Online multiplayer, currently up to 4 players.8. Heres a unique one, The game doesnt treat you like a child, and hold your hand. It gives you the option for pop up tutorials if thats your thing, but after that, it doesnt spoonfeed you easy enemies and a straight path. It tends to let you wander and choose many different ways to get to your goal. Some more painful than others.9. The combat feels punchy and rewarding if you can get the hang of how the A.I. functions and your mastery of the controls.10. THE ABILITY TO MOVE YOUR CAMERA, and to zoom out. These simple buttons make all the world personally. You can view everything in any angle you choose!Cons:1. The graphics / engine. The game is, albeit, an alpha, however it suffers from extreme frame dips, chops, stutters, and minor freezes. It is generally playable, yet sometimes it randomly dips to near unplayable frame rates for no apparent reason, causing many a player to drop their settings.2. The current amount of skill trees feel rather limited to the basics, and it feels rather cramped in comparison to Titan Quest.3. The multiplayer is glitchy, and crahses for reasons unknown more often then appreciated.4. Information on some quests and most items and crafting is very scarce due to the new-ness of the game, which sometimes causes confusion.5. No voice overs on the main bulk of dialogue causes a small feeling of disconnect from the story.In summary, the game will steal many an hour from your spare time if you let it, and they are very well deserved and spent hours, based on the amount of money they are currently asking. The game is in no way finished yet, and there are extremely exciting features coming soon, such as Factions, and hopefully more crafting.			"

												Yes indeed, the linage of all time classics like Diablo 2 and Titan's Quest can be seen through the cracks, Grimm Dawn is indeed deserving of being called the spiritual succesor to both. But hat does not mean it can't stand by it's own right, quite the contrary, the really well done graphics.  the outstanding music and immersive sounds, and the tight controls and addicting gameplay, yes, all by itself Grimm Dawn rightfully earns a place among the best ever.

								If you loved Titan Quest, Diablo 2 and like Path of Exile, then this is your cup of tea. If killing hordes of monsters is a stress releaver for you, look no further. Grim Dawn has a dark story and rich lore, but lets be honest, you love loot. You will grind away (albeit a fun grind) and get all kinds of loot. The game has several classes that allow you create an aray of characters. I currently have a pure Nightblade, a pure Soldier and a Clint Eastwood type Gunslinger. They all feel different and they all kick butt. The game feels very polished for an early access game and the developers are good at keeping us updated. The skill tree is not overly complicated like (POE) and you can go to YouTube and follow guides if you can't decide. I highly recommend Grim Dawn to anyone that likes this genre.			"

It's not finished but what is currently playable is very polished and fun.  At first the game is fairly easy and then progressively gets more difficult.

								Well if u like diablo 2, torchlight  and diablo 3, then u should like this. It has similar gameplay but things like the names of the character stats are different, and it is possible to multi class which is nice. i cant remember what i paid for it but i know it was cheap cos  im a tight ♥♥♥♥ so if u can get it under 15 its a steal. multiplayer is working rather well i have not had 1 CTD and the scaling for extra players joining is great also pretty stable frames with sli gtx670's and i5 3570k oc'd sometimes as low as 40-50fps most of the time around 70+ though at 1080p with all details MAX!

								A very good aRPG. If you liked Titan Quest then you should stop reading this right now and buy. I prefer this to Diablo 3 and would say I put it about even with poe, although I usually end up playing this one wen I want to play an aRPG simply because it requires no internet connection. The class system and upgrade system are great. It's also not finished yet (though pretty close) so it hasn't even sown its full potential. The dev team are solid and have put in consisten work so you can feel confident even tough its early access. The one thing I would criticize most is that even tough I love the design style and the setting, the in-game graphics feel really muddled to me at times, but it doesnt take away from the enjoyability of the mechanics.

								Grim Dawn is the spiritual successor to the classic hack & slasher: Titan Quest. It uses a revamped version of the engine, the same dual class system and talent trees, and there is a lot of randomly generated loot for you to pry out of the cold dead hands of the (un)dead. The zombie apocalypse has broken out, and for some mysterious reason you did not turn into a zombie when you were supposed to. That makes you special, and thus the hero of the story :-)The world is pretty grim, with a bit of a Victorian / Western feel to it. There's magic, there are guns, there's guys with hats, there are zombies, there are goblin-like monsters and lots of angry mutated wildlife. And then there is this cult of Ch'Thon mucking things up. Killing monsters feels satifying, and with a lot of different skills to choose from, you have plenty of viable character builds to try out. With the addition of the Devotion system in beta 29, you have even more options to customize your character as you progress through the game.The faction system starts to develop once you have finished the first major story arc, and it is nice. Each character and monster in the game belongs to a faction. Factions have relationships with each other. If you kill enough Aetherials, they are going to dislike you more and more, to the point where they might start setting up ambushes and sending champion monsters after you. The reverse also works: if you manage to get a good reputation with a faction, you get access to more special items from their vendors, as well as a Bounty Quest table.Another addition to the game over Titan Quest is crafting. You can create magical items appropriate for your level, as well as build some pretty cool Epic items, if you find the plans and obtain the neccessary crafting materials.I started playing in Beta 27, which added the Shaman class. It combines very nicely with the Occultist, because they both offer summonable pets. In previous betas I have tried other class combinations, which had a completely different playstyle. All of them were a lot of fun.Beta 28 and 29 added Act 4 to the game, so the storyline is now complete. Judging on my progress so far, the storyline is going to take about 30 hours to complete on a first playthrough.If you want to see some gameplay, I have a let's play series going with my Conjurer (Shaman/Occultist) that started in beta 27, and played all through beta 28 and 29:

								What can anyone say about this game, nothing bad I hope! Deciding to write a gist of a review for this game I now look back from the humble beginnings through till today to only have a few things in response for the readers; Well done Crate Entertainment, well done; You should pat one another's backs and relish in your creativity and fanaticism for this diamond in the ruff. The game is not even finished and I am still chipping away for hours to my much loved and enjoyed time for there is so much to do in this vast yet beautiful world you your selves have brought to light.PROs : - Everything from the camps, towns and to my delight a city yet to traverse with lots of amazing characters and environments to the over all game play itself. I would highly require more to pick up this book and join the thrills and chills. Always finding new things around the corner as I travel the vast changing lands and the characters, all unique individuals leaves me always looking for more only to be more aspired to continue my journey across the realm of Cairn with much hopes of furthering my own story with the established world for exploration. So go ahead, pick it up and delve in; You won't regret a thing, enjoy.CONs : - For the only down side is that, well, it is not finished, so the story ends as Crate Entertainment release parts for new hopes towards all the bright eyed adventurers out there. Patience is required that is well worth all the grueling waiting and self distractions.Overall one of the best ARPGs I've played to date, Try it today and please support the ingeniously awesome group behind this ravishing tale of heroism you all have, currently playing or Only heard wisps of it's name, Grim Dawn.Author William L.

												UPDATED REVIEW:So, Grim Dawn has been finally Released and I beated the game, I am very happy with this game, TQ Devs did a great job in TQ and GD.Grim Dawn in the Release had, and maybe still has, some issues with AMD gpus but also my NVIDIA card burned to death in a area that I don't wan't to spoil but be ware of Mid Act 2 Side Area.It has a controller support, i haven't really tested but my Wireless Xbox 360 Controller was automatically dected.Now let's talk about my impressions about loot and Gameplay,The Loot might be better than Diablo 3 for you but for me, who played Diablo 3 Trial to level 15, It was way better.The Game has 4 difficulities which 2 are given by default and 2 are given when you complete the game on that Difficulity for Example:Normal,Veteran->Elite->Ultimate(yes those are the 4 difficulities).If you play on Normal you will play like a normal ARPG but in Veteran you will get much better loot than Normal, also the monsters are a bit difficult for Casters, for me a tank self healer, it was easy to defeat every boss.The World is very big and it might get bigger(I saw some fields on the map very far from the towns and in Beta there was a Area that got cutted).Gameplay wise, it's a ARPG which you control your character with your mouse and has 1-0(10) Skill hotkeys and LMB,RMB, also it has an additional quickbar by pressing Y,also like i said you will love loot in the final difficulities, though it might get borring finding the legendaries you want.Conclusion:The game has a lot of quest to offer; 1 endless dungeon for loot; 4 difficulities,which in 2 of those you have to start over its like NG+ don't worry you won't be naked but you might be if you didn't prepare for Ultimate or Elite, hehe, Anyway I think this game is worth the money and if you want to play their old games, buy TQ(you might notice it's not made by Crate Entertaiment. Crate Ent. is the newest TQ company that has old members of TQ company)ORIGINAL REVIEW:This ARPG has a nice atmosphere, in the begining you are at a dark world but in Act 2 you are at a semi-bright world, I honestly think this game will be the most popular ARPG,why? beacuse its gonna have mod support,it(might) wont have problems in the launch.The game itself has a really wierd story and its grindy but for those who like grinding games they wont get bored easily.The Lengedary loot as i read is gonna be 1 per character but it might change beacuse the game is designed for level 200 so it might have like a low or medium chance to get lengedaries in level 60,75(Release level).This game features a dungeon where(im pretty sure) you wont get bored,that dungeon is challanging and has a good loot and as you go to many floors it gets harder, if you die you have to go to those floors all over again.The game has even a hardcore mode if you really wanna loose all your stuff you can do that,I havent gone into hardcore mode but im 100% sure it wont give you any bonuses it will be just a challange.What I forgot to say is,the game is based on a apocalyptic dark world where there is only some surviours but some are enemies,and you can do some side quests with the enemies side also the max level for now is 35.

												Updated.Grim Dawn is a very playable Early Access action RPG game that  shows great potential  and promisses well crafted game when  released.Very neat skill tree and great maps giving you a lot of fun and running around .Dungeons are at nearly every  corner so you won't get bored .In GD you will find  loads of quests ,bosses ,great loot ,which can be upgraded by using essences ,secret receipies ,and most of all great ,exciting adventure.Your  character can be build by using 2 classes out of 4 available at the moment.Demolitionist and Occultist are classes I've choosen for my hero .Those are giving me a lot of funkilling monsters by using variety of weapon such as mace ,sword ,gun ,crossbow or (my favourite) visual breathtaking casting spells! :)I can also have up to 2 pets Raven and Hellhound which skills can also be increased.Crafting available !!!!At the moment there is only human hero  available (I wish for more variety here!)for both male and female fans. No customisation  either for characters  but I believe that option will be introduced soon.I would recommed this game to all fans of it's type ,and as a proof I can tell you thatso far I've spent over 30 h playing Grim Dawn and I am still discovering first act .!!!:)I'm having more fun with Grim Dawn than Diablo 3 which cost me 60 e and  it was completed within 22 h.There has been  major update since my last review : The Multiplayer option is now available  ,and also two handed weapon were introduced .A few skills have been added ,and a lot of bugs fixed.The game is even more amazing than before :)I've bougth this game 2 years ago when it was in very early stage of development and I was amazed at that time because game was playable and I enjoyed it.Today I just like to add that I do not regret early acces buy .It was well worth it to wait 2 years and see the full capacity of Grim Dawn .I've played already 90h and I just can't get enough of it.It leaves behid well know titles of similar genre .Fair play to Crate studio ,they have managed to craft beautifull piece of art.

Early Access Review
								Oh so addicting. This game does everything right to pull you in from the start and make sure that the only time you want to stop playing is to create a new a character to try a different build using the +poison damage gear you've found. At the same time the game doesn't restrict you from changing your current build. For example, 8 hours in I respecced from building around two active abilities and fire and burn damage damage into two different active abilities and cold and lighting damage. I was having some trouble with certain situations and was finding my damage output lacking against bosses so I looked at what gear I had and what I could change around with my skill points and after a few iterations came with a mostly different build which performed better. The change felt organic. The game strikes a very good balance between giving players the freedom to change their current build and making them feel like the choices they made are meaningful.Everything about the game feels like it takes the better elements from its predecessors and organically combines them into something that has its own identity. The atmopsphere is gritty and dark like the Diablo series but with a futuristic twist as early forms of firearms and explosives are available. The dual mastery system from Titan Quest is back but the skill trees have more synergy within themselves and each other as the damage and damage bonuses in most abilities are split between two different types. But more importantly the game isn't afraid to add something new. The crafting system and the faction system along with quests that offer some meaningful choices are the big things that come to mind at this stage.The game world feels much more alive and interesting than most other games. The dialogue is organic and appropriate to the situations. For example, at one point you may encounter a pair trying to scam some money off you and you can decide whether to respond with violence or allow them to join the community you're building up. If you choose the latter and talk to them later on they will express their gratitude for not killing them and how they probably had no chance in combat against you. They also share how they struggled to survive prior to the current encounter. Encounters like these make the player feel invested in the gameworld and builds up the atmosphere, soemthing a lot of modern games fail to do and instead rely on a few cinematics and a diary entry around every corner. While this game has the diary entries, they are well spaced out and actually anwser some of the burning questions the player might have about the gameworld so unlike many other games, I actually read most of them.Another thing that adds to the atmosphere and to the experience as a whole is the dynamic weather system. It also acts as an important offset to the lack of randomly generated levels. I have no complaints about the level design itself but running through the same exact level tends to get old after a while and the dynamic weather spices things up a bit.All in all this game is shaping up to be one of the best ARPG out there and thats bound to improve as development progresses.

Early Access Review
								So far, the game is pretty neat. The gameplay is quick, fun and entertaining. The controls are quite responsive. The graphics are very decent. The music is fitting. The art style is nice and the game is up it's own butt with atmosphere. It's been a long time I had a game like Diablo or Dungeon Siege to keep me occupied, and now it's here.The UI and the way the game is presented could be improved, however. Often times it seems the screen is cluttered with text, or my HUD is getting in the way. Other than that, this game is a real gem. Truly underrated as far as it being Early Access.I haven't tried the Multiplayer feature yet, so I won't say anything in that regard.This is one of those games I wish more people would get involved in. I recommend it to all you dungeon crawler-loving gamers. Be prepared for fast-paced action and hordes of zombies, demons, beasts and bugs. Not to mention all the 4HAT L3WT you'll find along the way.			"

								Short and sweet version. This game is fun. Better and more realistic than that other triple A title. The environments and models don't look like they are made out of plastic like that one free to play title. And it is super easy to just jump in and play with a progressive learning curve and if you totally screw up your spec just go talk to a guy and reset your points and try something different.I've played the demolitionist and the nightblade and both feel powerful and dynamic with lots of impact on damage and plenty of blood and gore. Highly recommend this title and kudos to the devs for nailing the atmosphere!			"

												Grim Dawn.  Fitting that I've been playing this game lately.  I feel like I have my own grim dawn looming, as much as my character runs around killing a ridiculous amount of monsters attempting to fend off the Impending Apocalypse, or Certain Doom, or whatever the goal is here.  I'm not really sure.  Something bad is happening, and I've got to stop it.The last time I was in the hospital they told me how fortunate it was for me that the cath team was already in the lab for someone else and I could get right in.  I saw them wheel that person out with a sheet over them, even though they tried to pull my gurney back so that I wouldn't.  Ah, stories to tell.The story is always secondary though, and what really matters is progress.  Get better gear, learn new skills, get stronger, kill more monsters.  Which brings me to the only thing I do not like about Grim Dawn.  The monsters scale, so that even as I level up, so do they, which I feel loses a lot of the feeling of progress.  As I'm never shy to point out, I'm older than video games, and have always enjoyed the feeling of going back to an early area in a game just to get the satisfaction of seeing how much stronger I am than the enemies that I once struggled against.That's just my opinion on scaling though, and there are certainly reasons for doing it, despite my feelings.  I guess enemy scaling is just like life though.  I'm going back to the hospital tomorrow, and just like Grim Dawn, I always get the feeling that no matter how much I think I've progressed, my disease has kept pace, and levelled up with me.There are obviously way more things I like about this game though, as I am playing it, so let's look at those!  You've got a skill tree where you can multi-class that feels kind of like Rift, another constellation based set of skills that kind of feels like Path of Exile, though no one has such a huge tree as PoE, crafting that makes you hoard piles of strangely named objects, just in case you find you need them one day for a Thing You Want, enhancements for your gear that add new skills, whew, there is some depth to creating your character is what I'm saying.I guess if I had to sum it up in one word, I'd say Grim Dawn is a mix between Diablo (the good one), Path of Exile, and a pirated version of Photoshop that is somehow missing most of the color palette.  It's a great game to play while drinking gin, in order to avoid wondering just when you will get your well deserved Darwinian death.I know this is probably my worst review ever, but if you have managed to read this far I would like to say one thing.  Steam censoring would render it completely unreadable though, so I will say this instead.If you smoke, you are stupid.  Very stupid.  I'm not putting you down, I have been that stupid for thirty five years.  I just hope you can understand that you are paying big companies to kill you.  If you could even feel how scary this is, and know that you did it to yourself, well, maybe you could keep playing cool games like Grim Dawn for a very long time.			"

Early Access Review
								Pros: + Fantastic atmosphere+ Very good graphics overall, if a wee bit dated+ Combining classes and trying out new builds can be quite fun, even if they don't really work well. + Ease of respec (not masteries though) encourages experimentation+ Great dev team+ Steady updates+ Rotatable camera+ Very good loot+ Endless mode (essentially)+ Good crafting systemCons:- Sometimes TOO dark and depressing- Combat is okay, but still comes off rather clunky at times- Many skills feel distinctly underwhelming- Typical post apocalyptic color palette of grays and browns- Story is incredibly basic (so far)- Enemy balance feels a bit off- Some graphical issues here and there, most likely due to relatively little optimization, which is understandable for a Early Access game- Open multiplayer servers means playing with random people is risky due to hackers and cheatersI love Diablo (the best of the trilogy) Diablo 2, and Diablo 3. This game borrows heavily from the second installment, as well as their previous game Titan Quest, to make an unpolished but fun ARPG which, in my opinion, is the third best isometric ARPG on the market today. It belongs right up there with Marvel Heroes and Diablo 3, though technically MH is more of a MMOARPG. A must buy for ARPG fans, doubly so for those who enjoy stories with Lovecraftian elements. Will update the review as I get further into the game.			"

9/10 Overall Rating for aRPG fansGreat game, and not a boringly easy one, if you play Vanilla, no Mods, no use of Guides to follow a ""perfect"" build made by someone else, no use if GrimCalc to do your build ""on paper"" before using s Skill, Mastery and Devotion points in game. Devs are fairly active on Steam forums, much more active on thei Official online forums, but the do respond to bug repots, complaints and suggestions. Regular bugfixes, balance tweaks and other updates. That said, there are some good Mods (availble from players on the online Grin Dawn forums), GrimCalc to test ride builds, and Guides here n Steam to show you how to build the ""perfect"" toon (barring really bad luc with gear drops for every Class other than your own, lol!). So, there are lots of resources at your disposal, if you don;t feel like figuring it all out as you go.I prefer to play Vanillla, and prefer to play solo, figuring the game out as I go. The game is very similar to Titan Quest, which makes sense, It uses the same game engine pretty much, and many of the Devs are ex-TQ devs. It's a hack & slash quest driven aRPG. The similarities really ended there for me.Grim Dawn has amazing graphics. The dark, post-apocalyptic feeling is so well conveyed through the dark and gloomy lighting, settings, horrifc monsters, flashy light shows during certain attacks, the music is perfectly suited... it all adds to the immersion for me. The targeting system is perfect for the game. You know exactly which monster(s), monster Hero(es) or Boos(es) your attacks are hitting. Really huge map, with great replayability, which is good, since it is an aRPGm and you have to farm for gear and components. A bit annoying how rarely gear suitable for your build(s) drop, but... more killing! Aways a good thing. It is a heavy-ish grind game, so keep that in mind.The Difficulty settings are good. Normal, for new players, to learn the game. Normal (veteran) for more experinced aRPG players, moving into Epic, Legendary and Ultimate. Difficulty, opponent stegnth and loot scales with your character level nicely. Softcore mode allows you to die and respawn, losing Exp points, that can be partially recovered if you return to your Player Grave and click it. And finish off whatever killed you there, lol! Hardcore is perma-death. You die, start over from scratch. Inventory space feel slightly cramped, but you do have a transfer stash to store items in and dole them out to other characters. And, I tend to be a hoarder, reluctant to sell items I think I might want to switch around. I need t learn to let go. There is a GDVault out there somewhere, like TQVault, a third party program for storing and tranferring large amounts of gear and goodies. I haven't used either one, for either game, so I can't really say how well they a wrok, but from forums postings on Steam and online, they seem very popular with die-hard fans f of both games.Runs really well, even on a toaster, with good settings options to customize for best performance.  (My current specs- Windows 7 SP 1 64 bit, AMD FX-4130 @3.8 Ghz, NVIDIA 740GT (2Gb MSI), 16 Gb DDR3 RAM), old HDD, and a budget Gigabyte mobo)... and I can run on Medium + some High settings (all custom adjusted for my rig) at 60 fps, no issues. Some occasional minor fps drops, barely noticed, usually during REALLY populated battles, none of the rubberbanding TQ:AE is famous for. I am honestly impressed with how well it runs on my old, mouldy toaster. Can't say how it runs on a non-budget-build rig or beast rig, since I haven't got one, lol! I'll get back to you when I have all the component for a full rebuild and major upgrade.All in all, if you like aRPG's like TQ, PoE, and Torchlght, you will probably enjoy this game as much as I do.But, you won;t know unless you play it, eh? Worth full price, even better if you get it on sale here or from Humble Bundle or another legit Steam Key discount site.			"

												Grim Dawn may be a little harder to get into than most hack n' slashes, but it's crafted with an old-school gaming approach coupled with newer solutions found in the latest games.Rich, dark atmosphere has a surprising amount of depth and choices that impact gameplay. While the storyline isn't that involving (saving the world from invading monster factions and learning why), seeing how the people in-game are affected definitely is. Under all this there's plenty of cleverly hidden lore and hard-to-find secret areas.Pros:+Good twist on typical skill tress, where you select two classes and find synergy between them, and decide how deeply you invest into a class+Devotion is a system of common abilities that can back up the weakness of your character. For example, if you lack survivability, you can go for a number of defensive procs. The shrines for these devotion points are found throughout the world, which encourages exploration+Very cool bosses, tough dungeons, good enemy variety+An interesting faction system to make the grind matter a little more+Powerful legendary items that are rarer than in most ARPGs, making them more prestigious+After 200 hours, there's still so much to doCons- Netplay experience may vary- Often doesn't feel rewarding enough. You'll have a very hard time finding legendaries for your build, may have to trade- Feels grindy. It takes a lot of time to slog through all the difficulties to get to Ultimate, and farming infamy for the enemy factions can be very tediousWith hundreds of build combinations, an expansive world, and the ability to play with friends, Grim Dawn breathes new life into the old-school hack n' slash games. It may feel too grindy at times, but the combat is crisp and satisfying at all times.			"

												This game has gone from a very good early access title to a full blown Action RPG magnum opus. So many quests with a fully fleshed out back story, more loot than you could ever imagine and a class system as deep as any in gaming. This game is just stellar in nearly every way. If it only had the same music composer as Diablo and it would be ""perfect"". If you have had this in your library a while but not played since launch, give it a go again trust me.			"

								Probably one of the few early access games that is well worth the full price. Even though it has the early access tag it's polished, plays well, and the development crew is in touch with its user base. I've bought one too many games in early access that have steady development for 6 months then it drops off a cliff or is abandoned entirely... this is definitely not one of those cases.For any fans of Diablo or any of hack n slash, this is a must buy. Lots of replayability and variance between classes. I've only put 20ish hours in but each time they update I get sucked in once more. I can see myself playing this well past final release and will definitely support the devs with any other project and/or expansion.			"

Early Access Review
								Despite being in beta (early access) the game is very well fleshed out up to level 40. I've only encountered a couple bugs. Gameplay wise I find it just as fun - if not more-so - than Path of Exile (PoE). Both Grim Dawn and PoE borrow heavily from other games in terms of character progression. Grim Dawn from Titan Quest, and PoE from Final Fantasy 7 and 10.Grim Dawn isn't an always-online game like PoE however can be played multi-player online or locally. It also allows you to circle the camera around to get a full look at the environment, which Path doesn't. My main gripes with this game is its continued use of Diablo-style isometric gameplay (instead of straight 3D 3rd person action RPG), lack of multi-character control and unoriginality in terms of character progression. That said isometric ""Diablo-style"" Action RPGs are still one of my favorite genres and it's way worth the buy, even in beta.			"

												This one line pretty much sums it up:The Diablo 3 we never had.Runs incredibly well on max settings with a rocksolid 60 FPS on my GTX970 and intel i5 3.4GHz.It's indeed a bit graphically dated, as most reviews have mentioned, but it honestly doesn't bother me in the slightest, where it lacks in raw beauty (textures and stuff), it makes up in effects.Another huge deal maker for me personally (as one of those weird ""controller on pc"" gamers): it has controller support and integrated it very well (movement and combat feel as natural as while playing by mouse).My only gripe:When altering graphical settings mid-game, it completely locks up the game, to the point of requiring to hard-reboot my computer, is this a known issue and being worked on?Please keep up the great work!

VerdictBuy now!Buy on saleSave your moneySummary:Grim Dawn is a great ARPG for fans of the genre and new players alike. It blends the best parts of Diablo and Titan Quest and exceeds both of them, without doing anything amazing of its own right. It just delivers a fun experience and gives you an insight into what Diablo III could have been had it been done right (let’s not even talk about the DII Auction House at launch…).This game has been a long time in the making and it shows. The worlds are large and open and yet you never feel lost. There is a ton of content to get through and yet you never feel forced to do it. Nice touches like the bounty system to increase faction rep and the portal system enhance and ease gameplay. The character development is interesting, with the ability to dual class from level 10 (if you so desire) and choose a variety of options from each class. Along with a devotion system, which further opens up interesting class choices – this game just does it right.Throw in a very reasonable price tag and you should add this game to your collection today.The Good:Character developmentHuge amount of contentValue for moneyThe Bad:UI interface could look a little nicerAs with all ARPGs can feel like more of the same after a whileThe Ugly:N/AOverall Score:8/10			"

								In my opinion the best ARPG out there.  Creative world-building, beautiful item art, and interesting character classes.  It also has a bunch of innovative new character development systems such as devotion and factions.  I've enjoyed other ARPGs like PoE, D3, Torchlight 2 and Titan Quest, but this is my favourite by a long shot.			"

Early Access Review
								I was looking for a great action RPG. Grim dawn has stopped me from searching. I have had this game since very early access as the theme of the game caught my attention. I've gotten about 5 friends to purchase this game and multiplayer is very fun ( although a little buggy at times still much fun ). The developers usually keep you updated every couple of weeks so you know that more content will be coming as it goes and they have been very on the ball with this.As far as gameplay goes it feels very fluid based on the class you create. Spells and abilities are well tuned and all work well together ( I mean if you multiclass you feel you can mix and match yourself well ). They introduced a faction system which means you can be liked and hated by NPC parties in the game which can cause boss enemies to spawn or harder monsters. On the good side it allows you to purchase nice items from NPC vendors in towns based on the faction.The story is also very well done and ive heard mixed reviews on the fact no NPC reads their text to you - but personally I kind of like that. As you play through youll find notes and scripts about the lore of the game which I also like it is almost like you add a journal of story as you play the game which in itself is a reward.All in all I highly recommend grim dawn - theres at least 20 hours of gameplay and with all the muilticlassing you can do theres plenty more. Hidden areas and bosses are also out there.. happy hunting. "

								WOW! Im blown away. Iv been looking for a new Diablo/Sacred/Titan Quest style game and this is it. Im shocked at how great this game is. This game has my vote.Amazing graphicsAmazing classes and skills(has a great skill tree) as well as weapons and armor/itemsAmazing animationsDark atmosphereLove the looting and leveling upAmazingly fun game playGreat musicIt even has guns! And if you dont like using guns, then grab a sword, crossbow, shield, or whenever you like. It has it all !!!Love the classes and skills. I find all the skills for each class awesome. You know in like diablo 3 where most of the skills are lame and look lame with lame animations? Not this game. The classes are awesome with all good skill trees. Makes me wanna make every character. And if thats not enough then not only can you pick a class, you can choose 2 classes and be a hybrid(hybrid is optional). Ever seen a crazy armored demolisionist throwing bombs will shooting up everything around him + tanking all enemies? Its awesome. Again, you can choose to be hybrid or just stay one class, choice is up to you. And if you go one class and then later decide you want to be hybrid you can at anytime.This game adds so much more to hack and slash style games. This game sets a record in my book. And just to think that the game is still in development makes it even better. This game accomplished what the others could not and it isnt even finished yet. Cant wait to see more content/updates.Theres ONLY ONE thing that I found to been an issue and thats optimization. The game runs a bit choppy. Running max setting at 60fps+ but its still choppin and skippin somtimes at 60fps. Its not that bad tho. I cant wait to see whats in the future. This game is worth every penny.Grim dawn is way better then Diablo 3. I loved Diablo 1, 2, and 3 as well as Titan Quest and Sacred Series. Heck I was still playing Diablo 2 with mods till I bought this. But Grim Dawn takes it to a whole new level. It takes all my favorite hack and slash Diablo/Sacred/Titan Quest style games and throws them into one creating the best H&S RPG I have ever played. You can't go wrong with Grim Dawn. If you have the money to buy it. Then buy it.10/10			"

												The spiritual sucessor to Titan Quest.It's a very grungey and dark ARPG and has an apocalyptic/steampunk feel to it. The environments are lush and make you feel involved with the world, the music is also quite nice.For a game still in development, it plays very well. The combat is great but sometimes feels sluggish, such as moving your character during combat and switching target. The class system is great and I love the different skills and abilities than come with each. I can't wait to get to max level (at this time) and start up another character to level. If development proceeds and updates are continuous, I could see this overtaking Diablo, a game I have also invested a lot of time into.I give it, 8/10 Prunes----------------------------------------Because the game has been released now, the only thing I will revise is that it has got better due to all of the content being in the game and the constant work the devs are putting into it, providing more updates and fixes. The only issue is the amount of players, we need more!!I now give it, 8.5/10 Prunes			"

The skill system is diverse and the items too. You have crafting. You have relics you can piece together. The existing content is both fun and diverse set in a gritty enviroment. This early acces title despite being unfinished has given people a bunch of play time with over 10+ possible class combinations you wont be putting this game down anytime soon. Highly reccomend for any true fan of the ARPG genre.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a review as of Build 24If you're looking for a nostalgic ARPG experience good for at least one 15-20 hr playthough, this game will likely satisfy you.If you're looking to repeat the experience, you have to be willing to accept that there are some things that are not up to current standards. Some or all of these things may bother you, I know that not all of them bother me.The map is 95% the same every single game. The overall structure is exactly the same but they will put obstructions on random sections of path so that you can't always run the exact same path every single game. Along with this, I'm *pretty* certain that monster spawns are the same every game, with maybe hero/champion/unique spawns occurring in a semi-random fashion.Monster spawns are sometimes triggered by your walking over a, well, trigger point. These are usually only configured assuming you are coming from one direction. This means rather than spawning when you get close to a point, monsters will frequently end up spawning behind you if you like to explore 100% of a region. This feels really sloppy and gets tedious as it forces you to double back if you want to kill everything.Monsters scale to your level (with certain seeming minimum and maximum levels) and monsters that spawn as a result of certain actions (either map triggers or summons by other monsters) will spawn at different levels than the already present monsters. This can result in a monster multiple levels higher than you (I've seen ones up to ~10 levels higher than me) spawning things your level, or things way lower level than you (up to ~20 levels lower) spawning things at your level. While most of the skill points you spend can be unspent for an extremely reasonable amount, there are a relatively large number that can't be retrieved. You can get ~120 skill points currently, of which you may end up sinking 50-75 into places that you can't get them back from. When the level cap increases, I expect this to become less of an issue but currently it can lead to lots of regret.At each level up you obtain 1 ""stat point"" to be spent on one of three stats. This might lead you (me) into believing this game was set up like Dungeon Siege to a certain point with full armor sets based on one or two of these stats. This would be a lie. Almost all armor ends up requiring a certain amount of physique (read: strength) and no other stats. Almost all rings/amulets end up needing a certain amount of spirit (read: int/wis) and I've never seen one rely on anything else. Some weapons require cunning (read: dex) or spirit, but most rely on physique. These stat points cannot be reallocated. Sadface.This game is kind of oldschool in that the concept of utility skills/powers does not really exist. If you need healing, you will be expected to rely mainly on potions or out of combat things. If you want to move faster or drain health, that will mostly be due to your gear. From my observation, only the two melee trees (soldier/nightblade aka fighter/rogue) have things like this. As a result, almost all of the builds I see on here use one or both of these trees or try to avoid any situation in which they would take damage.I haven't tried it but don't feel like there is currently a viable ""pet"" class. The Occultist tree gives 2 pets, but you can only summon 1 copy of each (from what I've seen) which is pretty thin for a pet class.I think I've complained a lot and you're probably wondering why I've still given a positive review (if you're still reading). That would mostly be due to the potential for future development. Most/all of the things I've mentioned could be fixed with post-release player created workshop mods or by the dev team in a future Build.As it stands, I believe the EA game is worth $10-15 to me, and that's what I paid at some point this was on sale. If you're hard up for a new Torchlight/Diablo/TQ/etc fix, this might be worth more to you. Asked right now, I don't think I'd pay $25.If I really needed a fix though, I'd probably pay the $25.			"

												This is a Neutral review, but due to Steam's 'Love It Or Hate It' voting system, I'm selecting against it due to how the end game works.The game itself has four acts, with each act consisting of a major plot arc as the main character (you) explores the land to unite with survivors and repel an otherworldly invasion. I mostly enjoyed exploring every nook and cranny during the first act. Then that feeling died quick as the game placed valuable upgrades throughout the area, making the exploring portion mandatory to stand a chance at later difficulties. I spent 40 hours with my latest Hardcore character (not dead as of this review), and clocked 27 hours of those 40 exploring the map for shiny shrines and attributes gained through side quests. It was a struggle to beat the game the first time by act 3 and took several breaks to get the urge to finish the rest of the game. Overall, the 'Normal' difficulty version of the game is worth checking out.My main gripe with the game is it relies on difficulty being resistance based. In the game, there are 8 major resistances and 3 other important damage types not covered by the major 8. If a player is able to get a resistance stat above 50%, the game allows for a struggle in the fight, where that player can take a hit while delivering damage and not instantly run at the sight of taking damage. Coupled that by having only 1 healing potion to use at a time, a person playing Hardcore has to grind previous difficulties to get their resistances up or they will die, no exceptions. It made it very boring because I couldn't progress the story for the later difficulties at all, at least safely.The game further chooses to disrespect the player's time by not providing a reliable means to improve the most common 4 types of damage: Vitality, Aetherial, Chton, and Poison. Elemental Resistance is plenty in the game, so much so, it almost shouldn't exist where I got a shoulder plate to drop that gave +30% to all elements on top of the 40% element resist from Shrines. For those four I mentioned, there are almost no significant ways to improve them through Components (items you socket into items) and Augments (items you earn through factions that apply on top of the components), meaning you need to get lucky and hope an item drops with what you need.Damage bonuses are flat multipliers, so damage quickly becomes fixed if one doesn't use multipliers through curses or items that decrease resistances or defenses. The game doesn't support glass cannons properly because of that and teaches over time to just focus on defense because your damage will be good enough for almost all the fights. Only when my resistances weren't high against the damage type I was facing was I concerned about needing to do damage in a quick manner.I could probably write about 3 pages worth of complaints in design decisions with information to prove those points, but to save your time I recommend playing the game through Normal difficulty and stopping there, even though the game gimps most characters through their Shrine system having the rest of the Devotion points be available in later difficulties. It'll be a massive time sink gearing up a character to handle the later difficulties with no progression in completing those higher challenges.			"

								Did you play Titan Quest? Do you like action RPGs? Do you wish that Diablo 3 hadn't been a giant flaming pile of dog s%$# on release?This is your game.Path of Exile is okay. It's not great. This one is great. Not only is it made by some of the same people who made Titan Quest (in the same engine), but it has atmosphere. Great music, environments, gear, and it's hard.It doesn't hold your hand and let you change your build. You can build your character wrong. I think you can respec, but that's for losers who can't live with their decisions. You can pick two classes, just like Titan Quest, and combine skills from them. This is the real flavor of the game, aside from the hack and slashing and looting. The class system in Titan Quest was quite good, and it works well in this game.Once this one is done, I recommend it to everyone who likes a good loot and scoot. It's in a good state now, but the third act isn't in the game yet. I'd say get it if it's on sale, but wait until it's released to get it otherwise.			"

The most important thing I want to say to all who are still considering buying or haven't yet decided - THIS GAME IS WORTH OF ITS MONEY:- It's fun- it looks very good (better than on videos here, actually. the devs should upload new ones  ) - it is constantly updated, the devs team listents to ppl, you can see that they are devoted to their work- the atmosphere of the game is pretty cool. It's darkish and not cartoonish like let's say Torchlight. - there are no bugs as of the moment of me writing the reviewOne of the best features is that all classes in game feel unique. And what's even better is that you can combine 2 diff classes as u progress through the game. Thus you would probably spend more time in this game trying all the classes than in other rpg's.			"

The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is compelling.  The rewards are difficult but attainable and the replay factor is HUGE.  Although only two acts are completed, I've created dozens of various characters trying to get a feel for where to spend my time (LOL - Thats already done !)  A fine game at $60.00 a steal and so worthwhile at anything less.  Please give this game a chance - if you like the genre then you will love this game and be supportorting an up and coming powerhouse of a game company.  These guys have some great talent and if we can keep them in business then we might get a post apocalyptic zombie killer hack and slash from them in the future :) (HINT HINT)			"

								Hi, I'm Kurjuutus and I'm an aRPG addict.Had around 5 hours in-game before 13.12.2015. Bought this year (or something) ago and tried for a while and threw away. If you're like me and have done the same, now is a good time to start Grim Dawn again. Now clocking 23.4 hours and counting!My history with aRPG's are mostly on Diablo series. Starting from first. I loved Diablo3. Fast paced action with lots of balls in it, even though they made game more ""dumb"". Now Diablo 3 is pretty much dead, been craving for a good aRPG. Path of Exile for some reason doesn't fit my gameslist. Maybe cause it feels so slow and balless? Yes yes I know you can make many fancy builds etc etc.Anyway, I really recommend Grim Dawn to any aRPG fans around here. It's fast paced, it has very good leveling and even better gear system. I've only just scratched surface for now, my first character at level 36. Oh, and I'm playing solo..Perhaps more thoughts about this game incoming once I've completed storyline and tried endgame, if there is any.			"

												I initially went into Grim Dawn with low expectations. Maybe it would be a dark fantasy Titan Quest at best. To say Grim Dawn surpassed my expectations would be selling the game short.Core gameplay is standard genre fare; grind enemies into a fine paste and collect items off of their dead bodies. The combat itself has a nice weight to it, my Blademaster felt like a whirlwind tearing through groups. Progression uses the dual skill tree system from Titan Quest. A first tree is picked at level 1, and then the second is picked at level 10. There is no restrictions on mixing trees, so a variety of different builds are available. Skills in the tree aren’t just selected, a player is given three points on level ups to use.  A player can either choose to level up masteries, which has skills at 5 point intervals, or one of the aforementioned skills. This system forces a player to choose between immediate returns of available skills or investing in mastery points to unlock stronger skills. In practice the system mostly works, but can cause some pacing issues towards the end of a skill tree. Around Act 3 there was a huge difficulty jump, and the skill to finish my build felt like it required too much investment in masteries to unlock. Itemization is average for this type of game. Most of the items are just straight stat boosts, but the character is given plenty of choices for damage. There are ten resistances available to the player and enemy. All of the resistances see use without one over shining the rest. It is important to note that Legendaries are treated as end game build defining items. They start dropping at level 50, or around the end of the first difficulty. Where Grim Dawn really sets itself apart from the genre is the story and atmosphere. The game starts out with a cutscene to give some exposition about aetherials invading the world. Then the player is dropped into a post-apocalyptic world. From here the player isn’t given much in the way of outright story. Instead hints are dropped about how exactly civilization collapsed, the history of the world, humanities place in the three way war that is being waged, and much more. The main plot is more or less the player trying to survive, eventually becoming a ‘hero’ because frankly the developers need a reason to explain why my Blademaster has killed 24,500 enemies. The atmosphere is what brings everything together. From the get-go it is established that this is a terrible world. Other games have tried the dark fantasy thing, but often feel sterile despite there being blood and corpses everywhere. A set of notes that drop in an area tell a story. A family of four is fleeing the aetherial invasion and food is scarce, but there are rumors that the cultists who have risen up to fight the aetherial invasion will provide shelter to anyone willing to join. The family is forced to join the cult. In time the mother starts to buy into the ideology while the father just grits his teeth to make sure the children have food. The story ends with the women realizing that the family she joined the cult to protect would be safer as sacrifices to the blood god.As mentioned before, the cult has risen up to fight the aetherials. Make no mistake, these cultists are no friends of anyone sane. The aetherials sole goal is to claim the world for themselves, enslaving humanity in the process. The remnants of an empire are caught in the middle trying to fend off both sides while reclaiming civilization.This three-way war is illustrated in gameplay through encountering cultists and aetherials fighting each other. When the player engages one side, they will keep on fighting. At times they will side with each other to fight the player, but there has been times where they simply ignore the player and continue their assault, as if accepting the help.The game is loaded with small scenarios that provide opportunities for choice and consequence. There was a man lying in the road bleeding out, and according to this man was betrayed by his partner. Either way he was dead and there was nothing I could do to help him. Except to honor his last request to track down his killer.I do so and the person begs me to let them explain what happened. He explains that the man lying in the road was indeed his partner, but he acted in self-defense to stop the ex-partner from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ his daughter. There is no other NPC in sight. What do I do? Is the daughter hiding or am I be being played a fool? The attention to detail in all of these things give the world an authenticity that the genre hasn’t had in a long time. Since Diablo 2 in fact. Yes, it’s that good. This isn’t the game for someone wanting a fun 1,000 hour min/max item grind; that is Diablo 3. This isn’t the game for someone wanting to replay the game 50 times trying out off the wall builds; that is Path of Exile. This is the game for someone who wants the fun gameplay of the genre with a well realized dark fantasy world. Crate Entertainment is a studio to watch. I know that I’ll be watching for the first Grim Dawn expansion.			"

								This is the best ARPG I've seen in a looong-looong time. I purchased this gem over a year ago, and I still enjoying it. It's not a grindfest like D3, the skill system is pretty rewarding. There is so much option, so many different classes you could make. Of course there is some elements and levels which can be pretty annoying, but overall the game design and mechanic worth it in every aspect. The new additions rewarding as well, well-tested, and rich. Every patch and update makes this game even more enjoyable, and that's a really rare thing nowadays. The sound and level design is also fantastic! I like the little bit twisted, dark, and fully unique environment as well. Grim Dawn is an instant-get title.			"

								Melds the best elements from Titan Quest, (primarily class system/augmentation/itemization) while going for more of a Diablo II-ish setting, which could best be described as gothic steampunk.If you were a fan of the Diablo series, primarily Diablo II, definitely pick this up.If you thought Titan Quest had great mechanics, but didn't care for the Greek lore and setting, this is really the game for you.The multiplayer truly is great, you are given the option of enabling Instanced Loot as well, so there's no fighting over who gets what.You can also inspect other players at will, to view what gear they're using, as well as their other attributes.I was a bit skeptical at first, but after putting a good handful of hours into this, I can safely say this is one of, if not my most favorite ARPGs since the release of Diablo II: LoD.While I purchased this at half off, I can safely say this game IS worth the FULL price.A+, highly recommended.

								I initially bought this game without knowing it was from the makers of Titan Quest, and once in game, I immediately saw the resemblance.This game is a perfect followup to that, with interesting class diversity. Grim dawn doesnt have your typical Fight Mage Rogue Healer class types, and even has secondary classes. This almost forces you to explore more of the game, and that is a good thing! After splitting my time between two characters for a few hours each, I can say that each playthrough was slightly different. There is also a Normal < Veteran < Hard < Elite style difficulty, similar to Diablo and Titan Quest, so the replayability and longevity of the game seems fairly high.Ultimately, this is a great Hack 'n Slash RPG with nice class and skill diversity. Itemization appears satisfactory, with different weapon grades and magic items with a color coding system and stat rolls. Not to mention a co-op feature which I have yet to try.This bad boy is early access, but feels quite polished so far.8.7/10			"

Early Access Review
								I don't play that often and when I do I simply want to enjoy. Enjoy the world, the challenge, the story and all the other stuff. This game, even in its early access form, gives me exactly what  I want. The world seems interesting, the item embuing thing seems fun and the 2-way character build is something new. It is a bit of a Diablo, but in a good way. What I especially love is the difficulty level of battles already from the beginning. Unlike in many other games where you can simply run into any foe and click your way through, especially early game, Grim Dawn gives just enough for you to think when to rush in and when to actually kite around for a while. The game is by no means hard, but the difficulty level is just enough for me to feel engaged in battles. Especially against enemy heroes. This means I can actualyl enjoy the game casually all the way from the beginning - I don't have to rush and push my way through to end-game to have all the fun. I can have casual fun when getting to the end-game.Of course the game is not perfect. It is sometimes hard to target in battles due to environment and sometimes your surroundings might block your ranged attacks even when you don't see an obstacle between you and your target. But I am sure these are more of early access ""features"" rather than real problems.Either way I strongly recommend the game for ARPG guys around. Even for the more casual ones.			"

								Plays really well so far. Being from some of the makers of Titan Quest, in some ways it plays really similar to it. The classes work the same, and the stats more or less work the same. It feels like a more polished version of Titan Quest with much cooler classes, a better setting, and better animations. Plenty of good loot to sift through, but only a few epic drops so far, so it seems pretty balanced on that front. Can't wait to keep playing as they continue developing the game. Thanks devs for making this game, I now have another choice beyond Path of Exile, Torchlight 2, and Diablo 3 when I need that fix for this style of game. Currently this one has all of my attention.

												Grim Dawn is without a doubt one of my favourite games. The classes are varied and you can make some truely unique builds with them. For example using the same two classes (Occultist and Shaman) I made one character who specialises in life steal and another character who specialises with pets. The main story could have been better and more interesting. However, when exploring read the bits of lore you find because they often have interesting (and dark) stories to share about life after the Grim Dawn. The look and environment of the game is great and many of the locations are beautiful and match the game's atmosphere. However, I dislike the music and find it repetitive. The armour also looks great and I love how the low level gear is scraps of metal and rotten wood while the late game gear looks totaly amazing and as if it should be worn by a classical hero. Overall i would recommend this game to anyone especially if they like ARPGs.			"

								If you, like myself, were still looking for the real successor of Diablo 2 look no further!When I happened to stumble upon this masterpiece on a weekend sale it was a no brainer. Even at it's current state as fairly polished and bug free product, with 5th class waiting to be added and level cap limitation [ September 18th], it's the most fun I've had with an ARPG in a decade. Dark atmosphere with fitting music, plenty of loot for a little gear hoarder to collect and messing around with the double class builds make sure the upcoming weekends are going to be booked. I'd say it's pretty much a must buy at it's current price if you enjoyed D2 at all.Well there you have it, first review more or less done. Hope it helped.			"

												This game is freaking great. Don't let the EA ( early access) disclaimer fool you the game is in late beta and will be fully finished this year. Grim Dawn is useing a modified Titan Quest engine and it shows the improvments. Grim Dawn is the only ARPG game that i don't mind spending hours trying to farm loot. The multiplayer is pretty good, although you may experiance moments of intense lag in large fights. Grim Dawns art style hits its them very well. with the music complementing the atomosphe.  When i play at night with my headphones I can get creeped out with the ambiance.  Combat  In Grim Dawn is great and you feel your characters power as you grow. This game is challenging and you will need to carefull early on, Grim Dawn does do a decent job of keeping comabt challangeing up untill the end. Grim Dawn does a good job at keeping up with it post apocalyptic theme, from merchents who overcharge their wares and having the currncy be peices of iron, to the scavenging of food to restore your constituion and the run down towns and farms. if any of this intrest you or you are a fan of this genre it is totally worth the price.  ps please excuse my typosAFTER RELEASE UPDATEGrim Dawn is still a great game and most of what I said still holds up but their are some problems that have surfaced.Combat: The comabt is still challanging but because of the nature of ARPG it is easy to become extreamly powerful now on the surface this seams to a problem, but it isn't and here's why usally they trade  survivalability for damage, most mobs on normal and veteran settings are not going to poseany threat, but once they get into higher settings it will balance out.Now there is the opposite to this spectrum with trading dps for surivalbility (I like the idea of being unkillable), again this isn't a problem but I will point it out since I am here. Like the ""glass cannons"" the ""Battle turtle"" will have to change in the later game mods just to beable to kill bosses. In normal it takes forever to kill things but you will never have to worry about dying.voice acting & cinematic: It is okay for the most part, I wasn't one of the plebs asking for it, but it is sufficient for being tact on. The opening cinematic is something to be desired it isn't really good and is to full of cheese for my tast and I love the army of darkness.Multiplayer: Oh boy this is a big problem with me the game constently suffers from lag spikes and with players getting freaquent diconnects (I never join servers I host them so I think it is only happening to people that joins servers) it is frustrating, but not unplayable unless you are doing SoT or CB or playing HC(also can we stop using the word hardcore to define permadeath it's stupid masochist mod is more accurate).immersion: Grim Dawns theme is a post apocalypse with a HP lovecraft twist and it delivers. They way some of the npcs you find are just disheartening from a crazed loon living in a infested city to a father considering doing something horrific. There are many good people in Grim Dawn brought to apsolute despair and are jsut trying to survive. The way Grim Dawn handles its world building is very hands off. You find many nots in the world through breakign verious bookshelves and finding stands with tomes on them. These where the games lore, you can read them at your leisure in your journal. The wrting in these notes are top notich and the few that I have took the time to read are like reading pages from a novel. one of my favorites are the origins of sillth definitly chilling. I am left wanting to learn more about this games mythos, from the old gods you fight against to the other deities, you even get to meet one in game.Over all this game still holds up and is a steal at 26$ BUY IT NOW, DO IT, DO IT NOW!!!!!!!

								Before starting, ask yourself 3 questions first:- Are you a fan of ARPG?- Are you a fan of TQ?- Are you a fan of grinding your ♥♥♥ off?If just one of those answer is yes, then Grim Dawn should be on your list this holiday.The game is fun. I am not as much of a big fan of ARPG as before because I don't have much time in my hand as I used to, but this game already took from me more than 100 hours. It's not plenty, but it's enough for me to fall in love with this game, considering the fact that I played Titanquest for years. The core of TQ remained, and got polished to a better level. Dual-class, ridiculous physic (well, looking at those monsters flying always brings me joy), detailed, sophisticated, also confusing crafting system. You will spend hours after hours slaying monster, getting loot, and min maxing with your gears to get a superman out of it, except there's no superman until much later. If Diablo focuses much on End-game, this game is all about progression. Every point of skill should be spent carefully, every point of attribute should be used wisely to make your character better. And your gear. There are some other features that are worth-mentioning such as: Reputation for factions (also this is very tendious, as in Wow, in a smaller scale), veteran for those who feel Normal is too easy and the upper difficulty is too hard, (kind of) intersting side areas and side quests. etc. The graphic is ok-ish, not too fancy but enough to keep you entertained for quite a long time, though the color tone seems a bit off (it's called Grim Dawn for a reason). In short, buy this, this is one of the most rewarding early-access I've ever purchased. Pros:- Loot- Dual class- Character customization- Crafting system- Classic!Cons:- Crafting system somtimes feels too confusing- Grind, grind, grind- Not up-to-date graphics- Multiplayer is still as bad as TQ			"

								Dungeon Crawlers are my preferred genre, and Grim Dawn promises to be one of the legendary games. People will remember it like they recall Diablo 2. And this impression is from the pre-release version. I bought it yesterday afternoon and have 18.6 hours play as of writing this.TLDR: Grim Dawn is the most fun I've had collecting scrap metal while fighting monsters bent on my destruction.The Devs: The refugees from Iron Lore and the designers of Titan Quest: Immortal Throne. They are very active and responsive to the gamers supporting them. They are proactive on things, but, because they are an 8 person team and not 40 like ""other devs"" they might seem a little slow.The Game: Playable now!Pros:> No DRM> No Internet required> Scalable UI> settings for color blindness> Super Fast Loading Game> Atmosphere is absorbing - fits well with the apocalyptic aliens scenario> Dual Class - basically gives 16 class combinations for most of a character's life. Because the starting class tends to stay ahead of the second class there is a difference between an Arcanist-Soldier and a Soldier-Arcanist. The first is more magic based with some combat, and the second is more combat based with some magic. It can make a difference.> Two Hot Bars - assign spells, potions, etc to the 1 thru 0 keys... then do another set. > Combat is solid - Yes, some people fall in to spamming just two attacks, but it is their fault and not the game's. You can spam as many actions as you can keep track of.> Crate - Cannot say enough about Crate and their commitment to their players.> Zombies - Who doesn't like zombies?Cons:I think it is very unfair to tear into the downside of a game that is pre-release. But there are some things that are not just bugs that I feel need a change.> Zombies - kind of over played right now thanks to The Walking Dead. I personally could pass on this part of the lore. And while it is nice to see nods to this or that... but actually refereing to some of them as Walkers? To soon? Yes. How about just having them be ""Puppets"" or something. Puppets could be a nod to Heinlein.> Fog - Some regions are covered in a solid fog, dropping contrast to eye straining lows.> Character Avatars - Only one male and one female - both white. While I am tired of the cliche ""warriors have to be huge, wizards have to look like Harry Trotter"" I do think that even a couple choices would be nice. I'd like a spell caster that makes Shwartzenegger look small.> Multiplayer - No clue why every game dev from Blizzard to Firaxis is having trouble getting multi to work. But I never play multi so I really don't see this as a con.Other:> Assorted bugs, balance issues and incompletes that you'd expect from an alpha-beta game in pre-release. They will be fixed.> A very small development team. So things will be fixed, hopefully before the sun burns out.TLDR 2: Player after player says, ""I bought this game 3 hours ago and have played it for over 4 hours now. It's very good.""			"

								One of VERY few early access games that has consistently impressed and pleased me.On Gamplay: It's an ARPG, so you can expect gameplay in the same vein as Diablo, Path of Exile, or Titan Quest. If you're coming from Titan Quest, you'll likely feel right at home; the game incorporates the Mastery system from that game, and interface is a (much improved) derivation of that interface. One thing to note is that, where characters felt a little... stiff in TQ, characters feel considerably less so in Grim Dawn.Also, wonderful gore and particle effects serve only to enhance to hilarious Titan Quest ragdolls that you know and love.I can't recommend it enough.

												Quite why everybody in the reviews compares this game to Diablo 2 is beyond me. Did none of these people play Titan Quest? This is much closer to Titan Quest... and better too in pretty much everyway (and I like Titan Quest).  A different, slightly more  complex, experience than Diablo 3, it's effects are not quite as good (but then, what ARPG can boast better?) but the gameplay is great and the hours soon fly by. Also ... local coop! Great to see this still being supported in a modern game. Highly recommended.			"

								A great game just like Titan's Quest and Diablo. I am stuck at Homestead due to waiting on the next chapter but I am having so much fun so far. Just ran around once I got as far as I could, killing stuff, making money and gathering loot. I have bought all the extra space in the loot chest but I can see myself needing more in the future! Lots of great loot to hoard.I recommend this game highly if you love the above mentioned games. I experienced no bugs or crashes given this game is still in early access mode. Excited for the next chapter!			"

								edit - le sigh, farewell to Wyn, my lvl 27 Battlemage. Loving the Hardcore mode :)This game is great, hands down. It works in the 'Diablo style' without feeling like a clone or a knock off. Let's face it, there are really two names right now when it comes to the Diablo-esque ARPGs - Path of Exile and Diablo 3 (all right, so Diablo 2 is still going, I know, but we're talking modern). I like this one because it manages to not feel like either of those titles. -The pacing is decent - I keep moving forward and it never really feels like I'm slowing down. -The loot system feels tight, I get upgrades at a fairly regular pace but you never seem to know when that awesome piece will be around the corner. The item upgrades that you find are also interesting and useful right off the bat. I never feel like I should hoard them because I'm always finding something new. I'm sure down the road there will be big bad endgame style pieces but for now it's managing to stay fun.-The class system. That's where this game really shines. I've been making new characters and playing them to level ten to experiment with the mix-n-match the game provides and so far it's been a positive experience. Things I wouldn't mind seeing in the future - a little more information regarding how certain classes synergize with eachother, what skills play well with others, etc. It's early on right now so I'm not as worried about it (and let's face it, theorycrafting is half the reason fansites exist) and I'm having fun with the experimentation.-No persistent online connection. I cannot stress how awesome this is. Will it lead to some cheating? Probably. Do I care about that when I just want to play by myself or with a few buddies? Not in the slightest. Considering that the place I live has terrible internet having a proper Single Player Mode is absolutely crucial, my ping time can get over 1000ms and I don't need to explain how quickly that will get you killed in D3 or PoE. With this game I don't have to worry about it, just fire it up and away I go.So far so good guys. It's amazing to see what's been done (especially considering the age of the engine running underneath the hood) so far and I'm really looking forward to what the future holds. Well worth the price tag.			"

								I cannot rate this game enough, so far im barely even into the 1st act and have never felt so satisfied with a buy, honestly this game is worth every penny.This reminds me of Diablo 2 which i loved, just alot more in depth. Every little detail i miss about other Arpg's this features it and has been done to such perfection IMO. I personally like to rotate the camera and zoom in and out at certain points, you can do all this with your middle mouse button! The immersion you get from the world in which you are playing is brilliant and every detail has been added to really please the player. Even the World map is brilliantly detailed. This is more of a counter review against another i read with regards to the immersion and graphics. Sorry but NO. The immersion is awesome and the graphics are fine (i5 4690k, gtx 770 4gb) this game delivers in almost every aspect IMO. My only con with it so far is that the dialog spoken by NPC's is that of text with NO audio which id think would be awesome but that is it. Honestly dont take the negative reviews of this game too seriously as im sure most of them are just your typical Blizzard fanboys which pick fault in every tiny aspect.This is honestly a must buy for the people who just love the Arpg genre. This is one of the purchases you honestly are happy with the money you spent! :) This gets my thumbs up for sureI strongly recommend this game to anyone who loved Diablo 2. Honestly money well spent.			"

								[24 hours on record, 3 classes played]I'll get right down to it and add my voice to those heralding vast amounts of praise to Grim Dawn. Anyone who enjoyed Diablo II, Torchlight I/II and Path of Exile will definitely enjoy this title.Even in its Early Access state, Grim Dawn has much to offer: Interesting classes, a gorgeous world shown via a great high-fidelity engine, quests aplenty, and a storyline that shines with promise as you slash your way through towns and villages, grasslands, swamps, caves, and highlands - with many more zones on the way judging by the in-game map.Oh, and we mustn't forget the Shineys! Loot. Tons of loot. Seriously, bring a truck.			"

								So, I am a little confused by people who have posted negative reviews due to the multiplayer aspect of the game. It is first and foremost a single player game that happens to have multiplayer bolted-on! For those who say it runs poorly, perhaps your hardware isn't up to the task? There have been some issues (after all the game is in early access) but for me personally the game runs well. Worst of all are those who whine that the dev's 'nerfed my favourite skill and now I can't play the game anymore because it's not fun' or words to that effect. There's no pleasing some people! I have got over 380 hours in game and I am still having fun. I've played multiple builds using multiple different skills and long let this continue!I would certainly recommend this game.			"

												I bought this game awhile ago but never played it.  My wife got pregnant and I decided it was time to change my ways and “ grow up” .  I got a better job ,  started working really hard so that I can provide for my wife and future kids.   Bought a new house, new car, really made something of myself in a short amount of time.Fast forward 9 months and the kid arrives.   The reason i changed my whole life and in a way the reason i never played this game.   Well the baby was Black.  Neither of us are black.  She cheated on me.  I was crushed .  I left them ,  my life fell apart and now i live with my parents a former husk of the man i became.One evening after i had cried my last tear for the night i decided to start up my steam account and play Grim Dawn.I could care less that my ex wife cheated on me now .  I hate that ♥♥♥♥♥ cause she delayed the joy i now feel having found this game.I am complete now. Thank you "

Did you love the character freedom, of being able to combine a melee class with a caster class? or Just about any other combanation did you enjoy a world rich in lore and story then your going to really love this game it takes all the awsome qualities of Titans Quest and combines it with even more indepth character custamization now not only can you combine classes and mix and match what ever your in the mood for you can go even further with the devotion system its like christmas day everyday! the devotion system allows you to further develop your character quite uniquely by adding even more skills to choose from and more effects from said skills, so If you liked games Like Titans Quest and Diablo 2 then be sure to check this one out its a real Gem you dont want to pass by.

												Definitely a Great Game and will serve as a solid Benchmark for many ARPG's to come.Pros:- Extremely well balanced mechanics with very deep gameplay. No stat is a ""dud"" stat all have their advantages.- Extreme Build Diversity, 5 classes, each with 20 skills, 15 class combinations and hundreds of passives through the devotion tree. There are literally 100's of viable builds. - Fast Paced fun combat. I've been killing zombies for over 70 hours now and still enjoying every second!- Great Developer Team. Remember how blizzard would only update their game every 6 monhs? Crate's already about to release it's next major update after less than a month. Many free content patches expected in the future - and still waiting for survival mode.- Modding Tools. The community is going to create so many amazing mods that are truly going to push the limits of this game. Some people are still playing after 700 hours.Cons:- Multiplayer needs work. At its current state Grim Dawn is a single player game. This game is very easy to hack which means things like trading / random queues are just not a good idea. No economy is kind of a good thing though, you have to find your own gear.- Lack of End Game content. Don't get me wrong, I've played 70 hours and I'm not even close to end game yet, my highest level is 58 (of 85). However I will reach the end game eventually and there are only basically 2 static dungeons to run (however 3 new ones are coming next update).- No Random Dungeons. Due to the engine there are no random dungeons in this game which means there will never be things like rifts (diablo 3) or maps (PoE) which means we totally rely on the community and developer for new dungeons - can't just generate them!The Developers have laid down an excellent foundation, easily the best RPG system of any of the ARPG's out there. If they keep supporting the game with expansions, and supporting community creations, there is no reason this game will not surpass Diablo 3 and PoE as king of the Hack and Slash.			"

								Been playing both Diablo3, Path of Exiles and now Grim Dawn for the past few months. The game is quite good, and the number's geek will surely find plenty of combinations and calculations to do in finding the most effective way of building an able character. The casual player however, may find the game a bit too complex and hard to understand. Too many game mechanics which makes little sense without a greater understanding of the game which requires research and ""Google-Fu"" can be a bit overwhelming.Given time though, it surely is fun, challenging and enjoyable - even though I consider myself a casual player with little time for time-consuming analysis of a game.

												If you loved DIablo and Diablo 2, this game is the ♥♥♥♥.  Pros- Extremely expansive and detailed character build system.  110.5 hrs in and I could keep making characters for years!  The synergies between the skill trees, constellations, augmentations, components, etc. is very deep.- Great graphics and scenery.  The world is beautiful, monsters and gear look great.- Great crafting system- Grimdark setting that is actually grim and dark.  Like the journals I found of a family that resorted to prostituting their 11 year old out to survive, eventually turning to murdering the johns and canabalizing them as they succumbed to the blood god.  Savage.Cons- Too much loot.  Set your filter to yellow as a minimum, green is better.  The amount of trash loot is simply obscene.  That and ""rare"" items just rain form the sky to the point that you will find yourself swapping out Epic/Legendary items with a copy that is .001% better on a somewhat regular basis.- Difficulty is disappointing.  Too easy most of the time, then occassionally you get an enemy that is over the top.  Wish it was consistently more difficult without the giant spikes.  Won't be an issue for many, but if you are good with numbers, this game will feel like easy mode a lot of the time.- The map system is lacking.  The world is expansive and fantastic, but finding your way around can be annoying until you get familiar with the world of Cairn.- The default camera I feel is to claustrophobic and does not do the game justice at all.  Get Grim Cam and spend some time getting it set up to your liking.  It is a VAST improvement that really makes the world come to life.It has some flaws, but still worth it and the only recent Diablo-like worth playing right now imo. "

Summer-Rain asks,unsure of the foreboding atmosphere of overturned, burning carts, ruined towns and mutilated corpses and livestock. The living dead stalk the streets and countryside, and strange, otherworldly crystals havesprouted along the landscape, corrupting everything.""I have to make my way to Homestead, help the folkholed up in prison with resupplying their food source.""Summer-Rain smiles, before asking if Achilles can helpyou with your quest at the Homestead. ""Ha-ha, Summer, very funny...!"" You manage a wrysmile, before you cross a Reanimator's path, a giant,hulking undead monstrosity with aetherium crystalssprouting from its back, summoning lesser undead tofight you. ""What's the story behind those crystals?""Summer-Rain asks, putting a tub of vanilla ice creamin between her crossed legs as she watches you fightthe reanimator. Clicking furiously in this Diablo-likegame that makes Diablo III look apalling, you wonderhow a team of less than ten people did so well a jobcompared to a game where dozens of people workedon and took years to complete in the case of Diablo.You glance at her before doing a double-take, withSummer-Rain oblivious to the suggestive pose she isin, with vanilla ice cream, no less. You explain whilefighting throughout the countryside that the greencrystals; Aetherium, were artificially made and is thereason why the Grim Dawn event happened. Before the world of Cairn changed, it was similar to being a mix of the American Colonies and semi-industrial England. But after the Grim Dawn, with magic commonplace, two otherworldly powers came and fought among themselves over the world- the Aetherials, who possessed physical vessels and saw Humans as both fuel and food, and the Chthonians, enemies of the Aetherials who required pain and blood sacrifices to bind themselves to mortals to grant them aid or power.Summer-Rain tilts her head with the spoon in hermouth, a weird look on her face before she removesthe spoon for another scoop of vanilla. ""Doesn't seem like a good deal for any of us humans. TheAetherials wanna eat us and the Chthonians want touse us, even though they hate the Aetherials."" Bythis time, you have fought your way to Homesteadand helped their Quartermaster with an insectinfestation, and now the human remnants of anEmpire want to enlist an external faction to combatthe otherworldly menace. You walk towards the Homestead's central area amidBlack Legion guards, garrisoned in Homestead forprotection of both the farmers and for the Legion'sown, the last bastion of sanity in a world gone mad,miles from the Prison-Fortress you called your newhome since beginning the game.""Who are these two?!"" Summer-Rain exclaims, twocharacters now flanking you, one in dark robes andcloth mask, arcane runes upon his garb, while theother is clothed in white with gold armor, orangeand red accents decorating his patterns of fire andthe sun. ""I have to choose now, the faction whichwill assist me in my quest to free Cairn from thesemonsters.""Summer-Rain is excited now. ""Burn them! Burn theundead influence from Cairn!"" She yells, but youalready wanted to play with the Order of Death'sVigil, the necromancers who have a noble outlookon undeath, but are reviled by the rival factionKymon's Chosen, a group dedicated to a Sun Godwhom the Necromancers view as a false messiah.""HOW COULD YOU?!?!"" Summer-Rain exclaims,incredulous after picking your faction to progressthe story. ""They're religious fanatics, Summer!""You try to argue your case, but Summer-Rain isnot hearing any of it. ""You're using necromancy!The very powers you're trying to destroy! You'rea hypocrite, Starboy Coldheart!"" She sticks her tongue out at you while moving towards the door.""Where are you going?!"" You ask, not knowingwhat to do now, what with receiving orders togo to the super-secret hideout of the Order ofDeath's Vigil and Summer-Rain about to walk outof your room. She looks down at you in a strange,half-pout.""I'm going to get my laptop and play Grim Dawnon my own. I'm going to join Kymon's Chosen andburn the corruption of the undead, the Aetherials,the Chthonians- and you- from Cairn."" Your jawdrops as Summer-Rain opens your door andflashes you her signature smile.""I Love you...

												Though still in development this game proves to be challenging and the rotating camera angles are a nice touch while playing so nothing gets missed especially new discoverable routes.The Above review is something I quickly compiled shortly after Grim Dawn launched on Steam Early Access. My glowing review still stands, this ARPG is solid and is by far one of the best games I have enjoyed in a long time. As you take a look at other reviews little to no players say many negative things about the game. Those who do point out performance type issues have points, but Crate has been serious about creating fixes to permanently squash glitches and errors. Grim Dawn is now at the point where more and mroe DLC is being released. 2 Content patches (both free so far) have been released with one adequately priced arena based DLC (on the steam store). Another 2017 early DLC is announced for a new class with an 8th to arrive after that. Crate openly supports modding of GZrim Dawn and the community has been tediously at work making some quality extentions. Do I support this game in the finished state after it's highly successful EA launch? I sure do! It would be a steal and my recommendation to get it on sale but even buying it at full price is worth it in my opinion. At full price you are supporting a highly active and interactive developer studio, encouraging them to continue their fantastic support, and giving them incentive to keep DLCs coming in the future. Buy and play the game, you wont be disappointed!			"

												This is a highly recommended game. I love all the aspects of this game except for one flaw I'm having, The wireless 360 controller has a problem mantaining it's sticky keybindings. Don't know if this just my issue or a bug in controller options.But overall this game is well mantained and lots of fun and grinding of course.			"

								I've only been keeping up with this game since about Christmas eve, and have been playing/streaming it nonstop since then. The setting. The sound design. The fluid combat. While there's a limited number of skills, unfortunately, there's still quite a variety of ways to build your characters. Worked on by at least one of the Titan Quest devs, with a Diablo 2 feel, more fluid combat than Path of Exile and more variety in items and builds than Diablo 3. I have a few complaints, but none substantial enough for me to even think about turning away from the game. I grabbed it through the winter holiday sale and have said multiple times that it's been worth every penny, to me. If it's ever on sale and you're looking for a new ARPG, you'd definitely be missing out if you don't pick it up.			"

												Greetings.For start i would like to say that i am big fan of Diablo 2 and sadly no ARPG that came out after Diablo 2 couldnt manage to bring the same feeling and fun Diablo series had ( Diablo 3 is garbage).And now we have it Grim Dawn!  The developers of the game made Titan quest which was a masterpiece ( didnt play it yeah shame on me :)  ) starting from team of 2 people and eventually grew to team of 10 people and managed to create this GEM.Since the ARPG market isnt that big we have 2 games that are currently the best on ARPG genre which are Diablo 3 ( ugghh) and its Free version which is Path of Exile.On the other hand none of those games reached the pinnacle of gameplay which diablo 2 had. DIablo 3 is just overpriced MMO these days and Path of Exile is a big market for trading gems-skills to make a cookie-cutter builds.Now lets see what exactly makes Grim Dawn a great game and why you should invest your time into it:Dual class system: you get a choice out of 6 classes( masteries) as you start on level 2 and another choice of class at level 10. Although its not forced and you can play 1 class just as any ARPG.Gear gives skills: there are lots of gear and components which can give you different skills as well be it passive or active.Devotion System: There are shrines located in the world of cairn as you adventure , some of them require  to be fixed(different componets required)  or kill a wave of monsters.After you restore a shrine you get devotion point which can be spent according to your like.Total of 50 shrines can be obtainable.Factions: you kill monsters for a faction to get respected with them which unlocks gear and augments to boost your character even further.    I  can go on and on about game features but the game is awesome and worth every penny you give for it.3 Difficulties; Normal, Elite, Ultimate. 4 Huge acts to complete. 2 roguelike dungeons for more challenge. The game is content complete and fully playable which awaits some polishing and launch at February. Lets congratulate the developers on making such a badass game with little budget.  Cheers			"

												This game is the future of ARPGs... keep your eye on this one.** Update over 400 hours in this game and it is only getting better. I have been following and playing this game for a good while now and I want to say it's been really fun watching a game change and evolve into an even better game, way to go Crate.Pros: + This game looks good, I really like the effects and the overall look of the game.+ Controls are smooth and the gameplay is solid with no issues running on my out dated 670 card. + The monsters are original in design and though they haven't released all the different kinds of monsters they are unique enough that you know when you are fighting a type you are weak to.+ Sound is fairly decent, I'm not much of a sound guy. + Multi-Player is fun and involved.+ The components system that was adapted from Titan Quest is fricking great I love how you can change little mechanics and resistances by adding components to your gear.+ Community is awesome.Cons:- None. Highly recommend picking this up, still.			"

								Fantastic game. The gameplay is great and alll but, it's the little things that make this game special in my opinion. For example, three different colour blind modes for those of us who are, the talent/constellation progression makes for a really interesting and almost unlimited amount of character builds to play around with. The story is (as the title suggesrts) very dark but also well told with some pretty good voice talents. The development team have done a stellar job and you can tell by playing the game that it has been a labor of love. Cannot recommend this game highly enough if you enjoy the genre or, if you wanted to try an ARPG, this is not a bad place to start. Thanks for reading, may you enjoy the game as much as I am.			"

I'll tell you why; It's unique, I absolutely love it! It reminds of Titan Quest and the summers spent clickfesting away smashing enemies! I debated for a while whether to get it or not. Upon getting it I do not regret paying for it. It may be early access, but its very playable at the moment. The most interesting feature I think, is being able to rescue people and rebuild your town, its a rather unique feature and one I enjoy immensely! I hope this game goes big, like really big, and Crate can continue making more in this series for years to come!			"

								This game is a must-have for every person who likes top-down perspective action rpg's like Diablo, Titan Quest and Torchlight. Yes it's still in it's beta, but it's already well-worth playing. The controls are easy and responsive, graphics and sound are good and overall gameplay is awesome!The only big let-down at this point is it's often occuring frame-drops, even at lower settings. This looks to be a beta problem though. The engine is probably not optimized yet and I expect this to be solved by the time they release the game.			"

								How is this game? Marvellous really..And If you are the type of individual who has been waiting for an rpg that brings back that gritty Diablo 2 feel but on a much deeper level, then look no further. Crate Entertainment is really creating something special here in a game that's bound to be very, very special once more people get their hands on it at release. From the build diversity, to the great itemization and open explorable world, this game is just a masterpiece in the making. Put in this way, as an arpg enthusiast and fanatic really, only Grim Dawn and PoE have come closest to quenching that D2 thirst I once had. So kudo's to Crate Entertainment, a small indie company for out performing the mega millionaire/billionaire companies and delivering a hell of a game in the making!			"

								Speaking from only playing singleplayer thus far  - Grim Dawn shows amazing promise. I'm not particularly ""into"" buying Early Access games, but I showed this one an exception after closely watching it's progress on Kickstarter. I've sunk a good 3 days of playtime into Grim Dawn and it was worth it.I've played Diablo 2 more than any other game. I've been waiting for it's successor and this may very well be it. Even Diablo 3 doesn't hold a candle to this game. Grim Dawn is the remains of Titan Quest's engine - repurchased it's own creators and greatly tweaked and improved upon. Whatever grainy feeling I got from it has it's own charm.Grim Dawn is a game where you're rewarded for exploring and completion. Finding and killing elite or 'named' mobs give bonus XP. Leveling up dramatically improves your combat finesse with new abilities, passive and active. The skill/class system, which was the best part of Titan Quest is still fully imbedded in Grim Dawn. Doing side quests often gives stat or skill points. I like to call myself a 'Completionist."" Clearing the map, talking to everyone, doing every side quest. It's nice being rewarded for it and you will be rewarded in this game. You also get to choose where you go and in what order you do a lot of quests. There are currectly 2 wings (acts?) from the main city and you COULD go to the Act 2 area quite a bit earlier then you need to. Crate has added options so you can make decisions instead of making a completely linear game.The loot grind is there. Set items. Uniques. Decent rares. You'll be searching and you'll be loving it. Some gear improves specific abilities and other gear can be used by multiple classes, depending on your spec. A shared stash makes the loot grind less painful when that unique sword drops for your caster. :bI've spent the majority of my time playing non-hardcore characters, however I normally do play hardcore in these types of games. The one character I did play in hardcore I felt like the game was well balanced for it. I think I ended up dying but it was due to my poor decision, opposed to a flaw or unfair part of the game. I do suggest if you play hardcore that you play through whatever content is currently out before jumping into it. Mistakes will be made.Note: This is not an EASY game. You can run directly into enemies or a boss 5-10 levels higher than you and get obliterated. That feeling you have when you die is something that no other games like this give - Freedom. And it's great.Grim Dawn? More like GRINDAWN.... in a good way.			"

The patch come from 500mb to 1gb and there is alot of extra stuff to do with them. level cap atm is 50But ofc with every good game there is a downside. The optimization on the game is bad, and you will prob get some frame drop in combat. but it's Early access game and Create will fix the optimization on release so dw to much about it :)Pros and consPros- Gameplay is allot like Titan quest, Same talent tree system with dual class- So much loot you will click your finger off looting it all- the game is long. 15-20hrs from start to finish- You can rotate camera ""first arp i know of where you can do this""- Every zone feel like they belong there- Dual wield 1hand pistols :DCons- Early access can give some bugs ofc.

												Titan Quest 2: Steampunk edition. No, this isn't a criticism, I loved TQ, and Grim Dawn lovingly thieves TQ's corpse of a lot of key gameplay elements (no surprise, as most of Crate Entertainment is made up of TQ's devs, if memory serves correctly) Equipment: Grim Dawn's gear consists of a typical loot-fests' prefixed and affixed ""Ascended Warrior's [item] of Everlasting Pain and Death of the Fox""-type loot generation, with a fair smattering of weapon archetypes to choose from at the moment (swords, daggers, two-handers, rifles, pistols, crossbows, etc.) You can buy these super-overpriced from friendly merchants in town, or just kill special bosses or minibosses and get drops from them. Armor is spread about, consisting of a familiar spread -- helmet, torso, legs, feet, shoulders, gloves, and then slots for amulets, two rings, medals (like, military rewards, yeah), and relics. These last few are more specialized and, like most other H&Ss, are usually more utilitarian, offering not specific DPS or defense boosts, but general stat buffs. Upgrades: Gear can be 'gemmed' (Diablo 2 callback) in a sense. As you kill enemies, you'll collect fragments of upgrade items. Combine them (just smash them together in-inventory, no need for special NPCs or items) and you get the ""completed"" item. You can upgrade gear with this stuff at any point, complete or not, with completion usually maxing out the stat/effect bonus the item uses, in addition to adding an additional ability. Certain things will only fit into certain gear (upgrades increasing weapon damage can only fit into, well, weapons). And no, there's no slot-tracking to keep in mind, for better or for worse -- a completed upgrade piece is a big investment into a piece of gear you know you'll keep for a while (or maybe it's just an upgrade that you don't even really like).  Crafting: This'll feel quite familiar to Diablo 3 players. You get a Blacksmith NPC after some time out in the field who will craft stuff for you. This can be randomly-rolled items, or it can be super-upgrades, combining several of the previously-mentioned upgrades into a single, more powerful item with different effects altogether. Most crafting costs one or several of a few unique crafting-only materials you find afield (Scrap, Aether Crystals, and Tainted Brain Matter, to name a few gooey examples). Crafting is also the only way to make Relics, which is an item for one of your fairly-numerous inventory slots. Skilltrees/Masteries: This is what I am very grateful that the TQ devs put into Grim Dawn. What set TQ, and by inheritance, Grim Dawn, apart was the way it handled skills. See, you don't say ""I'm a Wizard!"" when you start the game, and only ever learn magic spells. What happens is, the first time you level up, you choose your skilltree. Right now, there's:-- Soldiers (lots of general self-buffs and damaging abilities, not flashy but strong)-- Occultists (Summoner-type character, can have a variety of pets or a single strong one, depending how you build it, and with debuffs to cast on enemies and a handful of offensive spells)-- Demolitionists (the ranged class, intended to use guns as there's skills that specifically focus on their use. Has a bunch of 'gadgets' that can supplement DPS, like grenades, traps, etc.)-- Nightblade (the rogue class, lots of movement/positioning skills, with focus on critical hits and powerful damage buffs)-- Arcanist (the caster, has a range of offensive and defensive spells from single-target to AoEs).-- Shaman (sort of like a spellsword, if that spellsword used a two-handed weapon. Skills are much along the path of the Diablo 2 Necromancer's totems.)The coolest part is that, at level 10, you choose a SECOND Mastery, if you so choose. Or, you can refrain from doing so, and simply keep pouring points into your first Mastery. This is a good idea sometimes, as GD also has a very strong focus on synergizing skills -- rather than just give you a billion abilities, you only get a handful per Mastery. But as you level up the Mastery, you unlock new skills that branch off of each ability's ""tree"", adding additional effects. You can pour points into this new effect for better stats on that effect... OR you can put points into the initial skill.Say you have a magic missile ability, for example. You put a single point into it to unlock it. If you put more points into it, it increases damage of type A. But, if you put points into a skill down the tree, you might unlock an explosion effect that deals damage over time of type B! So you could feasibly just unlock a skill for use, then never touch the initial skill again, if later branches in the tree have effects you prefer. Instant warp-to-town: Hardly bears mentioning, as it is more or less standard for H&Ss nowadays, but yeah. Free travel back to town at any time without needing to carry around town portal scrolls. NOT from TQ, but instead new to GD: you can unlock new areas by collecting enough Scrap (one of those crafting mats, you may recall) and iron bits (the ""gold"" of this world) and building a bridge. In some cases, this can speed up forward progression... or you can go in a completely different direction from where the game seems to be railroading you. A very nifty way to make you feel a bit less like you're just moving in a straight line through the game.One thing I do find kind of lackluster is building your character outside of skill choices. Character stat-building is more or less dependent on Mastery Selection, as points into the Mastery (which counts as a skill point use, so keep track) will not only unlock new skills, but give you general stat increases relevant to the Mastery (big ""Physique"" stat increase for Soldier, ""Cunning"" for Demolitionist, ""Spirit"" for Arcanist, etc., and a smaller amount of a mixture of the other stats). These are the three stats you can really directly affect, actually. Each is a catch-all for a variety of engine numbers (Physique is Health, Defense value, etc.; Cunning affects chance-to-hit and chance-to-be-hit; Spirit affects your Mana/Energy, damage of spells, etc.) Beyond Mastery skill points, you get precisely ONE (1) choice of stat to increase, from those three, per level. It's a moderate increase, to be sure (like 5 or 6 points), and yes, it's meant to supplement the Mastery's auto-assignment (which is 9 times out of 10 an accurate representation of the stats you usually need for that Mastery to shine), but for some it might feel like it's railroading players a bit too strongly.If you liked TQ, this game is a no-brainer -- It's TQ2, or might as well be. If you're a general H&S RPG fan (liked Torchlight 1 and/or 2, Diablo 1, 2, or 3, Path of Exile, Dungeon Siege 1 or 2, Sacred 1 or 2, etc. etc.), you might want to look through the gameplay videos and see if you might be interested. Otherwise... well, you kind of HAVE to be used to the genre to really 'get' the appeal of this game. If clicking on loot pinatas until they die and mashing Alt to see what they dropped isn't appealing to you, you're probably better off skipping over this one.			"

												Titan Quest 2: Steampunk edition. No, this isn't a criticism, I loved TQ, and Grim Dawn lovingly thieves TQ's corpse of a lot of key gameplay elements (no surprise, as most of Crate Entertainment is made up of TQ's devs, if memory serves correctly) Equipment: Grim Dawn's gear consists of a typical loot-fests' prefixed and affixed ""Ascended Warrior's [item] of Everlasting Pain and Death of the Fox""-type loot generation, with a fair smattering of weapon archetypes to choose from at the moment (swords, daggers, two-handers, rifles, pistols, crossbows, etc.) You can buy these super-overpriced from friendly merchants in town, or just kill special bosses or minibosses and get drops from them. Armor is spread about, consisting of a familiar spread -- helmet, torso, legs, feet, shoulders, gloves, and then slots for amulets, two rings, medals (like, military rewards, yeah), and relics. These last few are more specialized and, like most other H&Ss, are usually more utilitarian, offering not specific DPS or defense boosts, but general stat buffs. Upgrades: Gear can be 'gemmed' (Diablo 2 callback) in a sense. As you kill enemies, you'll collect fragments of upgrade items. Combine them (just smash them together in-inventory, no need for special NPCs or items) and you get the ""completed"" item. You can upgrade gear with this stuff at any point, complete or not, with completion usually maxing out the stat/effect bonus the item uses, in addition to adding an additional ability. Certain things will only fit into certain gear (upgrades increasing weapon damage can only fit into, well, weapons). And no, there's no slot-tracking to keep in mind, for better or for worse -- a completed upgrade piece is a big investment into a piece of gear you know you'll keep for a while (or maybe it's just an upgrade that you don't even really like).  Crafting: This'll feel quite familiar to Diablo 3 players. You get a Blacksmith NPC after some time out in the field who will craft stuff for you. This can be randomly-rolled items, or it can be super-upgrades, combining several of the previously-mentioned upgrades into a single, more powerful item with different effects altogether.

Early Access Review
								Grim Dawn is a spectacular addition to the isometric ARPG family. Created by some of the team that brought you the timeless classic Titan Quest, strap up and delve into Cairn - a world in a 'victorian-esque' era that is experiencing the eradication of the human race.At this time, this game is still a work in progress but it shows a ton of promise. Grim Dawn lives up to its name and paints a canvas of a harsh world where good help is hard to find, suvival isn't always guarenteed and death lurks around every corner. Accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, I found this game sucked me into its world and I sunk tons of hours hacking and slashing my way to the finish of the current beta (Build 24).If I had to compare it to other games of the genre, I'd say it has the grit and gore of Diablo 2/Path of Exile, mixed with the leveling system of Titan Quest and the fast combat of Torchlight 2. Grim Dawn introduces a variety of its own elements, such as the 'Constitution' health regeneration system, designed to reduce the number of trips to town and potions used so you spend more time in combat. The game also features a choice/consequence system where saving 'character A' means the death of 'character B' and a loss of trust from the faction character B is associated with. There is a ton of loot to reward you for your victories and a variety of options for crafting so customization is certainly an option for your gear.Outside of expected and respected bug fixes, I would like to see: more voice acting for NPCs, more animations for skills and enemies, and hopefully another class (currently there are 5).I highly recommend this game and I look forward to the completed product. Keep up the great work Crate Entertainment!			"

								Not even completed this awesome ARPG is better than D3, TL2 and PoE. You can customize your character to your playstyle and not have the game force you to play a certain way. All the attributes are meaningful. Dual classing opens many doors and it is fun blending the skills. The loot drop rate feels just right, not too low and not too high. While it is very simular to Titan Quest, it is very different and personally I like this game more than TQ.Totally worth full price, $25 is a steal for a game like this.			"

Early Access Review
								First time writing a review, it's not really my thing, but I felt I owed it to this game.If you're like me, you read the Bad Reviews to see why you SHOULDN'T buy the game.  There honestly aren't that many bad reviews, which should be a good sign in the first place, but I will save you some time by summarizing what I found out looking through bad reviews, and debunking them, leaving you with no reason NOT to buy this game.First, people complain it's buggy or crashing -- Keep in mind It's early access.  That being said, it's the most stable early access game I've ever played.  I'd have to guess that the people complaining about crashes don't understand early access, or maybe played much earlier on.  I have had 1 or 2 issues in my 25 hours of playtime.Second, people complain it's  not as good as Titan Quest, the story isn't up to snuff, etc... -- This isn't in -any- way a sequel or expansion to Titan Quest. Don't expect it to be something it isn't. Yes it has some of the same staff members who worked on Titan Quest working on this game, but that knowledge is used to understand that they know what they're doing with this type of game.  And if you read the news and updates, you'll see they're always expanding their team, getting veteran game designers/developers/artists to help with the lore, story, and artwork.  Again, it's still early access, and they're working on it.Third, people say ""[insert dungeon crawling ARPG here] is better -- Bah, Fan boys!  I love this style of game, and played Diablo 2 so much my middle school AND high school grades suffered.  Diablo, Titan Quest, Torchlight, Path of Exile, the van helsing games... I've played them all and couldn't tell you why anyone would say any of them are better than this game (D2 excluded, cause, ya know... you can't beat that...).  And yes I've played D3 since it came out, since the expansion, and through seasons 1 and 3.  This game is more Diablo than Diablo 3. I'll admit, I bought it half off during the summer sale, but I loved it so much I bought a 2nd copy for a friend and he can't put it down either.  If I have any qualms about this game it's that it's only 4 player max, and the character customization (not to be confused with Class customization) is lacking. And by lacking, I mean non-existent beyond Male or Female.  But that's all bells and whistles, and it's not what makes this type of game fun.  Where the game earns respect is in the innovation and unique ideas they have come up with that make the game fun and interesting, while not impacting the traditional principles that make this type of game addicting and enjoyable.TL;DRHaters gonna hate.  This game's fun as hell!			"

												I will gladly accept any and all quests from an NPC named Captain Bourbon. Especially pouring myself a glass of bourbon while getting a quest from Bourbon so I can reward myself with more bourbon. I'm on a mission...from and for Bourbon.If you enjoy Titan Quest, D2 and Torchlight you will enjoy this one. Very playable for still being in Early Access, the devs have put a lot into this and are active with the updates (see build notes in news). The mobs provide a solid challenge, the skill trees have a lot of customization and the ability to dual-class gives you unique choices for character builds.Update 2.26.2016 - Full Release - 82 hours loggedNo SpoilersSo, I rolled a fresh character after the announcement that it was content complete, as of this review I finished my first playthrough of the entire story (normal diff). I can't say enough positive things about this game, so here's a short list of my impressions:1) The overall story has an excellent pace, it doesn't feel rushed and there's plenty of side content. 2) The Devotion system is a fantastic mechanism that adds a lot of flavor to your build and play style.3) There's a great balance of challenge acheived with combat. At level 50 I felt like I could walk over certain packs of mobs only to find some creature around the corner that would gladly treat me like a pinata. I'll also add that I've started a new game with the same character on Elite, and so far in Act 1 it has continued to present a satisfying challenge. 4) Skills to pay the...Blacksmith? A couple things I'd like to note. The refinement of the skills, and dual class system, has only gotten better since Early Access. Compared to other games in the genre I am really pleased with the fact that the success of your progression feels more deeply routed in skill choice and not primarily driven by gear choice. Your gear is important, but it feels more like an augment to your class and not how your class gets defined. In the same hand, this impacts crafting and in a great way. There's a lot of incentive to craft different items as you learn new patterns, but it's not going to make or break your build. I appreciate that because there's a certain level satisfaction that keeps coming back every time you get a new piece of gear that's an upgrade, and it may not even be that big of an upgrade. 5) Grim Dawn reminds me of what originally drew me into this genre, and refines it to make it fresh and enjoyable. I'll clocking a lot more hours with different classes and I'm definitely looking forward to future content.Lastly: With voice overs, I'm even more convinced, if the opportunity presented itself, I would follow Captain Bourbon into the depths of the void to rescue his brother Scotch (future content idea?)Thank you to everyone at Crate for a great game!

								What can I say? Everything you loved about Titan Quest Immortal Throne and more.  The TQ engine has been upgraded with some new tricks, and the new environments and maps are a delightful treat. The best part is the Steps of Torment dungeon which has you crafting a key to open a dungeon that has no access to portaling out, and the key is destroyed upon entry. If you die you have to start over after crafting the key. It adds dynamic challenges to the game. The is an early access game you can trust. The developers have a lot of pride in their project and it shows both in game and in the community. 10/10 would roll another character again and again.			"

												Grim Dawn is a hack-&-slash action-RPG which falls squarely into the ""like Diablo 2 but"" category. You could say it's ""like Diablo 2 but fun"" or ""like Diablo 2 but balanced"". If you've ever been sick and tired of playing a new RPG, getting 8 hours in, and finding out that the skill(s) you put most of your points into won't work anymore for arbitrary reasons that were never previously mentioned, Grim Dawn will provide you with much-needed relief. I've spent all my time experimenting with new builds and haven't beaten the game yet in my 165+ hours, so I can vouch for that much at least. It's not a game for people who love the hack-&-slash subgenre, although at least some of them would certainly enjoy it. It's a game for people who are fed up with the hack-&-slash subgenre, but willing to give it one last chance.			"

								Лучшая из hack-and-slash игр за всё время существования жанра. Никакие Диабло, Торчлайты и ВанХельсинги рядом не стоят. Сделано в традициях Titan Quest, так что многое узнаваемо по части интерфейса и прокачки, но сильно отличается от оригинала по концепции, атмосфере и контенту.Хоть игра и находится в раннем достуе на момент написания отзыва (завершен только 3 акт), уже есть чем заняться при достижении максимального уровня — охотой на монстров и заработком репутации. Отзывчивые разработчики, большое разнообразие предметов, навыков и всяих реликвий, много лора для изучения сюжета и мира... Это просто идеальная игра. Вот только бегать с кем-то в кооперативе оказалось менее весело, чем в одиночку, но я не уверен, что это минус.Можно играть без подключения к долбаному интернету, что сильно мешает в случае с Диабло 3....Обновлено. Теперь вышла релизная версия и контента стало в разы больше. Да, это несомненно великолепный продукт с кучей возможностей, с огромной реиграбельностью и превосходным будущим. Каждый аспект Grim Dawn на голову превосходит подобные в других играх, в ней собрано всё самое лучшее. Теперь нужно приложить просто титанические усилия, чтобы найти хоть какие-то недостатки. Наверное, это лучшее вложение средств в ранний доступ, которое я когда-либо делал.			"

								Titan Quest lives again in this spiritual successor that expands upon ideas of loose quest progression and meaningfully-destructible environments which leads to a very open-world feel. Secrets feel secret (reminiscent of old Gauntlet games) and items have fun and unique stats, often times granting cool new abilities. For those left wanting with the somewhat shallow story of Path of Exile, they'll inhale this game's intriguing quest dialogs, flavor text, noteable NPCs, and lore drops throughout the game.			"

Great ARPG, supurb visuals, excelent design and a great take on the ARPG that absolutely spanks Diablo III right and proper.  I recommend this to any ARPG fan around.  6 out of 5 stars!I backed this game right from the beginning and watched it grow and flourish from a short 700Mb demo to a near 5Gb masterpeice.  Rarely do I purchase Early Access, unless I can see a great future for a game. This game is the true personification of Early Access done right.   I just wish I had more time to play this true gem in the rough.  Full-time studies and part-time employment have cramped my gaming lifestyle severely. (But no one said studying to be a Clinical Psychologist was going to be easy!)I can't wait to see what Crate has in store for us in the future.Visuals: Stunning visuals of a world shattered by the Apocalypse of Monsters and the Undead.Story: Immersive Storyline. (About time for an Original Storyline in my honest opinion).Character Customization: Go for hack and slash or use a rifle for run and gun.  The choice is yours.Playability: I could play and replay this game forever.Overall: This game is Immersive, challenging and all-in-all, a unique take on the classic ARPG.But why listen to me droning on?  Try the game out yourself, you won't be disappointed!			"

								Lets see here. If Diablo 2 was in a bar and met Path of Exile, and the two of them went home together, 9 months later Grim Dawn would be born. This game is awesome. Artwork is fresh, music is exciting, physics are smooth. Interesting combonation of traditional skills and gem creations give Grim Dawn an edge over similiar games. Oh wait... its still in alpha... and its still badass!8/10 for reals.			"

												I invested in this game because I remembered Titan Quest and it's expansion.  I could always see there was something there but unfortunately as game studios come and go....so went the talented programmers that developed these wonderful creations.  I perused Kickstarter and found that Grim Dawn was being created and noticed that not only the same potential was there but something more or just as special.  I invested quickly and not once have I thought it to be hasty.  This game is beautiful and the many hours and months of work have paid off.  Their tone is set well as it has been stated but within it all, there is hope.  I would think that more people will look towards investing in this game because this is really  what an action RPG should be. Crate's small team has done very well with its limited resources and I hope that they will be doing more work.  So please invest in this game.  It's been a wild ride for the limited time I have spent and I look forward for many more hours of playing.			"

I hate it when i enter a room thats a grim dawn server and i get kicked which has 2 more slots where there are only 2 people playing. So I got to another server and come back after like 1 hour or so and that server is still up with the same 2 players in a 4 slot room. Its like they kick people for kicks lol get it...bad joke.OK OK OK I run this game on a gtx 760 4gb and it runs like ♥♥♥♥, it really does. I dont know why but im hoping it will run better in the future. I can run Bioshock Infinite in full setting but this game get reaaaallllllyyyy slooowwwww sometimes.

												Deffinetly the best ARPG I have played ever.Pros:+The Combat is Fun+Amount Of Skills and Builds you can have+Interesting Story that grabs your attention+Takes a really long time to level up (E.g Level 30 after 20 hours of playing, exploring and doing quests)+Good Mechanics+AI Is pretty Legit and does what its meant to+Difficulty on Veteran is pretty challenging already and thats what i like to see+Ability to mix 2 classes together (Any classes)+ Very good looking graphically with great performance. (High end PC here).+ Beautiful areas each unique and interesting, which makes it fun for exploring.+The rarity in the epic/legenedary loop drop is perfect makes it very rewarding when you get luckyHonestly cannot think of any negative points at the moments.This game has tons of potiental for DLC's and extre areas.So what are you waiting for? GET THIS GAME. NOW.			"

								I love this. I really do. When I heard that there was a follow-up to Titan's Quest in the works I couldn't wait. And I'm having a blast in it. It may not be finished, but I've already spent 20+ hours in it and I'm not close to finishing the content available.If you like ARPGs, you will like Grim Dawn. If you loved Titan's Quest, you will love Grim Dawn.Highly recommended! "

Grim Dawn has awesome gameplay surpassing diablo 3. It provides so much freedom in terms of character customisation with the dual classes and amount of skills available. I am pleased that dev's decided to improve the story telling with the voiced NPC's for the main quests. Job well done Crate Entertainment!			"

								Great game unfortunately the multiplayer lacks a closed realm. In other words they lack servers that diablo 2 had in order to host events like ladders etc... A great thing I loved about arpgs was collecting rare loot and trading it for other currency (for instance runes diablo etc.) (path of exile orbs)  or other gear during competitive ladders. I think at one point they discussed the potenial to have their own servers but the cost would be too high as of now. They would need to see how well the game goes over when it's actually released before they can jump the gun on that. Basically finding rare loot isn't as rewarding since people can alter their save files and get whatever gear they desire. If you don't care about online that's great or closed servers that's also fine. I really enjoyed most of the classes but occultist was extremely bland for me. This game has good things about it and bad things. The bad consists of horrible particles, animations and spell effects for abilities. You don't feel powerful with some of the abilities just due to how it looks visually. Some of the builds disappoint me there isn't much of a variety and some skills feel out of place. I was also full of extreme sads when I learned there was no dedicated healer with utility like in Titan quest.

Alot of time and effort shows in Grim Dawnas the graphics rival that of Diablo and the Blizzard team.Soundtrack and FX seem to fit the theme nicely.Lotsa weapons, armor and items and character class is customizable.There is even a cool star chart of the constellations where you can further develop your character with (star perks)$24.99 is an excellent price for the content delivered with Grim Dawn.And theres plenty of blood and gore to satisfy the chupacabra in youI rate Grim Dawn with 8.9 out of 10 stars			"

								If you put over a thousand hours into Diablo 2 constantly theory crafting new characters and trying out new combinations, if you picked up Diablo 3 with the expectations of doing it all over again and found it wanting, if you hunted around for alternatives and even considered returning to diablo 2, then this game was made for you. It isn't finished yet, so if you can stand to wait, you might want to. However, it already plays better than Diablo. When it's finished? 10/10			"

								The only other hack and slash ARPG that I consider in the same league as this game is Path of Exile. Just like PoE, this game makes Diablo III look like a game made for simple-minded children. This game has everything Diablo III lacked: Better story,  with a grim setting and atmosphere  that successfully convey a sense of danger and despair. Unchained character development with many options for how to develop your character. Nuance in NPC interactions where making the wrong decision can result in you killing someone who you could have saved. As this game nears completion, I consider it a perfect arpg with no real flaws. Every aspect of the game is well-developed and it is truly fun to play. The depth of character development is impressive, as you can improve your character's stats, pick two classes to specialize in, enhance your abilities by restoring corrupted shrines and investing devotion points in a Constellation system, craft/find a wide array of weapon enhancements and even find relics that give you special abilities like dual-wielding ranged weapons. If you like arpgs with dark stories that don't treat you like an imbecile, this is as good as it gets.			"

												Amazing Game. Takes everything about Diablo 2 that I loved and just made it into something amazing.Extremely user friendly - controls and UI are simple and perfect. Introduction into the game is quick and easy, no hand holding, I loved it.B E A U T I F U L game - on my gtx 970, I run everything on high/very high and this game is just freaking gorgeous. The lighting is my favorite part. As you walk around, the shadows around you shift because your character is the only sorce of light in the room.No bugs, Not One. Zero crashes, zero problems. - such a refined product that I will gladly purchase from this content creator in the future with confidence.I am only 5 hours in but I can tell that I will be neglecting the rest of my steam library for a very long time.  As much as I want to say this is the true successor to Diablo 2.....I can't. That would be a show of disrespect to this game and its creators. This isnt the next Diablo , that torch burned out long ago. This is the first in what I hope to be a series of games.....this is Grim Dawn.			"

												I've played about an hour at this point. But that's the beauty of Grim Dawn - it's just a Diablo 2 clone. It's easy to pick up and play for a bit.There's nothing more to say. NOTHING. It's got some neat customization stuff - you like, build your own class? It's weird. But very very awesome. Similar to PoE, but not even close to the same thing. It's great.The music is fantastic for those who are fans of Diablo 1 and 2's moody, grim soundtracks. No other hack-n-slash has ever come close to that. So this is just fantastic. In general, enemy design seems much closer to Diablo, also. Zombies, weird leaping critters, slithering serpent dudes - they all fit in. Character design, I don't know. Not perfect, but good enough. But unlike the Torchlight series, design isn't all over the place. It's not a very cartoony looking game. And this is a big plus in my opinion.Game's about $5 over what I'd pay for this, if I'm honest. The game feels really quite polished, which is surprising for 2016, sadly. I don't really think the screenshots do the game many favours. In general, I like the graphics (blood textures need some work). If things are low-poly, they're doing a good job of disguising this with relatively high quality textures across the board. This is a game that was made for PC, and feels like it.Game's worth a buy, if you're looking for yet another hack-n-slash. This one does it well, which is surprising considering how many I've turned down. Loki, Torchlight, Diablo III I've still played for a whole bunch of hours, got several heroes geared, and most max level, and I am still not really sure if it was really all that good...Grim dawn feels good. It's fun to kill stuff. Good, crunchy sound effects make beating enemies to a pulp extremely satisfying. Which is fantastic.I don't really know how to end this review, but basically, game's great.

								Wonderful mechanics and beautiful gameplay, with many explorables and trinkets to customize your character to your own liking. Several classes to choose from an allowed to mix classes to change playstyle. It is unique and exciting have recently just purchased this and so far no regrets as I am a fan already. I  enjoy the being able to use guns rather than always swords and shields gameplay that feature seems to me a new way of introducing newer fans of aarpg to this awesome game. However at this moment there is no voice overs for quest' I am not a fan of reading though find myself trapt enjoying the phrases of quest added to a number of listful things that are added very quickly to do's. ( The developers have done a wonderful job on this game and to not be fully completed i was a skeptic, an concerned sbout my purchase though now that i am a proud owner of this unique masterpiece my mind is at ease that i did the right thing by purchasing this title....I look forward to completion and any newer content as already hooked at this an cannot set it down....Give this game a run and you will be thankful as you spent your money wisely....................Like i said, I was skeptical as not to knowing of what layed beneath the title and cool scenery though so dag on excited that i made the plunge into the unkown and found this master piece.  10 of 10			"

												Excellent ARPG with a lot of polish and so many possible builds and variations to try it's almost mind-boggling. The fact the devs were fearless and allow the player to create totally unworkable, useless builds provides half the joy of learning and discovery. It's very possible your first couple of chars will be completely underpowered, so you go back and make use of the generous re-spec options to shuffle some skill points around and try again. By the time you've gotten a couple chars under your belt you'll begin to learn what works, what synergizes where, and you're off to the races.The mobs are mostly typical hack and slash fare, nicely animated, and the loot drops in massive piles like it should. Which brings me to the only minor complaint I'd level right now. NEED MOAR STORAGE! You can eventually buy what looks like four large bank tabs shareable among your various chars, but there are SO MANY crafting materials and tempting drops that they fill up very rapidlyOverall, great game, more than worth full price. A LOT of work went into it and it shows. Please show your support to how early access games should all turn out.			"

								I have a few early games in my catalog but none have the content and stability as Grim Dawn. Even at this alpha stage, it blows away any recent ARPG. It doesnt do anything new, but what it tries to do, it does it right. I am so glad that the game includes Titan Quest dual class system as it gives the player more freedom with builds. The sound and music are amazing and the graphics are very well done, i love how spell attacks are reflected on the water. The game doesnt have random generated dungeons/layouts but thats how good their level design is in Grim Dawn. It has multiple ways to get to an objective and it makes you wanna go explore just to kill everything and get all the loot. I can easily recommend it to any ARPG fans, you will fall in love with this game easily and it will make you forget about others ARPGS "

												Started last week but this game is amazing!It is definately value for money!! 1)Very good old school arpg game - just how arpgs should be made. 2)Graphics are good-visuals-spells, everything looks cool and fine, and at the same time this game is dark and serious.3)Very good skills customization4)Gameplay is fast paced and not complicated- not easy-not hard for someone new in this genre of games(still some bosses require kitting though)I would not like to say anything negative since i do not think there are much to say but i would make a suggestion. For the end game some dungeon like-and dungeon finder should be added to make this a blast. And some improvements for the multiplayer mode would be great too. Single player mode is great. Just focus a little bit more on multiplayer after you have more resources to afford a server. I know that this game was made by a team of 4 people if i am not wrong and now it expanded at 10 people. A must play game if you love rpgs.My rating would be 9/10 for its genre and i totally recommend this game!			"

								-----The Game Diablo III Could Have Been-----Did you play through Titan Quest, but wish the game had more H.P.

Such fantasies are not healthy and the help of a professional is strongly advised).For the Low, Low price of $24.99, all of the things below can be yours today (Okay, maybe not today, but definitely in a week if you work hard)!GUNS: pistols, rifles, revolvers, revolving rifles, muskets, cowboy rifles... you get itSWORDS: BIG swords, little swords, stabby swords, choppy swords, tiny swords, blunt swords...

												First I like to say this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome way better then what I was expecting.Now thats out of the way this game to me is a great mixture of titan quest and diablo which is why I now know why people say its the diablo 3 we never got,I love how they took the best parts of both games and brought them into this one with the skill system of titan quest and the dark theme of diablo, the loot/drop system in this game is the best I've seen in any arpg's Ive ever played,Out of the four hours Ive played so far the game runs really smooth I havent had any problems with the game as other reviewers have mentioned.Now in my personal opinion I wish the mobs were bigger and there were more mob bosses maybe just cause im still  at the beginning of the game I havent seen much yet but I hope you guys can make it like diablo in that sense with future content and the other thing is i wish there was justs bows and crossbows cause i hate guns in this style of games but again this is just my personal opinion.Overall this game is fantastic and well worth the money I paid to play it,Great job guys I hope theres more content you'll be adding to the game in the near future till then I think Im going to be playing this for awhile.9.5/10			"

												Grim Dawn has plenty of content for those that decide to stick with it all the way through and decide to go even further with additional difficulties or try other classes and class combinations. One thorough playthrough on Veteran (Enhanced Normal) took me around 39 hours with a mix of single player and co-op. The hours per dollars spent ratio is fairly high; however, the experience isn’t problem free. The game performs well on everything maxed and only dropped frames when too many effects were going off. So turn down some of those settings if you’re using a weaker rig and planning to have some co-op fun.Story/Atmosphere Unsurprisingly, the world in Grim Dawn is grim. Humanity is struggling to survive amidst the warring factions all vying for control of the world. The quests aren’t revolutionary, but what kept me interested was the world building aspect. Journal entries waiting to be discovered are scattered all across the land. Some of them are very well written and have tones that range from sad to gross to horrifying. Other entries will give you some history or act as a bit of flavor. The game uses darker shades of color and litters the world with rotting dead bodies, ancient dungeons, mines, and many enemies to slaughter. The game is separated into four acts that all have a distinct visual style and map layouts. Some layouts were better than others and didn’t make you walk around too many blocked paths. I felt much more invested in the world than Diablo 3’s (I disliked most of D3’s story) and grew to dislike one of the factions in GD because of how gross they were with human lives. Let’s not forget that this game is an ARPG and the story isn’t the main focus. So let’s move on to the gameplay.Gameplay This game has a slow beginning pace in regard to acquiring skills. This pacing can become even slower if you decide to take on two classes because for the first 50 levels, you’ll be making hard decisions on what skills you want to give your 3 skill points. You can stick to one class and be a purist which lets you specialize and access the later skills much faster, but I prefer mixing things up. To access later skills you have to put points into a mastery bar to unlock them. This means dual classing can put you at a disadvantage if you don’t have a good plan in mind because specializing with your damage abilities far outweighs having a bunch of weak ones. Many abilities can have passives that enhance it even more, which makes specializing very potent. To err with skill point allocation is human, but the game is very forgiving with skill point refunds except for masteries. It starts out fairly cheap and slowly increases in price the more you use it, but I’ve used it for over 120+ skill points without destroying my wallet.Grim Dawn also has a Devotion system which reminds me of Path of Exile’s giant passive tree, but smaller. The Devotion system is made of many constellations which mostly provide passive bonuses and some on-chance abilities which can result in meteor showers, whirlpools, a shield, and more. You must find and cleanse shrines out in the world to earn Devotion points and most of them are out of the way or hidden. Every completed constellation provides affinity for unlocking more powerful constellations which makes things complicated. Planning will be required here since refunding skill points is more difficult. You’ll need Aether Crystals (a material) and iron bits (the currency) for each point.For my main character, I went with a Druid (Shaman + Arcanist) that heavily used the refund system to create a fun character that could handle the challenges of the game set to Veteran. My character underwent some drastic changes as she went from a melee focused lightning Shaman with a pet and some Arcanist abilities to a cold/lightning Arcanist that later added two aether/fire skills found deep within the tree. I mainly used Olexra’s Flash Freeze, a damaging AoE freeze attack; a Lightning Nova from an Amber gem; and Trozan’s Sky Shard, basically 3 ice meteors. I greatly enjoyed freezing all the enemies on the screen and then following up with the other two spells. Eventually, I picked up Aether Ray for that single target beam of death feeling and Devastation to complete my AoE build. The spells and skills are satisfying and impactful once you have your arsenal together. Some of them send the enemies flying. You should definitely use the refund system to maximize your character’s potential.The game has crafting and it’s the kind of crafting where you make one item that’s then needed for another, more powerful item. Example, 3-4 pieces make 1 complete ingredient. Item A, B, and C each require four different complete ingredients. Item Q requires A, B, and C. This kind of progression is tied to crafting materials and Relics. It also lets you try and roll rare gear if you have the Scrap, but I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re trying to replace very low level gear. You can farm materials off of specific monsters, including bosses. To repopulate a world, you’ll need to exit to the main menu and then start the game again which goes by quickly for my system, but still isn’t fun to do. The crafting system requires enough farming to the point of multiple restarts or playthroughs in order to make the more interesting items. In my case, I couldn’t make a Relic I strongly desired because I didn’t find the right blueprint drop for one of the ingredients over my 70+ hours on that single character which made me sigh repeatedly. Still does. I had all the other pieces that went through the process.Finally, there’s a reputation system in play. Enemy factions will grow stronger as you kill more of them which results in better drops. Allied factions will offer more items from their faction merchants. They carry good equipment and make sure you stay appropriately geared if the drops were not in your favor. You can do bounties for a faction to increase your reputation with them, complete relevant quest, or kill the monster types they dislike. Bounties are vaguely described kill quests and not very interesting.Coop Experience Grim Dawn has functional p2p online co-op which works out pretty well for the most part. You’ll never have to worry about servers shutting down or server maintenance, but at the same time, you better make sure all players involved have some decent connections since one of you will be the host. The only disruptive things I’ve noticed were some rare desync issues where you can lose track of the other player’s true position (summons will follow the real deal) and some dead monsters/enemies that stayed behind in odd positions, their bodies normally decay to nothingness. Some player abilities will synergize well together. In my case, I used my max level Olexra’s Flash Freeze to reduce the enemies’ fire resistance by 106% which greatly benefited my co-op partner who dealt 80-90% fire damage. -Grim Dawn is a fairly good ARPG that should keep you entertained for many hours. For me, it has a low replay value. It’s a game that I might check on every now and then. I do have an interest in seeing what future mods might be able to accomplish once the tools are ready since the other ARPGs I play are online only. You can also use a trainer with GD with no issues online or offline. Should you decide to give this game a chance, I’ll point out two useful resources for beginning players: http://www.grimdawn.com/game.php which is a game guide and http://grimcalc.com/ for skill tree planning.

												Did Diablo 3 took your lunch money and stomped on your childhood memories? Look no further. This ARPG is the best I had played since old school Diablo 2. No Hello Kitty Island Adventures graphics (Diablo 3/Torchlight) but with a darker and serious yet unique gore art direction. I can't deal with cartoonish graphic that Blizzard seems to go for.Moreover you can customise your character build as much as you want and not limited to Blizzards skill system that a 1year can design. The dual class as well as old school of skill and stat points are found in Grim Dawn. They further expand the customisation with Devotion points which you have to unlock and you can level the devotion skills and assign them to your minions or skill too!Did I just mention minions? The minions in Grim Dawn are actually useful unlike Diablo 3's minion which seems to serve aesthetic purposes only since they just tear like paper.Crafting system is quite simple yet purposeful (you can use your materials for crafting or imbued it into your gear) and I love that they gave you a lot of inventory space to hoard your loots. Character progression never seem to miss the mark. Even if you finish 'Normal' difficulty, there are other devotion skill points to be unlock on other difficulty modes. The amount of tender loving effects put into the game is amazing, I might have epilepsy with all the things going on sometime during a big fight.Most ARPG seems to have the bread but missing the nutella topping, Grim Dawn delivers both. Definitely a well made game and you should give it a try.			"

								As a big player of Diablo 3 (+2000h), I was looking for something new to wait Reaper of Souls.First impression :- The artwork of the game is very nice, it's a dark environnement and it's very well done.- The gameplay is enjoyable, it's dynamic even during the first levels.- The skill tree / point attribution systems are interresting, you have to think how your character will evolve before spending them (you can undo your choices with a npc but it will cost you some money)- The difficulty is alright, it's not that hard but still, don't forget to upgrade your gear / skills.About the complexity of the game mechanics, it's developed but easy to understand. My native language is French and I have learned the basics very quickly so don't worry about that.I haven't found something wrong with this game yet, It's just perfect. I can't wait for the other updates.			"

Even so, the maps are huge, feels like an open world, to complete them, it cost me at least 8 hours per act.The sound fx is very nice, some mobs have some creepy nasty insect sounds.The fun comes from testing builds, Occultist feels a bit like Witch Doctor from Diablo 3. My main character is Warlock (Occultist + Arcanist) and I feel like playing a WD + Wiz hybrid!I've been playing in veteran difficulty and I've felt farming is somewhat optional, you can only keep scavenging green/blue items but ""silver"" won't drop much.A small color equivalence of items rarity for Diablo3 players  item in diablo3 color in diablo3 color in grim dawn   normal white white   rare yellow yellow   magic blue -none-   legendary orange green   set green blue ** thanks lakylog for noticing the rare/magic colors mistake			"

												tl;dr Bla, bla, bla, etc. etc.  This is a solid ARPG that is fun to play.  ForwardAs a Diablo-alike Grim Dawn (Grim Dark) plays like you might expect.  GD has a bit more polish and content than many games from independent developers.   This game is definetly worth it at full price, and it is a steal when on sale.PROS(+)Lots of cool skills, items, zones, critters, and (+) Theory crafting.(+)  More pros than cons.  CONS(-) Many zones are linear and can be hard to find your way in(-)  There are too few fast travel points, which can lead to having to retracing your steps (especially if you die).  Not that I ever die because I am uber  /wink(-)  There is a respec option, but it is only a partial respecFair warning, I haven't had a chance to try to coop yet.  Hopefully I will get a few of my friends to buy it to try it with me soon.   Friends?  I think I saw a TV show about this a few years ago "

												This game is a great example of what Diablo 3 should of been, Grim Dawn is Top-down Isometric ARPG set in a dark apocalyptic world filled with deadly monsters. Although, repetive enviroments does set back the Atmosphere by a lot. The world might be large, but you may see smiliar enviroments throughout the first playthrough of the game.It has a dual class system which let's you have dozens of combinations fitting your play style, hundreds of items that are unique in their own way, and great CO-OP where loot isn't shared. *Something that every ARPG needs*+Pros Great Class SystemMany unique itemsLove the setting of the gameVoice ActingHundreds of Quests18-30 hours of play timeFrequently updatedGreat Developers- ConsRepetive EnviromentsSlow start to the game (Can get boring for people who are new to ARPGS)Story isn't enforced, and you quickly lose track of what's going onNot many difficulty optionsAside from that the game is fantasic, and should be played by everyone.

												Grim Dawn is made by the same people who did the Titan Quest series, so if you liked those you'll enjoy this for sure.  As someone who has thousands of hours under my belt playing ARPGs going all the way back to the original Diablo, I feel like this game strikes a nice balance in terms of complexity between Diablo 3 (modest) and Path of Exile (very high).  Between the 6 classes, the possibility to Dual Class, unique gear, and Devotion system there is a lot of depth and build diversity here to keep you busy for 100+ hours.  If there are any useless skills in this game, I haven't found them yet.  Everything is viable.  My current favorite is a Druid build where I run around with a rifle that shoots lightning everywhere, I call it the Boomstick build in tribute to Ash from Evil Dead.			"

If you're an ARPG Fan, you'll love this Grim Dawn...If you're not an ARPG Fan, Grim Dawn might make you one. The long and short of this is, it is exactly what you've already been reading, a very well-crafted and enjoyable game. Grim Dawn's Class systems provide the kind of depth and diversity required to dispel the anti-choice deception which plague the majority of RPGs available to us. The option to engage in multi-classing between the 6 available classes adds a secondary dimension, while a devotion system on top of that adds yet a third layer to core possibilities and endgame outcomes. While you will still end up seeing ""optimal build"" templates offered up down the road, rest assured that these will only be pathways for the unimaginative or lazy. Grim Dawn truly frees us from the bonds and anxiety that sometimes cause us to have to choose between what we want, and what we feel we have to do in order to create viable end-game builds. But what is an ARPG without loot? This is truly the crack from which ARPG fans smoke. Grim Dawn has this covered and you'll find it ultimately as fulfilling as you would expect. We are presented with stockpiles of standard ARPG loot fare (""common"", ""magic"", ""legendary"", ""epic"", etc.). While not unique, we can further customize this gear with augmentations along the way. Loot is truly the fourth dimension upon which our characters are built and, in compliment to the class and devotions systems, provide us with now exponential possibilities to reach our own personal end-game. Unlike games like Diablo 3, loot truly becomes the icing on the cake, and not the whole cake itself. Lastly, I read somewhere that what Crate did with combat was to simply ""make it satisfying"". While I can't quite put my finger on exactly how they do this, I can tell you that it's exactly that. The combat is not a burden and does not detract from the overall experience. It's extremely fluid and, given the number of ways in which you will dispatch hordes of foes, you'll start to question your own true control over bloodlust. At the end of the day, Grim Dawn is that once-a-year gem that leaves you asking why the hell you didn't hear the hype train rumbling down the tracks before this. Especially given the value price attached, Grim Dawn is refreshingly awesome. It's an experience you shouldn't deny yourself.			"

												Stay a while and listen.Because you can't anymore where we should have been able to. Remember the good old days of ARPGs? Well so does Grim Dawn. If you like Diablo, Diablo 2, and Titan Quest, then you want Grim Dawn. It's the classic ARPG formula expanded on and upgraded. Visually the game looks ten years old. So far that's just fine because it's mechanically pristine. Play it. Give these developers your money.			"

												I seldom do a review but this game screams for one.  This is a real treasure for Torchlight 2 and Diablo 3 fans. Considering the price it is a steal. If you like RPG this one fires on all cylinders. I am having a blast and can't stop trying out new characters. I am running graphics on High to Very High on my 780TI and all is smooth. Game is beautiful.Be aware I had a difficult time getting the game to initially start up {Windows 10}.  If you get a black box run the repair.exe in: C:\Program Files {X86}\Steam\Steam Aps\ and open the GRIM folder. Worked fine after clicking the repair icon.			"

								This game is in beta and still better than most arpg's out there.  I would say that it is better than most games that are out there, period.  It sits up there with D2 and PoE as being one of the best in the genre.  The dungeons are big.  The loot drops are exciting (although I wish they stuck to the more conventional colour coding...white,green, blue, yellow, purple, gold). The whole yellow being the ""magic"" tier throws me off.  Plenty of named mobs and mini boss types.  Oh yes and right from act 1 you get ""side"" dungeons to go grab loot from, They require special keys and whatnot.  I am overly excited to see this game as a final product but will continue to play through beta.  p.s.  Add me if you care to play some mutli-player loot grinds.			"

								Ever wanted to play a character who specialises in molotov cocktails as their primary weapon? I bet you do now! :)This is a fantastic Diablo-style action-rpg by some of the same people who made Titan Quest. The game is a LOT like Titan Quest and that is a good thing since TQ was awesome. I think this game is probably better then TQ, as well as more recent games like Torchlight II and Van Helsing.What do I like about the game? Well, the game is neither too generous or too stingy with it's loot. The skill system nicely mixes active skills, with various passive skills that modify how they work. The game isn't too generous with skill points, and you'll always feel keen for that next level up. The game rewards you for exploring and you'll find hidden quests, random encounters, loot chests and boss fights. The action finds a perfect mix between fast paced and not being so fast that you have no time to strategize. Combat requires you to be aware of how you position yourself and keep an eye on what is going on. They seem to have found the right balances to make the game fun across the board.Also don't be too scared by the Early Access label. The game is stable, mostly bug-free and feels ""complete"" with no noticable missing features except that it cuts short where the last act will eventually start. (One bug I did notice is that when I changed the resolution, mouse clicks on the ui don't always detect the right places until you restart the game.) Even with the game truncated, you'll still get quite a few hours of gameplay. After reaching the end, I immediately started a new character. There is also a ""Veteran"" option.Highly recommended!

								I have been a fan of ARPG's since their conception with the original Diablo game, and as time has moved on there have been more and more games come out. Having played Titan Quest I loved the engine and how it all work. So when the latest round of ARPG's were announced I was excited, a new Diablo, Path of Exile etc It seemed great but having played the most that were on offer, I found that nothing queld my thirst for blood and loot like Grim Dawn. I come back to this game time and time again, every new build I play through at least twice, trying different classes and builds and find more stuff, and everytime I am wanting more, to the point like I said I play through it yet again. Never have I experienced an ARPG as addictive as this one. What makes it addictive? I believe it is a combination of good game play, customisation of a character taht makes it truely yours and just great game mechanics; Items are upgraded easily, unique items can be upgraded, and the effects (visually) of some items just look great e.g. my flaming boots and green smoking helmet. Visually this game is great, hands down more Grim Dark than most other ARPGs. I kickstarted this game and it has been one of the best investments I have made, a solid game that leaves you wanting more.

								Ever wanted to play a character who specialises in molotov cocktails as their primary weapon? I bet you do now! :)This is a fantastic Diablo-style action-rpg by some of the same people who made Titan Quest. The game is a LOT like Titan Quest and that is a good thing since TQ was awesome. I think this game is probably better then TQ, as well as more recent games like Torchlight II and Van Helsing.What do I like about the game? Well, the game is neither too generous or too stingy with it's loot. The skill system nicely mixes active skills, with various passive skills that modify how they work. The game isn't too generous with skill points, and you'll always feel keen for that next level up. The game rewards you for exploring and you'll find hidden quests, random encounters, loot chests and boss fights. The action finds a perfect mix between fast paced and not being so fast that you have no time to strategize. Combat requires you to be aware of how you position yourself and keep an eye on what is going on. They seem to have found the right balances to make the game fun across the board.Also don't be too scared by the Early Access label. The game is stable, mostly bug-free and feels ""complete"" with no noticable missing features except that it cuts short where the last act will eventually start. (One bug I did notice is that when I changed the resolution, mouse clicks on the ui don't always detect the right places until you restart the game.) Even with the game truncated, you'll still get quite a few hours of gameplay. After reaching the end, I immediately started a new character. There is also a ""Veteran"" option.Highly recommended!

Early Access Review
								I have been a fan of ARPG's since their conception with the original Diablo game, and as time has moved on there have been more and more games come out. Having played Titan Quest I loved the engine and how it all work. So when the latest round of ARPG's were announced I was excited, a new Diablo, Path of Exile etc It seemed great but having played the most that were on offer, I found that nothing queld my thirst for blood and loot like Grim Dawn. I come back to this game time and time again, every new build I play through at least twice, trying different classes and builds and find more stuff, and everytime I am wanting more, to the point like I said I play through it yet again. Never have I experienced an ARPG as addictive as this one. What makes it addictive? I believe it is a combination of good game play, customisation of a character taht makes it truely yours and just great game mechanics; Items are upgraded easily, unique items can be upgraded, and the effects (visually) of some items just look great e.g. my flaming boots and green smoking helmet. Visually this game is great, hands down more Grim Dark than most other ARPGs. I kickstarted this game and it has been one of the best investments I have made, a solid game that leaves you wanting more. If you are willing to loose hours to a game, then let me recommend this one.			"

								I started playing when they first announced this game and got to play a pretty early build of the game. It really had the old Titan Quest feel to it. It was a bit buggy and not very polished (as it should be for an early build for a game) But it got me interested, I finished progress they offered back then and stopped playing. Now after a while I am picking it back up again. And man let me tell you am I SATISFIED with the chagnes they made. Once bit thing was how the hitting mechanic works. Titan Quest although fun the hitting always felt a bit ""floaty"" What Grim Dawn offers now it's a much better experience. I would say this is on par if not better than Path of Exile and Diablo 3. This game will be amazing once the entire product is finished and polished. More people needs to get to know this game and support it.			"

								 This game is actually quite fun, I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Even though this is an early access review, I can say this game already has it together.It has an amazing skill tree/multiclass system that I absolutely adore! It's ""Hardcore"" enough as to not put off those kinds of players (i.e min/maxers,etc.) but it can also be played quite casually. If you have played other dungeon crawlers/hack and slash rpgs you will feel right at home here. While the game is terrific, it's not without it's short comings, such as sometimes your fps will drop, I have had a couple crashes (literally only 2), pushing your skill buttons on the keyboard can sometimes feel a tad unresponsive, just minor polish and optimization stuff. Overall the game is quite nice and with the recent addition of multiplayer the game just got that much better. This is definitely one to keep your eye on!

								Though this game is still in early access at the moment, you already get a huge amount of content for your money.If you like dark fantasy and old school Hack & Slash games like Diablo I and II, Darkstone, Sacred or Dugeon Siege, this is definitely a must have. Furthermore, you get the incredibly flexible skill tree and leveling system from Titan Quest, which make the game even deeper, with, even at its early access stage, huge replayability. In addition to that, there's also an interesting crafting system.The grim atmosphere is well rendered with realistic graphics, which recalls of Diablo II style. This is much more than a promising game, this is already, in my opinion, a great game. Get it now, when it's cheap :D			"

								Now, keep in mind that this little piece of art is still under heavy development and that Early Access Review title is quite important when it comes to judge such projects based on user reviews. Currently, there are some optimization issues that might or might not bug you out and they're obviously are going to be solved over time. But, regardless, they won't keep you having fun with this game.Grim Dawn is an attempt to create an old school RPG in an interesting, industrial world where you wake up to your funeral and thrown into these series of apocalyptic events. - and it does what it claims perfectly with its lovely storytelling, well-designed scenery and lots of details that you'll find yourself paying attention, unintentionally.It features Dual Class System which is a decent way to theorycraft but not as detailed as Path of Exile. Combat System might seem a bit dull at first, but its a Progressive Game and you'll unlock the capabilities of your characters over time. So if you're giving this a try, you should give it a hell of a try to have fun with it. - Very detailed Character and Item Models; Breathtaking, well-produced Soundtrack; Quite variety of foes; Awesome Storytelling and well-placed Lore elements; Carefully designed world that will provide a lot for those who are observant enough.This game is going to be strong title and it has a huge potential of being a cult. - Its Development should take the time they need to finish what they've started. So, don't be impatient about it. Action RPG is a hard category to progress on. - and so far, Crate Entertainment is doing a very good job.			"

								Grim Dawn is still in Early Access, but there are hundresd of hours of gameplay to be had and I strongly recommend those who enjoy ARPGs give it a try. Buy it from the developer's website - they'll get a larger cut and still provide a Steam key.I repeat - buy it. Stop reading reviews. Buy it. If you have ever enjoyed an ARPG you will enjoy this.I've only clocked up about 30 hours, doing what I always do in an ARPG - hard mode, hardcore - so these are initial impressions.Grim Dawn takes a little from the very best ARPGs, and while it isn't quite the perfect mix, it is pretty close. We have the 'grimdark' feel of Path of Exile; the expansive levels of Torchlight; the diverse class system of Titan Quest; and the satisfying crunch of combat from Diablo. The only thing missing is the pet system from Torchlight. I miss my war-badger.At present there are five main classes, though a sixth has been teased. At level 10 you can keep your class or dual-class, meaning there are many combinations. Fancy building a six-shooter-toting gal in massive armour with a pet hell-hound? You can. Want a wizard in skimpy armour with a massive deathray? You can do that as well. How about a guy who looks like Witchfinder General who can freeze enemies then chuck a bag full of bombs at them? Yup. Pump points into whatever stats you want, develop your character as you see fit. This sort of diversity means no playthrough is the same - though I think I would have liked some procedurally generated maps.+Character customisation+Vibe+Combat+Quests+Replayability+Enemies stay at your level or above, meaning you can never grind and sleepwalk+Loot - lots of it and you can create your own +The attack-delay that dogged Titan Quest is gone+This game is HARD :)-It can feel like a slog sometimes between portals. Everytime you exit it saves your XP and equipment and any portals you've found, but boots you back to base-camp. If you've slogged through reams of enemies but not found a portal you can't leave without having to do it again.-Some repetition between enemy types - not in the same league as D3 or POE, but I miss the enemy diversity of Torchlight and Torchlight 2.-The music is a little forgettable - though suitably atmospheric.Frankly Runic and Grinding Gears set the promise for what Diablo 3 COULD have been. Grim Dawn fulfils it.This is the game you've been waiting for ;)			"

												So far the most entertaining and engaging of the diablo-clones, could use a couple pointers from path of exiles combat system but otherwise really very nice.Classes are well crafted, lots of customisation, multiple skill trees, for your class, for your horoscopes of all things, for your specs, its nuts. You can boost yourself up quickly if you are lazy and join multiplayer groups, everyone has surplus gear of classes they dont use, i've gotten heaps of gear from such people, your single player characters can be multiplayer if you want, its easy to switch back and forth.I like how they have a simple respec system, content is great, i can micromanage stats and skills to my hearts desire and i can feel the difference, its the ARPG to buy folks, my favourite out of TL2, D3 and PoE!My only small issue is with online people bugging out the game when they join or just the occasional crash, but its no big deal, it's possibly related to my meager internet connection.Definetly worth a buy, especially considering this is the devs first game and the more successful it is the better they can make sequels and the like, Crate is a very promising dev team, and a surprisingly small team too!And even more amazingly, they are STILL making more content for the game, in my book they beat all other contenders a long time ago, and they are still making more for us! sure its mostly paid, but at this point i dont care, all their content is varied and worth playing.

								Great Action RPG, especially since even being really early its still really good. Not particularly interesting enemywise, but the story is actually pretty good when you look at the remnants of civilization and the scraps of written lore. Plus, the classes are all pretty unique and a good combination of passive and active skills. Not to mention, once you hit level 10 you can choose to spec into another character class, resulting in some hilarious mixes of power. Currently, my favorite is the pyromancer, a mix of the base demolitionist and occultist classes which results in an engineer obsessed with dark pacts, fire, and having a pet raven. I named him Gerald. "

								Grim Dawn has to be one of the most interesting Early Access games I have played.  I'm not a big ARPG fan but I still manage to find this game really enjoyable. The game runs smooth and looks amazing on GTX 960.  The character customization allows you to create a build the best suits your playing style.  The only problem I've got  with Grim Dawn, is that it is a loot game. There is tons of loot to collect  and save for other characters but your limited on the storage space. There is a Storage bank in the main town but I found that I have fill most the the slots or don't have enough money to buy more slots just before I finish chapter 2.  Saving to much gear that would be great for other characters on my next play through.Grim Dawn is a very solid early access game. If it wasn't for the early access tag, I wouldn't have known the difference.  I strongly recommend for anyone to buy.			"

								I procrastinated for a long time buying this game since I hadn't bought an Early Access game before. Also, I was worried that I couldn't adapt to the visual and combat style of Grim Dawn as I had been exclusively playing Diablo 3. Still, I succumbed to temptations of wanting to play an alternative ARPG. Boy, I'm so glad I did because this game is worth every single penny I paid. It takes some time to get used to the dual class system and crafting system, but once you get a hang of things, these two aspects of the game will keep you playing and playing for hours. There are plenty of welcome twists to the usual ARPG mechanics but still stay true to tradition. The game is not yet complete but I've already clocked 20+ hours on 2 characters, and hoping to create another few more before I become burned out on games (lol). It feels awesome to be part of the developmental process for such a promising game. Buy it now! Don't procrastinate like I did!			"

								If you've ever played diablo and wanted a bit more customization and a bit less of the inventory hassle, this might be the game for you, the ability to automatically join similar component items together instantly if they are in the same bag and auto sort each bag independently is amazing I am playing a witch hunter (find out which 2 classes unlock that sweet combo), I can summon my 2 pets and set my Raven to agressive mode and my Hellhound to defensive mode and dual wield bladed weapons. My character basically works as a catalyst for his allies, thus having pets makes it a whole lot more managable when playing by myself, as taking time to heal and look after their health bars does distract from enemies. The game is amazing, I urge you to find a playstyle you are actually good at because I realize that I am NOT a tank now...			"

In other ARPG's after a couple re-runs of areas to grind, it started becoming a chore rather than an enjoying game. Another feature that really got to me was the impact of quests, and the choices you made. For example, if you kill a certain person, later on other people might come after you for vengeance. Vice versa, if you save a certain person, they might later come back and offer their aid/services. Grim Dawn does what all ARPG's does well, but at the moment I find nothing really unique about it that stands out. Riftportals are similar to PoE's portals. Code base is pretty much the same as TQ. But despite having no real unique feature, all of it's basic essentials are done amazingly well, leaving for a addictive game. Note that the game is still in early access, if it's this great now, I can't really imagine the finished product.			"

								The last game like this I actually put more than a day or two into (not a full 24-hour day mind you, but like... 2-3 hours per day) was Diablo II (I get bored easily with alot of free-to-play games with microtransactions, & whatnot) and this is THE CLOSEST I've come to the magic of that game and it's amazing predecessor (Diablo.) I have played a few other games that were fun... but nothing that grabbed my attention like this. I'm having an absolute blast!I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who, like me, has been looking for a Diablo/Diablo II-esque experience, without having to deal with all that ""fancy schmancy free to playz, marketplace, epic lewt, neato costumes for just $#.##, blah blah"" crap. You just buy it, play it, LOVE it, done dealy!			"

								Great Hack and Slash game like Diablo 2.Build on the engine of Titan Quest by a few of those developers.Pros Choose 2 masteries out of 5 for a total of 10 different possible characters. Plenty of item diversity, lots of things to collect! Grim atmosphere and art direction. Friendly community. Check out the official game guide and forums[www.grimdawn.com]. Zombies!Cons No protected online. (coop is possible, but nothing stops strangers from cheating). Poorly optimized, very CPU bound. Some mechanics lack in-game explanations. Another game with zombies!If you like RPG's, you'll love this game.			"

								This is both a fun and interesting game.  It's what a really good RPG wants to be when it grows up.  You're not stuck in a rut.  You can develop your charachter pretty much any way you want.  Grim Dawn is both fresh and comfortable at the same time; highly intuitive, easy to play, easier to have fun, just as satisfying for solo or group play.  The new group interface was a snap to set up.  While the game has a natural progression, it never feels scripted.  Don't like your character build?  You can re-do it without starting over.  Easy-peasy.  The whole game is full of thoughtful versatility.  I keep coming back and playing it again and again as new content and features are added.  :)			"

								The spiritual successor of Titan Quest, for me that meant a lot. Given the game 2 hours of gameplay I can say a few things.Pros: 1) They have the duel class system, and each class has another that would make a lot of sense to combine with another, although I haven't tried any of the vague ones ie Demolitionist + Occultist2) That game feels a lot more open than Titan Quest did, although you are still on a semi liniar map with definite chokepoints that you have to hit, but you are a lot more free to rush on through or take your time and explore the apocalyptic setting to your hearts content3) They added a hardcore mode. I've lost a good man and woman to it so far, very intense when you don't have money for potions4) Added a veteran mode, I have no clue what it does, but yay! options5) Leveling up is way faster than in Titan Quest, and skill trees go WAAAAAY furtherCons: 1) I don't find the quest line very interesting2) Not a lot of enemy variety edit: I'm stupid, there's quite a bit http://grimcalc.com/monsters (thank you Dr Mcninja)3) Gold is scarce, could also be a pro if you like a brutal experience on hardcoreConclusion:This game is a solid 8/10 I will definetly be beating it in the near future!P.S. I have not done any multiplayer so I don't know if drop rate is affected much or if there are issues in it			"

								Grim dawn is still in early access, but it's already better than many games are at full release. If you enjoy the ARPG/hack&slash genre, then you'll have a lot of fun with this game. Also while I have not played Titanquest, This game was developed by many of the same people who made titanquest, and is considered in a way to be the spiritual successor to it. I have not played titanquest yet, but I've been having so much fun with this game that I'll definitely want to buy TQ while I wait for development to be finished.A good amount of people seem to like a pro/con list, so I'll make onePros:Combat is funGood skill treesI can tell they put a lot of work in to the sounds, and the sounds are timed just right that it gives a satisfying thud to hit an enemy with melee.As close as you can get to open world with an ARPGHigh difficulty settings and hardcore mode availableExcellent graphics for an indie gameOptional modding features will be available in the final gameOne roguelike dungeon already available as endgame contentConsNot yet completed, so you may run out of story quickly			"

								I started playing when they first announced this game and got to play a pretty early build of the game. It really had the old Titan Quest feel to it. It was a bit buggy and not very polished (as it should be for an early build for a game) But it got me interested, I finished progress they offered back then and stopped playing. Now after a while I am picking it back up again. And man let me tell you am I SATISFIED with the chagnes they made. Once bit thing was how the hitting mechanic works. Titan Quest although fun the hitting always felt a bit ""floaty"" What Grim Dawn offers now it's a much better experience. I would say this is on par if not better than Path of Exile and Diablo 3. This game will be amazing once the entire product is finished and polished. More people needs to get to know this game and support it.			"

								 This game is actually quite fun, I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Even though this is an early access review, I can say this game already has it together.It has an amazing skill tree/multiclass system that I absolutely adore! It's ""Hardcore"" enough as to not put off those kinds of players (i.e min/maxers,etc.) but it can also be played quite casually. If you have played other dungeon crawlers/hack and slash rpgs you will feel right at home here. While the game is terrific, it's not without it's short comings, such as sometimes your fps will drop, I have had a couple crashes (literally only 2), pushing your skill buttons on the keyboard can sometimes feel a tad unresponsive, just minor polish and optimization stuff. Overall the game is quite nice and with the recent addition of multiplayer the game just got that much better. This is definitely one to keep your eye on!

Furthermore, you get the incredibly flexible skill tree and leveling system from Titan Quest, which make the game even deeper, with, even at its early access stage, huge replayability. In addition to that, there's also an interesting crafting system.The grim atmosphere is well rendered with realistic graphics, which recalls of Diablo II style.

								Now, keep in mind that this little piece of art is still under heavy development and that Early Access Review title is quite important when it comes to judge such projects based on user reviews. Currently, there are some optimization issues that might or might not bug you out and they're obviously are going to be solved over time. But, regardless, they won't keep you having fun with this game.Grim Dawn is an attempt to create an old school RPG in an interesting, industrial world where you wake up to your funeral and thrown into these series of apocalyptic events. - and it does what it claims perfectly with its lovely storytelling, well-designed scenery and lots of details that you'll find yourself paying attention, unintentionally.It features Dual Class System which is a decent way to theorycraft but not as detailed as Path of Exile. Combat System might seem a bit dull at first, but its a Progressive Game and you'll unlock the capabilities of your characters over time. So if you're giving this a try, you should give it a hell of a try to have fun with it. - Very detailed Character and Item Models; Breathtaking, well-produced Soundtrack; Quite variety of foes; Awesome Storytelling and well-placed Lore elements; Carefully designed world that will provide a lot for those who are observant enough.This game is going to be strong title and it has a huge potential of being a cult. - Its Development should take the time they need to finish what they've started. So, don't be impatient about it. Action RPG is a hard category to progress on. - and so far, Crate Entertainment is doing a very good job.			"

								♥♥♥♥.. Too much loot, too much, It's a Litt... *dead*This is the RPG game that I've been waiting for since Reaper of Souls, I'm not a story guy but my concern with any video game is the gameplay. I can say that Sonic Boom story is good except that it's unplayable so it sucks (That type of things).I wasn't that impressed on the first view or on the last patch but I was lucky enough to buy it weeks before the final patch kicks in, then ♥♥♥♥ just got real. I'm glad they patch most of the issues I'm having in the game so bless them, I have a few things that need to itch is that sometime that I got stuck in halls of enemy because the mob block the main target and didn't charge based on the nearest mob on the cursor so If they read this (Please please read this) I want my charge to be 100% hit, but if not it would cancel the spell so I won't get frustrated when die thanks to the cooldown.but here it is, Thanks for making the game and I really love it.I have to add this to the Dev:The lobby is a little weird, I had like 3 minutes problem that my friend confused how do we look at the lobby. It turns out he had to press play to view the lobby. weird but I wish there's an instruction.			"

												I played Diablo 3 a lot, leveling up quite a few characters and then I found myself at the end game with RoS. As much as I love Diablo 3, I find myself turning to it like cocaine. As much as I love cocaine, once I start, it ruins my life and I keep doing it until I burn out. As I weened myself off of Diablo 3, I tried other games. Torchlight was a bit too cartoony fo me and Path of Exile didn't quite give me that fix that Diablo 3 did. Then I found Grim Dawn on here and it seems like a great mix of Diablo 2, Diablo 3, Path of Exile and the old-ish Titan Quest. While the game is in early access, it proves to be a competent ARPG so far. I can't wait to see what they do with the game and hopefully they create an intriguing end-game that keeps me interested like RoS did. I got the game on a sale and it is worth every penny so far! The game is now finished and it is excellent. Now time to spend some serious time with it.			"

Grim Dawn is an Action RPG with dark atmosphere, good itemization and many ways to build your character.The story is interesting and there is enough to keep those interested immersed. The graphics are very good - not amazing, but authentic for the type of game. Not cartoonish at all. The pace is great and there's enough play diversity to offer plenty of replayability. It's a great mix of challenge and depth. Blizzard has a LOT to learn from the developers of Grim Dawn. Massively entertaining with depth that surpasses any ARPG in existence. I have been waiting for this game to be released over the years and I'm so very happy to see that it's released and it's beautiful.PROS • Itemization.• Crafting.• Factions.• Multi-class system.CONS• Some NPCs lack of voice acting.I recommend this game highly. I've only played as single player, but the game does offer co-op multiplayer via local server connections. "

												I play allot of Action RPG games this one outclasses them all. I grew up playing PS2 hack and slash game's like Champion's of norath, when I saw the screen shots for this game I just knew I would love it. What I didn't know was that I would play this game as much as I have. I play by myself, however there is a healthy online community of players who always have servers up for you to join. The gear in this game is creative and beautiful. There are many item set's that link together and give you additional stats or ability's. Most bosses have healthy drop rates. (This was a problem I ran into with titan quest) When you play on harder difficulty's the game drops gear more frequently, When you get to higher levels like 50+ the game will start dropping legendary gear & Empowered lower level gear to match your current level. Empowered gear is gear you get at say level 15 or 30, with triple its original stats so you can use it at level 58 or 65. The game also features a meal system that gives you a translucent health bar that refill's your current health bar when combat end's its rather useful and it is a nice feature on the harder difficulties. As far as the class system goes its just like titans quest, you choose the Soldier tree and say the Nightblade tree and your class becomes a Blademaster. You can mix all the classes like this and make many different characters. There is so much more to talk about, I would recommend this game to any Action RPG gamer. Thank you crate for this amazing game, whenever I felt like something needed to be changed or added into the game it's like you read my mind and changed or added that feature. Crate you have made a masterpiece with this game and I cannot wait to see what y'all do next.			"

Early Access Review
								I scrapped my original review in favor of this one, instead.Grim Dawn is the best ARPG I have played in years and I've played almost all of them; the entire Diablo franchise; Torchlight franchise; Path of Exile; Van Helsing franchise; Titan Quest [albeit after its prime]; and many more lesser known titles.  I adore isometric ""hack n slash"" games.  Grim Dawn has a lot of shining qualities and some blemishes, but the number one reason this game has stolen my soul lies in its deceptively complex nature.  Yes, you can load up a tank character, stacked with health and defensive ability, but with lukewarm damage, and spam 1-2 buttons through the available content quite easily.  For some, including myself, that was a little off-putting at first.  However, to truly min/max and tap into the untamed potential of a god, you need a deep understanding of how classes and abilities interact with each other; where diminishing returns of skills are; and so much more.  The dual class system [also featured in Titan Quest] is riddled with potential builds and each build ACTUALLY plays significantly differently [something I greatly appreciate].  Man, I love it.The game also has tons of components.  Components are similar to features in other games; they can be attached to armor/weapons/jewelry to buff resistances, damage types, health, constitution, and seemingly any other stat.  Many of them can be upgraded to a second rank or combined with another to create an entirely new component.  There are a LOT of different components.  So many so that they eventually pack your inventory full of random bits and pieces [this is one major annoyance for me.  I'd like to see a separate inventory area with nearly unlimited space for ""crafting components""; this would function similar to Warhammer Online's separate bag for quest items].  They are a nice complement to skills that you might be trying to build around in the actual mastery trees.  Some people complain about Grim Dawn's graphics, I've never understood why.  The graphics are raw and gritty and complement the games atmosphere excellently.  I cannot think of another game in the genre that has truly ""better"" graphics.  The other day I logged onto Diablo 3 to see what their Ladder system was like and the graphics felt way too cartoony for me.  Sure, they are polished, but they left a lot to be desired.  Grim Dawn's graphics feel right for what the game is: a gritty tale of survival.  Sure, some item models are a little bit less desirable than others, but nothing is ever going to top the disgust I have for Path of Exile's Templar class.  ""Where're my pants, brah!?""The main problems in Grim Dawn are pretty well-documented.  Not necessarily on the steam forums, but certainly on Grim Dawn's official site [a site in which the development team is quite active and responsive; when I wrote about their ""constitution"" mechanic, we got into quite a heated debate which I really enjoyed and appreciated].  I'll touch on a few of my qualms here:            1) There are a lot of damage types and none of them feel that ""distinct"".  What I mean by this is, outside of frost [which has the chance to freeze, and a chill effect], the damage type(s) you're building around are pretty much just for the role-playing side of things.  That isn't to say that certain mobs aren't more resistant to certain types of damage, because they are - i'm looking at you skeletons and ghosts! - it's just to say damage types don't have the type of cool status effects found in Path of Exile.  Some of the skills and skill modifiers, themselves, add these features, but I think it'd be nice to have some baseline effects as well.  The second reason this sucks is it can feel, at times, very difficult to find synergy between some of the mastery types.  This will certainly be less of an issue when the game officially releases with a high level cap and availability of all mastery types, but right now it is tough.            2) Melee OWNS Casters right now.  All weapons have baseline physical damage, which means if they roll multiple affixes/suffixes that buff physical damage they will fundamentally be more powerful than casting builds.  Casters only benefit from %fire damage or % burn damage affixes not generic fire damage [ex. 5-10 fire dmg, 5-10 burn damage] as spells do not count as ""attacks"" and therefore don't utilize, for the most part, the weapon's base weapon damage when modifying a skill [ex. a spell will deal 70 vitality damage; an attack might deal 125% weapon damage + a flat 25 physical damage].  Right now all of the most powerful builds rely on physical/piercing damage for these exact reasons.  Similarly, spells cannot lifesteal.  Couple that with the way stat points are functioning right now [another feature I love, couldn't believe they eliminated it in Diablo 3] and it leaves casting classes at a huge disadvantage.  That said, the devs have acknowledged the problem exists, made their position felt, and are working with the community to come to a reasonable solution.My hands are literally getting tired of typing, so I think I will begin to wrap this up.  Grim Dawn is phenomenal, i've already sunk well over 150 hours into it and the full game isn't even released.  The storyline is better done than most other ARPGs [not known for their strong story-telling - this type; i'm not talking about the Baldur's Gates of the world...semantics people], with a lot of pieces of parchment that have bits and pieces of additional story/atmosphere-building littered throughout the world. If the game is to last long-term in the world of insatiable gaming desire, I think it will need to consider developing some type of end-game [they've sort of given a preview of how they plan to develop things with Steps of Torment 4-5]. Right now most of my lasting enjoyment has come from farming bosses for unique items, carving through the hardest dungeons, and experimenting with different builds [mostly the latter].  I don't think it needs to create an endgame as bonafide as Path of Exile's [which has really set the standard for what an ARPG can accomplish], but I do hope to see more Rogue-like dungeons implemented.That's all for now, pick this game up.

								After playing the old game Titan Quest IM i've been waiting for a similar in this genre, or any other game as good as TQ in this genre, none have been made unfortunately.Then i found this game and saw maybe this is it, after buying and playing the game i got so hard into this game that i can't stop playing it :) you even can feel yourself playing Titan Quest 2. At long last i found the game i've been looking for!No wonder that the game still need some improvements, adjustments to items and devotion trees perhaps, more end game content, some bugs fix before the final release that so close.But in the front line THIS GAME IS SO GOOD, unique of it's genre, fun to play. Very suggested +1.Keep going Crate, make this game better and better!			"

												Absolutely brilliant. I was, and remain, a huge fan of Titan Quest - but this is the first time I've resonated and connected so strongly with an ARPG since Diablo II. It's an immediate love connection, and when I'm not playing it I can't stop thinking about it. The story and world feel rich and interesting, and I actually find myself listening to and reading the quest and lore texts (an unusual feat for an ARPG, and something I felt was lacking in TQ). The gameplay is fast, addictive, intense, and deeply rewarding. The power curve is fast and satisfying. The classes are diverse and exciting, and so far I haven't invested in a skill that felt disappointing or boring.This game is obviously crafted with love and skill, and if you (like me) wondered what could have been if the team behind Titan Quest had gotten another shot to build on what they had learned and created before, this game will be a very fulfilling and nostalgic and wonderful experience, and well worth the modest asking price.Note for veterans of the genre: the default difficulty option is a bit on the easy side, but turning it up to ""veteran"" offers a good challenge, and the screen being constantly filled with enemies and explosions and sparks and blood and loot will do plenty to scratch the itch you've been feeling since you finally ran out of loot to grind in Diablo II.

								Around 1 week after the release of the final content i wanted to update my review:I cannot describe how fantastic this game has become since the start of the early Alpha. Even in Early Access state of development I rarely encountered any Bugs. I love it that there are still Companies like Crate who put a lot of passion and love into games. Grim Dawn is a great example for that.Also, for the price, the game gives you a HUGE amount of content.You liked Titan Quest and Diablo 2? In my opinion this feels like a perfect mix of those games. It gives you the dark atmosphere of Diablo with some of the core game mechanics of Titan Quest, and even a lot more.For me, this is the best ARPG lately and i have played quite a few.I strongly recommend this game to everyone who likes ARPGs.

Highly customizable in that aspect.-Gives me a good feeling and satisfaction of bashing (exploding/evicerating/ripping open/freezing/burning/melting/throwing turds at) the skull of a creature like Diablo 2 did.-Same sort of graphical/design style and gore that Diablo 2 fans will remember.-A must try at least with steam's new 2hr<less gameplay return function!See you among the corpses.-Bekz			"

Early Access Review
								I scrapped my original review in favor of this one, instead.Grim Dawn is the best ARPG I have played in years and I've played almost all of them; the entire Diablo franchise; Torchlight franchise; Path of Exile; Van Helsing franchise; Titan Quest [albeit after its prime]; and many more lesser known titles.  I adore isometric ""hack n slash"" games.  Grim Dawn has a lot of shining qualities and some blemishes, but the number one reason this game has stolen my soul lies in its deceptively complex nature.  Yes, you can load up a tank character, stacked with health and defensive ability, but with lukewarm damage, and spam 1-2 buttons through the available content quite easily.  For some, including myself, that was a little off-putting at first.  However, to truly min/max and tap into the untamed potential of a god, you need a deep understanding of how classes and abilities interact with each other; where diminishing returns of skills are; and so much more.  The dual class system [also featured in Titan Quest] is riddled with potential builds and each build ACTUALLY plays significantly differently [something I greatly appreciate].  Man, I love it.The game also has tons of components.  Components are similar to features in other games; they can be attached to armor/weapons/jewelry to buff resistances, damage types, health, constitution, and seemingly any other stat.  Many of them can be upgraded to a second rank or combined with another to create an entirely new component.  There are a LOT of different components.  So many so that they eventually pack your inventory full of random bits and pieces [this is one major annoyance for me.  I'd like to see a separate inventory area with nearly unlimited space for ""crafting components""; this would function similar to Warhammer Online's separate bag for quest items].  They are a nice complement to skills that you might be trying to build around in the actual mastery trees.  Some people complain about Grim Dawn's graphics, I've never understood why.  The graphics are raw and gritty and complement the games atmosphere excellently.  I cannot think of another game in the genre that has truly ""better"" graphics.  The other day I logged onto Diablo 3 to see what their Ladder system was like and the graphics felt way too cartoony for me.  Sure, they are polished, but they left a lot to be desired.  Grim Dawn's graphics feel right for what the game is: a gritty tale of survival.  Sure, some item models are a little bit less desirable than others, but nothing is ever going to top the disgust I have for Path of Exile's Templar class.  ""Where're my pants, brah!?""The main problems in Grim Dawn are pretty well-documented.  Not necessarily on the steam forums, but certainly on Grim Dawn's official site [a site in which the development team is quite active and responsive; when I wrote about their ""constitution"" mechanic, we got into quite a heated debate which I really enjoyed and appreciated].  I'll touch on a few of my qualms here:            1) There are a lot of damage types and none of them feel that ""distinct"".  What I mean by this is, outside of frost [which has the chance to freeze, and a chill effect], the damage type(s) you're building around are pretty much just for the role-playing side of things.  That isn't to say that certain mobs aren't more resistant to certain types of damage, because they are - i'm looking at you skeletons and ghosts! - it's just to say damage types don't have the type of cool status effects found in Path of Exile.  Some of the skills and skill modifiers, themselves, add these features, but I think it'd be nice to have some baseline effects as well.  The second reason this sucks is it can feel, at times, very difficult to find synergy between some of the mastery types.  This will certainly be less of an issue when the game officially releases with a high level cap and availability of all mastery types, but right now it is tough.            2) Melee OWNS Casters right now.  All weapons have baseline physical damage, which means if they roll multiple affixes/suffixes that buff physical damage they will fundamentally be more powerful than casting builds.  Casters only benefit from %fire damage or % burn damage affixes not generic fire damage [ex. 5-10 fire dmg, 5-10 burn damage] as spells do not count as ""attacks"" and therefore don't utilize, for the most part, the weapon's base weapon damage when modifying a skill [ex. a spell will deal 70 vitality damage; an attack might deal 125% weapon damage + a flat 25 physical damage].  Right now all of the most powerful builds rely on physical/piercing damage for these exact reasons.  Similarly, spells cannot lifesteal.  Couple that with the way stat points are functioning right now [another feature I love, couldn't believe they eliminated it in Diablo 3] and it leaves casting classes at a huge disadvantage.  That said, the devs have acknowledged the problem exists, made their position felt, and are working with the community to come to a reasonable solution.My hands are literally getting tired of typing, so I think I will begin to wrap this up.  Grim Dawn is phenomenal, i've already sunk well over 150 hours into it and the full game isn't even released.  The storyline is better done than most other ARPGs [not known for their strong story-telling - this type; i'm not talking about the Baldur's Gates of the world...semantics people], with a lot of pieces of parchment that have bits and pieces of additional story/atmosphere-building littered throughout the world. If the game is to last long-term in the world of insatiable gaming desire, I think it will need to consider developing some type of end-game [they've sort of given a preview of how they plan to develop things with Steps of Torment 4-5]. Right now most of my lasting enjoyment has come from farming bosses for unique items, carving through the hardest dungeons, and experimenting with different builds [mostly the latter].  I don't think it needs to create an endgame as bonafide as Path of Exile's [which has really set the standard for what an ARPG can accomplish], but I do hope to see more Rogue-like dungeons implemented.That's all for now, pick this game up.

Early Access Review
								This review is for GD's ALPHA. Nevertheless, the game is in a perfectly playable state and is very fun too.Grim Dawn is an unusual spiritual successor to Titan Quest, to whom a few of the people working on it had a hand in making. Stylistically, the games are quite different- between the vibrant fantasy Greece of TQ and GD's own grim take on Victorian fashions and weaponry. Mechanically though, it's the perfect successor to TQ, taking the good aspects of TQ's 2-mastery system and deepening it with a greater variety of skills available per mastery. Item drops are far improved over where TQ was, with a far better rate of blue itemsThe amount of actual content the game has to offer can't rival that of many other ARPG's, past or present, but Grim Dawn's lengthy amount of time spent refining what is there isn't an accident- it's a lean game with a focus on replayability through quality and a small amount of variation in your journey through some minor randomization. It's a small thing, but entrances to underground areas changing to be located somewhere else drastically changes the pace of going through zones you already accomplished with another character before.And, as a final selling point for Grim Dawn, as with other popular ARPG's these days, support for the game won't end upon final release. It's a bit far from now, but future expansion including new areas and masteries, just as meticulously crafted as those in the original, are something to look forward to- and with GD's current record, unlikely to suddenly go awol as the developer decides to work on other projects.

												Grim Dawn is great!  130 hours in, and I still haven't seen everything, done everything, played everything yet!  I have a shaman/solider @ lvl 37, a warlock/arcanist @ lvl 44 and a solider/nightblade @ level 43.  All my hours have been in Veteren difficulty, which is really difficult.  This is a nice change from playing games like Diablo 3, Torchlight 2 and Van Helsing series, where the difficulties seem unbalanced to me.I highly recommend this game, especially if you are a fan of the Diablo series, Torchlight or Van Helsing games.The combat is smooth, the skills are great, the devotion mechanic is fun and the difficulty is a nice challenge!So far the only con I can think of is the massive maps.  Not enough riftgates (home base portals) in the world.  As a father and husband, I have limited time to play, and so consently having to re-clear areas to reach the next riftgate that is at the other end of the map can be very fustrating and repeditive each time I log in.As for multiplayer, I can't say.  I'm a solo player by nature, so I have yet to try out this side of the game.  Supposely sometime in the future, Crate said they would be adding a Survival mode to this game, which I think would be a fun feature.Also, as a bonus, you definatly get alot of game for your buck!  Huge maps, alot of monster models, cool spell effects, side quests and dungeons, hell it even has side maps to its side maps!			"

If you were about D2s immersion and overall atmosphere you do yourself a huge diservice by not paying 20 bucks for this masterpiece. Right now it is 16 bucks buy this help these guys out I promise you. This game is not even complete you would never know it. Huge world intersting characters.I have around 20 years exp with this genre and I'm a huge CRATE fan. I love Diablo 3 but its all about show and cookie cutter lots of multiplayer love. It has vastly improved 10 fold...But this feels more like the spiritual child of D2. It is a whole lot like TQ as well. Man o man if i didnt get one thing for Xmas but this id walk away very happy.Just some detailed info I had to dig around for....character models look nice not quite as good as D3 but you're armor changes appearance you can be a male or female. UI is very nice and minimalist. Act 3 is getting close to completion.You can check GDs web site they have 3 packages for purchase. 20 bucks gets you a hell of alot. Im excited for the future and potential this game has give it a shot you wont regret it. Yes its far better then PoE sorry guys. It just flows better looks better skill tree isnt this over inflated wheel of hp and mp increases (lol). BEST feature yet...IT works offline....OMGodders!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

UPDATED REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Over a year later Grim Dawn is content complete. I will say once again If you want the best ARPG ever made purchase Grim Dawn .Better than Diablo 3 Yes it is. Keep in mind it is a bit different than Diablo 3. Better than Path of exile  !00 times better....I don't even know why POE is considered 2nd best its not even close to Grim Dawn. POE is generic plain and simple and it is a typical F2p game but I won't taint this awesome game with talks of junk. You will probally be pressed to find enough time to give this Gem its due.The world is meticulously crafted everything placed has a reason...There are intersting quest there are factions for rewards and in depth crafting system a huge seamless map. The loot is awesome and the new cap is lvl 85. Theres also Devotion system and a whole lot of ways to customize your class. Graphically the game is gorgeous there is a huge amount of polish already and even though GD is content complete they still have a build 30 coming to add more balance and fix bugs which in the 70 hours ive never seen. So final release of game drops in February. THE game is on sale for 15 bucks...is it worth it LOL. Its worth full price and then some I would of payed 100 bucks for it if thats what they asked...It is that good and CRATE entertainment is purely awesome.Combat is Visceral and every hit is spot on. Where Diablo 3 is very good with combat Grim Dawn is not as flashy with skills but make no mistake the combat and effect suit this game style perfectly.Its kind of nice seeing your enemies rather then them being lost in a hail of multishot and meteors HAHAHA. Dont think take debit card remove from wallet or purse buy this game it is one of the best games ever made period			"

								This game is based on the classic Titan Quest, so I expected the game to be very similar.In a way, it is, you have the same leveling system where you have to invest points in classes before picking up skills, you can loot small enhancements to fuse before binding it to items etc.The story is nice, and you end up involved, no ""you are the chosen one"", you're a bit lucky and try to surviveGood monster theme, consistent with the world and location.But this game has always small surprises for you, with the name and the act 1, I expected the whole game to be dark and sad, there's a lot of environements, side quests, choices, smart mechanisms like the life regen when you're out of the fight.This game ended up being a really nice surprise, Crate devs seem to cherish their baby, it will come out of Early Access soon, there's almost no bugs, the story is complete, no empty promises ""it's a beta, we'll fix it later"", because everything is up and running.so to make it short:- Consistent hand crafted world, with day/night cycle and dynamic weather to make it alive- Good number of avaliable builds, the possibility to reclaim skill points (you won't be locked out of your ""perfect character"" by accident)- Interesting story with developpement of side characters- Fun gameplay mechanics to make it simple, yet don't insult the player with an obvious quest marker			"

I'm still playing Diablo III every now and again, jumping in to do a few rifts but it gets old quite quick.So anyway, this game had a rather slow start for me but once I got in to it a bit I'm just in love with it. Still haven't played MP at all since I only have one friend that owns the game but the Single Player so far is amazing.

Man o man if i didnt get one thing for Xmas but this id walk away very happy.Just some detailed info I had to dig around for....character models look nice not quite as good as D3 but you're armor changes appearance you can be a male or female. UI is very nice and minimalist. Act 3 is getting close to completion.You can check GDs web site they have 3 packages for purchase. 20 bucks gets you a hell of alot. Im excited for the future and potential this game has give it a shot you wont regret it. Yes its far better then PoE sorry guys. It just flows better looks better skill tree isnt this over inflated wheel of hp and mp increases (lol). BEST feature yet...IT works offline....OMGodders!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Graphics 9Sound     10loot         9skills        8quests     9addiction level 10Overall quality  10 (game is not even finished)Great job guys keep up the hard work !!!!!UPDATED REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UPDATED REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Over a year later Grim Dawn is content complete. I will say once again If you want the best ARPG ever made purchase Grim Dawn .Better than Diablo 3 Yes it is. Keep in mind it is a bit different than Diablo 3. Better than Path of exile  !00 times better....I don't even know why POE is considered 2nd best its not even close to Grim Dawn. POE is generic plain and simple and it is a typical F2p game but I won't taint this awesome game with talks of junk. You will probally be pressed to find enough time to give this Gem its due.The world is meticulously crafted everything placed has a reason...There are intersting quest there are factions for rewards and in depth crafting system a huge seamless map. The loot is awesome and the new cap is lvl 85. Theres also Devotion system and a whole lot of ways to customize your class. Graphically the game is gorgeous there is a huge amount of polish already and even though GD is content complete they still have a build 30 coming to add more balance and fix bugs which in the 70 hours ive never seen. So final release of game drops in February. THE game is on sale for 15 bucks...is it worth it LOL. Its worth full price and then some I would of payed 100 bucks for it if thats what they asked...It is that good and CRATE entertainment is purely awesome.Combat is Visceral and every hit is spot on. Where Diablo 3 is very good with combat Grim Dawn is not as flashy with skills but make no mistake the combat and effect suit this game style perfectly.Its kind of nice seeing your enemies rather then them being lost in a hail of multishot and meteors HAHAHA. Dont think take debit card remove from wallet or purse buy this game it is one of the best games ever made period			"

Early Access Review
								First I will start off with a disclaimer. I am a huge fan of the isometric dungeon crawler genre, but I know it is not everyone's cup of tea. Also this is my first review ever.With that being said this game in my opinion is hands down the best ARPG released since D2 LOD. If you are a fan of titan quest you will feel at home with how the core game feels as the same engine is used. The story is dark and gritty with an alternate world that has recently expierenced an apocalpyse of sorts. Needless to say there are plently of monsters that need slaying. Pros:+Excelent skill trees with meaningful passives. ( I miss passives that actually change your build, and I am happy to see the return to form, very similar to D2)+Items are meaningful, uniques and legendaries feel just that unique and legendary. This is one of the most important factors in the genre, and I feel comfortable in saying this game has the best item attributes around.The items in the game can dramatically change your build. Like D2 One of the great features of this is granted skills from items (another feature missing in many of todays arpgs) +Plenty to do after and during the story. While many arpgs simply have you killing monsters in the hopes of getting loot, this game adds a couple of new layers to the loot grind. The first is a reputation system, that allows you to buy specialty items and recipees. Which brings up another neat feature which is crafting. Crafting in this game is actually very useful and can help create unique builds, especially through relics (items that you can equip in a relic slot granting specific bonuses and a new skill). There is also a roguelike dungeon in the game that if beaten grants a reward of treasure chests galore. There is plenty more I have not mentioned like the Nemisis system, and devotion shrines. +Both offline and onlineCons:-Graphically speaking it does not push the boundaries, but that is to be expected in the genre. -Combat while not bad, is typical of arpg's. Nothing boundary pushing here. Basically the combat is near identical to titan quest which is no surprise. Still the combat is on par with any other arpg out, and the build possiblites pretty much gurantee a style for you. I only put this in the cons because some people may not be a fan of the basic combat style of arpgs.-Some people may be turned off by the large number of passives in the skill trees (I myself love passives)- There is no serverside online. Meaning the characters are saved to your computer allowing others online to modify/cheat their character. (This can be mitigated by playing with friends, but it would be nice to have anti cheating measures)Overall:This game is a must for arpg fans especially those that enjoyed titan quest and d2 lod. While the combat may not be as smooth as d3 or the trade community as active as PoE, I beleive that it more than makes up for it in the sheer number of awesome items (once again one of the most important parts of an arpg) and the many builds you can make. With devotion shrines to be found or reputation to be gained, there is plenty to do, and you will not have to worry about only grinding the same area over and over. If you are a fan of the genre this game is for you, if not then you will most likely not enjoy the game. This is a game that caters very much to people like me, that is to say the developers bring back the feel from the late 90's early 2000's that I loved so much.  "

Enough variation in the skill trees for replayability, plus multi-class to change it up even more! My only ""complaint"" would be no random generated maps each playthrough..8/10 - would buy again!

								I've played this game a lot so far, up until the very latest updates, and I'm very, very happy with it:- The maps are a balanced size - not too big, like in path of exile- The story and main questline is engaging and driven- It looks and plays beautifully- The character system is classic and great (Titan Quest style)- No bugs, only rare crashesThe only downside is that even with a lot to do, it definitely doesn't quench my thirst for playing the game! I've played through it three times and can't wait for new updates to continue my adventure. I love this type of action RPG, and this might steal the throne from Titan Quest. Definitely worth your money and time, even at this stage.			"

								The release date has been pushed so far away from the original estimate that it is almost unbelievable, but the end result is turning up to be very nice indeed. This is one of those games that keeps getting care until it is actually a finished product unlike most games these days.This is also one of the very few games that have great atmospheric music. You don't always even realize it's there and it never manages to annoy you. And when you actually happen to pay attention to it you find it obvious that the music is an integral part of the atmosphere.The game has some Diablo 2 feel to it but at least for me it does not invoke quite the same kind of gaming madness as Diablo 2 did all those years ago. But then again I may have changed a bit myself over time too. Upgrading items is too loyal Titan Quest for my liking. It's not a bad system but IMO it does not compete well with D2 gems and runes. And for me every game in this genre competes with Diablo 2 with Lord of Destruction expansion installed. Also so far I haven't noticed that interesting itemization in Grim Dawn but IMO the items are more interesting than in Diablo 3 for example. Then again most more interesting items in D2 came to play at a reasonably high level.			"

YouTube™ Video: Grim Dawn Review: Lock's Picks 

			Views: 579		

			Locklear reviews Grim Dawn, an action RPG set in a post-apocalyptic world with a focus on character customization and its dark flavor. Diablo 2 fans rejoice!		

So, should you buy Grim Dawn? I recommend it for anyone who wants to scratch that ARPG itch. This game is all about the interesting characters you can make by experimenting with all the customization options you get. The dark atmosphere and gritty world is a callback diablo 2 fans will appreciate. The audio compliments the gameplay nicely. The game runs well for the most part and loads very quickly. If you’re looking for a grandiose endgame with online ladders and seasons and rift farming, stick with diablo 3. If you want meaningful character customization and you liked diablo 2, Grim Dawn is something you’ll want to look at.			"

Early Access Review
								Like a grimy cousin to Diablo 2. Smaller in scope, but nevertheless a worthy addition to any ARPG fan's library. It's not very pretty; if you're a graphics fanboy, there's a lot to nitpick about the scenery. A love of dark atmosphere is a must, as 90% of Dawn's look is centered around an amalgamation of Dark Ages/Post Apocalyptic themes. No sunshine or secret rainbow levels here! Also, what's not to love about taking a shotgun to a zombie's face in the middle of a rainstorm, and then tossing a molotov into a group of walkers immediately after?  You level at a reasonable pace, as well. Aye, it's a ""one more level and then I'll get off!"" sort of game.Also of note: no quest guidelines or help. When you're given a quest (find my necklace!) you have to actually READ the quest info and pick out clues as to where it might be (which are almost always obvious anyway...""Oh! She said in the second paragraph she left it in her house in TOWN so it must be there, right...? Only, which house is hers? Guess I gotta check them all!"") Nothing brain-boggling, but it's nice that it pays to READ stuff rather than look at your map to find a highlighted location (as in most games). Might be a turn off for the impatient, though. Still, there are always plenty of monsters to shoot/stab/immolate/bash. And for under $20, this game is a no brainer. Will definitely suck at a few hours out of your life.			"

												BEATEN!# Level 41 / MAX IS 85 I think- Pure Warrior (melee)#32 hoursVery fun action RPG. Lots of customization, fun solo, great gear, and a variety of enemies.Pros:- Right balance of loot to sell/use/save- Difficult enough on normal without being impossible (solo)- Varied enemies and environments- Open world that is blocked off in such a way that you can ""construct"" paths to previously off-limits areas with loot.- Lots of sub-systems to explore (crafting, etc)Cons:- Story (typical in an ARPG) is interesting enough, but you probably wont care.- The map. I wish there was a transparent overlay map.Neutral:- Class system is designed in such a way that is meant to combine two classes, giving you more varied skills. If you go just one class, then you will have more powerful skills, but not a lot of variety. (Not necessarily bad)- There are a lot of passive skills. This is fine, but it doesnt add to variety or give you any visual queue other than stuff being more effective.			"

												Surprisingly brilliant ARPG. It's probably been said already but it's the diablo 2 sequel that never was. Takes some of the best features of most ARPG's and incorporates them into itself. Notably, diablo and torchlight, Again, suprisingly the lore isnt just thrown together, it's actually an interesting world with well thought out lore. The skill/talent system puts diabloIII to shame. I like D3 but this is something that's been sorely lacking in D3 since it's launch.If i'm comparing it to D3 too much, it's because Blizzard could learn a lot by looking back. Honestly, for the pricetag, if you enjoy ARPG's you'll get hundreds of meaty hours out of this game.  9/10 "

								When I first started playing this game I did detect similarities with this and Titan Quest. That isn't a bad thing. I love the Titan Quest series, and I don't honestly know what happened to the team who created Titan Quest, or who specifically is a part of the creation of Grim Dawn, but those who are working on Grim Dawn are doing a fantastic job. A new environment, new classes, new skills, and a pretty cool gem system are all enjoyable. I think the best thing to note here, is that it's a hard game. It's not forgiving. I wouldn't suggest going hardcore at first. Mobs are constantly scaling to your level, but only within reason. The battles are very intense and I feel like this game in the 20 hours I played of it, is definitely a great co-op adventure. I didn't play this single player, but I loved playing with my friend in co-op and didn't experience any technical issues, just one random disconnect. I like this game a lot, I guess the only problem I have right now is I don't know when to expect completion, or how many chapters are to be in this game. In my 20 hours my friend and I completed a lot, we explored, we killed maneater, we found out that there is an actual order of which things should be taken, but we ended up killing like, the final boss, then the other bosses scaled to our level, and we fought them at random times or when we actually progressed through the story at those given times. There are a lot of options in this game, and really the only requirement is to want to explore and enjoy yourself. If you don't want to kill a boss, you really don't have to. I am sure there is a requirement for some instances to get into a next chapter (which we are limited to just the 1 right now) then maybe a huge final boss encounter must occur, but really it was a lot of fun to be able to not have to do anything, but still doing things.TL;DR1. Dungeon crawler.2. Quests are pretty optional, but also seem to finish naturally.3. Challenging, mobs scale to your level.4. Class/subclass specifications make multiple play throughs a must.5. Exploration with very few deadends.6. I like Blizzard games, I am not biased. I didn't like Diablo 3, I feel this game beats it. Hard.7. $25 "

								I'm playing on a computer with Intel HD 2500 Graphics on an i5-3400 (aka 3.4 GHz Intel Rating) CPU at a resolution of 1024x768, most settings on low, shadows off, post processing off. And guess what?  It runs more than adequately.  It runs almost as well as Titan Quest, so far.  Like Titan Quest it slows a tad when you near flames and a little bit more when you view through multiple levels of transparencies (such as looking thru tree limbs, walls, and other objects to see behind them), that's about it.  The atmosphere is great, sort of a mix of Diablo 1 and 2 meets Path of Exile.  All of the great features of the Titan Quest Series' features are there, such as innumerable stats so you always know what is going on under the hood, to good art direction, and the ability to choose 2 classes if you want a hybrid character.   All I can tell you is that if it runs on my rig, chances are it will run on your rig, laptop or not, provided you choose the right options.  The main purpose for this review is to get out the word that it does run ok on such a set-up.If you enjoyed Titan Quest and Immortal Throne, or you really long for a quality, good looking update to Diablo 1 and 2, with new lore to explore, but that same feeling of slightly claustrophobic dread, this looks like a winner.  So far, I enjoy the beginning more than Titan Quest/Immortal Throne.  The way the factions and various magic systems are divided, also seems to allow for better balancing while meshing perfectly with the new lore of this game, which is new to my experience.  It makes it enjoyable to explore and simply to experience the game.   There are numerous new features beyond TQ/IT as well.I'll play more to see if I run into any issues.  I turned the shadows off mainly to avoid slight polygon effects showing up under shadow calculation (after a while some shadows looked like flashing black triangles), and to pick up a couple frames a second.  Turning off post processing didn't hurt the look at all, but picked up a several frames a second also.    At the settings I described above, with Details at Medium, and the rest not just mentioned at low, it looks just like the quality of Titan Quest at high.That's a good sign.  It is 1-16-2016.  I got the game on sale for about $15.  This is SO FAR exactly what I wanted.  I'll update the review when I have put a good 40 + hours in.EDIT IN DETAILING BEST GRAPHIC OPTIONS:For playing Grim Dawn on the Intel HD 2500 I also recommend keeping:-- Anti-Aliasing Off (not needed at these resolutions and can slow fps down),-- Anisotropic Filtering Off (tends to cause slight lag at least on Titan Quest/Immortal Throne in certain situations, and on isometric games tends to just increase the detail clarity of textures very near to you unless you put it very high, and tends to act on lighting and shadows causing more lag, but try AF at 2x or 4x and see if it is ok for you).-- I'll try 1360x768, and some other resolutions next, but the reason I used 1024x768 is because I knew from previous experience that this gave the best responsiveness on TQ/IT with some good lighting and mild shadows, rest on high).  You may be able to do about as well at 1280x720 or 1360x768, worth trying.  For me my custom colors and set-up work only at 1024x768 and 1360x768, so those are the key options I try first, works on most games for Intel HD 2500 GPU (with very rare exceptions).-- Although Triple Buffering did smooth out the movement a touch entering in and out of transparencies, movement of the character became a bit unwieldy with lots of enemies and transparency effects while in buildings so ... my guess is that it overwhelmed the GPU at that point past the ability to smooth, as it tried to keep up with the 3 frames ahead stored in the buffer.  It never helped much with a slow GPU in TQ/IT either.  If you have a fast GPU, that may be another story.)EDIT IN #2 :-- I tried a bit 1360x786.  As with Titan Quest, it can be done, but it is a bit laggy on the Intel HD 2500, so for me it is not quite worth it.  The 1280x resolutions usually will run a bit bigger, but on my system they will not be full screen within a window, that is with black bars, which I prefer for a higher concentration of pixels per inch at a resolution.  Also my colors don't look as good as the custom settings don't really stick to it.  They are worth a try if you like and use often those resolutions.  On many games 1280x720 will run about the same as 1024x768, it might be close also in this game, but no guarantees.I continue to enjoy the game immensely for its atmosphere. One thing some of you may find interesting -- at the moment there are some furniture which do not highlight and are destructible.  Occasionally these are shelves or slightly different looking cabinets.  Although they do not highlight under the mouse cursor, on rare occasions they can provide look and rarely some very good loot.  It is not a bad idea to try destroying any furniture around you.  It will all refresh anyway on the next restart of the game, as the map seems to reset in that way, along with the usual restock of enemies when you restart/reload a game from the main menu.			"

												This game is really awesome, it took my expectations and went beyond. Even though it is my first introduction to these types of games, I never really felt too overwhelmed at any point. I'm currently 41 hours into it and still nowhere near beating it, am just exploring new locations and finding lots of great loot. The amount of content and exploration developed along with story makes this more than worth its price point. Wonderful job on creating this fun experience.Pros:-lots of content for a small price. -Massive locations to explore and loot. -Very quick loading screens that only last for 1 to 2 seconds max.Cons: -Sometimes the game will slow down with all of the effects on screen due to the game only using 1 cpu core.

Early Access Review
								Seeing as Grim Dawn goes to full release today, Feb. 25, 2016, I thought it prudent to write my review today. I have to say that Grim Dawn is the best ARPG I have played since that old classic Titan Quest Immortal Throne. It takes on the two class system that TQ had plus it adds another way to spec out your character with a Star Constellation map and as you find desecrated shrines and restore them you gain points you can use to fill out the various constellation adding further character customization.Grim Dawn to me is the ultimate single player ARPG that also has multiplayer co-op and PvP built in, in fact it reminds me of the good old days of that classic Diablo 2 which I had a TON of fun playing multiplayer back in the day. The developer has been very active in the Steam Forum for their game during Early Access and they have delivered 100% in all promises made to the contributors in the Kickstarter that began this project and through out Early Access. I consider Crate Entertainment to be one of my favorite developers in the game development business and I can't wait to see where Grim Dawn goes when they release the toolset so the modding community can begin to take this game in very interesting directions in the future.

								One of my favorite game of all time, best ARPG of the modern era hands down. The build choices and quality of the gear is fantastic. The monsters are great and the subject matter nice and dark.The action is smooth, nicely animated and the audio is very well done.I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes loot or ARPGs.I can honestly say I have no cons that come to mind. It's got MP, and SP offline.I give it a 10/10 until I find something to ♥♥♥♥♥ about, but not even the UI is troublesome (once I hotkeyed 2nd hotbar for toggles).Depraved Sanctuary run anybody??

												Frustratingly unforgiving, incredibly rewarding, GD plays like an ARPG and requires the patience of an MMORPG. There are very few 'invisible walls' when it comes to gameplay; it gives you far more rope than needed to hang yourself.It's a large undertaking to explore and become familar with all of the game's content. There is a high learning curve, with a complex combination of mechanics involving character abilities, NPC politics, crafting system, itemization and gear augmentation. This world ain't for the feignt of heart. Grim Dawn will kick your butt. Repeatedly.With over 100 hours into the game so far, the experience has been very similar to the launch of World of Warcraft. Be prepared to get lost in awe, and feel overwhelmed by the vast world to uncover.			"

								Building upon the foundations, legacy and genre-impacting standards set by Titan Quest, one might wonder how such polished gold could be taken, reworked into the shiniest action-rpg ever, and then polished still further. Well, the masters of such craft at Crate Entertainment have achieved just that - with Grim Dawn !Grim Dawn has surpassed all my expectations as a true, isometric, chaotic hack and slash arpg.  It has everything you would want to come across within such a game, from deep and diverse loot, richly detailed environments, blood and gore, immersive atmosphere and exceptional music and ambience, to all of the technical and user-friendly aspects that bring it all together into one cohesive masterpiece.Here's some key points that stand out for me:- Detail Overload -> Every inch of Grim Dawn displays a dedication to detail, be it dungeons with mossy overgrowth, or smaller touches such as the animation after 'eating' an unfinished meal.- Armour and Weapons -> This is always a key part of arpg's, but in this case Crate have gone above and beyond with sheer variety, uniqueness of each individual piece from humble magical to the Epic and Legendary items, and overall stat-rolls.  Then theres the granted skills many items offer, along with Monster Infrequent items... I could go on.- Locations and Environment ->You need to play it to grasp how awesome these are.  The swamps of Wightmire with the tangling, creepy trees, marshes with algae and swamp weed, rays of light shining from above, and slow drifting mist is amazing, I've never wanted to linger in any game's swamp until now! - Ultimate Combat -> Every hit is satifying (unless you fumble..), wade into the fray and dismember, slash and reck everything.  Witness bodies ragdoll into the air or over cliffs, shatter entire skeletal legions and watch their bones fly.  Absolutely satisfying, it just all feels as it should in a frantic melee, Crate have nailed this so damn well!If Titan Quest is the Honed Gladius, then Grim Dawn is the Elite GreatswordFinally, it's hard not to be slighly bias when my first introduction to this genre was Titan Quest, and of course Grim Dawn is being made by members who created that game.  However, be that as it may, since discovering TQ, I have delved into any and every other arpg I thought was half decent or worth checking out, and I can say with as much an un-bias conclusion as possible that Grim Dawn is undoubtedly one of, if not the best, traditional ARPG games out there. If you're an avid arpg gamer, then I'm confident you'll agree and keep coming back to Grim DawnThanks for reading, and hope this review helped! :)Prosoro			"

G R I M D A W NThe aRPG after Titan Quest aiming (successfully) to do better than Diablo.PreludeFebruary 2016, the release of the game. It was a long haul seeing 2009 as the start, yet everything has come through: The story has become the sky, the gameplay like a bird flying, the mechanics as if the Gods 're watching.The GameOkay, so I've had this game for a while already (2014 I think), played it until the final quest (early access), just to find it was missing the final chapter. This was remedied a few months earlier (2015), including the implementation of locked achievements. These got unlocked just prior to official release (2016). So, now that everything is here - we can start playing for realsies! Some people have wiped their progress to start afresh.So, what of the review now that we have read your prelude and game chronicle?Right, well. I could start listing the pro's and cons of this game. Actually review the game.But I think I'll just tell you this one story:Just yesterday I told some of me mates about Grim Dawn. There was one pouting with his lip, mentioning not doing any Early Access games, although he does like (a)RPGs; One was scatting about engines on and on saying Grim Dawn should 've gone with an Unreal engine; Several others grimaced they only play AAA titles.Let's just say I have enough blood in containers now to summon a small army of Chthonian horrors.VerdictBUY IT!*  If one enjoys action RPGs. or face risking the:Chthonian cultists, who want to use you for their blood rituals!Aetherials, coming in many forms, none of which are good for you.

												Before I give my review I figured I'd give everyone a back story of my experience with ARPG's. For a good portion of my youth (until around the age of 18) I was a console gamer, specifically Nintendo. So my exposure to the genre was very minimal. It wasn't until I ran across a copy of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance on the gamecube that I got my real taste, and once I didn't I couldn't get enough. My brother and I played the hell out of that game. We probably spent around 200hrs on it (which was pretty insane at the time). Moving on I graduated highschool and finally decided to venture into PC Gaming. One of the first games I played was WoW. I started around the end of Burning Crusade and grew tired of money grubbing Blizzard by Cataclysm.  Afterwards I spent some time playing Path of Exile. I eventually grew fed up with it due to how imbalanced the game felt, the numerous bugs (this was during early beta, so I'd hope the bugs have been fixed by now) and it's convoluted, passive (boring) skill tree. So after one frustrating night realizing that my build was not exploitive enough to work, I gave up on it. For a couple years here, I didn't play any Diablo-like games. Until on a whim I purchased Torchlight 2, and for a while I was entertained. I guess the only real reason I quit playing it was do it's cartoonish graphic style (I know shallow, right). But I blame WoW for that one.  Torchlight 2 is still a very fun game, I'm sure I'll eventually return to it someday, maybe dabble in some mods.  Around this time Diablo III came out and I was still too butthurt with Blizzard to give it a try. I didn't want to have anything to do with it's corrupt auction house or it's WoW like graphic style. I have since learned that it's in a pretty solid state now (the auction house has been removed and numerous gameplay changes have occured) but I don't trust Blizzard as far as I can throw them. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. But I digress. Grim Dawn is a fanastic game. The visual's and atmosphere of the game are very eerie. The amount of customization is incredible. The sheer number of builds is awe-inspiring.  The story is compelling enough to keep you going. The gameplay is top notch. There is controller support. And so on and so forth. This is the best ARPG I've ever played. If my experience with this genre is reminiscent of your own, do yourself a favor and buy this game. If you are looking for an excellent ARPG, buy this game. Seriously, I can't recommend it enough. Support these developers and buy this game already!			"

								I'm really impressed at how well done this game is for such a small team of clearly talented people creating this art piece.I am a HUGE fan onf this genre, and actually Titan Quest was a game I never got into as much as some of the other genres, I recently picked it up and enjoyed it, even given how dated it is at this point.This game took all the really great things that I liked about Titan Quest and just created a whole new world of enjoyment.I like how many choices there are, but I don't really feel overwhelmed. I feel excited to play and to level up and explore the game. I can't already wait to try all the classes and combinations. I really want to hop in some multiplayer with randoms or friends, and hope to relive some of my best memories in gaming while running bosses or finding sweet loot randomly!This game feels so grest, I am super happy I bought it and highly recommend it to anyone else who is a big fan of action rpg loot centric games.

								Was waiting for some of my friends to play this game, and see what they would think, and buy depending on their opinion. Then it was in the wintersale, bought it.. no regrets. Gameplay is awesome, questing actually is very different then other games, not too obvious (not the standard follow marker, kill 10 boars, talk to this person, done). You complete quests while exploring, wich is something i really had to get used to, but really enjoy. The build diversity is insane. at lvl 10 you get to pick a second class and the devotion system allows you to alter your skills and build even further. This game really is ''play how you want''. Lookig forward to trying out many more classes. Best ARPG i have played in years. I'm lvl 33 now and just cleared act 1, Barely done anything in act 2. Bottom line, if you like hack and slash, experimenting with an insane amount of skills and about 30 class combos, this game is the game for you.			"

												Grim Dawn is a strong action ARPG in the vein of Titan Quest. Overall the graphics and sound are solid, with strong charcter flexibility. In Grim Dawn you have the ability to speciailize in two of six different masteries with a multitude of skills to invest in across each mastery. There's also a fair amount of items, as you would expect and hunting for rare trinkets and crafting can often prove rewarding. Overall Grim Dawn ofers much stronger character building compenents than other more well-known titles in this genre (i.e. Diabl 3), with solid presentation and gameplay. I would definitely recommend fans of the action RPG genere check this title out, especially for the more than reasonable list price of $25.			"

								I'm a fan of Diablolike hack'n'slash games. Like, a huge fan. And from the creators of excellent Titan Quest, this game is damn awesome effort. It's a pre-release so far, but already so good. It's not fair to compare this to Diablo 3, there's a huge difference in budgets. Nevertheless, this game is nearly as fun to play, and the atmosphere is much better. Where D3 failed, this game succeeds. The Diablolike games are a group I find hard  to put in any order of preference. Still, I'd say this game is in a good place with D1, D2, D3, Titan Quest, Sacred(s), Nox, Throne of Darkness, Path of Exile and  a very few others. Certainly vastly better than the miserable attempts Torchlights were.			"

								Ok so I have played over 70 hours and I have several characters at the current level cap. This is an extremely good game, and there are plenty of reviews going into how it brings back feelings of great old ARPG titles and that is exactly correct. I will go a little different direction. I have about 600 hours in Diablo 3 and I would say that Grim Dawn has none of Diablo 3's failings. The game feels gritty, atmospheric, interesting story line, and so on. However, it is weak where D3 is strong: game responsiveness. In Grim Dawn you will often feel a slight barrier between what you want to make your character do (and the buttons you are pushing to make that happen) and what your character actually does. But remember, this is ALPHA, so I fully expect all of that to be smoothed out. This game is more than worth the money. Feels like STALKER mixed with Diablo 2. Great fun.			"

								Do you remember after Diablo 3 came out and you were really dissapointed in blizzard and it left you wanting? This game is everything that Diablo 3 wasn't and more, and it's made by the same people who made Titan Quest. It's in alpha and it already has loads of content and devs who are constantly updating the game, fixing bugs, and adding more content weekly. I just got done playing for several hours with 3 other friends in a party and it ran smoothly and we all had a blast. It brought back memories of staying up all night in high school with my friends lan'ing Diablo 2 and Titan Quest. This game is definitely going to be the new titan quest and more. You can play two different classes which leads to a lot of different combinations and playstyles, and the devs are adding in new classes off and on as well which is really nice. I'm currently playing a warder which is a shaman and a soldier/warrior. It's a blast; this game is a work of art and definitely deserves to be given a chance. There are a few minor bugs i've noticed but they are visual and aren't pertinent to gameplay and progression. If you're thinking about trying out Grim Dawn because you're trying to fill that empty hole that Diablo 3 left you with, do it. I doubt you'll be dissapointed.			"

Even as an Early Access game, this game shines brightly with hidden potential (think about how much time you spent playing similiar style games, and how much fun you had...) Definitely worth the price! get it while it's a steal, not that full release price would'nt be worth it either!Edit: This game is still an amazing go to game, a must buy for any fan of the genre			"

								Great hack and slash. Like Torchlight, the game plays like Diablo. However, unlike torchlight, the story is actually somewhat interesting and the western/Baroque setting is very unique and unlike any other canon I've seen. Another plus is the fact that even though this is technically an ""Early Access"" game like many others on steam, it has all the aspects of a full release. Especially now that multiplayer has been added, the game really only has to add the Arcanist class before its essencially all there. Mechanically, the game is well made. Not too HD but just enough clarity to help the game keep its gritty look. While it's technically designed and designated an Isometric, the camera can still be turned with "","" and ""."" allowing for a much less restricted feel like many other over the head games. The class system is also very intuitive allowing for any of the 5 classes to be combined with another class, allowing for a variety of different combinations. The classes are also very accomadating to different desires and styles. The Soldier is essencially basic tank n' slash. The occultist is for people who like edge and magic, the demolitionist for gun people, the nightblade for burst/stealth people, and the arcanist for people who like not edgey magic. Overall, I believe this game is worth about $40, not $25.			"

								Pretty solid take on the standard ARPG. Slower paced than Torchlight II, but with more satisfying action. Class trees seem to be shaping up nicely, and you can choose from two of them to build your character from. Gear options are interesting so far; remains to be seen whether the higher difficulties will funnel everyone into specific builds/gear layouts.Worth full price considering Torchlight II is cheaper, Path of Exile is free, and you may or may not already own Diablo III? Maybe not if you're looking purely for value. But if price isn't an issue, this is an excellent game and it looks like it's only going to get better.			"

The talent and combat system is very similar. The setting is something you will love or hate. It contains a lot of undead and a lot of insect creatures(atleast Act 1). Here and there you'll encounter some greenish goblin like creatures which are a good alternation from the undead hordes.The early access is really stable(atleast the SP) and there are just a few bugs you will encounter, besides that it feels and plays like a finished product. The price of this game is not too high and if you got the patience to wait for a sale, you just can't skip on this game.Go get it if you're an ARPG fan, you'll have fun.			"

They're perfect.Not writing a massive review, just buy the game, easily worth 3 times the price in my eyes!			"

												This game is great.Solid ARPG mechanics very cool dual class progression systemlots of little quality of life things like a built in loot filterI've been playing the veteran difficulty and it is usually easy enough if I'm paying attention, but there are significant spikes in difficulty at times, and I think that's how it should be.Crafting, bounties, and apparently the game is open to modding so that should be sweet when the community starts pumping out content.Oh...and custom servers like d2 or torchlight style.I'd like to see slightly larger status icons on the HUD or have them somewhere my eyes are more prone to be. I usually don't even know when i've been poisoned or something since the icons are small and at the bottom right of the screen.Not sure how the end-game will hold up but so far this is a very good alternative to diablo 3 for just $25If this style of game is your thing, then it is totally worth trying.

												Grim Dawn is a strong action ARPG in the vein of Titan Quest. Overall the graphics and sound are solid, with strong charcter flexibility. In Grim Dawn you have the ability to speciailize in two of six different masteries with a multitude of skills to invest in across each mastery. There's also a fair amount of items, as you would expect and hunting for rare trinkets and crafting can often prove rewarding. Overall Grim Dawn ofers much stronger character building compenents than other more well-known titles in this genre (i.e. Diabl 3), with solid presentation and gameplay. I would definitely recommend fans of the action RPG genere check this title out, especially for the more than reasonable list price of $25.			"

												What's there to say?  This is the Titan Quest successor people have been waiting for!  Even better, Grim Dawn has surpassed and improved on nearly every aspect that made Titan Quest great.  It's darker, combat vastly improved, and they've expanded on the already awesome dual mastery system with tons of great item skills and the brand new devotion skill system.If you enjoy ARPG's in the same vein as Diablo, Torchlight, or Titan Quest, Grim Dawn is a must.

												I have played through Titan Quest many times over the years and have never found a game quite as replayable and fun! It just has a great balance of looting, planning, quests and rewarding boss battles.  With the introduction of Grim Dawn, I can enjoy the same kind of gameplay and upgrade system with much improved graphics and an environment unique from Titan Quest.  Although still in its developmental stage, Grim Dawn in already quite vast and playable.  A must buy for fans of games like Titan Quest, Torchlight, and Diablo.			"

								This game is in the late stages of early access with most of the content being out and the 6th class (shaman) having been released.  I bought this game prior to build 27 being released and I've loved it ever since.  If you're an ARPG fan, forget D3, and other games that are super mainstream.  This game is a nice slide to the right and definitely keeps you entertained.  It's challenging and fun, multiplayer scales well and makes things more interesting, and they're still not done adding stuff.  Can't wait for the full release at the end of the year.  $25 well spent in mind.Also, I love the nightblade's ability to shadow strike (or what I like to call shadow stepping) enemies.  Popping enemies has never been more fun! :D			"

												The Grim Dawn has brought ruin and Darkness to the world of Cairn. It has become the wargrounds for the Aetherials and Chthnonians. But you, as the outsider, possessed by otherworldy powers, have to vanquish both of these armies and their leaders.Grim Dawn is possibly one of my favourite games right now. It gives you a very Diablo-esque feeling on the Titan Quest engine.Pros:- The story is quite entertaining.- Secret areas that are at first sight, pretty hard to notice.- There are hidden quests that will reward you handsomely.- Very unique classes with each their own set of combinations of Masteries.- Very entertaining to play with friends, the more the merrier.- Lots of friendly and enemy factions, with each their own rewards. (Extra spawns, Nemesis bosses, Augments)- Active community with lots of information regarding builds, mods, trading etc.Cons:- After reaching maximum level, there is not much to do.- Once you have enough Resistances, nothing poses a challenge anymore.

								I'm a fan of Diablolike hack'n'slash games. Like, a huge fan. And from the creators of excellent Titan Quest, this game is damn awesome effort. It's a pre-release so far, but already so good. It's not fair to compare this to Diablo 3, there's a huge difference in budgets. Nevertheless, this game is nearly as fun to play, and the atmosphere is much better. Where D3 failed, this game succeeds. The Diablolike games are a group I find hard  to put in any order of preference. Still, I'd say this game is in a good place with D1, D2, D3, Titan Quest, Sacred(s), Nox, Throne of Darkness, Path of Exile and  a very few others. Certainly vastly better than the miserable attempts Torchlights were.			"

								Ok so I have played over 70 hours and I have several characters at the current level cap. This is an extremely good game, and there are plenty of reviews going into how it brings back feelings of great old ARPG titles and that is exactly correct. I will go a little different direction. I have about 600 hours in Diablo 3 and I would say that Grim Dawn has none of Diablo 3's failings. The game feels gritty, atmospheric, interesting story line, and so on. However, it is weak where D3 is strong: game responsiveness. In Grim Dawn you will often feel a slight barrier between what you want to make your character do (and the buttons you are pushing to make that happen) and what your character actually does. But remember, this is ALPHA, so I fully expect all of that to be smoothed out. This game is more than worth the money. Feels like STALKER mixed with Diablo 2. Great fun.			"

								Do you remember after Diablo 3 came out and you were really dissapointed in blizzard and it left you wanting? This game is everything that Diablo 3 wasn't and more, and it's made by the same people who made Titan Quest. It's in alpha and it already has loads of content and devs who are constantly updating the game, fixing bugs, and adding more content weekly. I just got done playing for several hours with 3 other friends in a party and it ran smoothly and we all had a blast. It brought back memories of staying up all night in high school with my friends lan'ing Diablo 2 and Titan Quest. This game is definitely going to be the new titan quest and more. You can play two different classes which leads to a lot of different combinations and playstyles, and the devs are adding in new classes off and on as well which is really nice. I'm currently playing a warder which is a shaman and a soldier/warrior. It's a blast; this game is a work of art and definitely deserves to be given a chance. There are a few minor bugs i've noticed but they are visual and aren't pertinent to gameplay and progression. If you're thinking about trying out Grim Dawn because you're trying to fill that empty hole that Diablo 3 left you with, do it. I doubt you'll be dissapointed.			"

								Great hack and slash. Like Torchlight, the game plays like Diablo. However, unlike torchlight, the story is actually somewhat interesting and the western/Baroque setting is very unique and unlike any other canon I've seen. Another plus is the fact that even though this is technically an ""Early Access"" game like many others on steam, it has all the aspects of a full release. Especially now that multiplayer has been added, the game really only has to add the Arcanist class before its essencially all there. Mechanically, the game is well made. Not too HD but just enough clarity to help the game keep its gritty look. While it's technically designed and designated an Isometric, the camera can still be turned with "","" and ""."" allowing for a much less restricted feel like many other over the head games. The class system is also very intuitive allowing for any of the 5 classes to be combined with another class, allowing for a variety of different combinations. The classes are also very accomadating to different desires and styles. The Soldier is essencially basic tank n' slash. The occultist is for people who like edge and magic, the demolitionist for gun people, the nightblade for burst/stealth people, and the arcanist for people who like not edgey magic. Overall, I believe this game is worth about $40, not $25.			"

								Pretty solid take on the standard ARPG. Slower paced than Torchlight II, but with more satisfying action. Class trees seem to be shaping up nicely, and you can choose from two of them to build your character from. Gear options are interesting so far; remains to be seen whether the higher difficulties will funnel everyone into specific builds/gear layouts.Worth full price considering Torchlight II is cheaper, Path of Exile is free, and you may or may not already own Diablo III? Maybe not if you're looking purely for value. But if price isn't an issue, this is an excellent game and it looks like it's only going to get better.			"

								If you like ARPG...give this a game a go. With work still to be done Crate Entertainment has got a gem here, worth a close look. Along with the usual suspects...loot, quests, class development, and breaking items, comes some new twists and Ideas. The ability to multi-class a second class with your original, and an interesting combine system to upgrade your gear are just a couple of the nice additions.Work still needs to be done, but what is here is stable, fun, and nicely developed. You won't get that , ""well it looks nice but...."" feeling. Graphics are GRIM but detailed, nice spell effects, sound and music seem to fit perfectly, and the game is performing well. Comparisons with other established ARPG's will be in abundance, though with Grim Dawn you won't feel like your playing a cookie-cut game to feed the populace, for this game has an identity for sure and I see great things only.

								Excellent ARPG. Plenty of stuff to do, enemies to kill, loot to hoard. The dual-class system allows for an amazing amount of customization. There are 5 classes to choose from (Soldier, Demolitionist, Occultist, Nightblade, and Arcanist). Once you reach level 10 you can choose a second class to compliment your first, or just stick with one. Each class' skill tree has enough abilities that you can't even come close to maxing out everything. Your choice of skills actually matters and will affect how you play.Even just with the same two-class combination ( I have 3 different soldier + occultist = witchblade) there is quite a variety as to how one can choose to play: ranged w/ guns, ranged w/ 2-hand melee weapon (Really? Yep.), dual-wield melee, 1-hand and shield, 2-hand melee.The game can be non-linear - if you want, you can skip most of act 1 and go to act 2 earlier for a challenge. There are lots of hidden areas to find, some with challenging enemies, others with chests containing guaranteed epic loot.All this and more from an Early Access title. One of the best Early Access experiences I've had with any Steam game and it gets better with each new patch.Absolutely worth full price, $25 is half the cost of a certain other 'AAA' ARPG that didnt come close to what fans were hoping for (and it's a steal at the current 50% off sale price!!).  This game will not disappoint.			"

Early Access Review
								Written with 80+ hours played and Build 26 Hotfix 3 of the Early Access.The Game is at the moment on Early Access so it's NOT finished but it has lots of content even on normal difficulty.At first you WON'T choose a class, its until level 2 when you choose your first class, and when reached lvl 10 you will be able to choose a second one.The game counts actually with 5 playable classes so simply do the math: 25 possible and DOABLE combinations (Many ARPG/RPG games don't have all classes doable, so if you became a class for farming / AoE you'll be unable to do certain bosses)PD: The devs confirmed they're working on a sixth class before the game is done. I'll leave the lore untill the game is complete but if you're interested on it, simply google it. So, you're on Devil's Crossing, an old prison transformed into a Zombie Apocalypse-like Camp. Lvl 1 and nearly naked. Let's talk about game mechanics. You'll find things called ""Components"" you can complete these components with same components to complete them and unlock some benefits with their completion. You can also rotate the view to find secret areas (There's some secret areas and breakable objects)The game includes a system which replenishes your HP if you're well fed (Very useful to save some potions).There's also FACTIONS you can level to get good rewards, but you can also ""level"" the enemy factions to get more enemy spawns, more hero enemy spawns or even Nemesis bosses to spawn.There's some other mechanics and things you'll discover by yourself. If you liked Diablo, Diablo 2 or even Titan Quest (The game its from the same creators) you should buy it. What are you waiting for?			"

								I don't buy Early Access games, but this one surprised me. Looking for a Diablo like clone, I found this gem. Develops are constantly working and updating the game, and they actually listen to feedback. The game mechanics are fresh, and allow for far more open customization of play styles than Diablo 3 does. I loved my Demon Hunter in D3 but here I get to play with a ranged character with other classes mixed in, and I can revert and change at any time. The game is a fresh entry and one that needs support. I said it before, early access is always a risk, do your own research, dig for yourself, and invest as you feel you can or should, and never take everything at its word, even me. Take a look at Grim Dawn, you may enjoy this great surprise of a game.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought Grim Dawn after watching a Twitch stream. Having not heard of this game before I spent some time researching as I have been burned by early access games before. After reading and watching and rinsing and repeating I finally broke down and bought Grim Dawn. I have not been disappointed so far. The game is visually stunning and controls very well. It does not hold your hand and requires exploration and actual reading of the quests. The world is also an open one with load screens only when entering caves or dungeons. Transportation is alieviated by a nice portal system though, which makes getting around to those areas already discovered a breeze. The skill system seems very robust allowing for a mashup of two specs (unlocked at level 10) and making or breaking your build interesting and rewarding. It seems like the developers are quite active in rolling out updates. Like any early access game though, I am sure there are problems which I havn't encountered or noticed yet. So as I do recommend this game, remember do your own homework. Grim Dawn is a nice breath of fresh air in the stale ARPG realm. 3.8/5 Bitz			"

The games is yet ( 2 of 3 acts are out ) like a heavily improved version TQ setted in the industrial time. The loot system is unique and offers a great endgame grinding system that seems to be endless and i am having a lot of fun even though i reached the level cap with some of my characters. ----I see a bright future for this game. This is how Diablo 3 had to be as it was released. Grim Dawn is by far the best Indie game i ever played and i hope the developers keep this excellent quality throughout act 3.			"

								Been on Steam for many years, this is the first game that compelled me to give a review. Been a somewhat on-off fan of ARPG since Diablo, Diablo 2 was the perfect game for me as a teen, sunk many hours into it back then. Torchlight 2 was good... but it just felt too cartoony.  Bought D3 when it came out, huge disapppointment with the skill system and it was boring and bright, unlike D2 which was darker. Grim Dawn reminded me of D2, and brought with it the wonder of the dual class system to me (I never tried Titan Quest, somehow it slipped off my game radar)GD seems to be what I expect from a modern ARPG, it is moderately hard if your build is incorrect, and you can respec your characters' skill points to see if u can improve on your build. If you are a glutton for punishment, you can play hardcore veteran difficulty. All in all, i would recommend GD to all people who were disappointed by D3			"

								I love these types of games and was waiting for this to get to a stage that I was comfortable to purchase as we all can admit many alpha and early access games never seem to make it.I bought in at build 30 and have to say the game is awesome and myself and a couple of mates are really enjoying the multiplayer. Sometimes its the small things when playing with friends that make coop games a dream to play, things like updating everyones quests or collecting a quest and everyone gets are small but really increase the ease of playing.I highly reccomend this game but I must say I really wish something could be done with the LAN issues as I do not think there is any for sure solution to it, sometimes you all connect with no problems and other times only two people can connect, you change a few settings then you have three connected, then it breaks again. From what we worked out it literaly comes down to just trying to connect over and over. Who knows maybe this will be fixed in B31 which has just come out?Anyways still a great game and I am currently in Elite mode which I hope there will be more purple drops. I was lucky enough to get a purple chest just a few hours before completing Vetern Normal mode which I think is super rare.A part from the LAN issues this is a great purchase and is different enough that POE for me to be hooked (I hate leagues and limited events -POE), love exploring and grinding with mates.

								Bought this game in early access state, but it's already good shaped. The game is from the creators of Titan Quest, which you can see quite early with the skill trees and second mastery which combines to one class name. The five possible masteries you can choose from differ in playstyle and even after choosing one, you can play how you like it. For example playing a melee demolitionist or a melee arcanist with soldier as second mastery. You're free to do what you like.I'm close to finish the first act and I can't wait to see the following acts, their setup and bosses. Nice game!			"

												Insta-classic. Everything you want in a good-ole action RPG. Loot that inspires character development, violence and epic battles that will leave your heart hammering and yammering for MOAR, immersive story and setting including choice-and-consequences and faction/reputation based questing and acheivements, farming and crafting, character customization options that, with the addition of Devotion, includes plenty of theory-crafting. All of this will easily keep any fan of the genre glued to the game for weeks, months and even years.  If that aint enough, the soon-to-be-released Grim Dawn Toolkit to make your own modifications and/or adventures virtually ensures that the furious, frenzied fun, endless tales and deeds, and legendary status of the Grim Dawn Saga will continue for a very, very long time. ~			"

								Grim Dawn is a really amazing ARPG (Action Roleplaying Game, a.k.a. Diablo-style game). AtmosphereThe world takes place in an apocalyptic world with old-timey shotguns, zombies, and magic. Lots of magic. The world is gritty and interesting, flowing with atmosphere that reeks of Dark Souls inspiration. This is a good smell to have.CombatThe combat is very fun. Each hit on an enemy feels heavy - like there's some weight to it. There's standard health/energy(mana) potions, yet I've never had to use them until I started fighting more hero enemies. The constitution (health regen) system works really well to keep downtime to a minimum. When your health goes down, after combat is done, you regenerate health from your smaller constitution bar, which then goes down. You refill constitution by finding food in the world, which is pretty frequent if you explore the map. It seems complicated, but it's not. Kill enemies, eat food.Class/Skill SystemThe skill/class system is refreshing. Basically, you invest points into your class to unlock new skill nodes, and skills can be leveled/extended with passive abilities, which alter or extend their capabilities. Once you hit level 10, you can invest points in a second class, which then results in a new class name altogether (Demolitionist + Occultist becomes Pyromancer).LootLoot drops (important in ARPGs) feel pretty damn good in this game. There's no magic find stat (which is counter-intuitive anyway), so they've balanced things in such a way that you feel like you get just enough awesome loot to keep wanting to look for more. Chests/bosses pretty much have a guarantee of something good dropping, and merchants occasionally carry green-rarity equipment (yellow -> green -> blue is the progression here). Each merchant's stock refreshes every time you teleport somewhere. Green equipment cost a lot of currency, so being able to refresh their inventories feels like a fair trade for having an easier time finding a rare item. Smart DesignThere's no waypoint scrolls (Thank you, Crate!). You can open a rift (portal) whenever you want, so the game feels very mobile. Yet, you'll usually want to explore every inch of every area, thanks to secret areas hidden behind breakable walls, quests you can find, hero minibosses, and so on. In ConclusionThe game is still in Early Access, yet the foundation is strong and there's plenty of content to sink hours upon hours into. I recommend getting it when you can, and enjoying the game as it continues to evolve. The future's looking bright.			"

If you are a glutton for punishment, you can play hardcore veteran difficulty. All in all, i would recommend GD to all people who were disappointed by D3			"

Early Access Review
								Bought this game in early access state, but it's already good shaped. The game is from the creators of Titan Quest, which you can see quite early with the skill trees and second mastery which combines to one class name. The five possible masteries you can choose from differ in playstyle and even after choosing one, you can play how you like it. For example playing a melee demolitionist or a melee arcanist with soldier as second mastery. You're free to do what you like.I'm close to finish the first act and I can't wait to see the following acts, their setup and bosses. Nice game!			"

												Is it better than Diablo 3? In some ways yes and some ways no.Diablo 3 gets much better updates for sure and seems to be winning out in the end.And then there is Path of Exile which may overtake them all when it's done.			"

Early Access Review
								I love these types of games and was waiting for this to get to a stage that I was comfortable to purchase as we all can admit many alpha and early access games never seem to make it.I bought in at build 30 and have to say the game is awesome and myself and a couple of mates are really enjoying the multiplayer. Sometimes its the small things when playing with friends that make coop games a dream to play, things like updating everyones quests or collecting a quest and everyone gets are small but really increase the ease of playing.I highly reccomend this game but I must say I really wish something could be done with the LAN issues as I do not think there is any for sure solution to it, sometimes you all connect with no problems and other times only two people can connect, you change a few settings then you have three connected, then it breaks again. From what we worked out it literaly comes down to just trying to connect over and over. Who knows maybe this will be fixed in B31 which has just come out?Anyways still a great game and I am currently in Elite mode which I hope there will be more purple drops. I was lucky enough to get a purple chest just a few hours before completing Vetern Normal mode which I think is super rare.A part from the LAN issues this is a great purchase and is different enough that POE for me to be hooked (I hate leagues and limited events -POE), love exploring and grinding with mates.

												This summer (2016) we will celebrate the 10 year anniversary of Titan Quest.  It's expansion, Immortal Throne (2007) shored up many of the game's weak points and cemented it's place near the top of the heap in the action-RPG genre.Say what you will about other games since, there are positives and negatives with all of them, but almost a decade after the original TQ launch we FINALLY have a worthy contender.Created by former members of the Titan Quest team, running on the (modified) Titan Quest engine, this game feels like what many WANTED from Diablo 3.  (To be fair, while D3 launched as a mess and has since been turned into a quite enjoyable experience, it is still very far from perfect.)So, let's take a look at Grim Dawn:Fun and enjoyable combat?  Check.Grim (had to) setting?  CheckOnline co-op?  CheckOffline Singleplayer?  CheckOfficially supported modding?  CheckController support?  CheckIntricate skill system with stat points to allocate?  Tons of shiny loot?  Well-crafted world?  Great art direction?  Impressive music and ambient sounds?  GREAT GAME??  CHECK!!! "

												A very good ARPG in general and excellent successor to Titan Quest.It partially fixes my main gripe with Titan Quest - no random maps. I'm absolutely loathe Greece after replaying it so many times and I usually become bored before I reach Egypt. While maps in Grim Dawn also not random they have random roadblocks so it doesn't feel as repetitive.While I didn't complete it yet, I have about 75 hours of playtime (I levelled few characters till various ""ends"" when game was in Early Access) and I'm still enjoying it.And don't forget what it got proper mod tools about month ago, so it probably will have lengthy post release life.

												If you like Diablo 2 LOD  madly  and if you  don`t like Diablo 3 so much that you haven`t even bought and the Path of Exile seems very difficult for you in this case  the Grim Dawn is a good  option.In addition to good graphics and amazing gameplay you can feel  the  growing developer skill in comparison to the previous games of this company.At high difficult levels  this game is sometimes very hardcore and doesn't forgive mistakes.In my opinion  Grim Dawn is not bad arpg hack&slash  from the new games with isometric .In spite of  Grim Dawn does not overshadow  Diablo 2,  it can compete with  Diablo 3. ^^			"

												Grim Dawn indulges me to a world where loot is endless, and so is the enemies. And the more hours I put in, the more I show-off my brand new lightning-induced ground attack. And that's the kind of feeling you get from Grim Dawn. It completely sucks you in, as you search for more loot, more enemies and more power all while trying to save someone, which might not pan out all the time.Grim Dawn creatively adds meaningful choices, a wrong move could very well mean the end of some innocent NPC's life. Other might bring forth temptation towards a powerful and/or valuable item.Grim Dawn contains a plethora of features: you can attach skills to other skills, to make a mean combo, you can actively traverse to locations that you have already discovered using 'Rifts', countless side-missions from NPC's and 'Bounty boards', and so on.Apart from the side missions, the game has an interesting story to acompany you with your adventure.The only misfortune you might encounter in Grim Dawn is the multiplayer component. It's a slith to set up, and if you manage to join someone's adventure, chances are that the reaction time will be real son of a slith. (Ok, I will stop now.)Overall, Grim Dawn is an incredible game, one that deserves your attention, whether you're a veteran demon slayer from Diablo series or a someone who has never touched an ARPG game before, this game will suck you in.

												I have to run, but want to make a quick review. Grim Dawn was constantly updated and now its complete.It can be played solo and online with up to 4 people. Simple to host and join the game, no need to portforward or be a wizard to get it to work, if you got a new rooter/pc etc.It even got LAN. (so it's a bonus for quality LAN or Tunngle/Hamachi people)Solid options menu.Dark atmosphere, addicting combat, impactfull feel of it, big world map filled with adventure, quests, bounties, secret areas and chests, high-end-game areas, enemy heroes and a couple of factions to join and reap rewards. Challenging dungeons that need a key crafted and close once you pass inside.Crafting and Recipe system.The Good1. Multi class. Combine two classes to get the maximum pleasure.2. Gear can have skills and even if not, you can insert gems that add skills. Wide build possibility.3. Find shrines on the map that grant you acess to Constelations - In short: augment yourself even more, you can add different constelation skills on top of the ones you have. It's glorious.4. MinMaxers dream/horror, Mastery skills and Atributes can't be respec'd, but the Skills learned can. Use grimcalc (search it up) - for an ease to plan your build beforehand.5. Factions with Bounty/Rep system , giving quests, faction specific augments for gear and gear itself. The more the enemy faction despises you, the heavier guys you will encounter.6. Some quests, do have some minor (and hilarious, in a dark way) consequences.7. Explore large locations, void, basements, dungeons and secrets to discover. Hand crafted, but the route can differ as roads/ways can be obstructed. Gives that bit of variety.8. Things like camera pan, display loot by rarity, body count (if your pc can handle it) etc. small things are there to tweek. ... and more, but I want to keep it short.The BadNo glitches found myself. Got a medium-high end PC and a fresh Rooter. No magic needed to play for me or find servers, players.The UglyThe highly detailed world, day and night cycle (light radius, feeling of ambush), weather, the desperation and death all around you.All the enemy factions. This abominations are realy asking for it. Tombs of our ancestors desecrated,Blood and guts, limbs fly, acid spills and chaotic/aetherial fire burns what's left of once proud human civilization.It is truly a Grim Dawn.			"

												Grim Dawn is set in the war torn world of Cairn and is easily one of the best arpgs I have seen in years having been developed by Crate Entertainment an indie company formed with some of the talented devs of Titan Quest. Crate was able to gain rights to the Titan Quest engine and began developing Grim Dawn which in my opinion is a worthy successor. While Grim Dawn does take inspiration from fan favorites such as the diablo series Torchlight series and Path of exile it introduces it's own unique ideas to these systems as well. Some of the things enjoy are.The Dual Class System: Having been developed by some of the people that worked on Titan Quest one of the core features that i really enjoyed about Titan Quest makes a welcome return here in the dual class system. Upon entering the game you can create a Male or Female classless hero at level 2 you will have the ability to pick one of 6 class trees.SolderDemolitionistshamanarchanistnightbladeoccultistyou can further flesh out your class at level 10 by combining a second of these trees. This combined with all the items that grant skills and augments to skills makes for some deep customization options which is one of the things i enjoy about rpgs in general. The devotion system: while it is apparent that this system takes inspiration from Path of exile's massive skill tree the devotion system in Grim Dawn is quite unique in that you have to go exploring throughout the would to find shrines which need to be cleansed. once cleansed you will gain devotion points which can be spent in a constellation map to augment your skills.Open world: Cairn  is a huge open world providing hours of fun content to delve into quests some with consequences /lore/Factions/Bounties/Dungeons there is allot to do in Grim Dawn and Crate have already confirmed they will be adding more content updates and full expansionsComponent system: The component system works similar to the gem socket system present in other games in the genre. The difference here is that instead of having  gems and socketable items Grim Dawn has different components that can be added to any tier of item. Some of these components can really improve your build by having skills tied to them. For example I have a character that has a lodestone socketed into my offhand this item grants a lightning nova skill and to take that even further I have tied the lightning nova skill from the lodestone to the scorpion sting ability in the devotion system which adds an aoe poison to the lightning nova.There are tons of components for every gear type and you can combine these components to make more powerful ones. While I do enjoy this system it is not without it's flaws the biggest one being that if i want to modify or remove an item from a piece of gear I can do that  by way of the Inventor's apprentice however you can only keep one or the other the component item or the piece of gear. This can make the decision to salvage quite difficult if both items provide significant additions to a build.  The Loot: Loot in Grim Dawn like other titles comes in different tier types Common/Magic/Rare/Epic and Legendary. What makes the loot different from other arpgs is the fact that like the component system some items can augment existing skills even after you have maxed them out on the skill tree or like the lodestone mentioned in the component section some loot can have specific skills tied to the item. This really makes for a unique customization experience.The Inventory system: While the inventory system is in many ways no different any other arpg out there there are a few things that are worth mentioning about the system in Grim Dawn such as quests that give bag upgrades for rewards a button that automatically combines components and my personal favorite and something that everyone has been asking for in several games of the genre. an AUTO SORT BUTTON!!! for those of us who hate playing inventory tetris. The stash system is also really well done as it has a character specific tab and an item transfer tab. The item transfer area can be upgraded to have more tabs within it as well so there really is no shortage of space.Questing and Lore: Quests in Grim Dawn come in many forms. Some quests unlock vendors and crafting abilities some have choices and consequences. For example maybe there are 2 warring factions in the game if you choose to help one you will become enemies with the other. These kinds of choices make for a rich questing experience. while exploring the world you will find tons of pages and notes on the areas that you are exploring I have always been a fan of finding lore in these types of games and there is no shortage of that here.Crafting: Crafting in Grim Dawn borrows some of the ideas from Diablo 3's artisan system they have blueprints that you can find through out the world to increase the list of items available to craft. You can craft components and potions to give you extra damage or resistance fore specific monster type as well but the thing that stands out to me is the ability to craft relics these relics like other loot in the game can ultimately change your play style for example you might have a character such as the demolitionist that uses pistols but can't dual wield them no problem you can craft the gunslingers talisman equip it and you have your ability to dual wield pistols.Factions: While exploring the world of Cairn you will encounter different factions and settlements that will have their own set of bounties and quests for you to do. These factions have quartermasters which are merchants that sell items specific to that faction depending on how high your friendly reputation is with them. As stated before in the quest section some factions are at war with each other so helping one faction may and in come cases will in definitely either damage or completely ruin your reputation with certain factions. If your reputation gets significantly low with a faction they will spawn more elites and nemesis monsters to hunt you down. This in my opinion makes for a very engaging exploration experience.Single/Multiplayer modes with server browser: Grim Dawn features the ability to play your characters in both single and multiplayer modes. the multi player is easy to use the host options are quite good due to the fact that you can host a game for up to 4 players and because the game features a server browser rather than an account based system the player hosting the game  can easily customize the number of players allowed in the server weather there is instanced loot and even put a password on servers so that only friends can join this is somthing i wish all games like this had.The Cons: While I really Enjoy Grim Dawn I do have one minor complaint. I wold love for there to be more voice acting especially since there is literally tons of lore notes in the game and being a person that has some visual difficulties reading a whole bunch of text does tend to put allot of strain on my eyes so having audio to listen to is a big help but I also understand that they are an indie team and are only able to work with that they have and this grype aside they have made a fantastic rpg.Final Verdict: If your looking for a new action rpg title to dig into Than Grim Dawn will not disappoint. It has something for new comers and old veterans of the genre alike. It is a great value and well worth the asking price and i highly recommend this so i am going to give Grim Dawn a 9 out of 10.

Early Access Review
								Starting off, I've only clocked in eight hours on this game. So there is still much exploration to be had for a full on reveiw. However, Grim Dawn has been one of the best hack and slash experiences to date. What is really enthralling about this game is how well done everything is done. While other games such as torchlight have aspects of a good arpg it doesn't push things as far as this game does.Gameplay: Is there anything new added to the genre? No, but the execution of all of it is well beyond than what blizzard did with diablo three.  The interface is simple and intuitive. The leveling system is unique as you have to invest skill points into the classes to get access to later bonus skills, and this lets you customize your stats in a way that diablo doesn't allow for. On top of that if you want to you can dual class the character which is totally boss. A unique feature to the game is regenerating heath based on food, which makes the game feel less of a potion masher type game.Graphics/Atmosphere: The mood of the game is perfect, it reminded me of the first time playing Legacy of Kain Blood omen on the ps one. It's just dark and gritty and actually feels like the world has come to an end, and you're just holding on by a pinky waiting for the final deathrattle to shake humans off the mortal coil. All of the equipment in the game is made from scrap parts left from before some catastophe. Which is awsome, the developers didn't force the story down your throat, I actually read the fluff that is put in the game. There are mentions of a grim dawn, but no real explanation of what happened, yet there are tiny clues and implied actions, the wrighting is fenominal and engrossing. Early verdict. This game doesn't push any boundries with quirks and gimmicks. What it it does is raise the bar on quality of the genre on every level. Buy this game if you like arpgs the makers of Grim Dawn deserve it for making a quality game.			"

								The idea of an open world dungeon crawler like this is a little bit intimidating. However, it's 100x easier in multiplayer to cover all of the ground that needs to be covered. I mean, even diablo's maps bottle-necked after an area. But I do find myself getting frequently exhausted between opening the map and going back to areas I missed. The mini-map doesn't exactly let you know if you've been there or not. Other than that, this game is actually fantastic. The whole concept is thrilling. It's as if Titan Quest and Diablo II had a cute little post zombie apocalypse baby. There are a few things that bug me, but they're seriously miniscule and don't even matter. 1. The map doesn't bottle-neck ( I know I already covered that. This is for the lists sake)2. Not a whole lot of variety in color. I realize that ""Post-Apocalypse"" ultimately makes you think of brown and grey. But not EVERYTHING has to be one of those two colors, you know? It makes every area look some-what the same. Dull and un-vibrant.3. None of the characters have voices, which is a shame because they would be fantastic with voices. A voice is what makes a character truly memorable. When I say ""Decard Cain"" you know exactly who I'm talking about. He probably has one of the most memorable voices in gaming. Other than perhaps Sheogorath from Oblivion. Anyway, think about getting some voice actors, and turn up the contrast on the new areas! Those are my two tips :3If you read this all the way down to the bottom. I love you.			"

												Really good 'sequal' to Titan Quest. Well though out, great loot in a different setting to your usual ARPG.**2nd full release edit at bottom of review****EDIT**I took a break from this game for about 9 months. There were only 4 classes when I left and the first 2 sections of the game. Upon my return I've found a more richly detailed game with greater depth thanks to the new faction mechanics, expanded crafting and larger game area.OVERVIEWI haven't actually got to where I left with my new Shaman yet but that doesn't matter. I guess that if your reading this you've played Titan Quest, DIablo 1,2 & 3, Torchlight etc. and are wondering how Grim Dawn stacks up against these?The answer is extremely well (imho). Don't be expecting an easy toe to toe, ledgendary heavy loot-fest like Diablo. GD's bosses can be really hard and even with the best built chars you'll often have to run away and return to kill them. Spamming health potions won't help you. I think people have lost their way with this genre (both players and developers) but in my mind GD will but it back on the right track.QUESTINGIt's the standard fayre of getting missions, completing them and handing them in for rewards. However, there's no flashing beacons on the map, no arrows pointing you in the right direction and no, your Mum doesn't spawn to hold your hand. You'll have to pay close attention to the directions of the NPCs. This is a little difficult when you first play as you have no idea where you're going but that is NOT a bad point as it only encourages exploration.Exploration is really worthwhile as you often find a well secreted dungeon or ruin with some good mobs and stash of loot where you were least expecting it. There's also some areas that you'll need to revisit once you have the proper tools to gain access too.LOOTThe main reason we play ARPG games right? Quest rewards are like a Siberian soup; thin and under nourishing. Again, this forces you to explore and sweep the map clean like a Biblical hoovering of fire and brimstone. That said, I find the quest rewards serve the main purpose of gaining faction favour which in it's own right grants access to special rewards of its own.As mentioned above this isn't the item hoarding certain racial group loot trawl that goes on in D3. Crate have explicitly stated they want you to engage in traditional 'runs' as only the best loot will drop from bosses etc. This means that you have to re-play. There is no tailored drops so you might get set items for another class and it may take a long time to get all the pieces for you current character.This brings back the value of loot, which was wiped off the map by D3. Those ledgendary and set items are exactly that; items you invested the time to track down and collect. They mean something here. Remeber the feeling of getting one of those ridiculous runes in D2? The ones that had a one in a billion chance of dropping? Imagine that but not quite as bad.CONCLUSIONGD can be hard. The number of different damage types could put you off, but don't let it. Thrive on the challenge. Stop being spoonfed and when your ♥♥♥♥ gets handed to you, rise to your feet once more re-think your strategy and charge!This is what makes the game a lot of fun. Sure, dying a lot can be frustrating but you just need to think around the issue. There is a ton of replayability here in a well thought out setting with plenty of scope for expansion. THe core game systems can seem a bit complex at first but stick with it and it will click.If you have £18 (or whatever it is in your money) to spare this is definitely worth the coin. Well done Crate Entertainment.**Full Release Edit**Now this game is in full release I'd just like to further impress upon anyone reading this that Crate have done an amazing job on this game. Sure it took 5 + years to get to its current state but don't forget there are only about 8 full time employees at this company!! What they have achieved is f'king brilliant.In much the same way that Path Of Exile changed the genre with its generous free to play ethic, Grim Dawn is also re-railing the ARPG. The graphics have been tweaked to be more detailed in the final release and certain areas have been totally re-designed for the better. The game feels a lot better balanced now and more focused to me. With crafting and factions and the devotion system there is a ton of juicy skills and levelling to be done which will leave you wiping residue from your loot chin for months to come.Grim Dawn makes DIablo 3 look very very badly executed. Above al though the full release is a massively fun game and that is why you should support Crate and invest some of your life into this game. 9.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								According to Steam, I have 19.2 hours on record for this game and I have to say I'm loving every bit of it.  Crate has done a fantastic job with this game, crafting a truly unique and memorable RPG.So far, I feel that the main storyline and sidequests are quite engaging, there is plenty of variety of enemies and environments, and a vast array of weapons, equipment, and enhancements.  Character-building is very satisfying with many choices in the skill trees of the six masteries, including the ability to multi-class.  Character progression seems fair and balanced and, while I generally enjoy farming for XP and loot, I've found that there is plenty just by thoroughly exploring the map - I have not had to do any dedicated grinding to find decent items and gain enough experience to continue through the game.  There have been a few challenging battles while not being frustratingly difficult and there are always rewards to match the difficulty of an enemy.  Overall, I feel that Grim Dawn is a fantastic action RPG and well worth the $25 price tag.I have found a couple of minor negatives though.  Even after 19 hours, I still feel like the movement control is a bit strange, especially in that the character can be a little slow to respond to mouse clicks.  I also have a bit of an issue with money.  Common items are worth almost nothing and even magic items are worth very little meaning you can fill your inventory many times and still not have enough iron to buy anything.  Nearly all of the worthwhile items at vendors are vastly out of range in price and, when you do manage to buy something, the resale value is virtually nothing.  Finally, my biggest complaint about the game is the music.  I generally find the soundtrack to be quite bad - very often slow and somber, even downright depressing.  I would prefer for the music to convey a sense of adventure commernsurate with other aspects of the game.Music aside, the sound effects are really good.  Graphically, the game is absolutely beautiful.  I don't have a good enough graphics card for high settings yet it still looks fantastic.  The game runs well on my modest machine - I've not had any freezes, crashes, or other glitchy behavior.  Loading seems a bit slow but that's probably dependent on my computer, not an issue of the game itself.  Even though it's technically still in Early Access, the game seems fully polished and I have not noticed any evidence of it not being a complete, ready-for-retail game.Overall, this is an excellent game and is well worth the asking price.  I highly recommend Grim Dawn to any fan of action RPGs.			"

Early Access Review
								This is what an Arpg should be like. Played most of them incl Torchlight 2, Diablo 3, Sacred, Path of Exile and of course Titan quest. but this is probably the one i'm going to keep playing the most for years to come.at this point it's still early acces, but has tons of content. I'm 41 hours in on my first char and haven't even finished the content yet. It's got meaty combat, interesting skill trees and a very satisfying loot and crafting system. And it doesn't even have the legendaries and other systems in yet. It has a few bugs here and there and it really needs some optimization, but they already said they will work on that when the full release is near.I honestly feel bad for buying this game during a steamsale. Because its pricetag now is already very cheap for what you get. This small indie team deserves more.*small update after the latest patch which made the game content-complete as per 24/12/15*What can i say? They nailed it. For me this game is the perfect mix between Diablo 2 and Titan Quest. GD might start off a little slow, but if you really love arpg's you will make a click once the game opens up and shows you all it has to offer. It's really really good and i know i'll be playing this for years.*even smaller update""It's been officially launched now and they definately got the performance optimized a lot.Even on my semi-crappy GT 635M card it runs pretty well on medium settings.I still stand by my first comment that this is the arpg i have been waiting for. I'll be playing this for years. Most addictive stuff ever! No it doesn't have the nice animations and polish of Diablo 3, but every other system in the game is better than Diablo 3. And trust me, after 500 hours of Diablo 3, i know. I see some negative reviews expecting a Diablo 3 clone, please people, watch some playthroughs or reviews on youtube. This is more like an oldschool Arpg, Which doesn't mean it feels dated in any way. It doesn't... at all.			"

												Great game with mad potential. It takes a lot of inspiration from past ARPG games, especially Diablo 2 and expands upon it. The game has some overall clunkiness to it with a story I wish would more ambitious and get to the point quicker but I think this is a damn fine game.			"

								Some of the team from Titan Quest have done it again!  Spiritual successor,  to be sure. More fast paced, yep! Story, great! Only small gripe is I wish everyone was fully voiced. Other than that you can't ask for more in an ARPG. I'd gladly pay more for this one to get the expansion. Hell, if I could, I'd buy a backer set even now to upgrade to it before it comes out!

												Pros:+ Game rewards you for exploring and customising character instead of punishing+ Well done GUI, random generation, recipes, and tools for smooth leveling or looting+ Good variety of monsters and enemy tactics (No endless recolored enemies)+ Just the right amount of plot, atmosphere, and expositionCons:- Graphics may not always be appealing and some mild frame stutter- Heavy randomness mean that your character WILL die and WILL miss its attacksIf you want a solid action RPG that just flows without being too superficial, this is probably the best I've played in five years.  A bit deeper than Torchlight but much better gameplay than other RPGs with a large variety of build options, you should be able to enjoy multiple playthroughs.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm not the kind of person that usually write reviews but TQ (Titan Quest) has been my favorite hack and slash game after D2 (Diablo 2) so obviously when I heard about Grim Dawn, I was excited. I couldn't stand in place knowing that some TQ producers were creating their own hack and slash game that would look alike their old game along with some improvements. The world is breathtaking, the physics are amazingly good for an alpha/beta phase and the classes are well made with unique sets of skills that I have never seen before. After reading on the forum, I'm very excited to hear about the new classes that are coming up. For now there are 4 classes and they mix very well with each other (depending on your personnal preferences of gameplay). So far, I have played around 2 or 3 hours and I can say it was captivating. Basically, if you played TQ or D2 and liked it, odds are you won't be disapointed by this game. If you didn't like TQ, well this game isn't a copy of it as they fixed everything that was wrong with TQ. For once, I think I wouldn't mind spending money on a cash shop or on donation because I want this project to be successful.			"

Titan Quest is also a really good game, but is older in real life and in game. I reccomend Grim Dawn to anyone who likes Hack n Slash games. It's also good to support indie game devs. Love it.

								Starting off, I've only clocked in eight hours on this game. So there is still much exploration to be had for a full on reveiw. However, Grim Dawn has been one of the best hack and slash experiences to date. What is really enthralling about this game is how well done everything is done. While other games such as torchlight have aspects of a good arpg it doesn't push things as far as this game does.Gameplay: Is there anything new added to the genre? No, but the execution of all of it is well beyond than what blizzard did with diablo three.  The interface is simple and intuitive. The leveling system is unique as you have to invest skill points into the classes to get access to later bonus skills, and this lets you customize your stats in a way that diablo doesn't allow for. On top of that if you want to you can dual class the character which is totally boss. A unique feature to the game is regenerating heath based on food, which makes the game feel less of a potion masher type game.Graphics/Atmosphere: The mood of the game is perfect, it reminded me of the first time playing Legacy of Kain Blood omen on the ps one. It's just dark and gritty and actually feels like the world has come to an end, and you're just holding on by a pinky waiting for the final deathrattle to shake humans off the mortal coil. All of the equipment in the game is made from scrap parts left from before some catastophe. Which is awsome, the developers didn't force the story down your throat, I actually read the fluff that is put in the game. There are mentions of a grim dawn, but no real explanation of what happened, yet there are tiny clues and implied actions, the wrighting is fenominal and engrossing. Early verdict. This game doesn't push any boundries with quirks and gimmicks. What it it does is raise the bar on quality of the genre on every level. Buy this game if you like arpgs the makers of Grim Dawn deserve it for making a quality game.			"

								The idea of an open world dungeon crawler like this is a little bit intimidating. However, it's 100x easier in multiplayer to cover all of the ground that needs to be covered. I mean, even diablo's maps bottle-necked after an area. But I do find myself getting frequently exhausted between opening the map and going back to areas I missed. The mini-map doesn't exactly let you know if you've been there or not. Other than that, this game is actually fantastic. The whole concept is thrilling. It's as if Titan Quest and Diablo II had a cute little post zombie apocalypse baby. There are a few things that bug me, but they're seriously miniscule and don't even matter. 1. The map doesn't bottle-neck ( I know I already covered that. This is for the lists sake)2. Not a whole lot of variety in color. I realize that ""Post-Apocalypse"" ultimately makes you think of brown and grey. But not EVERYTHING has to be one of those two colors, you know? It makes every area look some-what the same. Dull and un-vibrant.3. None of the characters have voices, which is a shame because they would be fantastic with voices. A voice is what makes a character truly memorable. When I say ""Decard Cain"" you know exactly who I'm talking about. He probably has one of the most memorable voices in gaming. Other than perhaps Sheogorath from Oblivion. Anyway, think about getting some voice actors, and turn up the contrast on the new areas! Those are my two tips :3If you read this all the way down to the bottom. I love you.			"

												Really good 'sequal' to Titan Quest. Well though out, great loot in a different setting to your usual ARPG.**2nd full release edit at bottom of review****EDIT**I took a break from this game for about 9 months. There were only 4 classes when I left and the first 2 sections of the game. Upon my return I've found a more richly detailed game with greater depth thanks to the new faction mechanics, expanded crafting and larger game area.OVERVIEWI haven't actually got to where I left with my new Shaman yet but that doesn't matter. I guess that if your reading this you've played Titan Quest, DIablo 1,2 & 3, Torchlight etc. and are wondering how Grim Dawn stacks up against these?The answer is extremely well (imho). Don't be expecting an easy toe to toe, ledgendary heavy loot-fest like Diablo. GD's bosses can be really hard and even with the best built chars you'll often have to run away and return to kill them. Spamming health potions won't help you. I think people have lost their way with this genre (both players and developers) but in my mind GD will but it back on the right track.QUESTINGIt's the standard fayre of getting missions, completing them and handing them in for rewards. However, there's no flashing beacons on the map, no arrows pointing you in the right direction and no, your Mum doesn't spawn to hold your hand. You'll have to pay close attention to the directions of the NPCs. This is a little difficult when you first play as you have no idea where you're going but that is NOT a bad point as it only encourages exploration.Exploration is really worthwhile as you often find a well secreted dungeon or ruin with some good mobs and stash of loot where you were least expecting it. There's also some areas that you'll need to revisit once you have the proper tools to gain access too.LOOTThe main reason we play ARPG games right? Quest rewards are like a Siberian soup; thin and under nourishing. Again, this forces you to explore and sweep the map clean like a Biblical hoovering of fire and brimstone. That said, I find the quest rewards serve the main purpose of gaining faction favour which in it's own right grants access to special rewards of its own.As mentioned above this isn't the item hoarding certain racial group loot trawl that goes on in D3. Crate have explicitly stated they want you to engage in traditional 'runs' as only the best loot will drop from bosses etc. This means that you have to re-play. There is no tailored drops so you might get set items for another class and it may take a long time to get all the pieces for you current character.This brings back the value of loot, which was wiped off the map by D3. Those ledgendary and set items are exactly that; items you invested the time to track down and collect. They mean something here. Remeber the feeling of getting one of those ridiculous runes in D2? The ones that had a one in a billion chance of dropping? Imagine that but not quite as bad.CONCLUSIONGD can be hard. The number of different damage types could put you off, but don't let it. Thrive on the challenge. Stop being spoonfed and when your ♥♥♥♥ gets handed to you, rise to your feet once more re-think your strategy and charge!This is what makes the game a lot of fun. Sure, dying a lot can be frustrating but you just need to think around the issue. There is a ton of replayability here in a well thought out setting with plenty of scope for expansion. THe core game systems can seem a bit complex at first but stick with it and it will click.If you have £18 (or whatever it is in your money) to spare this is definitely worth the coin. Well done Crate Entertainment.**Full Release Edit**Now this game is in full release I'd just like to further impress upon anyone reading this that Crate have done an amazing job on this game. Sure it took 5 + years to get to its current state but don't forget there are only about 8 full time employees at this company!! What they have achieved is f'king brilliant.In much the same way that Path Of Exile changed the genre with its generous free to play ethic, Grim Dawn is also re-railing the ARPG. The graphics have been tweaked to be more detailed in the final release and certain areas have been totally re-designed for the better. The game feels a lot better balanced now and more focused to me. With crafting and factions and the devotion system there is a ton of juicy skills and levelling to be done which will leave you wiping residue from your loot chin for months to come.Grim Dawn makes DIablo 3 look very very badly executed. Above al though the full release is a massively fun game and that is why you should support Crate and invest some of your life into this game. 9.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								Have you ever played Titan Quest, and thought that this game has potential, but it's a bit slow, the skill trees are a bit meh, there's little to do and the itemization system is not very deep? Then this game is for you. Grim Dawn is based on the Titan Quest engine, but they reworked it immensly. It's faster, it's darker and there's pretty much a solution for every concern I've listed above. The only problem is that it's still in alpha, so it's not finished. Currently, the maximum lvl is 40, and you might think that 'so I ran trough the 2 and a half acts then what?' and it's a good question. The answer is, there's a lot to do already. Grim Dawn implements a lot of little things that makes an ARPG good:-replayability by level scaling: if you've reached max lvl, and want to 'farm', you're not restricted to the last dungeon/boss of the game, you can run through the major areas in act1, because it's scaled up to your level, so it's won't get boring, because there's at least 10 areas currently that you can farm-blue items without fixed stats: self explanatory, you find a blue item, there's a range of stats it can get, so there's always room for improvement-green items with crazy stats: green items are basically the 'rares' of diablo2 but with a possibility to become much better than blues, so again, there's always room for improvement if you want to find a green item that's even better than a blue one-components: components are item enchantments, again, with varied stats for bonuses when you complete one. All I say is, you can even get a component with a completion bonus with +1 all skills-relics: relics are a bit hard to craft items which enhance a specific type of gameplay, difficult to craft them, but it's worth itAnd there's more to come:-weapon 'powders' from faction rewards, which enhance weapons even more, so reputation is important-faction rewards, again, reputation-Nemesis, or 'most hated' reputation tier which causes that more and stronger monsters will come at you or even specific bosses which are only available at this tierGrim Dawn has a multiplayer option, which currently are not central server based, but gives a rewarding experience and generally, it's more fun to play with others.If you are unfamilar with Titan Quest but you know Diablo 2, then I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to you, because it has everything that made Diablo 2 a classic, and it could be even more.The review wouldn't be complete if I didn't list some negative things too, so here they are:-it's being made by a small team, so you can't expect immediate content patches and huge updates, so you have to be patient-there are some quirky stats and effects in the game which needs explanation, but if you read the forums, you'll understand everything			"

The customization alone was enough to impressed me and with 6 unique characters made I still find myself thinking of new builds to create. Aside from that, the game is no pushover. Even after a couple runs through the game I find that if I'm not careful I'll die to the most obsurd things. I really have a lot fun playing and eager for new content to be released.

Early Access Review
								Grim Dawn is easily the most entertaining ARPG I've played since Titan's Quest, Crate has taken that engine and polished the solid mechanics of TQ until they shined and used them as the base for this story of a world in the throes of an apocalypse. Path of Exile came close to striking the right notes, but high end hardcore play was impossible for those without stellar internet connections due to constant desync issues that would lead to you being killed by invisible monsters. For the asking price PoE was a great game, but Grim Dawn feels like a title that will go a long way toward scratching that ARPG itch better than any ARPG did for me in recent memory.The game, at this point (early July 2014) only has two of its three chapters implemented and lacks multiplayer functionality at the moment. Multiplayer should be coming soon, and not long after the final chapter of an entertaining story will unfold. If you're a big fan of ARPGs but lately products like Torchlight 2 have lacked j'en sais quoi, Grim Dawn may be just what you're after.Also, you get to shoot monsters in the face with muskets, and who doesn't love that?

The game performs well on low end computers, and is quite beautiful in more detailed graphical settings. Plenty of lore to delve into, and loads of items to find, ways to build your character, and with difficulty settings that can be truly challenging.Definitely recommended.			"

												It is difficult to describe a good game in this genre, as usually Arpgs are defined for the ""feeling"" or the ""experience"" you get while playing. Most will say the graphics are good or bad according to their rigs, some will mention the music, some the ambience, some others will even mention the dialogues, and most will talk about the loot.I will say the whole experience feels organic; it is perhaps more dark than Path of Exile, but it doesn't feel with a weird pace. It is as smooth as Torchlight II, but far from the cartoonish feeling. It does not feel as large as Titan Quest, and yet I have not able to advance very deep into it. If you had a chance to play the undisputed best of this genre, Diablo II, and crave for a close experience, this is as close you can get, so far. If you have no clue of these games I am mentioning, or you are new to the genre, go ahead and buy it. It is solid overall.			"

												TL;DR: Liked Diablo2? Disappointed by sequels and clones that followed? Do yourself a long waited favour and buy Grim Dawn, it deserves every cent and second of your money and time you'll spend on it.First review on steam for me, I just felt compelled to do it this time, because the devs deserve all the praise they can get.Great support and interaction with the community through 6 long years of development have brought fort an amazing arpg that makes you wonder which is the AAA title and which the indie when compared to other °more well known° rivals.It's been in an extremely polished and enjoyable state since the very beginning of its early access, and you could see the ambition to make it the best game it could be when more and more people were added to the development team, along with more features, more content and more polish to both new and old areas as they released them.This game has all you could have ever wanted from a true sequel of diablo 2 and more.- Huge, I mean huge, and beautiful hand made world, where every single little thing has been maniacally placed to make it feel as real and atmosphearic as it can be. You will feel overwhelmed by the complexity of some passages, the different possible routes, the many secrets and facultative content to be found. And good luck finding some of them, because they are well hidden.All of that without completely giving up on randomization, taking advantage of a system that changes which routes are blocked and which are not with every playthrough, keeping the game fresh, letting you enjoy even more the level design, something I feel that can make or destroy a game, and in most other games nowadays, is extremely linear.- No more shallow items that give a couple flat bonuses only. The game is full of items that grant the user interesting abilities that you can even build your character around some, but the good news is that you start finding those way earlier than other games that make you wait for the °end game°. In grim dawn it feels like °end game° all the time.There's also a nice crafting system, allowing you to collect recipes for items, consumables, and augments for existing items (those can also grant skills!)- Extremely interesting character system that allows for a lot of customization between dual classing, stats, class skills, devotion system (think of it as an additional tier of talents with prerequisites that force you to plan ahead on how to unlock them, and the amazing thing is: you get the devotion points by cleansing shrines, and sometimes you can find those shrines in secret ares, which further encourage exploration and attention to details) and much more.- The quests and faction system is a nice change of pace from being forced to do things the same way all the time. Now you can make your choices in some of those, and experience the difference yourself (for istance, having or not a new vendor in town if you saved/spared him). Obviously don't expect to find hundreds of those, it's still an arpg/dungeon crawler, not a pure rpg.- The combat is fun and visceral. The impact of the skills and the controls are just right, and all of the things I listed above, including the complexity of the levels and characters gives it a very nice feel and pace. This is not a RACE to destroy everything in the shortest amount of time like Diablo 3. You can try, but you will never feel the NEED for it in order to progress, and it overall juist feel better.Along with the classic three difficulty level, there is also a °veteran° option to start the game a bit harder and unforgiving than the traditional normal.Also during the game you can find some Roguelike dungeons that can definitely put to the test your character and your abilities.The devs are committed to give it a long support, with a survival mode and expansion pack already announced, as well as being very fast at fixing bugs and applying balance passes.The only thing you might not like are some animations of the character, which look a little stiff, but seriously, it's a great huge game made by a team of about ten people, most of whom joined only when the project was already half done.This is a game that can give you hundreds and hundreds of hours of great fun, for the price of less than half of many AAA titles that sometimes offer about 10 hours of shallow gameplay.Still reading this? Just buy it already, you can always thank me later.			"

								        Game is pretty good now for not being finished.Only had the game crash on me twice and one of those times was the changing video setting ingame crash that is know and is being worked on.If you liked Titans Quest I would definatly recommend this game for sure just keep in mind that as of July 5th , 2014 the multiplayer isn't released yet so if you want to play online you will have to wait.This realy is the most complete early release game that I played (This is the first Early Acess game I played lol) .Here are some things you might want to know before diving into this.1.If you like voice acting npcs telling you the story this isn't in yet so you will have to read.2.If you like cutscenes there are none yet that I've come across.3.Game has a very dark atmosphere that some like myself will like.4.There are guns in this game but they work great with the world so far and balanced imo.5.Game is addictive and fun.6.Droprates are great imo making the game fun not like a chore.(Once coop is added they might change I realise this)			"

								This is a great hack n slash aRPG with both single and multiplayer functionality. THe game is still very far into its infancy but what s already in the game so far is amazing to see and experience. The skill tree system and dual classing adds some variety to building your character and personalizing it as you see fit. Components are another way to further personalize your gear for your needs which can add various stats to weapons armors and accessories. Currently the story is incomplete but give it a few more months and the rest of the main story should be complete. Legendary items also are not in the game yet but once the level caps are raised and these are introduced even more personalization will be available. Each class has its place and any combination of the classes is viable. You could even choose to fully spec into a single character rather than invest into 2 classes.  Another cool feature is hidden areas that do not show up on the map. It is always nice to find one of these especially if its one no one else has found yet. Steps of Torment is currently the hardest content in the game and is quite a challenge. It took me nearly 200 hrs to be able to complete it. As such as more content is added, level caps are raised, and harder difficulty modes are added there will be plenty of replayability in the game to last you quite a long time. As such this is a great game to invest your money in if you love aRPG's and want to get the most out of your money. It may not be a complete game but when it is complete you will not regret spending a single cent on this game.8/10			"

Early Access Review
								So before I even get started, at the time of this review, this game is in early access. THAT MEANS IT AIN'T DONE YET! So just bear that in mind. Now, that being said, this game actually has a bit of a pedigree behind it. This game is a dungeon-crawling, action based rpg much in the vein of Diablo, Path of Exile, etc. Now if you've seen any game footage of Grim Dawn already, you may be thinking ""Hmm, this gameplay and talent interface sure seems familiar"". Well there is in fact a reason for that. A few years back, there was an action rpg based very much in ancient mythology called ""Titan Quest"". Several of the original developers from TQ are now working on this game. Much like Titan Quest, this game has what I would describe as a ""Hybrid"" class system. Meaning your character starts as a blank slate, then after your first few levels you get to choose your class specialization. A few more levels down the line, however, you get to pick ANOTHER talent specialization, merging the two into a hybrid class (ex: If you start as an Occultist, and then merge it with Demolitionist, you will become a Pyromancer). The game also has a unique blend of dark age/black powder technology with a sort of Grim, Victorian aesthetic, which I personally really dig. Although the game still isn't technichally finished, I feel I can safely recommend it seeing as the developers behind it have some credible history in the genre, and the game still feels functional in its current state.

								Grim Dawn is effectively a grimmer, darker, dawn-ier version of Titan Quest by the same team. As action RPG's go, it feels slightly dated as a consequence; they're using the same engine, after all. It's still not finished, but it still adheres to the potion-munching style of its indirect predecessor, a type of hack'n'slash I don't really care for personally. It's pretty difficult. If that's your thing, either go for it if you can handle the unfinished story, or wait it out until the game's done. 3/5			"

								I've been playing since the early Alpha came out, and I absolutely love this game. It's grown up, matured, gotten more polished and balanced and added loads of glorious loot and side quests. It's got the addictive qualities of Titan Quest with its own unique setting and feel, the combat is super satisfying, and it slowly escalates in difficulty now quite perfectly. The story is fairly forgettable and generic, but that isn't why I would play it anyway.People who enjoyed Titan Quest or even Diablo-style ARPGs in general will find a lot to like here -- give it a try!

												Only have a little time invested in it so far but I can tell this is gonna be my new RPG. it plays like D2 and feels like a Buldar's Gate adventure. Huge maps, an insane amount of items, skills, and spells are going to be what brings people back. This is a wonderfully crafted ARPG and I couldnt recommend it more. Yes, it has a few things to work out still (the multiplayer is buggy and the server list doesnt even work, to the best of my knowledge.) but it's deffinately worth your time and money.Gotta play more / 10EDIT #1: lobby finder is up and running. +1EDIT #2: OK. so now I've put a few more hours in and its absolutly amazing. i feel like there could be more to it, but that's what EXPANSIONS are for. Between the constant little tweaks and  how active Crate is in the community, this game has a bright future on Steam, and hopefully your Games Library.9.9/10 still hoping for a Random Dungeon Generator / Boss Rush / Endless mode.

A lot of the same gameplay mechanics are in place and the small developer team are constantly adding new content and making adjustments based on feedback. If you like ARPGs and especially if you enjoyed TQIT I'd definitely recommend Grim Dawn. Not going to go into too much detail about it as I honeslty haven't had the time to spend with that I'd like over the last few months, just know that as with any early access titles there will be build that might break some aspect of the game and features are added and dropped as they work on polishing it. I paid $30 for this not long after release and for the discounted price I can't recommend it enough. Enjoy.			"

Early Access Review
								In the grim, dark, grim darkness of Grim Dawn, you will slaughter enemies in their hundreds and thousands with chainaxes and semi-automatic muskets until you get eaten by a boss monster. If that sounds negative, it isn't. The folks behind Grim Dawn also produced Titan Quest almost a decade ago- anybody who plays both of them will see obvious parallels, right down to individual powers and skills- and know exactly what they want to offer. This is a straightforward hack'n'slash: you see something moving that isn't you, you click on it and hit hotkeys (and occasionally run away until you can drink another health potion) until the critter dies in a spray of bloody gibs, then you rinse and repeat. The formula's as old as the original Diablo, but Grim Dawn provides enough character-building options that it feels fresh. Monsters are fairly straightforward- you've got slow melee, fast melee, shooters, shooters with some area effect, some immobilization, boss versions of each type, etc. They're mixed together enough to provide some interesting tactical challenges. What else? As mentioned above, the setting employs copious amounts of Grimdark(TM): 19th Century weaponry made out of junkyard materials, armour alternatively borrowed from The Road Warrior and a Victorian costume shop, abandoned and burnt-out buildings, spiky axes made for a steampunk serial killer, you get the idea. Goes well with the gameplay. Buy it and kill stuff, or don't buy it and don't kill stuff (unless you're playing another game that also entails killing stuff.)			"

								Absolutely amazing game to play with friends. I've been a huge fan of ARPGs since I was an 8 year old playing Diablo I/II, and this game is by far my favorite of the genre. If you, like many other people, thought Diablo II was superior to Diablo III in every way, this is the game for you. Grim dawn feels more like a spiritual successor to Diablo II, and this is due to the continuation of mature themes, dark environments, engaging co-op experience, unique character builds, fun pvp, non-linear difficulty scaling, and EPIC LOOT that made Diablo II great. By comparison, Diablo III feels like it was made for bed wetters by Disney. It also goes without saying that if you were a fan of Titan Quest, this will be your favorite ARPG ever made. Worth mentioning, there is another promising ARPG called ""Lost Ark,"" which looks like it could give Grim Dawn a run for its money, but it's being developed by Koreans and its Western release date is still TBA. I will endeavor to update my review upon the release of Lost Ark, and perhaps upon the release of Grim Dawn's future expansion.			"

								If you liked titan quest and also enjoy post apoc styled games this one is a must.  TL;DR Good buy for the price especially for dungeon crawl rpg lovers.Pros1: High amount of item slots on your character (even a rune stone slot and a badge slot!)2: Large skill point system, think titan quest for how skill progression is3: Music is nice, helps set a mood without being overly loud or blaring4: Combat is easy to get into, but at the same time bosses can be tough5: Decent graphics and able to play on high and medium end computers6:Not that expnsive or the content you're buying, and frequent updates and patching7:Skill retraining (for a in game currency fee) to help in case you need a mulligan on skills you've chosen.8:A lovely selection of attainable loot that you can equip into your items to give a boost, and unlike Titan Quest you can put them in epic tier loot!cons1:Dialog with npc's is unvoiced and easily forgetable2:Not much lore wise to help you understand the world, lands, factions, and history starting off.3:Combat may be easy to get into, but it can be a bit stale using the same few moves over and over (esp when focusing on leveling one ability and min/maxing others)4:The few times I have heard voices so far in game it has been very sub par.5:Not many ""secret"" areas to find, would be interesting to see this expanded.6:Patrolling the Mojave Desert almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter  (sorry had to say it xD )7:In game money can be a pain to amass, maybe either make items sell higher, or iron coins drop more.8:Not a very good selection of epic leveld loot or set items, hopefully much much more will be addedAll in all I find this a fun game, sometimes might get stale but a little break and I can get right back into it.  Fun for a dungeon crawl, nice monster variety, decent skill variety, plus you can redo your skill points (though not attribute points) if you have enough ingame currency.  Has a nice setting, the mood of the game is a nice balance between post apoc rough and tough rust, and colorful nature.  Lots of items with randomized traits.  Hopefuly while adding to thegame, the makers add much more item variety with epic level loot and crafting items.  But I enjoy this game so much as a dungeon crawler rpg (one of my fav styled games)  and hopefully for rpg lovers out there you will enjoy this game too!			"

								I'm a huge fan of RPG games, especially one's steaming from the Original Diablo that's how i got into games. If you start playing this game make sure you don't have any gaming addictions ;). This game really fills that emptiness that diablo 3 and all other action rpg tries to fill. the theme is grim, dark, atmospheric and keeps you searching for your epic loot none stop. If you are down for a jam msg me and ill start a new character with you, that's just how good this game is =)			"

Others have reviewed Grim Dawn better than I could but I still need to put in my two cents.This is Early Access done right!The amount of work Crate did balancing this game is amazing. Grim Dawn is probably the 1st game since patching became bigger than The Beatles to not have the gaming community up in arms about balence issues while still managing to have depth beyond the character sheet math.(This team deserves a lot of credit, I've had more fun shooting & torching zeds in Grim Dawn than any FPS to date!)- Updated after 60hrs -			"

								Grim Dawn stays true to the sacred mechanics of hack and slash, but adds weight and substance with an underlying theme of progress and survival within a dying world which set this appart from any of other hack-and-slash games I've played, and I enjoyed it more than even the classics available outside of Steam.The Hack and slash genre is one that has stuck to the same cornerstones of design since the days of Diablo, which arguably launched the genre. The fundamentals work well, and every couple of years a new title will come out and improve the concept a little. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing and The Bard's Tale added some character or a new atmosphere, FATE and Torchlight added in little new mechanics that bring more depth to the world, Path of Exile titles like DeathSpank and Borderlands thrived on ARPG elements, but kept their own style too. Then along comes Grim Dawn, which stays true to the holy mechanics of dungeon crawling; randomly generated loot, tons of enemies and enemy types, and a dark downbeat atmosphere, but adds enough to change the tried-and-tested ARPG elements and bolster them to a new level.HighlightsWhile doing those things well would have been enough, Grim Dawn has added to the fundamentals with a grim brooding atmosphere and overlying story where the last humans are trying to survive in a punishing and dying world, and it made me feel as though I, as a common nobody dragged to the hallows to die then set loose to make my way, was really having an impact on the environment and the people around me as I gathered resources and helped establish footholds and improve things for the better for myself and those around me. It's packed with tons of intrigue, lore, story and personality and they make the overall game as exciting and interesting as the gameplay itself.* Play time and content is huge. It's pretty difficult to run out of things to complete, and difficulty scales Mistakes* I've noticed input lag on a number of occasions, and there are plenty of reports of small performance issues* The graphics engine uses the same components as Titans Quest, which many people simply didn't like then and will not like now. It works well with the dark and desperate feel of the game, but for many this will be a sticking pointRecommendationsCurrently available for £18.99/22.99€/$24.99, Grim Dawn is fairly priced, especially considering its closest competitor, Diablo 3, weighs in at $39.99 and another $39.99 for the expansion. At the time of review, it's already been discounted to -50% a few times, which is plain and simple great value for money. Game time clocks in at around 40 hours+, with a ton of replay value, and being in Early Access, there's a planned Third Act releasing some time within a year which will add plenty more content. "

												This game is what I've been waiting years for.  This is the true successor to Diablo 2, from the creators of Titan Quest (which was THE game that everyone in the ARPG scene played after D2) that will bring the nostalgic feels right back like chills up your spine, and for new gamers will provide an excellent immersive and beautiful intro to the Action RPG genre.  This is hands down my game of 2016 - and deserves a community of likeminded fans to support it.  You WONT REGRET this purchase.  It is near perfection and I haven't seen it's equal in over a decade.

If you have widescreen 2560 x 1080 Win 10 and had a problem like I did where it would launch into a half black screen, run the repair file in the game folder.

Multi-class is cool...I got a shaman fighter.  Still trying out this game but really liking it so far.			"

Early Access Review
								I played Diablo 2 regularly back in the day, but some time later I found this Titan Quest game on the store shelf. I needed it, to the extent that I got a new video card and RAM for my old desktop just to run it. Ah, the 2000s were a fun time. I tried Diablo 2 and even 3 later on, but I had been spoiled. Creating a class instead of picking from a group, crafting items and Artifacts, Iron Lore has made a true RPG in a lovingly-crafted world. And finally, they got the chance to do it again.I had followed Grim Dawn before the Kickstarter, and I was very excited at what could be done. Admittedly, that anticipation can leave one disappointed, or blinded into mindlessly loving the product. I'm pleased with what Crate has done, evoking the spirit of Diablo while modernizing in the style of Titan Quest. Combat feels smooth and detailed, everything is already polished to big-budget quality. The visuals are inspiring, and the world feels believable in the characters and quest choices. The loot is varied with minimal junk. I need to get around and play it some more, but I figured the sale would be a good time to put up a review to help make a decision. I'd recommend the game if you are interested in a modern take on the genre that isn't focused on console support and failed auction houses.			"

								Grim Dawn is, in my opinion, the best ""Diablo style"" hack n slash ARPG since the Diablo series. There have been many imitators but few have risen to the top. If you are looking for that original Diablo 2 feel, then look no further. The graphics are gorgeous, even at medium settings. If your system can max it out then you will be in for a real treat! GD has been in early access for quite a while, but that has resulted in a high amount of depth and polish. In addition to the standard features of the genre, you also get factions, crafting and a recently implemented devotion system. If you liked Titan Quest or its expansion Immortal Throne, then you will immediately be at home with GD. As mentioned above, if you crave that old school Diablo experience but in a modern package, then I recommend you buy this game.			"

												As an avid fan of the ARPG genre, Grim Dawn gets a very glowing recommendation from me. What sets it apart from other games in the same genre is the amount of freedom and customization you have in regards to your character. The skill trees, like in Titan Quest, offer a lot of skills and ways to customize said skills. You put points into the tree and unlock different tiers of powers. Additionally, at level 10 you can pick a second skill tree which opens things up even more. If that wasn't enough, you find shrines throughout the game you can give offerings to in order to cleanse it. Once that's done, you can put a point into one of a TON of different constellations under what's called the ""devotion"" panel. They offer different bonuses to even further enhance your character. Other than that, it's an ARPG. There's not much more to be said. The thing is, Crate Entertainment got it absolutely right. It's a wonderfully fun, lengthy romp in a beautifully desecrated land. I love this game and hope others will feel the same way about it. An absolute blast!			"

								The Grim Dawn developers have created a superb ARPG game whose only flaw that is that it will devour huge chunks of your life, resulting in sleep deprivation and strained interpersonal relationships.The gameplay is rock solid and fluid, the environment is a beautifully detailed, nightmarish wonderland with enough goodies to satisfy the most voracious loot ♥♥♥♥♥.Even the names of weapons and armour etc. are bizarrely attractive ! Who wouldn'twant a 'Prismatic Enviscerator'  to mash their enemies to a bloody pulp and decorate the local flora with their entrails ? Why wouldn't you wear 'Boots of the Fleshy Hulk' to stomp around and casually kick in doors. No keys required for the hero of this saga ! As a grizzled gaming veteran, especially RPGs, I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a game so much ! I rarely write reviews but games of this quality and soul come around very rarely and the developers deserve our full support and encouragement. If, like me, you're wary of Early Access or on the fence, abandon all doubt and purchase.			"

												Holy cow, this is one of the most fun games I've played in 2016! I'm really glad this game didn't get stuck in ""Early Access Development Cycle Hell"" and I gave it a chance. (see bottom of review for quick verdict, which is a solid recommendation)So I'll start off and say this game is clearly inspired by Titan Quest. As someone who liked what TQ was going for but had an abysmal experience with the game (feel free to check out my review), I was a bit hesitant on investing into this game. However I did some research and read up on some of the new mechanics and character classes, and since it was featured on a humble bundle, I figured I'll throw down the money. Also, I may compare a few aspects of GD to TQ, so just a heads up. As I begin playing the first hour of the game, I notice how, again, a lot of models and such look like TQ. Needless to say, that's not a bad thing. The models looked great! I picked my first class, leveled up, and in less than two hours I was high enough of a level to select a secondary class. This is where the character development begins. There's 6 classes, and you pick two of them, leading into 15 different combinations. You can invest as many points into each class as you like; they don't hinder each other if you want to go with one core mastery, and I found investing into both my classes (I picked Soldier + Nightblade, so I was a Blademaster) that they complimented each other almost flawlessly.Speaking of dual classes, yeah there are less than in TQ, but the game moves a lot quicker as if to promote replayability. By the time I finished the game 100% on the first difficulty in GD, I was level 48 and it only took ~20 hours. When I finished TQ 100% first difficulty, I was barely level 40 and it took me almost 50 hours. Why so long? In H&S games, I like to explore everything. You can find some unique locations or some nice cameos and especially getting tons of nice loot. Grim Dawn felt nothing but rewarding by exploring everywhere. I wouldn't go more than 10 minutes without finding a cave to enter or a side location to explore chock full of loot.Another level of character development unique to GD is the Devotion system where by clensing shrines (which is another reward in the exploration factor), you can select stars from constellations to buff up your character and even give you more skills. At first it was a bit intimidating to take everything in, but that brushed away quickly and I spent a lot of time planning how I was going to develop my character. That in itself is rewarding to find.Towards the midpoint of the game I even found items that would grant me new skills. This is cool; it adds yet another layer of character development and it makes finding loot more rewarding. Some of the socketed gems you put into your items do the same, as well as relics you craft and equip. Most of these skills complimented my build very well, and the ones that didn't would still have some purpose, if at least on another character. The only issue that I personally had with this is I began to find quite a few duplicates of these items and it would feel a little less rewarding. Needless to say, it wasn't frequent.Pros:Several levels of character development (dual classes, devotion point system, finding skills on items, socketing items with gems to give you more stats and skills).Exploration is heavily rewarding, and it lessens the amount of boredom.Game moves at a fairly quick pace, but still oozes with content and things to do.Lots of replayability potential, including more to do on the higher difficulties (which I plan on playing)Every skill I've used is really useful and doesn't have an obscene cooldown, unlike TQ.Neutral:The setting's been done numerous times before if you look at hack & slash games of recent times. I personally didn't mind it too much, but some people might be disappointed.Finding epic and legendary items is plentiful and rewarding, but I do feel there aren't as many diverse ones since I found a few duplicates. Could just be my luck.Cons:Can't think of any.The impression I got after finishing the first difficulty was that I was hooked and already wanted to play the higher difficulties. Grim Dawn takes the good stuff from Titan Quest, expands on it, and adds its own elements for a fun, fresh experience. I don't think I've had this much fun trying to plan and develop my character since I played Torchlight, and I haven't felt bored at all. Easy recommendation.			"

												Grim Dawn, I never knew about this game until my brother persistently convinced me to try it. Reluctently I purchased the game and had little expectations when trying it out. My mind was blown away the first hour I played. Because of this, Grim Dawn has become my most played Steam game ever.Pros:- The story is well written and interesting to follow- Character Customization, the world is yours to be whatever you want to be- Item skills and Devotions (Not only do you get your typical 'class' skills, you can obtain even more from game items, relics, and devotions!- The game gives you that Diablo 2 feel- The developers are involved with the community, speak to the community through their forums and facebook page- Free content updates (who wouldn't love this)- Beautiful world- The game can be modded and the community have already released so many great ideasCons:- Character animations aren't the best, at times feel stiff- Not a lot of variety when it comes to story related bosses. There are plenty of Enemy Heroes to kill though- I enjoy the soundtrack, but some areas could use different music- Melee heavy builds, I've tried multiple 'specs', but I feel limited with magic caster decisions- There isn't exactly an 'endgame'. The game does support the idea of having more than one alternate character, but when you do hit max level and finish the game on Ultimate, you're pretty much done and should start a new character.This game has a bright future ahead of it, and the creators at Crate continue to deliver a promising series. My cons are personally opionated and I recommend trying this game for yourself, especially if you loved Diablo 2. I cannot wait to see more of what the community releases for game changes.			"

								From the makers of Titanquest, Grim Dawn is the real Hack 'n Slash deal to get asap ! Bigger and better than TQ, with tons of new stuff and great graphics / effects. This is what Craplo 3 had to be since the beginning ( the funny thing is that Craplo copied Titanquest storyline - released in the 2006 / 2007 - even the final boss fight / arena + dialogs )Multiclass, epic fights, awesome blood & gore, customizable camera ( you can even rotate it ), super loot, factions and more stuff that will be added while the game is being developed !I reccomend you to play this game when it will be fully released, because of the epicness ( also if you don't want to spoil storyline and zones to explore ) !Would ♥♥♥♥ on Craplo again. 10 / 10			"

Early Access Review
								While the game's content has yet to be fully fleshed out, the core gameplay is intact and visceral.  Grim Dawn comes into an ARPG market dominated mainly by Diablo 3 and Path of Exile, but offers an experience notable different from its competitors.For those that remember and love Titan Quest, the gameplay of Grim Dawn is both nostalgic and improved.  If you've never tried TQ (you should) GD offers a unique experience for an ARPG.  Character progression revolves around gear, which drops often, stats (simple but varied) and a set of talent trees based on classes.  You may choose two classes, and therefore gain access to two trees, each with varied but coherent abilities and passives to allow a diverse range of powerful characters.  If you enjoy trying out different builds just to see how they work, Grim Dawn can offer you a lot of replayability.GD has no private servers, and at this point doesn't even have multiplayer implemented.  The idea, though, is that Crate wants its players to mod the game as they please.  While this does allow for ""cheating,"" in a game with no ladder boards, no action house and no intent for an economy, it feels perfect.  Grim Dawn isn't about grinding out the best loot, being the first to kill X boss, or the fastest, or whatever. Grim Dawn is about killing monsters, exploration, character building and just all around fun.If that's what you're looking for, you should give Grim Dawn a try.			"

												VERY EARLY INTO EARLY ACCESS============================It's pretty amazing how this small 7 person studio is capable of creating such a great looking and fun game, and it's not even done yet!Even for an early access game, I find it pretty polished and haven't seen any bugs as of yet, with 12hrs in or so.  If you like games like Diablo, Torchlight, Path of Exiles, and so on you'll have no problems loving this game.I'm still playing my initial playthrough as a warrior type, and find the combat to be pretty sraight forward, the different mobs including unique named monsters and bosses, drop the varied color coded quality loot you find in all games of this type,  with some good itemization and stats overall, especially for set collections.  I can't wait to see the full game at release, because right now it's already a very nice and fun game.MID-POINT INTO EARLY ACCESS...March 17th, 2015 Update============================So, it's 1 year later and...The game development is progressing very nicely I find, and the content keeps coming with more class options, quests, mobs, and loot that progresses the storylines along.  I'm still amazed at how well this small studio is able to put out a game that easily rivals bigger competitors in the same genre.  This holds up great to the games I mentioned earlier and is well worth getting just for the first 3 acts to date!  It's got loads of stuff to kill and loot already and could easily have been released as is.  Then bring out DLCs, season pass, and Grim Dawn II for the rest of the upcoming content.  Thank God they're not going that route!  Keep it up!!PS. I DESPISE Steam's Early Access now.  3 out 4 E.A. titles I bought into are now dead, defunc, or eternal 'we're working on it, be patient' mode.This is the only title that came through so far for me, and it alone might vindicate the Early Access program for me.RELEASE VERSION UDPATE...December 20th, 2016========================What can I say about the release version?I can say that Crate has more than surpassed my expectations for an Early Access title (the only one personally).  At no time throughout the development did I feel like the progress was slow or problematic, since they really kept up with content updates.As each Act was released, we were guided through another chapter of the storyline with new areas, friendly/unfriendly NPCs, quests, and of course new 'monsters' for us to dispose of to secure humanity's future in this grim, dark, apocalyptic world that is Cairn.With a fair number of character development choices, like leveling basic stats, adding class skills for pure or dual-class builds, faction choices with conseqences, and endless tiered possible gear choices from loot drops, buying from general and faction merchants, player trading, or crafting your own thanks to bluepring recipe drops and purchases.To reach the current level cap of 85, you'll need to playthrough from normal(veteran option),  elite, and ultimate difficulties.  You can also level up in The Crucible, which is a DLC addition which compares to other survival Arenas.  Can obtain some very nice gear early on (I go in at Lvl.2) and  throught to max level.  Big plus is the ability to obtain Devotion points after completing your first 10 waves of combatants.  Turn in your earned Crucible money to buy a devotion point at level 8, which is the level you'll be after just doing 10 waves.A really exciting and challenging feature associated to your infamy rating with certain factions, is the unlocking of more heroes, more swarms of monsters, and ultimately the faction's Nemesis boss, who will hunt you down for having maxed your infamy with them.There are so many other details that I would love to share about the game, but it's probably better to leave it to you.  Buy this game if you loved Titan Quest (same dev) and love Diablo-like games.  You'll discover all the things I mentioned and more about the game, and why it's such a great game to surely become a Classic of the genre.Huge thanks Crate!			"

								Honestly, the best dungeon crawler / hack n slash I've played in a long, long time. Personally, I'd even place Grim Dawn above Diablo II and Torchlight II, though I would say that those three are the best in general. Extreme value, I've just started and am around 30 play hours already!			"

Early Access Review
								This review is for those enjoying the old school isometric hack and slash games such as Diablo 1, 2, Titan Quest as well as Dungeon Siege 2. In my opinion this game, called Grim Dawn, will be among those epic games should they keep up the way they're doing things right now.The reason I find this a gem comes from the confidence in Arthur Bruno as lead designer to lead his team in the right direction. It is clear he loved playing the Diablo 1 and 2 games and learned making these games at Iron Lore with TitanQuest. The way he talks about game design and the ideas he has only makes me hope that there will be enough resources available to make it all happen.The environments are really grim and atmospheric. In D3 there was a lot of gore and brutal depictions of corpses with their entrails hanging out, but due to the comic book color scheme it never really came across the way it should. And that is what Grim Dawn does really well. Fog moving across the marshes, ambient sounds in dark caverns, zombies clawing their way out of the dirt behind you for an ambush and cutting of escape routes. There is a lot of attention to detail as well to convey the correct feel of the world you move in.Some quests in Act 2 are relatively short and simple, but they still manage to invoke an emotional response. They fit in so well with the setting that it is believable for such situations to occur. After mentioning the D2 experience of act 1 where there is a lectern leading you to a ruined keep. At the bottom there is the vampire queen... One of the upcoming dungeons delivered that same feeling. This game really takes the best elements and adds its own interpretation of it.The mastery setup comes from Titan Quest. It isn't your typical skill tree and allows to combine skills from multiple classes to create your own play style. Of course some skills need to be adjusted or entirely replaced, but the basics are there. I'm glad the masteries aren't filled with passives like Torchlight 1 and 2 which greatly reduced the fun of playing due to lack of active involvement. I'm also happy that you need to unlock skills and be stuck with your decisions. Sure you can respec, but it isn't meant to re-build your entire character. A system like that from D3 is horrible and reduces the fun of replaying and building new builds.On top of that making decisions actually leads to set repercussions. You might not want to invite some NPC's you meet in the wild to move into Devil's Crossing. Something similar like Fallout might happen that you go back and the entire Vault and your family is dead due to that decision. Although its not that intense (yet) in Grim Dawn. There are other decisions with consequences like helping refugees or finding what happens to that little village. Or Direni that gives you the key to Depraved Sanctuary...or you kill him. Both with future consequences into Act 2. Which is quite refreshing to see these days. Especially since many games tend to cater to as large a group of people as possible. And they complain about wanting to make meaningful decisions, but not deal with consequences and being ""locked out"" of some content. Which means re-playability if you enjoy the rest of the game and want to try different decisions.The items in general are quite interesting as well. Green and Blue are not automatically better for your character then a Yellow item. Pieces have their own stats as well as possible additional skills like summoning a Hell Hound, Revenant or Harbinger and other things that can proc. You can adjust your items by adding components found on your journey. Components that can stack 3 or 4 times and give additional skills and bonus stats upon completion. That adds even more customizing to your gameplay, play style and character build. Soon we're going to get a crafting system which also has an element of gambling added into the mix. There you can use components found to create pieces of armor and tonics with specific effects according to crafting blueprints you can find.Enemies are quite diverse and challenging as well. Those skeleton Revenants, Deadbolt Archers and priests look amazing. Same for the zombies in act 1 which come in diverse forms with their own strengths and weaknesses. And what about human opponents using the same skills that you as a player have access to. Encountering them might even inspire some to try out a build incorporating the same skills as those opponents. The battles are balanced not around a single unit, but the entire group of opponents. Enemies move slightly faster then the player character which invokes a bit slower combat then most games in this genre. This may seem odd to most, but it actually creates more tactical and skill based battles. You can't just rush in and start whacking away all the time. If you're ""unlucky"" with the random monster spawns it might be the case of a small area being infested with 2 hero Reanimators, a corruption that summons zombies, and the rest of cold ones and mutants thrown in the mix. At those times tactical movement and picking your battles to clear the room is needed.Graphics wise people might complain it isn't cutting edge, but that isn't odd seeing the older engine from Ironlore that is being used. However that doesn't mean the game looks bad. Quite the opposite actually. In my opinion it looks perfect with quality models. Looks way better then D3 and also beats the bulky disfigured models of PoE. Animations are good as well and are only lacking in the rare places. Those places you don't really notice due to the fast pace of going from one battle to the next.There are so few bad things in this game that I don't even know which ones to mention. The only downsides people can note is the scale of UI, fact that the game can drop in FPS, occasional clipping here and there and the main title screen not having enough crips and detail. Can we really call these deal breakers during an alpha? A development stage where such elements are there for practical reasons, placeholders as you will. These will be dealt with once we get near the actual release and the game will be optimized and cleaned up. For now those elements are not high on the priority list which is understandable for an alpha.Crate listens to feed back. Heck they even re-build Act 2 due to the complaints from us playtesters. Even now they're working really hard to make it even better and better as we speak/type. With adjustments being made to previous areas while working on new content. Like many I've played a lot. 40-50hours with an illegal copy around Build 10-13. After that bought a copy at build 15 on Steam and am around 90hours. That is a total of 140 hours for just the alpha. Not many games can boast that amount.			"

								Grim Dawn is an awesome ARPG (action role-playing game) developed by some of the makers of Titan Quest. If you enjoy other games from the genre, such as Diablo II, Torchlight (2) or Path of Exile, it is definitely worth checking out.Update: At the time of my first review, the game sometimes crashed when attempting to use portals to and from town, and failed to render the ground every now and then. These issues have been fixed! Although still ""Early Access"" the game is very polished feeling/looking, and the Devs listen to the players!Much like Titan Quest, your character's class is not chosen at creation, but instead determined by picking one, or two, skill mastery trees (at level 2 and 10 respectively). This creates a large amount of diversity and customization when it comes to ability combinations and character buiding. No matter what path I have chosen thus far, it has made for an interesting and rewarding experience.TLDR: This game stands to be everything I wanted from Diablo III and failed to receive.			"

								Grim Dawn is a good old Hack 'n' Slash game. If you liked Titans Quest and/or Diablo 2 this game will be to your like.So far the game is fun and the item farming is just like in Diablo 2 and/or Titans Quest, not like in Diablo 3. So if you need a good Hack 'n' Slash game buy this or put it on your wishlist.EDIT: When the mulityplayer come it will be even better and the uniq items you can forge has made it even better.EDIT 2.0: The game has now gone to a new hight and are truly worth the price. You can really kill some hours in this game just faming for some better gear.			"

												Simply put this game has, imo, the best single player experience of any modern Diablo style ARPG available. Is it better than classics such as D2 or Titan Quest? The improved graphics are nice. Looks great on Ultrawide monitors. Probably looks great to the 16:9 peasantry too. I think the skill/devotion system it has is a definite upgrade. The faction system is relatively basic but adds another positive element to the game. Replayability wise it lacks a bit compared to D2 but is better than Titan Quest. Note: I never messed with mods in Titan Quest so they may change the comparison somewhat.From a value perspective it is well priced for what you get. I pretty easily put in 100 hours. Just now am I finding it tiresome to go do loot runs. If this game has a negative it is the multiplayer. If multiplayer is your thing I would suggest looking to Diablo 3 or Path of Exile. No dedicated servers or anti-cheat makes playing multiplayer with randoms pointless. That said, the multiplayer should work fine for playing with people you know.			"

												Known as a spiritual successor of Titan Quest, Grim Dawn takes you through a dark land where corruption spread, and evil walks free. Each act has a scenario that defines it - mountains, ruined city, farmlands -, each very detailed and full of monstersSomething I find curious is that the classes are strong and match well. Choose two you like and see how one complements the other. Not only that, but you have a devotion system where you can choose stars that fill gaps on your build or make you even stronger/tankierThe dev team is communicative, and modding has just been added to the gameFor some reason, optimization is a bit lacking. The game runs well, but when there are many effects going on, you can expect your fps to drop (which doesn't happen in Diablo 3 or Path of Exile, for example)If you have your eyes on it, you won't regret playing this game			"

												At first I thought that this game was another ripoff of Diablo, the style and even progression but to my surprise, it really wasn't. The game starts off a bit shaky to be honest, character progression is rather slow and even till you get your bearings around the maps and how the game actually works, takes some time. Although if you put the effort to actually play through it, it gets exceedingly gratifying. The class combos are awesome, the weapons are cool and the map, is well huge. There is plenty to do within the game and even when you're done exploring a new combo of a class, you feel the urge to create a new one. Personally the only drawback for me was the lack of quest marking. I get that you need to explore to find the quest (it shows up on the map once you get close to it), but it is rather tedious, especially in the first few hours of the game. Other than that though, the game is absolutely awesome!! I would recommend to anyone!			"

TL;DRTitan Quest set in a grim steampunk world. While it may be rough around the edges, I highly recommend it to every ARPG fan!+ Multiclassing (up to two)+ Build variety and replayability+ Sweet loot+ Myriad of side quests+ Factions+ Devotion skill tree+ Interesting setting and lore+ Ambience+ Soundtrack- No Rogue class equivalent- Rather cheap and spongy bosses- Minor stability and optimisation issuesREVIEWGrim Dawn is an ARPG developed by Crate Entertainment, a studio founded by Iron Lore veterans. It is built on the Titan Quest engine so if you have played TQ before, you will immediately notice some striking similarities between the two titles.A few words about the setting: the world is on the brink of apocalypse – demons roam the land, resources are scarce*, and humanity is divided as ever. To make matters worse, cultists (mad as the proverbial hatter) are fighting for power. The game begins with the protagonist being possesed by an aetherial spirit. The survivors hang him/her but the spirit leaves the body just in time and the survivors decide to set the hero free. Should one be more interested in digging deeper into the story, there are many well-written documents to be found on the journey.The gameplay revolves around eviscerating thousands of monsters, collecting loot, and completing quests. The usual. The tools of destruction include swords, axes, maces, rifles, pistols, and crossbows (similar to Torchlight). However, there are a few elements which make the game stand out from the crowd. First of all, after reaching level 10, the player gets to choose a second mastery. There are six masteries: Arcanist, Demolitionist, Nightblade, Occultist, Shaman, and Soldier. What is interesting is that they are well thought-out and every class is viable, even if they lack synergy at the first glance. Moreover, every mastery supports a variety of playstyles and can be effective with both ranged and melee weapons. Secondly, there is a devotion skill tree which provide yet another layer of customisation. In order to get devotion points, one has to restore the shrines scattered around the world. My only complaint about classes is that there is no Rogue equivalent. Overall, the class system is very fluid and one can spent a lot of time tweaking their very own build.Another unique element is the introduction of friendly and enemy factions. Gaining reputation with friends give the player access to faction-exclusive gear and bounties (side quests that can be farmed indefinitely) while becoming more hated by the enemies results in tougher spawns and, eventually, a possibility to fight a Nemesis monster (in other words, a BAMF). While most factions are inherently either friendly or enemy, the player will get to choose their allies.While the graphics may not be the game's strongest suit, the surroundings seem to be well done. Grim Dawn also features a glorious Diablo-esque soundtrack which enhances the ambience. The voice acting is mediocre at best but, to be fair, this is not a deal breaker in a game like this. Speaking of shortcomings, the game has some minor performance and stability issues. Gameplay-wise, I find the design of some boss enemies cheap and annoying, rather than challenging but fair. They are kind of like high school jocks – tough in groups (and they always stick together), not much of a threat otherwise. Nevertheless, any enemy can be defeated with a proper application of skill, a decent equipment, and build.In conclusion, Grim Dawn is a marvellous title that can provide dozens of hours of great entertainment. While it is rough around the edges, the game lives up to the hype in my opinion. I highly recommend it to anyone that is not allergic to the ARPG genre.*The currency in Grim Dawn are iron bits. That's how scarce the resources are!P.S.

												Grim Dawn is a very appropriate name for this game, especially if you are a fan of the Diablo franchise.  Diablo 1 may not have been the first ARPG, but it certainly put the genre of tearing monsters apart until they explode in a shower of blood and shinny items on the map.  The game that made birthday pinatas a bit lack luster from there onwards.  While Diablo 1 was the promising toddler, Diablo 2 was the 12 year old son who won the science competiton nation wide.  Everything seemed to be going well.Then diablo 3 launched and it was like walking in on your teenage son dying his hair black, cutting his wrist, wearing eye liner, and wearing bandages like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sonic the hedgehog game.  What the ♥♥♥♥ happened, I knew I souldnt have let your creepy black sheep uncle to take you to disney world.  Back to the point, Grim Dawn is both grim in the game setting and grim because playing it is a constant exercise in ""what if"" when thinking of Diablo 3.  Suffice to say if you found Diablo 3s bright art style of smeared water paintings with lighting effects as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as possible for lower end PCs to run it rather diapointing, as well as its borderline incoherant story and a disjointed world forgettable despite over 100 hours played than you will be in for a nice suprise.Visually Grim Dawn made me think this is diablo 2 but with better graphics.  The game plays on this and it does a very good job for the disenchanted ARPG player.  The marshes, caves, ruined settlements, and bleak landscape of Act 1 bring back fond memories of the Rogue Encampment.  It makes the whole art petition response look silly in retrospec, along with Reaper of Souls going back on it as well.While the story and universe is not a high point it is practically shakespeare compared to Diablo 3.  The documents you find are well paced and some are pretty disturbing and depressing.  On top of that there are moments in the game where your decisions can have ramifications although the steam page does exagerate a bit.  The game is made from a combination of the creators of TitanFall and I believe a few people who worked on the origional Diablo.  TitanFall was a baffling game as Im assuming the publisher didnt understand that 50% of what makes these games enjoyable is watching monsters turn into pools of blood.  Opting to go for the teen rating and showing a complete ignorance to the genre.  I do have a beef with these guys on the part that Titan Falls expansion seemed to never get fixed.....That said it would seem the ugly practice was left behind in the world of Greek Mythology and didnt carry over to Cairne.  For people like myself who found Blizzards odd skill system or lack there of a skill system bewildering (something that would carry over to World of Warcraft) you will be happy to know that Grim Dawn has more stats than the guy who sits with a spread sheet at a baseball game taking notes on everything for some bizaare reason.  Perhaps reliving his desire to be an assistant coach in the dugout.  You have stun resistence, stun duration reduction, lightning damage, electricicty damage, fire damage, burn damage, piercing damage, vitality damage, and you get the point.The wonderful Titan Quest duel class system returns allowing players to mix different classes that seem odd but turn out very interesting.  What is nice is that there does not seem to be 1 spec for each of the class combinations.  My main is a Warder which is a combination of the soldier and shaman.  I focus on 2 handed weapons and lightning damage but there are 2 other viable paths I have read about.  I imagine the same is true for other combos.  Certain gear and the fairly elaborate addon system can be a huge part of your build.  One item I added to my axe gave me a lightning nova ability which was great for clearing large groups.  Lousy on its own but with all my + lightning skills and gear stats very effective.  There is also a faction system.  Getting higher rep means you can buy items from said faction and the more hated you are by enemy factions the more rare bosses that spawn.  Speaking of loot you wont have to farm for hours only to get items that look like a troll put them in the game.  Unfortunately with a small team does come its problems.  The framerate is all over the place depending on where you are with the beginning act being the worse offender.  Many enemies simply explode into blood and there are not as many unique death animations as you would get with a larger team.  The enemy variety is also limited compared to other games.  All of this just makes you wish these guys had more resources at their disposal.  Nothing is really game breaking.In summary I have not enjoyed a game in this genre so much since diablo 2.  Torchlight never really did it for me and you all know my opinion of diablo 3 at this point.  If anything I say resonates with you then this game will be a nice gem to add to your steam library.

								Beautiful game with some pros and cons:Pros:  + tons of content          + 100's of hours of game-play          + Beautiful to look at          + Very easy to pick up and play          + takes time to master          + 7 classes + dual classing = 7 * 7 = 49 possible classes          + Lots of story Lore in game and at website          + Multiplayer 4 friends          + Offline single player modeCons: - Sometimes enemies meld to much into the background to be invisible          - Browns and greens on browns and greens (enemy and background) again makes some enemies hard to see          - Voice work is to low can barely hear it          - Sill in beta or alpha or unofficially released          - the devs don't work for Blizzard making Diablo 4          - this is not a Blizzard title (sorry yes Blizzard fan, but can acknowledge great games from other places)          - Not really anything to con con about (meaning in the first 13.3 hrs on record not one single bug ort problem)Since the game is still in Early Access I have an Idea for the Devs for long term end game solution. Create a tower that randomly generates itself every 7 days. Make the tower have good side going up / evil side going down. Make the it 100 floors up and 100 floors down. Gamers will choose which direction they will head each week per account, every 5th floor have a mini  boss and tenth floor a big boss. This way once we beat the campaign we can continue to do something new each week with our avatars. Just a suggestion. Great game, highly recommend, and can definitely say its worth the money.			"

												I have been following Grim Dawn since before the Kickstarter, which launched on the 17th of April 2012. The game has seen many changes since then. We got the features they said we would plus more. There is real depth in the character customization with plenty of build options for all different play styles. Combine two of the currently available six classes to craft the character you want to play. Combine skills to create many synergies between any of the six. The Devotion system which was not something originally planned adds a really cool aspect of customization. Finding shrines in the world and restoring them grants points to devote to constellations with a huge variety of features; not just passive bonuses. Huge variety of gear in the way you would expect. In the true fashion of an ARPG you will find lots of bad gear. You will, however, find some gear you never want to get rid of, even though you eventually will. Some Rare, some Epic, and most Legendary gear will grant you new abilities to use; components, which you insert into gear, will allow you to double down on something or even out your weaknesses and some will grant you new abilities. The world has expanded immensely from what was originally planned. With additional acts and factions there is plenty more to do in the world of Cairn. Zones expanded and dungeons were added and every time it was very exciting. As more people joined Crate we got more art assets and the world really came to life. I can't say it all here but Crate Entertainment has created a masterpiece. I think will endure the same way the previous great ARPGs have. From a cult following to a game with many fans Grim Dawn has come a long way. Get out there and save humanity!			"

												Known as a spiritual successor of Titan Quest, Grim Dawn takes you through a dark land where corruption spread, and evil walks free. Each act has a scenario that defines it - mountains, ruined city, farmlands -, each very detailed and full of monstersSomething I find curious is that the classes are strong and match well. Choose two you like and see how one complements the other. Not only that, but you have a devotion system where you can choose stars that fill gaps on your build or make you even stronger/tankierThe dev team is communicative, and modding has just been added to the gameFor some reason, optimization is a bit lacking. The game runs well, but when there are many effects going on, you can expect your fps to drop (which doesn't happen in Diablo 3 or Path of Exile, for example)If you have your eyes on it, you won't regret playing this game			"

												For an eairly access game this game has alot of content to keep you busy and I love that! It plays alot like the Diablo games but with better customization and if you ask me more intresting loot. The story is good and the atmosphere is dark and grim which give the feel how Diablo 1 and 2 would give before Diablo 3 went with the more colorfull art direction. It is tottaly worth the price they ask for but if you can catch it on sale I highly reccemond buying this game expecially if you like ARPG.[Update]I've been playing this game since it was in eairly access and im still playing it. I still find this game more satasifing to play than diabl3 which is still a good game but i find this game has more to offer and the replay is good with all of the different build you can creat and i love the diverse item that this game offers.

								Ok First Let me say that I am a huge Diablo III fan but the gear and item situation in the game lacks greatly. Once a new patch comes out the old gear is no longer viable. Along comes Grim Dawn and they have the item stats and drops right so far. I have been using a mixture of white and yellow and I got my first green a couple of days ago. As I progress thru the game the monsters scale and the items stay relavent. I have compared several items that have dropped and like the scale of the stats in the early access quite well. Gameplay is solid after you figure it out. Builds can be varied and provide ability groups for mixing and matching tooyour style of play, which I love, SOlid early access platform I would reccommend to anyone burned out on Diablo III competitive play. I have not ventured into multiplay yet, and have just completed the Warden quest which an WAS INSANE ending of a chapter. My only complaint is that I cant play it on my Surface III I7 as the mouse support is not there. Dev team please patch this QUICK so I am never far from the game!  I found the Fix in the Forums....This is an amazing game!			"

								Yes as you can see this game is D3 like game. Many of the most popular WOW/Diablo clone are just pale imitations compare to their  older brother, but this game is the exception the confirms the rule. Despite its ressemblance to D3, it bring new story, new environments and some features. At beginning this game may look confusing with new spell mechanics, new name, new gems crafting system that is quite different from Diablo. But if you read carefully and take  the chance to fight and learn your caracter , the mechanics become obvious. My only complain is the lack of content(its early access so its normal)All the rest of the game is smooth and graphicly enjoyable. I recommend this game, but if you want to play a full finished and polished game...give it some time as we are not even close to the final version, but the best is yet to come.I got this game  on sale for 13$ and it was well worth it..I strongly recommend for you to wait for this game to be on sale..well in its current state.

								After a (very) long early access and development nearing its end, let's get to the conclusion: this is an awesome hack'n'slash. Not the most beautiful (see Diablo 3 for that), but a good one anyway.The game itself is very close to what was Titan Quest. Pretty much the same design team behind those two. The game experience is solid, even though there are only eight full time buddies on the job. One would expect such a small team to fail bringing life to such a big project, but it ended up working out just fine for them.If you have to look for flaws in the game, let's begin by aknowledging that the game isn't visually stunning. The art direction just does the job, and that's it. No more, no less. You may also find that some elements of the ingame background will kill you faster than the final boss, which is both surprising and very disapointing, especially if you end up losing a 20h HC character on that.Other than that, expect a solid gameplay, interesting challenge and overall nice game.

Early Access Review
								I've watched this game grow over the last year and a bit and I have to say I'm really happy with it.  If you like Diablo, Titan Quest, Path of Exile type games, you will like Grim Dawn.  This is a quick pre-release review.ProsThe character versatility is one of the main things I like about the game.  Every class can be customised and changed to fit a person's playstyle.  You can undo skill points so you aren't stuck with choices you made when you had less experience.   Also gives you the opportunity to try out new skills without much risk.The maps vary in complexity, terrains and mobs change, quests affect terrain features like building bridges - keeps your eyes happy.Items, devotion and class skills give you a really good range of abilities to choose from and combinations to form.  Adds an element of strategy when choosing what will work best together.ConsMultiplayer issues...  Playing with friends can pose problems.  For example If one person is further ahead with quests than their friend(s) then whoever has the least progression has to be the host.  Ok, but what if you play together often but 1 person plays a little more and is always ahead with quests?  Or you play with more than 1 person but you are all at different progress spots?  Well then you have to go back and redo all of the quests with your friend over and over again.  It would be nice if whoever was the host enabled all of the same quests to whoever joined so anyone anytime could just hop on and play without missing anything.  Also there is eventually a faction based choice to make which opens up a new quest line - Cool!  Bad if you and any of your friends are a different faction because you cannot help complete the quests together AND there seems to be a strange bug that causes you to start damaging each other during the game after engaging faction mobs when grouped with an opposite faction party member.  This needs fixing!Devotion shrines in multiplayer - same as above.  Host already did the shrine?  Well bad luck, you can't do it unless you host or go solo.Replayability - if you want to try a new class combo out or wish you picked soldier as your second instead of shaman, it gets a bit tedious playing through the whole game all over again.  I don't mind the xp grind and can deal with the quest grind.  But finding all of the shrines again and collecting all of the purple items again is just a bit painful.  It would be nice if devotion shrines were account based so all of your characters got the completion.  It would also be great to use your transfer stash to hold purple items so you could pass them on to other characters on your account making quests that you've already done easier to do a second, third, fourth time.  A single iron count for all characters on the account - awesome idea.Bugs - still in dev so I realise there will be bugs.  Major bug is whatever causes the game to stop and then you have to hard reset your PC to escape its clutches.Overall, I like the game and will keep playing.  Looking forward to more fine tuning in the game and see what else awaits.			"

												If you are looking for a decent oldschool game, Grom Dawn is the thing. You actually get the feeling you had, when you played Titan Quest / D2 / Sacred (the first one, not the rubbish s2/s3).So far the game runs smoothly, had just one crash after 3 hours of playing, but it is not a problem since your progress is safed automatically.To my conclusion... If you want a game that tells you exactly what to do, where to find ♥♥♥♥ and how to skill your caracter...go play something else. Grom Dawn does not have that much Tutorials, but after a while you get the hang of everything.9/10 since there is not much of actually innovative stuff, otherwise it would easily be a 10/10			"

								The game is still in Early Access phase and already is the second on the list of games I spent most time playing. That speaks for itself. The similarity to Titan Quest is obvious and developers took every thing that made Titan Quest great and made it even better. Interesting lore? Check. Unique skill system? Check. Dark climate felt from the very beginning? Check. Foes dropping items they are equipped with? Check. With all that I have easily reached 100 hours of gameplay. And then they started adding more and more features. New classes, reputation system, devotion system, new areas and finally legendary items together with additional difficulty levels. From what I've heard the studio is small and I'm shocked with the speed of updates. There are still thing to be done (for example: lags after picking items when cloud save is enabled that quite a few players experience) but I'm assured that the studio will keep the good work with completing their game and later on with expansions. Good job, Crate Entertainment, good job.			"

								I love this game, I tell myself that I need to get to bed in like 30 min and then 2 or 3 hours go by! It's cool that its almost medieval themed, but not. You have guns and weapons with abandoned towns and stuff, but it happened so long ago that it's old school hack and slash. The graphics are pretty decent and the game play is a lot of fun with the different classes. I am already having way more fun with this game than I ever did with Diablo 3.			"

								Over 7 hours playing, great game, picked up during the Summer sale when it was half priced. Almost didn't buy it I'm glad I changed my mind. I like how you can change from soldier to a demolitionist and have multiple characters as the game progresses. One thing I wish was different is that once you clear an area and remove the chrystal the creatures would stay gone. Some confusing path finding at times, but nothing major. One thing I do like is if you click on an object your chracter will find the correct path even if you can't. Lots of loot to choose from and they do make a difference when fighting. This game will probably get comparison to diablo and rightly so. I finished diablo 3 and had no intention of paying $40 for another level of play. I would pick Grim Dawn over diablo any day of the week. Don't hesitate, pick this game up even in it's early access form.			"

								I have been looking for a good replacement for Diablo 2 for a LONG time as far as having that dark feel to it.  This is PERFECT !!!!  Though this game does not have a necromancer it does have the Occultist which is close enough and satifies quite well.  I was very sceptical of the fact it was Early Access but am impressed with how well put together this is in its stage of build 19 (as of this review)			"

								Ive played a lot of so called RNG diablo isometric games and this is by far one of the best yet. Its a great follow up to Titan Quest and wish I could say the same when comparing d2 and d3.Unlike a lot of other fixed camera arpg games grim dawn offers a camera that can rotate which is very handy for finding hidden areas or looking at an area in a different way. Plenty of lore to explore, set items, crafting, modify/upgrade abilities and even mix up your class choice to hybrid. Projectile attacks can be blocked (null) with other projectiles which is an interesting take on an arpg and not many have done it.The game has almost past my expectations other than map sizes, maybe im just being a tad too picky but I would like to see much bigger expansive maps, all in consideration this is a no brainer for diablo style game lovers, just buy it.

								Ok First Let me say that I am a huge Diablo III fan but the gear and item situation in the game lacks greatly. Once a new patch comes out the old gear is no longer viable. Along comes Grim Dawn and they have the item stats and drops right so far. I have been using a mixture of white and yellow and I got my first green a couple of days ago. As I progress thru the game the monsters scale and the items stay relavent. I have compared several items that have dropped and like the scale of the stats in the early access quite well. Gameplay is solid after you figure it out. Builds can be varied and provide ability groups for mixing and matching tooyour style of play, which I love, SOlid early access platform I would reccommend to anyone burned out on Diablo III competitive play. I have not ventured into multiplay yet, and have just completed the Warden quest which an WAS INSANE ending of a chapter. My only complaint is that I cant play it on my Surface III I7 as the mouse support is not there. Dev team please patch this QUICK so I am never far from the game!  I found the Fix in the Forums....This is an amazing game!			"

								I spent a lot of time playing Diablo 2 when I was younger, and spent even more time playing Diablo 3. I was a fan of the game, even before it got fixed with ROS. I ran every class in Torchlight and Torchlight 2. Point being; I ♥♥♥♥ing love my dungeon crawling, and I love my loot fests. I've followed Grim Dawn's progress since the Kickstarter. I didn't have a job at the time, so I never invested and I've held off on purchasing in Early Access because I didn't want to get a bad impression of the game. I finally cracked and bought into it. The game starts in a basic hub city, and with a basic ""go kill this weak boss"" quest. After that, the world opens up. You are indroduced to factions that you may work for and gain reputation that gives you access to faction stores (not unlike WoW). Some areas you'll never see in the main quest line, and the game really rewards exploration with lore and loot. And the class system is divine. It can be a little overwhelming at first (don't expect to keep your first character). The game has a wide selection of classes that all play differently. They all fit a stereotype (Soldier = Warrior, Nightblade = Rouge, etc.) but at level 10 you get to select a second class. Some of the classes don't blend very well, such as a Soldier/Nightblade build. Many skills require certain weapons in each class, and they can conflict with each other. Building a character takes careful planning, but is very rewarding.If you enjoy exploring, loot and rewarding leveling, this is the perfect game. It's amazing what a small indie team can put together when they are truly invested. Grim Dawn is an A+ example of old gaming done right in a modern time of microtransactions and DLC. Once this game is completed, you can be assured I'll be investing in any and all expansions. tl;dr Buy this ♥♥♥♥.			"

								Similar to Titan Quest, but but with one major difference, the level scaling of areas. It actually pays to re-run dungeons. Not quite such a linear path as TQ where your always moving forwards.Crafting is cool too. but here currently lies one downside to the game in its current state. Its the same Bank & transfer area as TQ but now with crafting but no extra room for storage! hopefully this will be sorted. :(Combat is very rewarding imo, the ragdolls, the skills etc. Since buying this game it's got me hooked in a good way. It's the only game thats fills the void TQIM left behind. :)But with new updates to come, inc skill mutations/modifiers this games just gonna get better!Summary: Pro, buy it nao!			"

								In short,  this is highly recommended and fun ARPG.  The music, the graphics and art style are fantastic.  You can get into the lore or just hack & slash.  Don't be cheap and wait for a sale on this one.  This is being developed by a tiny group of people whose lead bought the Titan Quest ""engine"" as a platform to base this game on.  I have been taking my time with this one since all the acts aren't out so I don't want it to end.  That said, there are plenty of side quests that I haven't even completed.  That said, yes, this game isn't ""done"" yet.  Although, there is still some balancing going on and new content coming, it feels like a finished game and so far, the updates haven't broken saves.  Well, that's about it.  For me, I love the art style, gameplay, music and the dark mood of the game.  As always, I'll put out updates as needed!			"

								TLDR; Great ARPG in the style of Diablo 2 and Titan Quest with dreary atmosphere, great music and hordes of enemies to kill and loot. 10/10 would mercilessly annihilate hordes of enemies again.If you love ARPG's like Diablo 3 and Torchlight but miss the gritty and brutal atmosphere of Diablo 2 then this game is something that should be on your radar. Fantastic atmosphere with unique classes and an interesting dual class leveling system. Combat feels responsive and solid. The character animations leave a bit to be desired but it is very easy to overlook this gripe with the shear amount of fun you are gonna have clicking on things to make them explode. It's not a bad looker either with strangely vibrant colors for such a dreary world. The story is what you'd expect from an ARPG like this. The world is being threatened by some overwhelming force and you are special in some way and must fight to save humanity from annihilation. It's nothing to write home about but it does its job of setting up the world in which you will be slaughtering endless masses of enemy scum with an array of abilities and weapons. The music is also a standout as it does a good job of fitting the overall atmosphere that the game is going for.			"

												I'm an experienced player of Diablo II. I can tell you securelly: This game is incredible. For me, it is the best hack'n'slash I have played. Everything, EVERITHYNG, is very well done. I bought in a few days, and I don't stop to play. Was a time a game like this locked me.- Maps are incredible large. The world can be 8 times greater than Diablo II.- Class customization is incredible and awesome. You can use two classes and a sistem of Devotion than makes your character unique.- Large content. They are making DLCs, I hope they never stop.- Lore and ambient incredible.- Engine awesome. Corpses fly away and explouds on dust. Nice!- Rift system for mobility. Very smart.- You can use fire guns.- Factions and quartermaster system.This is what I discovered by myself from now. I'm playing more and more... If you are curious and like the game style, just buy and try it. You will not be desapointed.Note: 10/10. I will dye playing this game. Devs, give me content for a life, please.			"

								A really nice surprise!Been playing this since EA and watched it mature into a really great game. It is quite addictive and makes you want to play just a little longer, just until the next level up, just until the next dungeon is completed, just one more quest...then I'll stop...honest. You can tell this game was made with a great feel and pedigree for the genre, which of course Crate has with Titan Quest.It has some very nice mechanics, especially the way you can dual class, it has lots of hidden little dungeons dotted around the sprawling landscape, that add a nice bit of variety to the overland questing area. The shrine reclamation, to add more points to help customise your character a little bit further and the loot!Seriously, the loot is great, even if you dont get something you want for one character, it makes you start planning for further alternative characters for replaybility, so you can put the item in a shared stash for your other characters.All in all, a great game, you get alot of gaming for this price, great value indeed.

								Grim Dawn is a damn good game, which is, at the time of this review, coming to the end of it's pre-release updates. The game has evolved so much through the short amount of time I've owned it. It's fairly unique and combines a little bit of all the ARPG games into it. Leveling gives you points to upgrade class specific skills/passives and your 3 major attributes. Then there are shrines that you find along your journeys that give you constellations to complete, and once they are you'll get a big boost in stats or get abilities/passives. Oh and at level 10 you get to pick another class, which gives you a unique class name based on the 2 (i.e Occultist + Shadowblade = Witch hunter). This provides us as players an infinite amount of building paths for our characters. As far as ARPGs go this is a solid 9.5/10.			"

								If you were or are a fan of the Titan's Quest games Crate has done a great job of taking that interaction and skill system and dropping it onto a new world.A number of small improvements I've noticed and liked are as follows.1) Auto relic merging. 2) Active skills now level when you add points to them, without having to deactivate them and start them again!Things I wish were a bit better.1) It can be a bit hard to figure out where certain features like cave entrances are when looking on the map. Would be nice if after you found an interesting cave or spot it could be highlighted in some way on the map.2) A longer range for seeing things like merchants and other features on the map would be nice as well.3) I would have liked a bit more openness to the overland maps.4) I would like to see a few more side quests, or maybe not quests but Easter eggs, little spots where something interesting happens. And have it not always be a cave. Hint: More Mosquito island like locations.5) I'm spoiled and would have loved to have some voice-over dialogue. But it's not critical to the success of this game.Bugs. Overall very few for an Early Access game so far! 1) Mobs will sometimes end up in places I can't get to. The only way to kill them is via ranged attacks. I have had this happen a number of times now, and once with a boss mob, which made it super easy to dodge its magic attacks and just shoot it till dead. Small bonus item pickup seems to have pretty good range as I was able to still get all the loot that was dropped. Yay. So far all the mobs this has happened to were kill-able. I've yet to have it blocked by terrain etc.2) Minor interface bugs. Radio buttons in the menu's that glitch and don't become unlit the one option when you select another. And once a button that wasn't highlighting in the skills dialogue.3) I have had a few stuttering lag moments, which do not seem to be related to things like the number of mobs on the screen. Almost like the system works overtime when I'm in a big group fight and then hiccups after it's done. Or when transitioning between zones (areas of the map) not sure, they seem rather random, and definitely disproportionate to the evens on screen.OverallI'm enjoying the game. The pace seems fairly good. I love the skill system, it was and is my favourite part of the Titan's Quest series. I do worry about multiplayer being a little boring as there are a lot of choke points and areas where a single individual can funnel mobs for easy cleanup, so a group of players might find that even easier, unless the mob count goes way up. That said character progression seems to happen in line with the difficulty of the area you are moving into, or the mobs are scaling well. They are always within a level or two of my level as I'm advancing with bosses being a couple levels higher. In summation. If you like ARPG games and or are a fan of the style of the Titan's Quest games. This is wrapping up to be a fun game.O.			"

								This is a great arpg. I strongly recommend this to folks who remember Diablo 2 fondly and were less than pleased with Diablo 3. The character and itemization systems are some of the best I have ever experienced in this kind of game. The graphics are strong and the game establishes a strong sense of ambiance. The sound is good and the effects help the action feel impactful.The only negative is that there is no BNet like server to prevent cheating and better promote party play. Overall, this is a must buy for fans of the genre. It is easily better than the next contender (Path of Exile) and well worth the low price.			"

												This is the best new offline, single player ARPG (Diablo style) on the market IMO.  They took what Titan Quest was, and improved on its gameplay, and variety.  Crate is a great developer to deal with, because they actually listen to the players, and a lot of the changes and fixes they've made have been based on player feedback.  They're pretty smart about ""Balancing changes"", and I can't recall an instance where anything was ever ""completely gutted"" with nerfs.  If you're like me and absolutely detest developers who are overzealous with ""nerfs"", then you'll find it refreshing to know that doesn't really happen in Grim Dawn.  I haven't played the game recently, but I got near 200 hours, and plan to come back to play when the Necromancer class and new content is added.  I just got too many other games to play atm.  200 hours might not be a lot of time to put into one game for some people, but that's a lot for me.  I typically get bored with games and move on after about 40-80hrs.  Almost no game ever gets 200 hours of my time.			"

								This game will be amazing. The dark feel, and  ""steampunkish"" style really satisfies. Currently playing level 22 Pyromencer, Ive been playing PoE for the last couple years off and on always keeping an eye on GD. I finally bought the game about a week ago, and have played about 22hrs since. Its I recomend this game in the state thats in and only expect more incredible polish and content from these guys. Edit: After finishing the content at around level 35, completing all currently available quests. This game is definately worth the cost, Crafting system is pretty unique, although it fills your inventory pretty quick, gameplay is fun and items/enemies are unique. I was playing a ranged character and always felt pretty on par with the content, yet still challenging. Support this game, Id love to see how this plays out  =)			"

								I love this game, I tell myself that I need to get to bed in like 30 min and then 2 or 3 hours go by! It's cool that its almost medieval themed, but not. You have guns and weapons with abandoned towns and stuff, but it happened so long ago that it's old school hack and slash. The graphics are pretty decent and the game play is a lot of fun with the different classes. I am already having way more fun with this game than I ever did with Diablo 3.			"

								Over 7 hours playing, great game, picked up during the Summer sale when it was half priced. Almost didn't buy it I'm glad I changed my mind. I like how you can change from soldier to a demolitionist and have multiple characters as the game progresses. One thing I wish was different is that once you clear an area and remove the chrystal the creatures would stay gone. Some confusing path finding at times, but nothing major. One thing I do like is if you click on an object your chracter will find the correct path even if you can't. Lots of loot to choose from and they do make a difference when fighting. This game will probably get comparison to diablo and rightly so. I finished diablo 3 and had no intention of paying $40 for another level of play. I would pick Grim Dawn over diablo any day of the week. Don't hesitate, pick this game up even in it's early access form.			"

								I have been looking for a good replacement for Diablo 2 for a LONG time as far as having that dark feel to it.  This is PERFECT !!!!  Though this game does not have a necromancer it does have the Occultist which is close enough and satifies quite well.  I was very sceptical of the fact it was Early Access but am impressed with how well put together this is in its stage of build 19 (as of this review)			"

								Great game to get your classic Dungeon Siege/Diablo fix.  Good graphics, sound and the story is playing out well (so far). On the map you can see large zones/areas to come but even as an alpha theres plenty of towns/caverns/wilderness to get your teeth into. With bugs and glitches few and far between (even in its current state) its turning out to be a well made game.			"

								Very fun ARPG game. Atmospherically, I would say it's somewhere between Diablo 2 and Torchlight 2 for me. Some steampunk and lots of gothic architecture. The music definitely adds an extra layer of charm as well. Character building, in terms of skill points and stats isn't too much changed from Titan Quest, although I feel like the skills within the trees are much more fun and better designed that Titan Quest's skills, so I can't fault it too much. I would have liked to see a bit of innovation here though, but hey, it's Alpha so there's still time for that. Overall, I highly recommend it. I'm only 6 hours in at time of this review but I can already predict I will be playing much longer than that.			"

												Fantastic game!  I saw a friend playing it while I was on playing a different game and I decided to check it out.  So fun!  It's your tpyical ARPG in terms of the basics, but there is so much more depth to this game than I am used to.  There is more of an open world field to it even though it remains mostly linear.  It's more open world than dungeon crawlers and there are parts of the map you can or can choose not to explore.  What really has me drawn is right now though is the multiplayer, which has functioned wonderfully so far and the character builds.  So many ARPG's get you on a narrow character path and this game has so many options.  I love that you can pick from any of the classes to start and then you can combine with any of the classes at level ten.  I'm sure there are some that more naturally go together, but you decide.  And even after you decide, change your mind around from there.  I started with an occulist because I like to summon creatures and then decided to add on a shaman at level ten because they can summon as well but then in seeing some of the two handed weapon options with the shaman, I poured my attribute points into physique and picked up heavy armor and now I tank with my occulist/shaman build.  Then there is the devotion line of perks that is HUGE and hard to earn but again, so varied and it allows so much more customization.  Well worth the money.			"

Go buy it now \m/As a fellow ARPG junky this puts a smile on my face just like Diablo 2, Titan Quest, Sacred 2, Diablo 3, Path of Exile, Torchlights, Loki Heroes of Mythology and some others have/do now or in the past.Simply you can tell that a lot of heart went into building this game and it shows its pure quality. If you ever wanted Titan Quest 2 but don't mind a different theme then press that [add to cart] NOW!. If you love the ARPG genera press [add to cart] NOW!A massive thank you to the dev team for all their hard work over the years. I know it will all pay off and you deserve it, all the best.I hope that my own game will own as much as Grim Dawn does. Grim Dawn is an inspiration to me as a fellow indie dev, I can’t wait for the final release. Grim Dawn = a ARPG classic of the ages			"

Early Access Review
								After a (very) long early access and development nearing its end, let's get to the conclusion: this is an awesome hack'n'slash. Not the most beautiful (see Diablo 3 for that), but a good one anyway.The game itself is very close to what was Titan Quest. Pretty much the same design team behind those two. The game experience is solid, even though there are only eight full time buddies on the job. One would expect such a small team to fail bringing life to such a big project, but it ended up working out just fine for them.If you have to look for flaws in the game, let's begin by aknowledging that the game isn't visually stunning. The art direction just does the job, and that's it. No more, no less. You may also find that some elements of the ingame background will kill you faster than the final boss, which is both surprising and very disapointing, especially if you end up losing a 20h HC character on that.Other than that, expect a solid gameplay, interesting challenge and overall nice game.

								Great game ! ! !wow, these guys have put a LOT of effort into this game & it shows that they built TQ & TQIT.Game looks great, game play is lots of fun & these days it's hard to get this quality @ this price point.Totally ALL appendages UP...Horray for dev's like these.Play it  if a friend has it, you will see for yourself.Another game along these lines is POE, Free N also has the same level of dedication.If U R ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with reg d3, you want to own N play this this for a fraction of the cost & won't regret it.Lastly......they did fix D3 with reaper but it's a tad too late N seems sorta ""cheaped"" out.

								Great game to get your classic Dungeon Siege/Diablo fix.  Good graphics, sound and the story is playing out well (so far). On the map you can see large zones/areas to come but even as an alpha theres plenty of towns/caverns/wilderness to get your teeth into. With bugs and glitches few and far between (even in its current state) its turning out to be a well made game.			"

								I prefer not to compare ARPG's with Diablo but i must say that Grim Dawn is everything D3 isnt. If you are a fan of ARPG, classic hack n slash titles, this one is a must get. A real successor to TQ and D2.			"

								This game is going to be awesome. It feels right. I dunno. D3, i played it when it came out, it was fun, but got boring pretty quickly. Once you tried out all the skills and figured out what worked, meh. This game seems like there is a bit more variation in the builds and it is still not even released yet! It plays the way i was hoping Path of Exile would play. Poe is a fine game for being f2p but this game right here.. I am finally excited about an ARPG again :D			"

								If you are a fan of games such as Diablo 2 or Titan Quest then Grim Dawn is the game for you. It's nothing special but it everything it does, it does well. Keep in mind that it is still early access and there are a few obvious bugs that you may come across but Crate (devs) have been very good so far with updating the game.			"

								If u played Titan Quest you will like this game.I am Diablo 3 player, PoE player and player of many other games, and each games go by itself, they are different in many ways. Diablo 3 has literaly best and smoothest engine and combat style and flawlesness is far superior then any of those games i mentioned. Only thing that GD lacks is that, smoothness... But everything else , perfect. Buy it, enjoy it.			"

								Those, who seek for dark atmosphere and bloody gore are at the right place. The game is catchy and promises lot of hour of gaming. It's kind of diablo gameplay with some spice flavor of titan quest. I can only recommend it.			"

								Grim dawn has easily earned the top spot as my favorite ARPG. It has great atmosphere, story, and lore. There's true character customization with an amazing number of class and skill combinations, and the devotion system adds a whole other facet of character tweaking on top of that. The depth of stats and unique skills gives itemization far more possibilities than several other ARPGs I could name in which itemization is nothing more than finding the best in slot for your cookie-cutter build. Gameplay is smooth, and with the variety in enemy types and abilities, it is often quite tactical. The constitution system is reminiscent of D3's health globes--keeping you in the fight and not standing around to recuperate--but manages to not break immersion to do so.The few quibbles I have are not really worth mentioning and are completely overshined by how well all the ARPG systems have been built and interact as a whole. The devs are also very receptive to player feedback and have made fantastic additions and tweaks throughout the development process. I can only expect more of the same as they continue to improve the base game and work on the expansion. If you like ARPGs at all, this is an absolute must buy.			"

												In my opinion this is the best ARPG currently on the market. It plays a lot like Diablo 2 and Titan Quest but with nice graphics.It is a loot-based game which focuses on boss farming to acquire good loot (like in Diablo 2 and not like in Diablo 3 where you farm whole areas to get loot). While your character gets better when you level up and spend points on your stats and skills, you can be godlike when you have godlike gear. The game has 6 ""pure"" classes with its own skill tree. You can dual-class which gives a total of 21 possible classes (15 dual classes and 6 pure classes). The skill system is very in-depth but still easy to understand and the possibilities of different builds are very enormous. The max level is 85, after finishing the game at normal difficulty you will be around level 50 and there are two more difficulties.There is also a Hardcore mode, multiplayer, an extensive crafting system and an achievements system.Overall a very good game, I would recommend it! The replay value is really high and if you like ARPGs you can expect a few hundred hours of fun from this game.			"

								If you like arpgs and dungeon crawlers you'll probably like this game. I will say its more in depth than most in terms of difficulty, this game does not hold your hand. that is a good and bad thing. The combat isnt as polished as some of the other aarpgs like Path of Exile but overall a good buy and enjoyable			"

								The Good: Strong character building, great music, 80+ hours of content.The Bad: Minimal voice acting, no cutscenes, still unpolished in places.The Bottom Line: Grim Dawn is a fun, fully playable Diablo clone. The story is there, but you'll have to mostly read it from dropped pages found while out exploring the environment. If you've already played Diablo, Torchlight, and Path of Exile, you know exactly what to expect from this game. A classic ARPG through and through.			"

								Being developed by the same team as its quasi-predecessor Titan Quest and using the same engine, Grim Dawn plays a lot like the aforementioned Titan Quest. That is, it is a classic hack-and-slay. As this is written, the game is not releaed yet, so some of the now mentioned points might change until release. Unfortunately, there are severe technical issues contained in the current build (which is build 30), for example local multiplayer not working with 3+ players and a high rate of random crashes. The difficulty is somewhat higher than one might be used to from other hack-and-slay titles but still enjoyable. Apart from that, gameplay is designed quite conservatively. That means one should not expect an extraordinarily innovative gameplay but a hack-and-slay ARPG like many others before. On the other hand, this also means that the gameplay is really great (there is a reason there are so many hack-and-slay titles), so this is not necessarily a bad thing. In general, the gameplay experience is captivating and the atmosphere created in the game does help this a lot. In conclusion, I can really recommend Grim Dawn to anyone who is willing to ignore the troubles of early access (else you should probably wait unitl release and get it then).			"
