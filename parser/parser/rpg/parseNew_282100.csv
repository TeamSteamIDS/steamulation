AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Fearless Fantasy Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: RPG; Casual; Adventure; Lighthearted  My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 3-7 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Casual gamersREVIEWWith a cursory glance, it would be easy to dismiss Fearless Fantasy as another mediocre game, with mobile-game-era mechanics (oh my), that isn’t worth looking into.  I will tell you: that may be a mistake.If video games were people in a Hollywood high school movie, Fearless Fantasy would probably be that odd, quiet girl who sits alone during lunch.  Most people know she exists, but don’t necessarily acknowledge her existence— best she just stay in the corner “where she belongs.”  Then when the jock has to talk to her (on a dare), we find out she is indeed a bit odd and won’t ever fit in with the popular crowd… but she is also surprisingly fun and suddenly attractive when you give her a chance to take off her glasses and let her hair down.Many people will automatically dismiss this game because it uses ideas rooted in mobile-gaming.  That is their prerogative.  All I know is that I only play games on PC, and I play many different games— and I found Fearless Fantasy to be one of the more enjoyable games I have personally played.  It isn’t the best, but it is better than many.What makes this game enjoyable is the combination of nostalgia-evoking, tried-and-true, core RPG mechanics (turn-based combat, level ups, skill points, and items) with some modern zest (using the mouse to make gestures to execute abilities), and a light, casual style and storyline.  While you play, it simultaneously feels comfortably familiar and interestingly novel. Many games try to find ways to spice up the classic turn-based-RPG combat style; one of the best I have seen is the swipe-and-click gesturing used in Fearless Fantasy.  Instead of just clicking “attack” and watching your character attack, you have to use your mouse to perform various combinations of swiping and clicking, involving timing and precision.  I thought it was exceedingly fun trying to pull off the advanced moves on the high difficulty.With the relative ease and short length of this game, it is a great candidate for a quick bite of a variety in your gaming diet.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Fearless Fantasy strangeness drew me to it like a moth to the flame. I purchased it purely for its intriguing art style and was greeted with humor, two characters that nearly sound like Steve Blum and Mark Hamill's Joker, and a turn-based combat system based on timing and tracing.I really like the art, especially for the monsters. They were just enjoyable to look at before I slaughtered them. The monster designs range from humorous to creepy (pay attention to their names too). The stills that were in place for the cinematics were not very interesting visually, but the humor usually takes priority during those sections.The voice acting seems decent enough and light-hearted. Joshua Tomar kept throwing me off with his Steve Blum impression. Adam Harrington's voice kept on giving me serious Joker vibes. Both made my experience with the game even weirder.The combat system can be difficult to master. Tracing with the mouse did not work out well for me unless I played on Casual or Normal (you can set the difficulty manually for each level). There are three characters with different specialities (damage/debuff, buffing/taunting, healing/defensive) with five different skills available for leveling up. None of them are too amazing, but it's satisfying to trace a perfectly timed path and scoring an epic or flawless rating for very high damage or bonus effects. Look at the first trailer for the game to have a fairly accurate idea of how the tracing mechanic works (you path your mouse through arrows).Fearless Fantasy is a strange, little game that might be enjoyable for you. Let the art style consume you.			"

												I'll hold this little crud as a perfect example of a bad port from mobile platforms.You see, it is a decent game, by indie standarts. It is working, there are no bugs, it has start and end, and there are even a challenge of some kind! Like in the famous Osu! title. But, just like with Osu! and even worse... its main part, the battle system, is strongly tied to touchscreens. You just can't do same shift with mouse, and don't even try to use joysticks, trackballs or something like that.I repeat again - this game is designed to mash and sweep your finger via screen, back and forth. And it is quite good only in that.But here we are - at PC station. I know, somebody might have a notebook with touchsreen, but statistically it is an imperceptible minority among usual mouse+keyboard users. And there that game fits as well as a fifth wheel.I see that almost a quarter of my friends already bought it, probably in some bundle, or with 90% discount. And ALL of them either not touched it at all, or idled for 5 hours, to get all cards. Well, that's the way to go! To beat it and get all achievements... too much honor for that cheapshot.Avoid. My mark is 5/10.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Enter Skies Publishers: tinyBuildInitial release: May 2014Genre: RPG, Casual#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationCostume Quest meets Paper Mario meets Elite Beat Agents. If this sounds good to you, read no further. This is a tiny RPG that came out of nowhere. Surprisingly challenging and interesting battle system.  Mildly throw away plot. Though its nice to see the party members adhere pretty well to the “holy trinity” Leon- the DPS, Alice - the support healer and Vonn – the Tank. Its also a nice feature to be able to re-spec at any time with a just a right click, some battles can be tanked through while others require more.. finesse. The whole time I was thinking of FFVIII because Leon, mixed with the timing of things increasing damage and the fact that Leon is absolutely holding a Gunblade warrants the comparison to Squall. And obviously on a different scale. Surprisingly deep diversion.Follow my curation for more "

												This game is amazing if you are looking for a casual RPG. Great humour and interactive gameplay keeps you entertained throughout the game. The artwork is amazing and it blends well with the story. It's quite a short game but it's still worth the money since you can replay all the levels including the bosses. You can also easily respec your character's stats as well as their respective skills.It can be difficult at times especially if you want to clear a stage in 3 stars. I suggest you practice your timings right because getting a flawless or epic timing is a must to survive some difficult bosses. You also need to manage your energy, so adding points on endurance and using gadgets that adds +endurance is advisable. More energy = more skill usage = more damageGraphics: 7  (Awesome art style which blends well with the story)Gameplay: 7 (Intuitive battle system - timing is a must)Replayability: 5 (Not so much, no branching story line or another reason to replay the game)Fun Factor: 7 (Could be low if you aren't into short casual rpg games) "

It's just a thing i really like in rpgs.Anyway, this game gets a 912837918237 out of 10 from me.On a last note, just so you know, I threw my money at the screen the second I saw the game.			"

												Do not come into this game expecting the next final fantasy and you will be okay. It is more or less a straight grind of challenges of enemies.

												Rating: 2/10This is not the kind of turn-based RPG you'd expect. It has got the soul of a mobile game whereby you swipe, tap and do other gestures for successful attack/defense moves. And this is a really bad idea when your finger is replaced by a mouse, which makes the game feel clunky and awkward. The art style of the game sure is bizzare, but not in  a good way. Sure I appreciate the surreal feel of the game, but the artist didn't do the best job with the main characters - They look like an anime-crazy 10 year old drew them. The voice acting is cheesy at best, and the script matches it perfectly - Again not in a good way. I would only recommend playing this on a mobile device. Avoid playing this on PC unless you are okay with the controls and all the things I complained of.			"

												Fearless Fantasy is a RPG that seemingly tripped, fell down the rabbit hole and landed somewhere in an anime universe. There are strange creatures, over the top dialogue, and some interesting reactive based combat. One thing I will say about Fearless Fantasy is it doesn't really hold back, it wears what it is on its sleeve. This is very obviously meant for a mobile device but nonetheless finds itself on Steam. To be frank, Fearless Fantasy is like a funny tasting alcohol, it is unique but definitely an acquired taste. One that certain people may like, others not so much.The reason for that is Fearless Fantasy goes against the grain in most regards of traditional RPGs. The art style is what caught me off guard the most. The monsters in Fearless Fantasy are not your typical, orcs, goblins, and oozes that we have all grown up with. These nightmarish creatures seemingly stepped out of a Dr. Seuss book. With strange vibrant colors and wicked smiling faces coming out of other wicked smiling faces. This sets the tone for the game and lets you know that this isn't your standard RPG. On top of the onslaught of twisted creatures, Fearless Fantasy has a bit of an anime edge in the character design.The story of Fearless Fantasy is very simplistic and very light on plot. There is a Princess, Hero/Mercenary, evil fiance, giant monster that can eat everybody. It's story, in my opinion, is not really the main focus but it is present and quirky. In between missions you are occasionally gifted with slight animations that give some personality to the characters. The characters have a light-hearted tone that is reminiscent of anime, this makes the characters seem somewhat vapid in nature. This will throw some people off but I didn't mind it all too much. The scenes are voiced acted well but sadly they lack any color, which takes a bit away from the scenes and also some footage is reused in certain situations.To shake things up even more is Fearless Fantasy's combat. Again this is where this game holds its heart on its sleeve. The combat is completely meant for a mobile platform, you poke, swipe, and swish for all your abilities and attacks. On the Steam version, your mouse replaces your finger and this is quite jarring at first. I love the idea of the combat system as it keeps the player involved in a way that traditional turn based RPG's don't. If you miss an attack there is no one else to blame but yourself, if you critical hit, you did well. Where the problems begin is that there is no time given for you to practice your skills. You essentially learn the combination of swipes and taps as you play. This leads to wasted attacks and some grinding just so you can figure out what you're doing. On higher difficulties? Forget it!While I cannot comment on the mobile version of the game, I can say that on PC the mouse feels somewhat clunky in combat. Lacking the swishing grace that a finger has as the attacks get more complicated and faster as you progress through the game. There is other minor issues with combat, while the tutorial does explain the basics. Things like enemy status ailments are never explained, it was only until my fifth mission I realized I could click on my party and see what the negative buff was. Despite the issues though the combat can be fun and highly reactive. I should mention there is also a shop with items and upgrades. The shop fills in the required RPG aspects and gives that grinding a point, and lets you spend gold.Other areas of the game do what they can for being a mobile heavy game. The options menu is somewhat bare. The map which contains your levels is drawn well but static.  On the other hand, the audios of Fearless Fantasy are fantastic. The music never got dull for me and was exciting and fun when it needed to be. The sound effects having the necessary oomph when a critical hit landed or swish of a dodged blow. The attack animations themselves while eventually repeated, looked fantastic the first time I used them. Dazzling the screen with effects I wasn't expecting.Replay value and length are up to the player. The game includes the standard 3 star achievement hunt. This is divided by difficulty per area/scene of the game. Increasing the difficulty of the reactive combat. This feels a little grindy but still adds welcomed replay value. The story mode can probably be beaten in about two to three hours. The higher difficulties will take much longer.To sum up, Fearless Fantasy is not everyone's cup o' tea, but I was surprised and interested to see how different the game was. I think some bold moves and design decisions were made here and I think the good far outweighs the bad. Even if you're not a fan of the art decisions and story. The combat is unique. I would love to see what this kind of combat could be like in a dedicated PC title and made a little bit more friendly for the mouse. As always I encourage you to do a bit more research, but the game isn't overwhelmingly priced at $6.99. You could always catch it on sale but I think the game offers more then enough even at its base price. Especially if you are looking for something that dares to try something a little new and a little weird.			"

			Fearless Fantasy is a weird little game with a good story and integrating combat. On Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/282100/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing:...		

	Fearless Fantasy is an adventure game similar to a JRPG in its combatelement.  To start with, the music in this game is wonderful;  it does anamazing job of propelling the atmosphere and the combat.  The art style isdistinctive, and may not appeal to everyone, but for what it is, it is well done. The game does implement a star system to encourage replay-abilityto see how fast you can complete each level.	You have the choice of three characters with a variety of differentstrengths and weaknesses.  You level up abilities as a team, and each teammember has abilities that can be used to regain energy or mitigate attacks not only to that character, but across to other characters.	The story is what ties the game together;  it propels you forward, andthe cut scenes are not overdone.  You can choose your difficulty level foreach mission, and the combat is done on a turn-based basis.  You attack bydrawing a line, and the quality of how seamlessly you attack will affecthow much damage you do.  Each ability has a unique way on how you attack, requiring that you learn exactly what your abilities do, and think out howyou will be attacking each turn.  	The game accomplishes what it set out to do very well.  The storyis entertaining, and the art style is unique.  The game provies incentives to play it again through its' star system and plenty of achievements.  Ienjoyed playing this game, and can easily recommend it.	This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch if you are looking for a more in-depth review.  Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												Fearless Fantasy is probably the weirdest turn-based RPG I have ever played. In order to commence an attack, you need to solve a gesture based gameplay that is similar to Osu!. The game may intimidate some PC user because the gameplay is designed to play on the touch screen or on mobile. The character design is weird and the cutscene looks like it animated in Flipnote Studio 3D by a child. The story is short and had a weak plot. The item/weapon system is too limited.The game didn't have the complexity of weapon/items/battle system of the JRPG but offers a unique type of gameplay.Get this game on sale or if its free.Rating: 5/10			"

Fearless Fantasy does well at what it sets out to do, offering a weird but likable aesthetic backed by a whimsical premise and quirky cast of characters. The streamlined design works to its advantage with a hands-on battle system that does a nice job of getting the player more involved. While the software itself is soundly designed, however, the omission of touchscreen technology support is quite glaring and would have enhanced the game’s tightly focused battle engine. The use of mouse, while functional and serviceable, takes away from the true potential of the gesture-heavy gameplay. As it stands now, though, Fearless Fantasy is still a nicely streamlined role playing battle marathon.Look to the ""Troll"" move, which attracts the enemies' attention by performing signature dance moves from Gangnam Style.

												One thought that came in my mind while playing it... how it would be to play it on phone :PBut this game got my heart. Graphics are not perfect but there is something unique in it.Something that other games don't have. This game seems to be simple in the beginning.BAH, its even boring... when You play on ""EASY"". But then one moment You realize You want something more from that game. You go back, and You start to play NORMAL, HARD. I really like the way You need to swing with Your mouse.I wish there could be a way to train, it's so hard on HARD. 1st look - i thought of OSU :PI love the gameplay. Its a really an original game!

												The game had potential, not a lot of potential admittedly but it had some.Ruined by a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ need to use dumb phone controls on a PC game. No, I can't swipe and touch all around my screen like some ginny ♥♥♥♥!I tried to like the game, I really did but its just yet another mobile game ported to PC with the sad irony being that the game came to PC first. What they should have done is put it on Nintendo 3/i/DS then ported it to mobile.If you can get past the janky♥♥♥♥♥control scheme of swiping or tapping then you will have middling fun, middle of the road. Even looking past the control scheme the game is overall very solid and well done in many parts (yes that is a compliment) but its not captivating. Every time I failed a heal or missed an attack or performed an epic defense and still took a lot of damage I couldn't help but wonder if the game was done in this style so as to hide is awful flaws.Overall, I can recommend this game (surprisingly) if you play on normal or easy and just have an itch for a Nintendo DS gimmick style game. Since, however, if you fall into that category then you either own a nintendo handheld from after the year 2000 OR a mobile phone, then you are already spoilt for choice aren't you?Everyone else, stay away.

												Deviantart-level presentation with fanfic-level writing and top-notch-cringe amateur voice-acting makes this demented piece of game a really fascinating camp work.In it's core it is rather usual score\3-stars–grind rhythm-game in jrpg style without any of annoying jrpg timewasting.""Level-design"" or ""gameplay"" is very sound, narratively speaking - melee strikes require precise aim with swiping, while ranged ones require hitting moving targets on time.But this game is rather strangely ported, and i don't know if it can be fixed. With mouse most basic actions become much harder to perform, especially on higher difficulties, which combined with high resolutions (targets remain the same size while spacing increases) makes it really difficult. But with proper touchscreen monitor and ancient 1920x1080 resolution this game is pure mechanical joy to play. Still this is a pc version and touchscreen monitors are rarity, so no excuses.Overall it's rather enjoyable rhythm-game with all of squalor in fascinating trainwreck of presentation.

												Fearless Fantasy has an art style that is both cool and crazy. The combat system can be somewhat addictive and challenging when you try to perform some of the harder and stronger attacks. There are 3 difficulty settings, the higher levels adding more clicks or swipes to each attack. And of course there are weapons and skills upgrades. It has great bosses, awesome music, nice story with interesting humor and of course a very interesting turn based combat system that is challenging, satisfying and entertaining.			"

												Fearless Fantasy is a fun RPG that is rather short but is entertaining nonetheless and is worth the download.The story is rather simple but it gets the momentum going so you can smoosh monsters in no time.Leon, a professional monster hunter gets a request from someone to rescue a girl for 500 gold. That girl happens to be the same person who requested the rescue. As Leon finds out the hard way, the girl happens to be a princess who is running from an arranged marriage with the mad King Xola. They are later accompanied by Vonn, a fellow monster hunter, to stop the mad King and his pet Deothas to save the kingdom!Gameplay, of course, is where the game shines. The game has a map which shows progression throughout. The player is given the chance to buy items before battles or practice previous encounters the player has already beaten. You can also spend experience and skill points on techniques on the overworld map. The battle system is classic turn based with an Active Time Battle system similar to the mid Final Fantasy games (4-9). Character turns are determined as these fill up. The fun part about the gameplay is the combat. When you attack, defend, or perform special techniques, special arrows appear throughout the screen. Hovering your mouse through these arrows will determine if your attack is effective or not or how much damage you take. A grading system is there to rate how accurate you are. Get an EPIC bonus on special techniques by filling up a grading gauge and you get special bonuses and buffs. These buffs are an essential part of combat and can be the meaning of life or death in the harder levels. Getting a successful buff and seeing that EPIC flash is a rewarding part of the game.The enemies are fair and the game makes all of their special attacks and properties known by hovering over them. This gives you complete control over the battle and gives you time to plan accordingly. This gives battles a unique and strategic vibe where you are given all the information you need to be successful and not get caught off guard. Deaths are fair in this regard as you can only really blame yourself for not planning ahead.  Skill points and attribute points can also be redistributed before battles so you can plan your party beforehand. Items are also relatively cheap and you can also train in previous stages so beating the game is not too difficult.The game takes on average 4 or 5 hours trying to beat both Veteran and Normal. This is pretty short but the game regardless is loads of fun and recommended for those who enjoy a simple and fun diversion. "

												Oh hello! Didn't see you there. I'm here today to talk to you about this game called Final F... I mean, Fearless Fantasy.It's a neat little Indie RPG game with some hilarious and over-the-top dialogue, phenomenal soundtrack and great voice acting.The game has no free roam option or anything like that, you go from mission to mission, level up and buy new stuff.. The usual. The combat style is really similar ""as you can imagine"" to Final Fantasy games, turn based combat. But the combat itself is something pretty different and unusual for these kinds of RPG games, Have you ever heard of or played ""Osu!"" because that's how the combat plays out. You pick what you wanna do when it's your turn and then you move your cursor around according to your attacks like you were playing Osu!. As mentioned before, the voice acting, overall writing for the dialogue and soundtrack are all freaking amazing.In addition i'd like to say that the character designs for especially the enemies are absolutely gorgeous, well maybe not gorgeous but unique and likeable.. I'll still go with gorgeous, gorgeous in their hideous and ugly way. I also love how the camera works during battles, it's very cinematic and makes everything look so darn epic. There's not much actual story being shown discarding the cutscenes that look like some childs' doodles on Paint.But i do love how the characters have their little discussions with each other after a battle, teaching us more about the lore and the story and doing some character development which is always a plus in a RPG game.I have to admit though, the game felt bit too difficult at the beginning.. Or maybe it's just that the game is so fast paced i just didn't have time to really practise anything.The game also looks like a Mobile port but i'm pretty sure Fearless Fantasy actually never was a Mobile Game to begin with. So that's cool.Overall it's a pretty solid game with very few issues and a cheap price tag.Buy it if you enjoy playing either Final Fantasy or Osu!.. Or both!			"

												This game is just so good I think I would even replay through it when I've completed it.The story so far from what I've got up to is funny to the core.I was going to play through the entire game but I thought why not savor the first playthrough and do it slowly for once, there is no real choice I think but it's just so fun enthralled me straight from the images and videos. The character that I least like so far is the kings lackey because well your find out if you get it ;)The combat system is new to me takes a bit of getting used to but once you have it gets easier.I can't think of any more to describe but trust me it's money well spent.

												It wasn't love on the first sight. I still think the art style of this game is creepy and crazy. On the other hand the combat system is somehow addictive and challenging when you try to perform some of the harder and stronger attacks. Maybe a touchscreen would make it easier and even more fun to play, but if you are using mouse, it is still pretty playable and enjoyable. It has great bosses, awesome music, nice story with some little funny phrases that made me laugh and of course very interesting turn based combat system that leaves some satisfaction after each epic attack I land upon my enemies. Would recommend. 9/10   "

I story and the characters are entertaining. Love the spells too, they are quite diverse. The game didnt get tired of itself like so many games do.The graphics are..kinda weird, but as soon as you start playing the game you'll see it is just fit for the game. The voice acting is awesome. The King's voice is Shaco's from LoL if i heard it right. :)Highly recommended!5*			"

												I'm not sure if this game was made with touch screens in mind, but it certainly feels like it.  The interface works well with one and I quickly switched back when I tried using the mouse method.  Sure a mouse does work, but the touch screen jsut feels better.  I'd say this is more strategy game with some RPG elements and a clearly pardoesque sotryline.  The humour is decent and the game forces some actual thought on the best way to approach different levels rather than blind grinding.  The downside is that often you have to play and fail a level first to know what's coming in order to then plan your strategy accordingly.  I guess the game might be simpler if played on the casual settings, but I'm a completionist, so the hardest setting it is!A good game so far given that I knew what it was going in, a casual riff on RPGs with an active battle system that keeps me engaged.

												I got this game for free.  The icon sat on my desktop for a couple weeks, along with the other ""step-kids"", while I played my better-known titles.  When I finally got around to playing it I was pleasantly surprised.  Even with close to 600 games in my library (not to mention the countless console games I've accumulated over the years), the combat manages to feel unique and fresh.  The simple yet challenging mechanic reminds me a bit of One Finger Death Punch, partly because it's timing-based, but also because when I don't get it perfect, I want to go back and try again.  I should add that while it appears this game was designed with touch screens in mind (which I have on my laptop), I chose to use my mouse and still enjoyed it.			"

												One of the more interesting mechanics I have played in a long while, Fearless Fantasy is, if anything, unique.The main mechanic is through the movement of the mouse, in the way you would expect to swipe your finger in a mobile game. The story is not something that you necessarily play this game for, and it feels as though this game is was never meant for PC. It feels like this game was always meant for mobile, and that it was a last second change over to Steam. This game could even very well be for mobile (I haven't researched it), and if it is, I'm sure it is a great mobile experince. The experience on PC is actually quite good for it as well, if a little odd. The enemies are easily the oddest part of the game, with enemies I cannot even begin to describe because they are entirely unique to this game.This game is solid, if bizarre. Given a bit more marketing, this could easily gain a cult following for being something you will never play anything like again8/10			"

												Really cool RPG with a touch screen-like type hitting/dodging mechanic (using your mouse, however) that feels at home on a mobile device. Not really a deep story (small twist: you fight alongside the princess you're trying to save), but generally fun over all. Music is very good, often with a good beat that works well for combat. Voice acting is excellent- characters are all fun loving or light hearted, without being too over the top. Art is the real draw here- it reminds me of the style seen in ""The Yellow Submarine"", with maybe a hint of Alice in Wonderland. The Blue Meany would fit right in there! Worth noting that the hit detection is fairly good, although there's some occasional bugginess in some attacks (one boss monster had an attack where their dodge arrows disappear prematurely at a certain step). Only downside that stuck out to me is how long the fights can go on for. There's a point where, while you won't really lose to the enemy, they take forever and a day to kill, dragging otherwise fun fights into monotony. There's also a significant difficult ramp up from Casual to Normal mode, but you don't really need to play the higher difficulties unless you're showing off. I will say you probably shouldn't be sleepy when playing this game- your reflexes define just about everything. I feel there's a lot more good than serious detractions to Fearless Fantasy and I heartily recommend it.			"

												Awesome! www.indiegala.com/store has been promoting this game for free if you spend $3 USD on other game(s).I thought the graphics looked nice and the gameplay looked very casual and fun. I was shocked when I played it because the music and voice acting is awesome! It's the kind of music you can enjoy by leaving it looping for a long time when you minimize the game. The gameplay takes a little practice (2-10 minutes) to understand the timing and get the hang of, but it is worth it. You can level grind all completed levels and even if you lose a battle, as long as you made at least 1 kill, you still get rewarded with EXP and money, so you don't get that angry ""I wasted my time"" feeling when you die. The saving is automatic after each battle. If you aren't sure what to spend your stat points in or which upgrade to buy, pick the ones you want and roll a (real) dice (such as, the last number, decides which one to upgrade to and other numbers = reroll). If you limited it down to only 2, you can use even/odd and do ""best out of 5"". I found using this method, takes away the stress of not being able to decide. Anyway, I think this game it's self is worth $3 USD, so if you find a few games that add up to $3 or 1 game for $3+, I recommend it.So far in my gameplay, the game hasn't gotten overly complicated and I can always go back to level 1 in an instant, without having to run for 30 minutes to get to it.

Review - Fearless Fantasy""In Fearless Fantasy, you have to make an effort to be able to land an attack and dodge them.""Fearless Fantasy is a uniquely designed Turn-based RPG game. The player starts with the protagonist saving a damsel in distress and from that point on, their adventure begins. Though the voice-acting and cinematics aren't that good, the game art is actually great but the main selling point of the game is its battle system. Unlike the traditional turn-based RPGs where you just click attack and then your character performs it, Fearless Fantasy brings the excitement in every turn because for each attack command you execute, you have to successfully complete a certain minigame (like you have to click some circles at the right time or follow an arrow path at the right time) in order for your attack to successfully land on your enemies. The same also applies for dodging enemy attacks. The game design is also more like that of the minigame Cut the Rope where each stage is rated by stars but in Fearless Fantasy, the stars corresponds to the game difficulty on each stage.I recommend this game to those out there who wants to try a different kind of Turn-based RPG game. The game's rate of replayability would rely more on how you can adapt to the game's battle system. Get it when it goes on sale. The game has a lot of potential but I hope the devs would reconsider a sequel to it. Personal Rating:Gameplay: 9/10Music: 6/10Story/Plot: 6/10Graphics: 9/10Overall: 7/10			"

												Amazing game! It's an RPG but imagine that if you can respec all skills and stats at any time without penalty. You can buy any weapon you want from the shop, and only pay the difference in price between that and your current weapon. If it's a negative difference in your favour, you get a refund. This means you can try any weapon whenever you want with no loss in gold.Only possible negative I can think of is that the ironman achievement seems impossible. You cannot die or reload, and there is no save option either. If I can find a way to do this without having to restart my game, then there reallly is no flaw to this game at all.			"

Comprehensive, in-depth video review: (written review below)


YouTube™ Video: Swash! ❧ Fearless Fantasy Critique (Steam Review) 

			Views: 546		

			An in-depth critique by SwashbucklingSir of the timing and turn-based combat RPG Fearless Fantasy. Innovative gameplay, wacky artstyle but faulty in many details. Check it out!		

First of all, let’s delve into the graphical fidelity of Fearless Fantasy and let me be frank with you here, this game looks rubbish. Two-dimensional artwork that has a varying degree of texture resolution ranging from low to incredibly low. The characters are disconnected from the world due to a lack of shadows. The spell effects trot along the same lines. Honestly, the only good thing I can say about the aesthetics of Fearless Fantasy is that at least the enemy design is creative and even wackier than Dark Scavenger.The sound design of Fearless Fantasy also has a huge variance in terms of quality. While the sound effects and music are decent, though highly forgettable, the voice actors on the other hand, oh boy. It has to be said though, that these voice actors had to work with possibly the worst dialog I have ever had the pleasure to witness. Just have a listen for yourself.And “Jimmery biscuits.” Is not even the worst thing you will hear while playing this game. There is such an obnoxious amount of “something something … NOT” jokes in Fearless Fantasy, that I probably should go see my dentist due to all the cringing that I was forced to conduct while playing. So while the art style evokes possible humoristic influences of Terry Pratchett or the hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy, the game instead throws boring and repetitive low-blow jokes into your way. Disappointing.Now, let’s get to the gameplay and the core innovative idea of Fearless Fantasy. The combination of turn-based combat with timed mouse gestures. Honestly, the idea is actually really good. The first few combat scenarios are interesting, require some getting used to in terms of timing, and are genuinely refreshing to play. Sadly, the fun only lasts for so long, as a ton of problems surface very soon. First of all, every ability and every attack each has its same pattern, so that sooner or later you will know exactly what is coming up and start mindlessly gesturing across the screen. I would have highly preferred to have a randomised pattern to keep things constantly interesting. To make matters even worse, sometimes my mouse clearly went through one of the arrows, for example in a straight line, however for whatever reason, one of the arrows was not registered and therefore the attack had a significant lower damage amount. Which brings me to my next point in combat. Even though I really do like that hitting the timing perfectly empowers your ability and matching the timing of enemy’s attacks reduces their effectiveness, this while system is incredibly inconsistent. I did several tests, restarting the same level over and over again and found that even if I managed to get a flawless block, I sometimes ended up getting no damage or 20 damage, which is a huge difference. The same is true for attacking, rendering the whole reward of actually hitting the timing naught and destroys the satisfaction of playing. Speaking of the non-existence of satisfaction while playing Fearless Fantasy, the cherry on-top of all the previously mentioned frustration is the grinding. As you can see, there are set stages in Fearless Fantasy, with a set amount of waves of enemies that are meant to be defeated. Once a stage was completed, you can proceed to the next level. You will soon hit a point, where a level is unbeatable because your party has not reached a certain experience point yet, thus requiring you to go back and replay previous stages, with the exact same enemy setups, abilities, waves, everything just to grind your way to a higher level. I am aware that grinding is a vital part of a lot of RPG games, especially for the JRPGs Fearless Fantasy is inspired by. The difference to those being though, that in these traditional JRPGs, your party usually went from A to B to complete a certain task, while on the way you had to encounter random monsters, which you then defeated and gained rewards from. The important point here being that you had a target. You were meant to be going someplace and this encounter just stood in your way, however to proceed in your mission, you had to defeat it. In Fearless Fantasy, there is literally no incentive to go anywhere, as the world is split up in levels and thus going back to previous levels just for the mere sake of gaining experience is incredibly tedious and frankly dull.Now, I did not even mention all the little gripes I have with Fearless Fantasy. For example, the skill system poorly explains what happens after you upgrade an ability, only for you to find out later that due to the latest upgrade and the attached increase in energy cost, you now can only cast a spell once instead of twice, thus ruining the whole plan you had laid out previously.All in all, I am honestly sad to see that such a promising idea was wasted with poor execution on all fronts. Low-fidelity aesthetics, horrible writing and voice acting, failures in multiple game design choices and overall a really repetitive experience. If you are interested in the gameplay, do only get Fearless Fantasy at a heavy discount. "

												This is easily one of the worst games I have ever played. Poor artstyle, repetitive gameplay and - that's the gamebreaker here - unplayable with a mouse. Your primary target is to slay down waves of monsters in kind-of-Final-Fantasy-like arenas. Every character makes its move an then waits for its cooldown to get ready for action again. You can choose between a melee attack, a ranged attack, some power spells (five per char) which make more or area damage, buff your group etc.) or using items like health potions, mana potions etc. If you cast your spell you have to swipe geometrical figures with the mouse cursor in order to succesfully hit your target or block the attack. And you don't have much time to do so. I guess this would work very nice on a tablet/touch device, but it's absolutely no fun on PC.			"

												FF is a fun mix of arcade 2d fighters and jrpg games. The game has 13 different battles, each with multiple waves of enemies and 3 different difficulty levels. You can replay previous levels to improve your rating [which is determined by the difficulty you completed it on].The game's battle style is centred around ""slicing"" and clicking. If you're familiar with fruit ninja, although I hesistate to draw a comparison, you'll know what that means. Attack effectiveness is determined by you accuracy in these actions. While this might make it suited to being played on a tablet device, it in fact works very well just with a mouse. You may need to tweak you sensitivity in windows though, as there is no way to do this in-game. This doesn't get boring and remains challenging as each enemy has different attack patterns you need to match, and the sensitivity to sucess goes up as you change difficulty level.The graphics in this game are very nice, colourful and detailed. Much like any jrpg, you will encounter lots of bizzarre enemies, which is always a plus with this type of game. The story of the game is told through speech bubbles an dcutscenes, but the quality of the cutscenes is pretty questionable. It's not a major detrement to the game though. The music in this game, matching the graphics, is top-quality. "

Game meant obviously for ""touchy"" devices, but still playable with a mouse. Short, silly with casual approach to an RPG elements, very simple story and exciting fighting mechanic.It was the first game that introduced me into this kind of gameplay and I must say - I loved it! Turn based fights where you do not only click on enemy to attack, but the better you do in an mini-game during your/enemy's attack - the more/less damage you deal/recieve. I found it really rewarding and it kept me focused all of the time.Do not buy it for complex story, because it doesn't offer one - it just fills the basic need for it. As for the RPG part - I also do not recommend it for hardcore fans of the genre who love to fiddle with their characters' stats, abilities and equipment. You can always reset and change everything between fights with no additional in-game cost, which in my opinion is good for this kind of game.Game offers choice of difficulty for each battle, which makes it good for anyone to pick up and play. You can really feel the difference between each one and it's even more challenging with a mouse.If you have a choice - get and play it on a touch device, especially if you are going to play on hardest difficulty.

												At first I was too sceptic about this game because of the images on Steam store and because the game was bundled already.But then I've bought it and played it. What can I say... So much FUN! Thought it would be your regular turn-based RPG like those made with RPG Maker combat system. I was so wrong. The combat mechanics are innovative and make Fearless Fantasy really addictive. I liked that when you level up a skill a new attack option appears in it's combo. You should try it to understand. The art is weird and trippy, the sound and the music are made greatly.  The baddies, like those shrooms on screenshots look adorable, but when they attack it seems kinda disturbing. Really good game in it's unique mix of genres.			"

												Super weird, but actually kind of interesting. A compactly designed RPG all about making tight, tactical decisions and having quick reflexes. It might have a cringe-worthy story filled with cardboard chacters, but the game's intriguing art style and good design make up for these flaws.

												While Fearless Fantasy isn't long (there's only 13 sections), it's nonetheless an interesting game. The combat mechanic is probably more suited for touch-based devices (I found windowed mode makes the game a little easier, than playing full screen in 1920x1080), it still keeps combat interesting.Because of the mechanic, I did find myself having to grind earlier levels for experience, and ended the game with level 17 characters. But, I still recommend it as a fun little RPG, especially if you can get it cheap.Definitely enjoyed the cutscene style as well.3 of 5 stars.			"

												Fearless Fantasy is a surprising simple yet addicting game that has a lot of going for it. Weird story and dialogue, wacky enemies, easy and intuitive gameplay (especially if you're playing on a touchscreen laptop or screen), and some great humor. The story is pretty short though, there's only 39 ""missions"" to complete. However, each mission has 3 difficulty levels which can be replayed to grind out experience for your characters to level up and increase their stats to make progression easier. It's not the next greatest turn-based RPG, but it's well worth the look and if you have a Windows 8.1 tablet or touchscreen laptop (I used Asus Transformer) it pretty accessible and easy to play. You'll find yourself thinking ""one more mission"" in order to level up and increase your characters' stats to prepare to take on the next mission which may be a little too difficult at whatever level you may be at.

												First let's get this out of the way.No, you don't need a touch capable screen to play the game at all.However, having said that, having a touch capable screen will definitely make doing the combos and input sequences much easier than a mouse because of how visual and directional they are. Using your finger to literally trace the directions exactly as they are as opposed to using your mouse to guess and estimate with your entire hand can have a great change in you performing ok and performing amazing.With that out of the way, the story is both humorous and entertaining and certainly not completely implaussible as far as actual rpg storylines go. I really wish they had added a sort of training mode where you could practice some of the sequences as some of them do appear quite quickly in veteran and give you only a short window of time for inputs. I think potential alternate input methods such as keyboard inputs could be a potential option or setting that could be alternated to.Overall though for the price I think I got my good share of fun and entertainment and would certainly be interested and look forward to more releases like this one.

												Interesting battle mechanics, power of your abilities depend on how well you complete the strikes or patterns. Although kind of short as I completed everything on 3 stars in 3hrs plus some idle time. Give this a try when it is on sale for around 1 euro maybe.I really dont think using a touchscreen will be ""better"" to play this game. Those that complained about this being a touchsceen game or phone port are just not good with their mouse imo. I tried playing this game with my touchscreen and it was way more difficult for me than playing with mouse.On the side note, this type of game defenitely doesn't have to be intended for touchscreen devices, just think about OSU! which is a pc game.

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine A game I wasn't expecting to be this good!Fearless Fantasy is an RPG Adventure game published by one of my favourite indie companies called tinyBuild and at first I wasn't expecting a very good game, however I was proved wrong. The art style makes me feel like I am watching a stop motion animated Tim Burton movie, with its weird art style I really enjoyed playing it. The voice acting is actually pretty good and I enjoyed the funny humor that the game provides and I like the battle system, waiting for the exact moment to strike as well as following a specific pattern. However, I was put off a bit by this game. It made me feel like I was playing a mobile game, the world map makes me feel like I am in a world map on a mobile device, the combat/battle system works like you are on a mobile device and the quality looks like it has been ported from a mobile device.The sound and cutscene (video) quality put me off greatly, sometimes the sound quality sounded good other times it sounds like they recorded the voices with a cheap audio making software, plus, the cutscenes look like they downloaded them from YouTube.Another thing which put me off is the limited amount of options it gives you in the options menu. It feels like it has been ported from a mobile device.But, setting aside all these problems, this RPG game is a creepy, weird yet funny game to play. RECOMMENDED :)  "

YouTube™ Video: Cheap PC Games: Fearless Fantasy Review 

			Views: 21		

			http://store.steampowered.com/app/282100/ Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Little_B_Gaming Check out my friend bambeast27 channel.		

I love weird games in any kind of sense and Fearless Fantasy is such. The creatures are not typical, the battle system is not entirly typical. At first glance, it seems like another mobile port and to some degree it is, but make no mistake – it's defenently worth your time and money.The main character here is Leon, the best bounty hunter in the world. He's tricked by princess Alice to save her from arrange marriage and they start a quest to stop an evil king. Along their journey, the company is joined by Vonn, friend and fellow bounty hunter of Leon, to help them with their quest. Together they have to stop the bad guy and kill a terrifying monster. The story is cheesy, simple and there in nothing to remember, except the character interaction. The writing is surprisingly fun. Cheesy, but fun. Dialogs between everyone is good. It won't win any awards, but I didn't want to skip any of the cutscene.The option are bare-bones. Sound sliders, fullscreen, dynamic camera and visual effects. There are non rebindle key, because it's entirly mouse driven game.The developer put a little twist on the traditional JRPG's battle system for the player to be more involved. You choose a regular attack or special. Then arrows and/or circles appear on screen and with the mouse you have to slide and/or click on them at precise moment. Better you do, more damage you make. Different skill have different patterns. Some even takes quite a few seconds to do and this keeps you on edge. This is the case with the enemies. When they make a move, you will do the same thing. Better you do, less damage you take and later in the game, this may be the difference between life or death. All skill require energy. Sometimes character can be blinded, but you can still make a flawless move. I really like this battle system. It's not just click to choose, it involves you and it's awesome! But it can also make you rage-quit, if you mess up.All enemies have description and from here comes the strategy part. Some enemies while they are alive, his allies receive less damage from range attack, but when they are left alone, they die and so on. So you have to decide to kill the other creatures first or the single one that provide this buff. And this is kinda cool.The skill are acquired by leveling up. When this happens, you have one point to put in stats and one in skills. All skills can be level up 5 times. Their sound and especially visual design is great.After a battle you will get gold. With him you can buy weapons, items and gadgets. All are pretty standard. You have to be at certain level to get better weapons, items and gadgets. I wish there were more things to buy.Beside the battle system, the graphics and charatcer design is what caught my eye at first. Both are amazing!!! All creatures are non standard and I can't even describe them. A mushroom with a some sort of shotgun and an evil flower. This is the best I can do. They are really weird in a good way. A lot of thought is put in them. The backgrounds are great too. They have this oil painting style and I like it. It's different than the characters. The bosses are really fun to fight. All have some sort of support, like tentacles or other characters, that have some buffs and you have to decide from who to start. They require some strategy.As for the level design, there isn't much to say. You have a static map and there appear the next level. You click on it, choose the difficulty, represented as stars, fight 3-5 wave of enemies and that's it.The suprise for me is the soundtrack. It's great!!! I want to listen it every day. It's that good. All tracks are fast-paced techno and really fits the combat on screen. Sadly, you can't buy it or find it anywhere. Sound effects are great. All have enough punch to feel satisfying and when you combine  it with visual effects, they get even better.The voice acting is really nice and I wasn't expecting any. I like Leon, he's bold, cocky, looking for a fight and he always have something to say. Vonn and Alice have their different personality. Non of them three characters are original or complex, but their conversations are fun to watch.I have few problems with the game. The first and most important is the lack of any information about the debuffs you get. Some you can recognize, like poisoning, but others you can't, at least in the beginning. All have icons beside of characters name and with time you will know them, but I think it would be better if I hover the mouse over them to show me some information. The second is grinding. It isn't much, but had to repeat few level to get some money for new gear. Next is minor. When enemy is about to attack on screen you see “Tap when ready”. Come on, it's a PC game remove tap and put click. Next is audio in cutscenes. It feels really compressed. Other conversations have much better quality. And lastly the combat. I can't comment the mobile version, but the games feels kinda clunky when you have to use the mouse to execute the moves. Further into the game they become longer and complicated. It feels more natural to swipe with fingers. Despite that it's really fun. Oh, and tutorial for the combat is nowhere to be found.Overall I had fun with the game. It's defenently worth the asking price. If it was more, I would say wait for a sale. The game is not super long. It will take you 3-5 hours to beat it. There is three star rating system and from here come some replayability. I didn't maximise all my skill and I still beat the game, so for me it's not worth on the hardest difficulty, because the fighting become faster and this can make me break my mouse. The battle system, creature design and soundtrack are really great and because of them you can overlook the shortcomings. I recommend it.			"

												Interesting game, with unique gameplay.  It's hard to describe what other games it is similar to. It's a turn-based RPG, but you have to use timing and mouse movements to get the most out of your attacks (which reminds me a bit of the Penny Arcade games). Your skill/armor upgrades are somewhat basic.  There's no exploration, you just follow a path set for you. I actually think it would be more fun with a touch screen than a mouse.			"

												Although I haven't finished Fearless Fantasy, I can attest that it's a brilliant game!  Fun factor is always number one, and on that criteria alone, it's relentless!!!  It has great graphics, amazing art style, wonderful music, and really funny and well acted dialog!  Fearless Fantasy only falters slightly in the gameplay department.  The mouse swipe quick time events don't always register, and that makes combat sometimes clumsy.  This is not ""game breaking"" by any means, but it is a bit frustrating.This is an RPG not to be missed!  Although I got it on sale, it would be worth every penny at full price!  This is another RPG ranking as one of my favorites!!!    UPDATE 8/9/14Just finished Fearless Fantasy and it was WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!  Everything above, yadda, yadda yadda!GO BUY!!!			"

												This game is pretty great! The music is catchy, the characters are interesting- I could even go so far as to say lovable, I found the humor light-hearted and enjoyable, and the upgrade system is simple and liberating, The animations are kickass.  Each level is a gauntlet of battles. Every time you select a command or trying to defend, these arrows show up and you have to run your pointer through then to succeed. I found this more interactive and there was a better feel to attacks. it was also challenging than it looks and sounds. When I missed my chance to get it perfectly, I found myself waggling my mouse about.The monsters are also the weirdest thing I ever waggled my mouse at. Even though the cutscenes need a bit of polishing, that is only a small flaw in this gem of a game.9.75/10 would waggle my mouse again			"

You have to swipe your mouse throw arrows that pop up on the screen after you choose your attack or spell, very refreshing gameplay.Only complaint is that even when you get very good combos, the damage seems low for such an active attack system, but maybe I just need to play around with stats more.

Don't be expecting a new Skyrim, or Final Fantasy!I have played but 20 minutes and I have already fallen in love with the serene voice acting, the odd and intreaging art style- and especially Alice <3When diving head first into this sweet game, provided you enjoy it for what it is, is an adorable and enjoyable game- I am excited to see development and maybe some more customisable outcomes in gameplay.

												When I first saw this, my reaction to the artstyle was basically ""What the hell is this nonsense?"" Having played it, the answer is that it's amazing nonsense in the best traditions of oldschool JRPGs, and full of hand-drawn cutscenes and fairly charming amateur voice acting for when you're not in combat.Beyond the artstyle, Fearless Fantasy is more or less a standard JRPG with some clearly mobile-influenced elements, like the interface and being divided into short, selectable levels with three difficulty modes each. Despite its fairly short length (only about 3 hours for me, including 2 replays of every level except for the last two), it manages to fully develop all of its mechanics, the well-tuned battle system making it so every action and decision really counts by the end of the game.The only real issue I have with Fearless Fantasy is that the gestures required for the attacks feel like they were designed for a touch interface, but the game hasn't been released on mobile or any platform that typically has a touchscreen yet. However, their website indicates they intend to release a mobile port sometime this year. As a result, while this game comes with my recommendation, I would suggest waiting for the mobile port if you have a smartphone with a decently large screen or a tablet.(Of course, having beaten the game, I don't plan on playing another version of it. As a result, I won't be updating this if the mobile version doesn't come out or is terrible or something.)			"

												A chintzy mobile game tossed onto the PC for reasons I don't fully understand.  Nothing about this is optimized for the PC nor it's controls suit the PC.  Everything is tapping and swiping in an attempt to make you feel engaged in an otherwise old and archaic JRPG combat system. Voice acting is grating and the art is...well...the art if you take it in as a static image is passable with that ""westerners draw anime"" style that was popular in the early 2000's but the animation and movement is just atrocious.  Everything looks and feels disjointed in a completely non-stylistic manner which lends it to feel like this was baby's first game project.  I'm sure this looks just peachy on tiny phone screen or tablet but welcome to the PC, put on your big boy pants and learn to animate properly.I see the game has mostly positive reviews and I can only imagine it's because people bought it knowing what it was and was predisposed to enjoying this.  It's a cheap JRPG style mobile game, if you know that going into it your standards for this have to be pretty darn low to start with.  It's also possible they were fans of the original mobile game and are blinded to it's flaws. I don't know...I was given it for free as part of a Crusader Kings 2 bundle at IndieGala and after spending a little time with the game was left wondering if I could somehow get a refund for something I got for free.

												Awesome game. Don't listen to all the bad reviews talking about the game being designed for ipads and not for pc (Mostly referencing the swiping QTEs). Yeah it's a different time based mechanic, that will take a little to get used to. When you do get it down, it is very rewarding, and satisfying to pull off. In terms of the game itself here is some things to consider:-Game is fairly short (can be finished in about 3 hours)-Voice acting! (and not terrible at all)-Charming comedic charm-Balanced mechanics, that have good synergies between one another.-Absolutely fun.If you like RPGs or have never tried one and would like an introduction to turn based RPGs I would recommend this title, as it is fairly simple, short, and interesting.:D			"

												This is Fearless Fantasy—a JRPG inspired indie game with a very unique twist on the standard turn based combat system. This game is an absolute delight! With a great soundtrack, peculiarly nice voice acting, and a fantastic slew of enemies, Fearless Fantasy should be in everyone’s Steam library. 	Let me start by acknowledging the work these developers have put into this game. The duo, Enter Skies are still working on this game, as there is a mobile port on the way. And despite being released in May of this year, they still communicate with their community over on the Steam forums (much better than, say, Code Avarice have been doing for the entirety of Paranautical Activity’s existence on the platform).	The overworld is quite reminiscent of Record of Agarest War, if I’m remembering correctly. You’ve got your difficulty options going in, which will require you be precise with the aforementioned combat system. Bosses, however, have other little stipulations which may further cause you difficulty in Veteran battles. The world is absolutely psychedelic, with beautiful battlefields and some damn trippy enemies.	The combat incorporates the use of an Elite Beat Agents or Osu! Style of board which will determine whether you miss or critically harm your enemy, or fail to or critically defend against him. Epics and Flawlesses will provide you with powerful turns, while misses will result in failure. You can attempt to troll the enemy, or be trolled yourself—that’s all up to you ;). And consumables are actually useful. Well, I don’t mean to say they aren’t useless in other games, but I can’t tell you how many JRPGs I’ve played where I hoarded the hell out of potions thinking they’d be useful later on, only to end up beating the game with a sack full of vials. 	With general gameplay out of the way, I’ve got to say I was absolutely charmed by this game. The cut scenes are what look to be flash animated, simple, and delightful to watch, with some decent writing and great voice acting. The voice acting is reminiscent of the Tales games to me, and the actors definitely put in a lot of effort despite this seemingly small project. Seriously, the voice acting is absolutely genuine and high quality, especially considering the quirky, humorous nature of the game! 	The last thing I’ll cover is the music and sound. The opening theme was the hook which made me stop what I was watching on the other monitor, amp up the volume, and really give this game my full attention. I may be overly optimistic but everything that’s been done in this game is far from lazy, which includes the use of sound. Attacks seem powerful, and Flawlesses feel amazing when you pull them off!	This game is an absolute trip. It’s a wonderful, if short adventure. There is a very positive feel and flow to this psychedelic world, in which your progress actually means something. I had a really great time with it, and at the very cheap price point of 7.79 CAD, Fearless Fantasy is definitely a worthwhile purchase.			"

Fearless FantasaaahhhBut, Bratty, you haven't played through the whole game yet!First of all, shut up. With most indie games, if you play them for more than a half hour you can get the point of them. This game is no exception. However, that doesn't mean it's bad at all. Actually, this one's pretty cool. Game MechanicsWas this a mobile game before it was a PC game, was it simultaneously released, or was it purely a PC title? The mechanics and battle system scream mobile, but I haven't bothered to do the research on whether or not this is the case. Either way, it grows old really fast. The problem with these mechanics is that they're all too samey, in comparison with other games. You upgrade, you swipe, you move awkwardly, yadayadayada. All of that is very, very mediocre. Voice ActingCornball voice acting. I mean really, really corny. Not bad! The audio is crisp and the voices are fairly punchy - they at least sprung for voice actors or a studio when they recorded this that featured a familiarity with the fabled pop filter so they don't sound like garbage. They also invested in what I assume was audio mastering, since everything has the same sonic presentation. MusicGood, but if I can't get a DLC for the soundtrack for free, I'm not gonna spend money on it. Graphics/ArtThe absolute best part of this game. The graphics, even if designed for a mobile platform, are offbeat. How can I best describe it? Between the deviantart-style anime storyline reveals, the combat graphics, which look absolutely fantastic, and all the other odds and ends -- you can see a clear direction and cohesion for the entire game. This genuinely looks like a group of people got together that wanted to make this specific game.It's weird enough to pull everything together and make it interesting, and I absolutely can't complain about that. Quite obviously, some of the graphics were inspired by those used in Final Fantasy games, but they retain their own unique charm and make everything for the game stand out. Get a group of people, make a game, everybody has their place or their purpose, and they tie it all together. This is the interesting local band of really good indie games. Absolutely recommended for the art style alone, not that anything else is bad.Art: 9/10 Everything else 7/10			"

												I'm not a fan of how this game is like Dance Dance Revolution meets Final Fantasy, but I will admit that the art department did a damn fine job with this one. Crisp, HD visuals that give even pricey graphics cards a run for their money. It's got charm in it's art style, also. It battles out like any lat Final Fantasy game, but in order to deliver your attacks, you have to 'swipe' the screen with your cursor. Yeah, that seems fun for a bit, until you find yourself grinding and having to put up with onset carpel tunnel syndrome as a result of some of those swipes. But again, I digress. The art style is what gets me on ths game, and for me, that's what its most redeeming quality is.			"

												Between the *adjective* Fantasy name and bizarre aesthetic, first impressions of this game are sure to raise eyebrows and I know it certainly made me cautious if not curious. Thankfully this isn't yet more RPG Maker garbage endlessly♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the Greenlight colon(y) but a quirky game that plays on cliches in a predictable but enjoyable manner. The combat is engaging with both basic attacks and techniques/spells requiring the player to draw through an arrangement of arrows at precise times: missing results in extremely lowered damage while hitting all/mostly perfects will grant further, sometimes esssential bonuses. It often straddles a line between fun and frustrating but overall it works well, Levelling up grants you both attribute and skill points which are pretty straight forward, adding more points onto a skill will typically unlock more hits or damage and often more arrows to complicate matters.The story is a typical save the princess and then beat up the bad guy fare but the characters are a little more aware of their situation and are either hammed up or cynical/realistic. They never quite break the 4th wall and there's nothing revolutionary about them and their motives but it's refreshing.Despite being a three hour game it does feel like it can wear away at your patience towards the end once the QTE sequences get quite long and enemy HP balloons along with them gaining a plethora of obnoxious passive abilities (e.g. 50% less ranged or melee damage, slapping your party with a status effect or damage on death etc.). All things considered it is a neat little game and worth picking up for a couple of bucks or in a bundle.			"

												A very interesting turn based RPG that uses fluid touch like controls to attack, you select your attack and then attempt to swipe your mouse through the arrows in the right direction and the faster you swipe through them all the better your attack. The same goes for when the enemies attack, the better and faster the swipe the less damage they will do. I would definately reccomend picking this game up if you like games like Final Fantasy. The story is very comedic and stays on the silly side of games.8/10			"

												Very casual game reminiscent of most turn based RPGs with a fun game mechanic and a certain comfort quality that makes it an excellent addition to any collector's library.I look forward to seeing more from this developer, and hopefully another Fearless Fantasy with their creativity expanded from the original to create even more fun.

												unless touching your monitor results in a moved cursor  this game might become too hard with the controls, at least for veteran difficulty that is, you can move a mouse around that fast but it must be a lot more comfortable playing this with your fingers touching the place at your screen (not sure if a touchpad would/could help it)the monsters look great, but yes: the characters might almost appear ugly.. the FMVideos along to that are in an ""awkward"" resoultion, but hey... that helps the game using up less space on a hard drive too, right? Also these videos are not really in full motion :P but rather hand drawn comic scenes in black outlines and yellow backgroundwas fun playing it, altough it almost felt long to get just one level done, maybe some would not consider that ""worth the time"", also if you regard that the ""gestures"" done by mouse movement just don't get the efficiency through the way they could when playing it on a mobile device or having a touch screen on your laptop/PCI'd still recommend this game, even though I don't feel like doing most levels on veteran mode because it would just take too much effort for not feeling that ""rewarding""enhancing the agility stat results in your moves being executed faster, which can help it.. but of course make it harder too - some moves are done rather slowly in comparison to others howeverstory mode ends without even having most of the abilities maxed out, at least for playing easy/normal that is - so the ""replayabilty"" might suffer from this control issue, although it's quite merciful after all, you can miss an arrow or two and stilll get an epic result if the end of the move was executed well enough, also you can see a bar on top showing you how far away you are from that or if the attack/defense will fail or not			"

												An interesting take on RPG turn based style games. A mix of OSU/Elite Beat Agents and turn based combat. Definitely a personal favorite of mine thats hard to master but satisfying once you land a flawless move. The art style is definitely something else I enjoyed a ton because of how creepy the monsters each looked. The story is pretty bare bones, with your generic character tropes and pretty basic cutscenes but even with all that in mind, you can feel the love that was put into this game. I strongly recommend this game if you're looking for something different from the usual RPG game on steam.			"

												This game is like OSU but  jrpg, and  very unresponsive.Maybe that's just me, but i constantly miss, when, as i think, i should have clearly hit good, instead i miss compeltly, when my mouse cursor clearly went right trough all arrows.Also would be  very good  to have some kind of tutorial, and some easier mode for  the each first time you use new ability, cuz i have absolutely no idea what to expect of each new skill, and when some new skills cost more than half of your mana, menas you just spent  one turn, most of your mana, completly missed, and, effectievly skipped a turn, when you just wanted to try that new skill.Also there is one  skill, that kills you instantlym if you can't perform it perfect. I never touching it, because i have no means of trying and training how to use it.Aslo about   mana costs, they are too high.   even if you hit enemy with that  previously mentioned nice new skill, that's it, watch your mana gone and you stuck either spending another turn to mp regen food, or  using basic attack for the rest of the fight			"

												This game is as mediocre as a RPG can get. Throw-away story, flawed leveling up system, amaturish artwork, non-existant character development, mundane battles, uncreative items, cheesy voice acting and worst of all, ridiculously short playthrough. It only took me 2 hours to complete the whole game. Thank God I got this game for free because there's no way I'm paying full price for this game.It's a good time waster, I'll give the game that but unless you have a crap tonne of money in your wallet, don't waste it on this game. Buy something else more worthwhile. Giving this game a thumbs up simply because it successfully made me pass the time.			"

												This is a port from android game, a mix of oldschool Final Fantasy-esque battle engines and some mobile game where you slide your finger as part of some mechanics.This sliding mechanics is the main issue here. Finger movement on a tablet is quicker than moving your mouse over some appearing arrows and clicking into circles. That wouldn't be so bad if those were not so strongly tied to the combat itself - e.g. some enemies can only be hit by EPIC attacks and those require quite good sliding over those arrows that appear during ANY attack. The only actions that don't require some crazy sliding minigame are taunting, using items and resting.Beyond those actions EVERY attack or special move initiates this tedious mini game. Pros:- grotesquely fun monster design, it's really something- music is ok, it's mostly playing some chilling tunes in the background Cons:- this game is grindy at heart, you'll need to replay some battles over and over to gain gold and level up your heroes- every attack initiates this stupid mini game, I just don't get it- plot is mostly pointless, the only meaningful and interesting character is king Xola (really cool design)- the overall atmosphere is silly, it's like watching an adventure of a band of bickering Claptraps (from Borderlands) with their stupid gimmicks and punch lines (with the classic ”It's hammer time!” by a hammer wielding team member)- graphics are ugly at hi-res, really really ugly, characters are looking as if they were cut from cardboard and painted over by some drunken artist. In game cutscenes are even worseThis game is not tragic, it's actually a good product from technical point of view - it didn't crash, there were no bugs that would affect gameplay. Still, it's short, the story is just not interesting enough, it's a grindfest, there isn't really any character customization here, etc.If you want to see some of those cool monster designs just search them on googles or watch this game on some streaming site. ---------- For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ "

												At first glance it may not look like much. Friend of mine made this game and im a sucker for RPG type games and turn based combat systems. Purely the fact of the arrow battle system makes this game way more for a touch screen type of gameplay. Playing with a mouse you gotta keep on your toes. Getting in that force of habit with usual turn based games, you do your stuff and kinda space off, gets me EVERY TIME. If you play games like this regularly or know ways to take advantage of beta games and such being a tester myself as well it's not TOO difficult. If you want a hands on rush I suggest diving in to the deep end, 3 star battles all the way. No little girl starting stuff :p.To my anon. friend, gratz on the release hope people love it like I do <3.			"

This game is worth every scent as long as you don't mind swiping across the screen to be able to attack. If you're like me you may end up falling in love with this game over the swiping. It gets kinda intense as you level up.			"

												This is why participation trophies are a bad idea.  It lets people think they can do things they absolutely should not do.The quality of this ""game"" is absolutely terrible.   It's extremely amateurish - any developer with any respect would see the quality is so bad the product should never see the light of day. Artwork - Terrible.  Hand drawn by someone who either never took any art classes or was kicked out of them on the first day for incompetence.   Makes Napoleon Dynamite look talented.Voice Acting - Terrible.  Hard to be sure because I shoved a pencil into my ear to rupture the eardrum to protect myself from hearing any more of it.  I threw up a little.   It's that bad.Gameplay - Terrible.  It's like a pisspoor tablet game.   Tap this, tap that, it's ""combat!"". Graphics and technical - Terrible.  Only one resolution, no graphics options apart from ""full screen"".  UI conventions not followed (Pressing ""esc"", which you might think gets you out of a menu with no apparent close mechanism, actually quits the game - although this is overall wonderful because the game is that bad). I'm not even upset there's no ""zero"" for me to give this game, because it wouldn't be enough.   This game is so bad it goes into negatives.   There is a saving grace, we can all laugh at the sheer comedy of the ""developer"" asking $7 bucks for this abortion.			"

												Firstly, I would like to say that this game is primarily aimed towards systems that enable touch screen technology - or at least from what I can see based on the reviews as well as my own experience playing this game. However, I have a wireless mouse that I use with my laptop. So what I'm getting to is: if you don't have neither a touch screen, nor a [wireless] mouse for your gaming experience - this game would be highly difficult to even try to play. For instance, if you were to try and use the laptop's built in mouse system, it would become increasingly hard to actually manage to complete a single level given that there are patterns that you need to trail with your mouse, and with the built-in mouse, moving quickly enough for that would just be impossible.TL;DR: TOUCH SCREEN, OR MOUSE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR GAMEPLAY. I always like the function of upgrading weapons and leveling up, it's so addicting in that sense. Whenever you upgrade your weapon, an extra mouse/touch pattern will be added whenever you use your skills. When you upgrade your skills, eventually this will add extra requirements when clicking and trailing the little symbols that appear. As many people have mentioned before, this game mechanic is very similar to the game many of us know as Osu! Like Osu, it would be much more practical if it were to be played using a touch screen, but given that I do not have one, it is a bit challenging. HOWEVER, this game can be played with a mouse, and you will still be good to go. I've been playing the game now for an hour or so, and I'm quite addicted. I had to step away in order to prevent playing too much to the point where my family will be screaming at me to get out of my room!Some of the levels were quite challenging, and I had to die a few times in order to finally beat certain challenging levels, but hey - what fun would a super easy breezy game be? Bottom line: I think you should invest in this game given that the following conditions are met as mentioned above.			"

												It's a nice little RPG with funny jokes, fully voice acted and an interesting combat system, that unfortunately doesn't execute all that well with the use of a mouse. The art style is unique and I liked it, I also liked all the different types of monsters, and their names, quite often they made me laugh. The story itself is somewhat cliche but I suppose that's actually the point since this RPG is kind of a parody. The only issue for me with this game really is, what could have been an unique and interesting addition to turn based combat. At first I was happily surprised at the system and I enjoyed it, but as I got further I ended up being rather frustrated with it. Perhaps it's all the more so because I am using a laptop the combat with a touchpad mouse is unfortunately quite a pain. Still, it is a nice game so if you are into RPGs it's definitely worth checking out, mainly because it's a rather amusing parody towards RPGs.			"

												Fearless Fantasy might be the weirdest rpg you might have encounter so far, but it's definetly worth it.Your Leon a bounty hunter with a gunblade (tell me that doesn't ring a bell) rescuing a princess by the name of Amelia from an arranged marriage, now on a quest to stop the evil king's plan.The combat system is quite simple you fight wave after wave of enemies, when you attack or use a skill you're required to move your mouse cursor through some arrows, the better you at that the more damage you inflict, there's a total of 13 levels so the game can be beaten in an hour or less.But you can replay them again on veteran difficulty for a harder challenge.The game got a lot of comedic moments between the characters, and there's also some funny monsters to be found, also your taunt is gangnam style dance, how can you not like that?.The game lags a bit every now and then due to poor optimization but nothing game breaking.At 7$ this is a must buy for a rpg fan, if you're not that much into rpgs then wait for a sale.

												Fearless Fantasy is a mini-RPG that adds a little bit more interaction into typical Final Fantasy-esque gameplay by giving timed attack animations to move through with your mouse.  With a quaint and silly artstyle and a story that doesn't take itself too seriously while still having a plot, the only real con of this game is that it's criminally short. Survival mode adds some replayability, but if you're just interested in the campaign, expect 3-4 hours of gameplay for your 3 or 4 dollars spent.    Not mind-blowingly good, but if you were able to snag this in a bundle or while it was on sale, it'll occupy your time for an afternoon or evening.			"

												I had this game from a Humble Bundle pack for a while and haven't even played it until now, but I was in for a treat. This is an awesome turn based RPG-battle game with an awesome and fun art style.The art style is very cartoony, a mix between crudely drawn anime and the type of stuff you would make on MS Paint. But it's great. That's what makes this game so cool... is the art style, to me at least. The story isn't bad either.Keep in mind, this game is focused on RPG battles - there isn't much else besides that (there is a story, but you don't do much exploring or anything - it's all linear, go from this battle to this battle and so on and so on).

												Firstly, I would like to say that this game is primarily aimed towards systems that enable touch screen technology - or at least from what I can see based on the reviews as well as my own experience playing this game.

												This is a strange but fun title.Fearless Fantasy's gameplay heavily features gesture-based combat which is something I haven't seen before in a game of this kind, so it's gameplay is new & refreshing. That said, gameplay is heavily reminiscent of traditional Final Fantasy titles with turns, status effects, equipment, et cetera. This doesn't detract from Fearless Fantasy as a whole, however - it's still a respectable, enjoyable experience. As stated above, the game utilizes gesture-based combat. For example, the majority of melee attacks requiring properly timing & tracing ""arrow tracks"" with your cursor, while the majority of ranged attacks require clicking circles that shrink over time. The only real flaw I can mention on this title as a whole is the discrepency between Easy & Medium modes - maybe I couldn't grasp the game mechanics, but I had perfect ""Flawless"" strikes on Easy & had significant difficulty even getting the minimum of ""Success"" on Medium. There seemed to be some inconsistency here.The characters, though not very fleshed-out, are distinct & serve separate roles well. Though the story isn't really here, it's worth mentioning that their unique & various callouts, responses & other verbal cues add some personality & emotion into what would be a much duller experience without them. That said, the story does not have much depth. In short,  you rescue a princess, kill a monster for it's venom, kill a corrupt king & his war machine/monster thing . To be fair, a lack of story doesn't detract from the title's other merits.The general look of the game is fun & often offbeat style, which fits the humor that frequently features in this title. I wouldn't normally go out & say ""I like this art,"" or ""this is a masterpiece,"" but the whimsical, cartoon-y art just ""fits."" When the game isn't making a joke of itself, the equipment of characters & creatures encountered are often fittingly sinister looking & the style of the gesture-based combat leaving an afterglow of the player's cursor is a nice touch.The sound of the game is one of its strongest points. As briefly mentioned with the characters, their vocal cues & responses are a strong addition. While the voice acting in cinematics server their purpose, they're nothing to write home about - but their comments throughout battles, whether announcing their turn, or taking/giving hits add a lot to give Fearless Fantasy some life. General gunfire, melee strikes & other combat sounds are better than most titles of this kind that I've played. I must also praise the soundtrack of Fearless Fantasy - it's one of my favorite parts of the game. The music changes to fit new enemies as they enter the battle & throughout the title, it ranges from quaint classical to upbeat, faster-paced styles.Overall, maybe the title isn't for everyone as you might be more critical than I am, it isn't flashy enough, or it isn't ""new"" enough to bring much to the table. Personally, I enjoyed the title & can recommend it to casual players, people looking for something new in their turn-based fighters &/or those intrigued by the gesture-based mechanics.			"
