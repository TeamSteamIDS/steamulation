												Heroes of Steel is an old school ""pickup and play"" tactical party combat RPG. It shares common ground with systems in the Ultima series and Final Fantasy Tactics (overhead grid tactics) along with wizardry style dungeon crawlers (Fixed party of 4 specific roles making a fighting unit).I emphasize this is a combat game because that really is what the game is: a COMBAT game! 80% of what you do is fight and kill enemies, the other 20% is a mix of exploring and gear/stat management with some light story sprinkled in to keep a cohesive experience.The combat turn is free forming where your characters do any action in whatever order you wish. The characters don't have to complete all of their actions before selecting the next character, and there is no turn order. For example you have have a caster debuff a monster, have your fighter run up to it and smack it, then have the caster nuke a different monster, then retreat your fighter back to support your caster all in 1 turn.The game is a slow burn and takes a couple hours to get off the ground.The combat can seem like a foot slog at times, especially in the beginning when your party is just starting and you don't have many options. It takes time for the game to open up. Most RPGs are also guilty of this, but it is worth mentioning that you wont be tearing through the enemy with ease right from the get go. There will be tough situations and battles of attrition where you have combat waves of enemies or large engagements and heavy odds. Certain battles can last the better part of an hour. Some people may be off put by the battle length, but the game auto saves all the time so you can quit out and continue anytime (including midbattle) they also added an animation skip option to help quicken combat downtime.The game is challenging but fair. Enemies aren't pushovers, the threat of dying from careless play or overextending is always there. Often you kill enemies fast, but if you are careless they will kill you fast. It's important to figure out a fighting style or general group strategy that suits you and then SPECIALIZE. The whole party is a UNIT, each individual fulfilling a specific role. Damage and healing are obvious but good crowd control, and positioning are more subtle and just as significant.These subtleties are important as you advance into episode 2 (20-30 hours) and beyond when the enemy AI behavior ramps up to where things like: tactical retreats, luring/pulling, stealth attacks, cursing, repositioning, and using terrain are paramount or you will die a lot.Speaking of death, it is handled in a very intuitive way. There is no resurrection or revive mechanic. If any of your characters die, you are given the option to retry the turn (this rewinds the game back one turn so you can try again, or you can reset back to the beginning of the dungeon area before the engagement. This is handy to start the fight from scratch or leave the area to resupply. The only negative for death is a hit to your total learderboard score.The game encourages you to explore every nook and cranny and to kill EVERYTHING you come across. Stealth basically boils down to a way of getting the first turn in combat (getting an edge on buff/debuffs and positioning) and getting high critical bonuses on sneak attacks.In fact, the game is so combat focus that it is hard to avoid most fights. There is no ""escaping combat"" mechanic. This can be a problem if fights goes badly. In this situation it is usually best to try and salvage by a tactical retreat for a few turns and regroup, or to let yourself die and restart before the engagement.The story and dialog adds purpose and life to the game without destroying the game pacing or getting in the way of the combat. Story and dialog are pretty well done. The highlight here is the interaction between your characters and their reactions to things in the world around them.There are some cliche things but nothing too grating. It uses some common themes like a post-apocalyptic world and Norse myths, but it has enough twists and different situations to keep things interesting. There are some critical choice paths to make throughout, but interactions are never meant to take away from the combat focus.The UI is easy to understand and the battle system and descriptions are clear and well explained. But some things need improvement like: more general graphic and ui options, more keyboard shortcuts, more ways to sort equipment.Some of this just comes from its trappings as a mobile game first but they could definitely help.Edit: In an update the devs added a mini status/buff display, tool tips and more recently improved keybaord shortcuts, steam controller support and possibly controller support on the way. Good job on them improving this!Rebuffing between fights can sometimes be a chore due to certain buffs needing a specific formation to optimize the buff and apply to all party members at once. Edit: In a recent update this problem has be resolved Auto Buff! This basically refreshes all buffs on all party members with one button click, no more repositioning and having to individually cast every buff!Health and Mana management is done mostly through camping at specific sites spread around the dungeons or consumable items (potions, scrolls, etc) There are some skills that can help this along, like a skill that lets you sacrifice mana of one character to refill another's sort of like a mana ""battery."" This system works well for the most part. If you do struggle sometimes its better to go back to the local town or camp to refill your HP and Mana for free instead of consuming a ton of potions. Being conservative and walking back and forth isn't instant and can slow the game's pacing down a lot at times. Something like a town portal or zone teleport for dungeons you have already explored would help with the downtime here. Edit: The devs added a fast movement option which does help with downtime.Raising your statistics and leveling up is handled in a traditional D&D sense where you raise an attribute like strength or constitution, then raise a martial mastery like a weapon or magic skill like blades or conjuration. Then allocate points to improve a specific active skill like ""Crushing Blow,"" ""Healing"" or ""Fireball."" Theses skills often have the trend where as you increase them they get more potent but cost more, so you need to balance it. This isn't too difficult to figure out and you can sit on unspent points if you don't know what to pick, but it is important to not spread your talents too thin and to have a goal or strategy in mind. It takes some critical thinking and planning as it is possible to make a counter intuitive build. Edit:Thankfully the devs updated with a respec option!The music ambiance isn't bad, but it lacks variety and needs more songs added to the score. Sound effects could use more variety also.This area really needs some attention and would help enhance the atmosphere and mood of the game dramatically. Dev updates are currently working on this.In Summary:Overhead Tactical Grid Combat SystemExplore subterranean world in post-apocalyptic environment with fantasy and Norse influence.Traditional RPG stat and level progressionPROThe pull is the simple, fun, challenging combat, and shear amount of content offered, this game is LONG. The difficulties and the various ways combat can play out helps give it even longer legs. The setting and writing are interesting and not drabThe devs are very involved and receptive to the community, the game is always receiving updates and improvementsCONUI can use some more improvement, it still evolving from its mobile game trappingsMusic and sound lacks variety and needs more general optionsMinor tweaks to the the system like addressing escaping combat and fast travel.

												Graphics (3/5):  HoS is one of those games that has an odd dissonance when it comes to graphics.  The tile system used is well-done, and the spell effects are pretty good for this grade of indie RPG.  However, the portraits are fairly crude in comparison.  Given the limitations of an indie dev, I can't really rag on this too much, but it's a little jarring to see nice effects and tilesets while the portraits look like they've been done in photoshop solely with a round brush.  I don't demand mindblowing graphics, but this is just something that I've always found kinda funny with a lot of indie RPGs.Sound (3/5):  I have to admit, when I'm gaming casually I often turn off the sound effects and listen to an audiobook or something instead.  However, what I have heard from HoS is quite pleasing.  The opening theme is decent, the sound effects and ambiance are nice, and overall it's quite acceptable.Interface (1/5):  This is HoS' biggest stumbling block by far.  While HoS may have a compelling story and a decent advancement system, these are overshadowed by the fact that navigating the game is a clunky, inefficient affair.  Two main examples stand out:	First, movement.  On the combat screen one must double-click to move a character.  This is a smart way to do things, preventing the player from making a wrong move due to an accidental misclick.  Yet outside of combat clicking once moves the character, while clicking a second time while the character is in transit cancels the move.  The difference means that right after combat when I've been double-clicking to get around, I must take a few seconds to re-train myself to NOT double-click once I'm heading back to town.  While this sounds like a mild annoyance, consider having to do this after each combat.	It gets worse, however.  Moving across a map is a sluggish affair in any game, and good design means streamlining this as much as possible.  For example, a Run option helps you zip around just a bit quicker.  Tales of Maj'Eyal takes this to a major extreme, where the player zooms around the map faster than the eye can follow.	With HoS however, a player must click a point around 7-8 spaces away, wait while the sprite trots to the spot, then click again to move another 7-8 spaces.  While the lag time between clicks is no more than two seconds, it adds up to a player pressing a button for an instant and being forced to wait, while remembering not to click again if you get impatient as this would halt the character.  In any good game, you want the player to interact as much as possible with the game itself, and in HoS movement is an exercise in absolute tedium as interaction occurs in sporadic instants, with forced waiting in between.	Why not have the movement operate as in, say, Baldur's Gate, and every other game of this like, where a second click moves you to that new position?  Or add WASD functionality that grants the player real-time control of movement?  Even if it's just moving a character, at the very least the player is INTERACTING.	The second major problem is the menu system, which smacks of recycled code.  This is particularly egregious when leveling your character:  each character must click through three independent screens to modify stats, skills, and talents, and each screen only allows three or four options to be displayed at a time.  This organization of the data is crude, as comparison between different items or skills must be done by scrolling up and down, limiting effective side-by-side analysis.	Dialogue uses the same menu system: in one instant the player is on the game map clicking on a store icon, and in the next the entire screen is obscured by dialogue options (again, showing only three or four at a time).  The player is thus dragged back and forth between talking portraits and a full-screen list of options.  Not only does this break game immersion, it's again impossible to think over the options carefully and weigh your choices.	At best the menu interface is just inelegant.  At worst it hinders the player's ability to weigh his choices well.  While the designers had good intentions by wanting to offer a good quantity of information for each choice, the fact that this data forces us to analyze so few options at a time (and in sequence no less) utterly eliminates this minor advantage.  This is by far the worst interface I've seen in an RPG.Story (2/5):  HoS may have decent story going for it, but it unveils this poorly.  The trope of four prisoners banding together to break out is a good starter, but at the same time we are offered very little lore about the world.  I don't know anything about the enemy or the protagonists at the outset, so I feel no awe, trepidation, or empathy in the first few hours of play.	Consider this:  A solid novel grabs the reader and immerses him in its world by the first chapter, hopefully with the first paragraph.  It quickly introduces enough details about the world and the characters within it that the reader gets a good frame of reference to how things work and what the characters are like.  The intro inspires him to keep going.  A game must be able to do the same thing.	We get a bit of solid interaction between the four protagonists in the prison, and hints of their personalities bubble to the surface.  It then takes perhaps half an hour to an hour of play to escape the compound they've been trapped in.  It is at this point that some more character and worldbuilding would be appropriate.	Instead, the characters must slog through a maze of tunnels to reach the first town.  That not only means a LOT of tedious navigation (as mentioned earlier), but it blocks any opportunities for motives, personalities, culture, or history to be revealed.  It's only after a couple more hours of combat that we get some small cutscene where the characters are chatting in an inn and their quirks and goals rise to the surface.	There's definitely a world to explore and people to come to love.  However, there's too long of a fuse and very little payoff that I've seen after four hours of play.Gameplay (2/5):  HoS is moderately fun, past the interface.  The combats are decently scripted, and the system is straightforward.  The four class choices are the standard fantasy tropes of warrior, wizard, cleric, and thief.  These tropes are fine, yet not nearly enough work is invested in making these classes novel or interesting.  Each class has only about ten or so unique talents:  some of which unfortunately make others redundant (giving wizards the ability to unlock doors and disarm traps has ALWAYS robbed thieves of their unique utility).  Frankly, even the high-level talents aren't anything to write home about, and so it's very hard to get excited about leveling up.Overall (2/5):  I decided to review HoS not because I had a particularly good or bad experience.  Rather, I decided to take my time reviewing this because I see genuine potential in the indie dev's work.  Unfortunately, not enough care was given to the logistics of gameplay, the appeal of the setting, or the fun factor of the system.  I bought this game hoping for a tactical RPG experience that would grab me, but was ultimately disappointed with clunky controls, an uninspiring class system, and insufficient development to tell me ""Hey this game promises a great experience.  PLAY ME!""	With so many indie games coming out and so little time in one's life to play them all, a game has to grab a player immediately with the promise that the time investment is worth it, and operate smoothly enough to ensure that this promise is fulfilled quickly.  Unfortunately, HoS does neither of these.  Yet I do wish the Trese Brothers the best, and hope that they learn and grow from this experience.			"

												Around 58 hours I played this and that was before all the great updates and the latest expansion(free expansions). I could have went on playing much more, this game is HUGE> Huge world with many dungeons to explore. much loot to find, many characters to encounter, upgrading system, great world map, towns to explore, skills to try on enemies, interesting story and quests, and much more. I enjoy this game so much and I plan on starting over because so much has been added. Also great developers that will help with anything, so hands on. One of my surprise games for sure, also I found myself getting attached to my team. Knowing them and their backstories really added to the fun.			"

												I applaud the Trese Brothers for their attempt at making a solid turn-based RPG, however, it unfortunately falls pretty short.  This is glaringly a mobile port, without even trying to mask it—there's even sort of ads to purchase the game on iOS and Android.  Usually I don't have an issue with mobile ports, but I think the transition may have perhaps affected the controls.  The responsiveness of the commands is hit or miss, which is what really breaks this game for me.  I won't dog the art style as I saw many people do when this was in Greenlight, because it's much better than I could do.I'm surprised I'm the first negative reviewer, but I'm sure most players received the game for free from a Groupees bundle(as I did) and are just being grateful.  Most of the positive reviewers seem to have less than 30 minutes logged—take that how you will.  I'm glad I didn't pay for this, as $12 about $10 too much.  4/10			"

												A turn-based party RPG from one of the most active Developers on steam. Full respect for the time and effort the Trese brothers put into their games. Personally I ran into a very minor issue with the game, the dev responded instantly and a patch was out the following day. What more could I ask for? That shows a lot of passion and dedication to their product.Constant patches/improvements, always active on the forums and actually talking to their players. The combat system is solid with 8 different characters to choose from to make your party of 4.The story and characters are well written and interesting including their interactions between each other. A range of weapons, armour and other equipment can either be looted or purchased from merchants including the ever necessary consumables.Skill/talent and stat points as you level, and easy respecing.Personally I quite enjoy the art style in the game and zooming in the combat map the character models still look good.I've been having a lot more fun with this game then I expected, it's definitaly worth it's asking price.I'm looking forward to sinking a lot more time into this over the weekend.Trese brothers are ones to watch, truly passionate game creation wizards. This game and Templar Battleforce have won my loyalty. Side note it is really worth checking out Templar Battleforce as well :)			"

												Really nice RPG with a cool story.Lots of fighting, big dungeons, cool premise (society had to go underground). I just completed Act 1 of Episode 1, there are 3 full episodes now, with a 4th coming, each with about 2 Acts. So at 40 hours I am about 1/8th of the way in (admittedly, I like to take my time and left the game running while tending to other stuff quite a lot, but still, plenty of content!).Episodes by the way are all included in the game, it's just their word for chapter, there is no additional DLC/expansion.I like the story and the way the characters talk to each other. The combat is fun.All in all this game has a lot of charm, and for me that's plenty of reason to keep playing. At 10 euros it's a very good deal imo, even if it sometimes feels a bit crude/rough around the edges (just adds to the charm).It comes across as a game created with a lot of love and passion, and it's very well supported by the devs, and that's also a big plus imo.EDIT: Wow, the story really opens up in Act 2 of Episode 1! :D			"

												I would recommend this game to others especially if you enjoy a long story that is well-written and based in the framework of a squad-based tactical game.  The story does have it's moments of cheese, but underneath the artwork and first-time PC dev interface is a game system that's been honed over years in table-top play.Basically from what I can gather on their forums, the devs have been world-building and playing out RPGs for decades and that really shows in the care and balance that goes into building out the game mechanics.  I've played more than a few RPGs that are beautiful visually and have a slick interface, but have zero thought going into skill advancement or how a squad can be built out.The one thing I'd love people to realize about this game is that it's both long and evolving.  You can get a taste through the prologue of the game but the full flavors don't develop until you're well into it.  Also, this game has had 22 updates on Steam as of the writing of this review and there are more in the works.  These are devs that engage with players and are doing it the right way with a small staff.Definitely buy this game if you are looking for a tactical game for the long haul.			"

												I wanted to give you my opinion about the gameplay I encountered so far in Heroes of Steel. The more I play this game, the more I am falling in love with it. Let me start first with telling you a bit about the battlesystem. As a Turn Based RPG fanatic, this battlesystem works great for me. You have 4 partymembers (for example Tank, Rogue, Wizard, Cleric), a turn based combat system with action points (like Jagged Alliance or Divine Divinity Original Sin) and some very enjoyable encounters to overcome. I started playing on hard and I think that's the right way to play this game.There is a good story in this game, all characters in your party have their own 'goal' and I love reading their chats and thoughts. The skillsystem works great, each character has like 10 different skills to upgrade each level up (each skill has 10 levels to improve them) so for replayability that's a good thing, you can make very different party setups at start and through the game with the different skills.The game graphics aren't 3D and it doesnt look like an AAA title but gameplay goes first for me and this game surely delivers in gameplay (specially when you reach the first town, the game really starts). I recommend watch some gameplay videos on youtube or here on Steam to see if it's to your liking or not.Developers keep on bringing new content for free, like new dungeons and weapons. So NO micro transactions for new content, just a free update from steam and it's in your game. Developers are also very active on the forum and will help wherever they can.Now it's time to continue with my game, I hope this was usefull for you.			"

												Now guys let me tell you: This game has more WARHAMMER QUEST feeling to it than even the Warhammer Quest mobile port. It's my opinion, not fact, but I really felt that WQ boardgame flavor when I played, and I can tell you it is a great feeling.How can it be so?It doesn't have random quests and although it seems to possibly have some random loot, Heroes of Steel has a real story to live, not a short theme for a quick mission.I believe it comes from its top view and tactical combat system, but also thanks to the danger the game puts your heroes through. In WQ mobile port, you do not feel the threat. In Heroes of Steel, you do - you feel hunted, you want to survive until the next safe spot, and you'll do your best to get to it.Now let's get deeper into this review. Good points are that:Heroes of Steel surprised me with quality tactical combat, interesting choices and great dialogues! Enough qualities to make you purchase it.Read below to know more about the weak spots in the game, but if you want to enjoy nice boardgame tactical combat, well written dialogues, and a nice ""party roleplaying"" aspect, you may go for it. The dialogues are very well written and make us feel like on a serious tabletop RPG. There are nice reactions between teammaters and we know something more is to discover here. We want to see the next steps. The game also feels like having a great duration to it. I only got to the first town here and there surely are a lot more hours to put into the game.The choices themselves, though sometimes limited between two paths to get through, are interesting enough; the game makes you feel the danger, threats can get really oppressive (I so much wanted to get out of the caverns!) and the camp spots make sure you are always on your guard as you'll always be lacking healing options. In an atmosphere like this, even picking a path is great, especially as taking the dangerous one also triggers nice dialogues (see above :) ) between your characters.As for the tactics, some combats are really tough, but moreover,  the skill and AP system is very well implemented. With each character's progression you have to make some interesting decisions. After playing dozens of roguelikes and RPGs, I feel Heroes of Steel has a very nice system deserving to be at the top 10 of these games.The art and UI were the two elements that really frustrated me at the beginning. The art is original but doesn't always have the ""pro"" touch. 2D indie games need great 2D art (at least a few pics of them) and here this is something that is a bit lacking. Some arts are ""hit or miss"". Still, the game is more than good enough to make you enjoy the rest. It's just an area that could have given me even more pleasure.The UI especially made me uneasy. I wasn't used to it. I left first, but after coming back to the game and going through just a few fights, I began to like it more and now the UI is as good as the rest.I really think the strengths of the game are:- the quality of its writing and dialogue: a very good surprise here,- the quality of its combat system: even though there are sometimes LOTS of fights, it still stands as a very good system.- quality in character progression, I mean that with four characters to upgrade, most games fail here but this one still keeps interesting choices. - and a strong Warhammer Quest boardgame flavor!Heroes of Steel then ends as a very good indie RPG and a game to recommend.

												I've been playing this game for several months on my Kindle Fire.  I'm so glad it's finally on Steam.  The PC version is great because you get the bigger screen, keyboard commands and quick keys, and easy zoom.  The game is otherwise the same as the mobile versions.  This is an enormous game which is not yet complete, and is constantly changing.  I keep telling myself I will play something else but everytime there is a new update (which is very frequent, sometimes 2 per week) I have to try out the changes.  There is one more character to be released, the Dueler, a warrior.  To briefly describe the game: it is a turn based RPG with the standard 4 characters of warrior, cleric, thief and magician.  The tactics part comes as you learn to fight the various monsters in this world and work on building your party with talents that complement and enhance each other.  You can spend months just trying different character builds to see how they work and which characters they work best with.  The replayability is incredible.  Don't think you'll become bored by seeing the same maps over and over.  The updates I mentioned often come with new bosses, new secret doors, new sidequests, new areas . . . as I mentioned before the game is constantly changing.  You can play at several difficulty levels from easy to nightmare (for those gluttons for punishment).  I know that other reviews will tell about the storyline plus you can read the description from the developers, so I won't go into that except to say that it is complex and very interesting.  Heroes of Steel provides you so much value for your money. It is larger than many games I have bought at two or three times the price and will keep you entertained far longer.  This review has gotten too long, I need to go back to the game!If you want to see a tutorial to learn more about gameplay go to:  http://www.indiegameguides.com/Heroes-of-Steel/tutorial "

												It's a really fun game,  and expansive.   They pack a whole lot of interesting story into pretty concise dialogue,  and I'm surprised at how addicting game play is.   For those of you who want an epic, solo RPG where you still get to use your imagination instead of being force-fed every detail,  this is the game for you.    There are so many different types of monsters,  so many different strategies and combinations of how you can put your party together.    It's a very well done and polished game.    I hope they either release an expansion via DLC or create another,  similar game so I can support them to create more cool games like this.  Just like a pen and paper campaign,  it takes time for the story to unfold,   but the world setting is unique and really enjoyable.   Best value for hours played so far for me for any game I've bought on Steam in recent memory.			"

												Wow this little gem blew me away. I've been wanting a turn based strategy game sort of like the old pool of radience game for pc. This is the closest I've found in fun level to that type of game. This game is a blast! the power ups are spaced out nicely. you dont perma-die if you dont want to there is an option to continue (or ressurect which costs as 2 deaths). You really  have to use your four characters skills wisely, you also have the choice of 8 characters at the start. cleric, paladin, fighter, sorcerer, wizard.. ect. I've had a real blast playing this game i dont want to put it down!! Reminds me very much of my favorite TSR games like Pool of Radience, Darksun, Buck Rogers .			"

												So I have played this game for many hours and have mixed feelings about it although I would still recommend it.  Read on.Pros Long gameLots of fightingGreat priceSome of the story is pretty coolDevs improve the game with timeCons:In general, game mechanics are annoying and these annoyances are more and more visible as you play to the point of fustration it seems.  Read on...  You have 4 characters which are hardwired to respond to a certain situationand you have no choice but to click thru their dialog almost 95% of the time.   You have no control as to their decisions or actions.  I wish there was a clickable in game link that describes game mehanics better because otherwise your not certain why certain things do what they do especially in combat.The characters dont level evenly and its undpredictable why some characters advance then lag behind.  I cant tell if its because the character doesnt get the kill shot or what.   You can raise a skill, attribute, or talent but these upgrade with levels in an unpredictable way and its not the same for all characters.Your characters can become weak pretty easily in this game because you have to dump points into one skill to keep up with enemies who always level as fast as you no matter what.  What ends up happening is that youll get new skills to invest in but they start of weak and are SP intensive, and so if you spend points on it (one point at a time max per level), its weak and ineffective.  Now you diverested a precious skill point away from  your main skill which is in essence now weaker, thanks to  monsters progressing as fast as you, no matter what, and their defenses are better but isnt keeping up.  I hate this mechanic.  You can respec only after a long long time assuming you get the crystals along the way.Every single monster seems to be your level +1.  No matter what.  Very bland.  Its seems they level up even when you havent trained when acheiving a new level.  Xp for the vast majority of the game was just as predictable.  You get  XP based on level  of the monster.  So for tough monsters would give the same xp as weak ones, no matter the monster type, always.  Fights are too closely spaced and are repetitive, you feel like you just want to get it over with at times.  Other times your characters hit a story node, get shuffled into the worst position for combat, and are vulnerable from the start.  Remember It doesnt seem like you can actively save.  If you die you can restart the last round of combat or go back to some predetermined story node.  I quit the game because I was forced to repeat a portion of it due to the bad positioning of my party from a story node.  This along with the rest of the mechanics made me had enough.Character gear is strange.  You only have 4 slots and you cant have two of the same.  I can only have one gauntlet, boots, cape and a ring say, but I cant wear a mantle or a necklace then or 4 rings.  Really?  Loot needs to be better distributed.  The fighter especially is dependent on gear.  I went thru at least 10-12 levels without a significant upgrade and he was less and less effective than say the mage.   You go through levels and levels without seeing a shop to upgrade if you can at all, because the characters are very restricted in their weapons.  The fighter for instance cant use any ranged weapon.  The mage can only use a staff.  The cleric just maces.  Need more flexibility.Get rid of locked chests altogether.  You dont need any skill to open chests except that you must have a theif open the chest with his talent which he comes with by default.  Why make me have to selecte a theif, click on his talent, just to open a chest which he can open regardless of his level or skill.  You cant party selelect to open a chest so this is just annoying.  I spent points in lockpicking and it turns out that doesnt help you open chests.  Now I dumped points into a near uselsss skill, and I cant respec the theif,Combat.  When combat starts, it sounds like a wolf growled at you.  Everytime.  When you find a secret same sound, so you think your about to fight.   Lets change this.  Mislead me for a long while.  Then there is the fog of war that come with combat and you cant see beyond 6 or 7 squares.  But the enemy can see YOU and can HIT you even when you dont have a weapon or skill that can reach that far, and you cant see that far.  These are simple humans we are talking about not to mention the monsters.  You cant loot their weapons to even the score after the fight since you never get gear from a fight.  Just gold.  These enemies can also hit you up close or from far away with ranged weapons.  Your characters cant hit anything next to them except for a melee weapon so they have to back off a square.   I wish your enemy counterparts were under the same mechanics as you.			"

												Okay, First look, let's see what we have here.We have.- A low price- Simple graphics- Slightly clunky UIExcept for the low prise let's ignore those for now and see what else we have.- A really good story that keeps to immersed at all times.- Good turn based tactical combat.- Interesting talents/skills.- A massive game that the developers are still adding too.- The promise of a UI revamp to bring it more inline with the PC.- Game play that put's the big boy's in the business to shame.- The developers don't do DLC, they do free updates.Conclusion:  If it has a Trese Brothers label on it, buy it.  They may only be a small affair but the blood of great game makers flow's through their veins, and they are getting better by the day.			"

												Really a great, very, old school feel here. I really enjoy it and its huge! I cant believe how big this game is and they keep coming out with more content. I just got episode 4 and its the best yet. Reminds me of great memories of playing pen and paper rpgs when I was a little kid. I definitely recommend this game.			"

												Heroes of Steel brings back memories from the SSI turn-based games that were released in the 80s.The game has its charm. I like the simple and plain UI and the dialogues are well-written as well as the story. The soundtrack doesn't consist of many tracks, but is atmospheric and fits the theme of the game perfectly.The main issue I have with this game that makes me give it a thumb down, is that I the fights are too repetitive and boring. Hordes of enemies keep attacking everywhere I go and all fights are identical to one another. I've won all battles so far using the same strategy too, there's no variery needed.Around an hour into the game, battles began to be nothing more than an annoying nuisance preventing me from exploring the areas and advancing the story.The second big issue I have is that all areas I've discovered so far, are designed like mazes with enemies protecting each and every crossroad and dead end. It means that you have to spend 10-15 min each time you take a wrong turn to fight off the enemies just to discover it was all for nothing. Bummer. The enemies also never drop any loot, all you get is some exp for your trouble before backtracking the maze o where you came from.			"

												This game is enjoyable to the point where I have a real hard time to quit playing it once I've started, and convincing myself that I need to stop and go to bed is not always easy.Almost 30 hours in and its still fun. I've paid $59 for other games and haven't played them anywhere near as much, and I bought this game for much less than that. It's not on sale when writing this, but even for its regular price I'd recomend people to buy it. The game has a story and it's intriguing, I enjoy the different characters and to top it off, the game itself is addicting. I love finding chests with new loot or potions or simply discovering all of the map. The combat is on normal not too hard and not too easy, perfect for me.			"

												Heroes of Steel RPG there is a reason RPG is part of the games title because that is exactly what it is. A rpg which harkens back to tabletop gaming ala Dungeons And Dragons oozing savory cooking juices of stats, attributes and skills defining each character with very unique traits, strengths and weaknesses. The replay value with Heroes of Steel RPG is endless with the ability to create new parties different from the one you had in your previous group and seeing how they fare against the rules and mechanics of the game world. You can equip many weapons and armors on your characters depending on their class while others are off limits once again dependent on class. Do not fear though whether warrior, archer, cleric, mage you will have a fearsome arsenal to do battle against the blood thirsty merciless villains and disgusting vile repugnent monsters you cross paths with.Magic comes in extremely useful in Heroes of Steel RPG. So if your a lover of magic users you will be very satisfied as you cast combat and defensive buffs upon yourself and your fellow adventurers along with healing to keep your party fighting against overwhelming odds while utterly destroying your malignent murderous foes with offensive spells. Everything is done from a top down view with nicely detailed graphics which give off a very comfortable to the senses board game feel. Though animations are not really there its enough to convey a feeling of magical life as if game pieces had eerily come to life to amuse, befuddle and terrify you as you suddenly feel your mind pulled into all that is going before you.Enemies are pretty menacing and frightening. When encountering an orc for the first time in the early parts of the game i actually found myself intimidated due to the excellent build up through gameplay pacing and the story playing out in descriptive text boxes as enemies spoke. I dont think an orc has ever creeped me out as it has in this rpg and there are plenty of other encounters with different beings and monsters just as unnerving. Combat is turned based yet with a very smooth feel where its like real time. You can take as fast or slow as you want between each turn deciding what is the best strategy. Environment is also very important as it can make a difference in spending your time mainly healing or attacking then going behind safe cover as the enemy play their turn. Its quite a scary moment whenever your party is all of a sudden thrust into combat with dramatic music playing and a sense of life and death as they were discovered sneaking about in stealth mode picking locks and or exploring an area. Yes there are skills for picking locks and being stealthy. Rogues and thieves clap your hands in gleeful greed! Silently of course. Wouldnt want to draw any attention to yourselves now would you.Oh and there will be blood. Plenty of blood. Just make sure its not yours.Audio could be a bit more detailed but it still captures a board game feel due to its simplicity adding to the retro rpg ambience of everything bringing home the tension and relaxing moments. Music is fantastic and me being a lover of 1970s and 80s b-movie i was in music nirvana as i felt that world to explore and discover rush from movie warriors of old such as ATOR THE IRON WARRIOR, DEATH STALKER and CONAN THE BARBARIAN. The user interface is very busy and easy to get into with plenty of areas to check on your parties inventory, skills, equipped items, level up screen, appearance etc. Excellent ui which does not get in the way yet is highly indepth.Heroes of Steel RPG a rich attention grabbing story with excellent high quality combat and gameplay mechanics which any fan of Dungeons And Dragons and other classics such as Warhammer Quest should get their mitts on for a festive battle fest of flying flesh cutting steel and blazing buttocks searing magic!

												RPG GoodnessVery enjoyable RPG from the Trese Brothers.  Similar to Baldur's Gate, etc... Build and lead your team of 4 through a story-driven tale, with combat, big dungeons, towns, side missions, character development.  Upgrade various facets of each team member over time, improve their armor, skills and weapons. Variety of maps, enemies, bosses.  Recent performance and UI improvements, further strengthening of the story and storyline interactions are simply delicious icing on this game.  Every release gets better and better.ValueAfter 80 hours of gameplay, I finished Episode 1 of the game, and there are 4 total so far.  All without DLC.  Gameplay is deeper the longer you play, and there are 4 difficulty levels, and an optional upgrade for 4 additional characters is available.  Replay value is high due to ability to mix and match characters.  Note: I am primarily playing my current game on iPad, so have well over 150 hours total, and I'm nearing completion of episode 3.  The devs are working on expanding episode 4, so there is incredible value in this game.Accessible Developers and CommunityThe developers are very active with this game (all of their games actually), and continually upgrade, improve gameplay, squash bugs based on user feedback and advice.  They have a forum for their games, and the community is mature, helpful.  Questions about strategies? Stuck on a map? Want ideas on team builds/upgrades? Replies from uber-players and the developers come within hours, if not minutes.			"

												All I can say is, ""Wow""!  What a great game!  This is a must-have if you like these types of games.  Heroes of Steel puts the Tactical in tactical turn-based RPGs.  With constant developer support and responsiveness, bugs are non-existent and the gameplay experience keeps getting better and better with more content and constant user-suggested improvements.  Refreshing to say the least.As for the gameplay....outstanding.  I love these types of old school games.  Graphics and soundwise, that's what this feels like.  Almost nostalgic.  However, don't let that fool you, this game is very current and plenty sophisticated in its combat-oriented content.  You truly are the difference in winning and losing battles.  Your positioning, movement, order of attack, buffs, de-buffs, spells, etc...make all the difference in almost every battle.  If you get careless, you get hurt.  If you pay attention, you can still get hurt but you should be able to implement a strategy to win and advance and it's very satisfying.Speaking of advancing, this is one of those games where you just can't wait to level up and get the next Talent/Skill/Attribute point(s).  The building of your characters is probably the coolest and most important part of the game.  Four unique and distinct characters need to be built as a cohesive and synergistic team in order to survive and excel.  Each character has many different ways it can advance and they each can perform multiple functions, BUT (and it's a big but), they need to all work together.  Each has talents that can help the overall team in different ways and each has individual talents to help themselves.  How you choose to use each character is completely up to you but, again, they need to all work together.  Combat is challenging at best and extremely difficult at times so working as a unit is pretty much imperative to long term success.  To that effect, a great feature is the re-spec button.  Each character gets one chance during the game for you to reset his/her entire build to fit what you're trying to do.  This is fantastic since with all of the options you have, you can play through pretty much the entire first episode and learn the game, then figure out what works, what doesn't, what you're missing, what you need, what you didn't use, etc...and fix it without having to start over from the beginning.  Huge plus in my book because Ep 1 can take anywhere from 30-60 hrs by itself.Which leads to content.....lots and lots of content.  It's mostly fighting with just enough story to make it immersive.  The real rewards are the feelings you get for taking down a nasty boss, levelling your characters and getting new talents with which to play, and finding a new piece of gear or a shiny new weapon with all those enhancements....yes!  :-)  4 Episodes with lots of levelling.  Characters can achieve a max of level 65 I believe (I haven't got that far yet so don't quote me but I think I read that in the forums somewhere).  Or you can just spend hours building and re-building new groups and playing through Episode 1, testing and trying out all of the different talents and strategies available to you.  Both are fun.In conclusion, I've played a lot of RPG's in my day and this is one of the best I've ever played.  It seems I'm almost always looking for that game that can keep me up until four in the morning for ""one more turn"".  This is it.  Worth every penny of full price and literally a complete no-brainer if its on sale.  Buy it.  You won't regret it.			"

												Heroes of Steel is a retro, dungeon exploration game, with simple quests, yet challenging adversaries. This is an Android Port game, and I play it on my Samsung S4 regularly. (You’ll notice it doesn’t seem like I’ve played the game on STEAM. That’s because I haven’t. Not really.)If you're a graphics addict, then this is probably not for you. On the other hand, if you can forgo graphics for the joy of story and gameplay, this might just hit the spot.When I first played HoS, it reminded me of a much better version of GURK II: retro, a party of 4, exploration, random monster encounters, loot, turn-based combat on a top-down view.Some details of the game:1.	Party of 4. You can choose alternate classes. (Basic is Warrior/Barbarian, Rogue/Archer, Wizard, Priest)2.	Party is permanent once the character members are chosen.3.	Turn-based combat.4.	Resembles a D&D board game.5.	Characters level up with experience.6.	Characters gain points to buy character stats, character skills, and/or character spells.7.	Character icons ARE NOT static. They actually fidget on the screen (This little detail I love. Adds a lot of realism)8.	Character portraits are static and are obvious amateur art, yet they are VERY detailed.9.	Equipment gives stats/skill bonuses/magic bonuses.10.	Equipment IS character specific. I like that. It adds a little extra hiccup to deal with. Spices things up.11.	Like Gauntlet, the game has Health Potions, Mana Potions and Health+Mana Potions.12.	An EXTREMELY long main quest. I kid you not. You’ll spend MANY HOURS exploring content without finding an end.13.	The game has more than a few side quests to explore. Up to you to do them or not.14.	This game has 4 full episodes and the final episode is finally out. The game is COMPLETE. Thus, there were hours of gameplay before the 4th episode, and now there are more.15.	The game pacing was vastly improved by increasing the general speed the characters travel on the overworld (underworld?) map.16.	Nightmare mode difficulty setting. This is my favorite setting. It’s so dangerous, difficult, and plain challenging that I have to pay attention to everything: from money, to potions consumed, to where I put my stat points.17.	The interface has seen a lot of revamping to streamline it and make it easier to navigate. I, honestly, didn’t like the first version. Now I marvel at the changes that I never considered which improved the game considerably.Now. Added value to the game:1.	EXTREMELY responsive developers. I mean this. The developers answer questions directly and constantly communicate with the clients via their proboards Star Traders forum. These guys are so dedicated to making their games work that they don't stop updating. That's a LOT of value for your $$$.2.	The community is super helpful. I mean this one. It’s like a dream place, never seen anyone flamed or abused.So, Yes I recommend this game.			"

												Short review: I abandoned the recent AAA title ""The Witcher 3"" for this - go figure. Longer review: Don't let appearances (screenshots) fool you: This game is a real gem. It is solid tactical combat at heart, but still also manages to have above par dialogues and an engaging storyline. I like that upgrading your chars' stats and skills  is done in a simple, elegant and no-nonsense kind of way: no overwhelming skill-trees with gazillions of traits, skills, perks etc.  The ""clunky"" interface people talk about in other reviews was recently replaced with an overhauled one that works like a charm - yet the devs are still improving and expanding the game on a regular basis. Btw the devs: These guys are among the best, they are dedicated to their game and really do listen to the fans. I have not yet bought their earlier game ""Templar Battleforce"", but sure will.			"

												Entertaining game,I enjoy games like this because of very limited game time, with family and work priorities being more important.  Very easy to come back to compared to other games where one has to schedule playing time just to really get into the game.Yes it's a port and the interface feels odd at times, but minor gripes really in my opinion.  Plus very easy to play on the Surface when desired.If you like squad based tactical turn based games this should be played.It is somewhat of a low playing game.  Meaning once you select the characters and really get into figuring out a build for them, if you want to start over with a different character/mix of heroes, having to restart from the beginning is just dreadful for me to think of doing having invested so much play time to get to the same spot.  I make this comparison to other games like Shadowrun series, Wasteland 2, Blackguards series, XCom series, Temple of Elemental Evil, Expeditions Conquistador, Legends of Eisenwald.  Each of those games play faster and playing around with builds are more restart friendly, in my opninion.			"

												Seems like a good game so far (about 2 hours in). The artwork is great, and the story is pretty good in an old-school RPG way. Combat is also good, and very similar in style to many tactical combat games. The UI could use some work...in particular, tooltips when hovering the mouse over things like talents would help a lot. The on-screen keyboard when naming your group should clearly go away since PCs have keyboards (unless it thinks I have a Steam/XBox controller?). It would be great if you could sync progress between the PC version and the mobile version (Steam Cloud for Android in the future maybe?). Overall, it's fun if you like tactical combat games and old-school RPGs. The devs are great and very responsive from what I've seen. I'm looking forward to playing more and seeing what the future holds. The devs have a long history of making lots of updates to their Android titles, so I expect this game will get better over time on both Android and PC.			"

												Picked up Heroes of Steel during Xmas sale when it was going for 60% off (that's cheaper than the cost of a movie here and hundreds more hours of entertaining tactical fun) and have had a blast with it so far. Came into this game blind, after seeing that a friend had played it quite a bit during the holiday season and will have to say that it is one of the most memorable turn based experiences I've had. So here's a fervent thank you from me to the developers for making a very engaging turn based tactics game with good depth and options!The basic to-hit system in melee pits rolling multiple sets of dice (attacking dice from points in Accuracy/weaponskill/Str or Dex vs defending dice from points in Parry/Dodge/weaponskill) against each other, with success for each dice being determined by a certain threshold and the overall result of the attack being a hit, if attacking dice had more or equal number of successes compared to defending dice. Unlike some other RPGs, there is no straightforward to-hit percentage with flat increases per attribute upgrades and while not particularly intuitive at first glance, it is an interesting system with considerable nuance. For one there are 2 thresholds, one for strong dice (succeeds on a roll of 6 or more on a D10) and one for standard dice (succeeds on a roll of 8), which mean some attributes like Accuracy on weapons and empowered attacks are quite a bit more valuable on the attack. Similarly while Parry values are not taken into account when facing ranged attacks, they are better than Dodge when going up against melee as all Parry points are strong defensive dice. This system by its nature, also provides diminishing returns on extra points (dice) and may incentivize more balanced attribute levelling at some point. In some ways, a more complex system like this one can be appealing to those willing to spend a little time exploring the mechanics and I for one, welcome it as a fresh change.Damage outcome is also nicely designed in that armor directly soaks a certain amount (half of Armor value) of physical damage, with the other half of its value being a random amount. This results in lighter weapons which cost less AP and have more strikes per turn being strong against unarmored foes but relatively ineffective against heavily armored ones, a good tradeoff.The AP centric battle system, where available movement and actions per round on a grid-based battlefield are dictated by the number of Movement/Action Points is intuitive and enables considerable ease on planning positions/moves. Some opponents have less AP than the party (kiteable foes where ranged attacks and use of choke points are likely to be feasible) and some have equal or more AP than party members (non-kiteable foes where brute force and careful positioning are needed). The accompanying map design/layouts were all well thought out too, with some maps providing suitable choke points and others being a cornered fight or open battlefield requiring more care. In particular, I liked that the 4 party members complement each other well with a good array of different talents (including special strikes, heals, buffs, debuffs and various utility talents). There are various buffs that increase basic attributes (Str), stats (Accuracy) and even movement points. Similarly there is a good mix of debuffs that lower enemy Parry/Dodge and Armor values and even those that strip them of AP. Indeed battlefield efficiency will be dependent on finding a health balance of the above. Sid Meier once said: ""a game is a series of interesting choices"" and indeed the game does present an interesting array of choices in which to approach combat, dependent on one's playstyle, party members and of course talents levels and gear.It is also nice to see that higher level talents (while certainly more potent) also require more SP, thereby making the choice to upgrade, one that actually requires some thought and which is partially dependent on one's playstyle and SP drain gear. Expending too much SP in regular fights can result in more frequent use of consumables, a resource the player may not have when dealing with tougher battles later on, so a careful balance needs to be struck.In terms of the storyline, I like the fact that the characters' background/experiences are neatly woven into the storyline and am eager to see how it will all turn out later on, with gods and all. Would be nice to have a short bio for each character which writes itself as the story progresses (similar to Valkyria Chronicles). The Underdeep is a fascinating place with a good amount of lore and it would be great to have a handy reference to connect the dots more easily. It's good to have various townsfolk discuss the world and its events with the party and some even send the party on side quests, as this lends more color/depth to the tale. I'm hoping future episodes will feature more branching decisions where the party can choose to affect world affairs. The story held my interest all the way throughout Episode 1 and is one of the stronger selling points of the game, besides gameplay of course.Finally I would like to laud the commitment of the devs on listening to feedback (on forums) and on continuously polishing their product after release. Virtually no game is completely bug free upon release and willingness to tweak display and fix minor issues, is a mark of developers who care about the quality of their work. Would once again like to say that I've thoroughly enjoyed Heroes of Steel thus far and hope more turn based enthusiasts will find their way here too and give this game the support that it richly deserves.

												Alright, here we go...It's the first time I write a review here on steam. It does not necessarly means that this is the best game I have played, but it easily belongs to the Top10 and is in my opinion one of the most misunderstood and misconceived games.One think to point out, this game is being continously developed, with devs not only adding content and improving UI, they in fact are very responsive to what players are stating and wanting. This by itself is really great. And if you check, the majority of the negative reviews are quite old, when the game was significantly different to what it is right now.As there are already a couple of great reviews digging deep into game mechanics and stuff, I will rather list what I think is good & bad about the game.The good:- evolving game, and it clearly evolvs in the right direction and for free! (which is unfortunately not true for many games out there)- this game has content, quite some content, ridiculously much content- simplistic visuals let you focus on the core aspect of the game, which is fighting, fighting and again fighting- speaking of fighting, this is where the game excels. The combat is easy to learn but hard to master. That is because fights are always hard, sometimes even crazy (one fight took me like 90mins, while using the entire dungeon to kite and out-position hords of enemys) and group alignment must be carefully thought of (the group has be better than its parts!). At the same time it offers amazing flexibility with you being able to decide who is acting when during a turn of combat and - and this is what happens to be the ""killer"" aspect for me - you can finish the game with an absolutely weird combo specialization. Me personally, I finished the game on normal difficulty without casting a single heal. Instead, my pala was pure damage & buffing, while the socerer, an awesome damage dealer by default, was ""only"" doing crowd control & buffing. While fighting, I made use of any positional advantage a map offered and any received damage was dealed with healing bottles. This sometimes led to crazy situations, but it made winning even more rewarding. And as a funny side note, I earlier saw that I finished with the 3rd highest score on ""normal"" difficulty on my first play through. I note this rather to show you that in this game you can indeed give any member of your group any specialization - they just have to fit together and you have to play according to how you build your group- throughout the game enemies are tough, so at no point the game evolves into a piece of cake. This game achieves what many other games fail, it keeps the level of difficulty throughout the game (of course some boss fights are tougher than normal mobs- the game make you feel that the fighting strategy you use, is really what decides the outcome (like where to position, whom to attack first, using a retreat to lure enemies into a bottleneck where you can take them out one by one....)- there are hundreds of items, which also need to fit to each other in order to maximizing how much your outfit makes you better- no brilliant, but quite engaging story lineThe bad:- as stated, the amount of content is incredible. While this by itself is of course awesome, it also generates a couple of potentially negative effects. First, a casual gamer might be discouraged to start playing a game which can easily take like 150h to finish. Second, at least for me replayability is an issue. Even though I can skip episode, I probably will rather check out other games than putting another 100+ hours into this game- music is monotonus, but I usally listen to music while gaming anyways- this game is difficult, you will die at some point and you will encouter fights where you gonna have to fight for one hour or more in case you start the fight with the wrong tactic (hello necromancer, I mean you guys creating 80+ undead marksman in like 10 rounds of fighting)Anyways, overall this game is a gem in my opinion and if you are looking for game that will test you, that will make you sweat from time to time, but that allows you to build a group the way you want and to engage in incredibly engaging fights, go for it.For me this game is a 9/10			"

												If you're of an age to remember the old SSI AD&D DOS top down games, and you enjoyed them, you will enjoy this game as well. Not to say there aren't other Gamers this would appeal to, but as I play, I keep feeling like it's 1996 again. Included in that nostalgia is the same solid combat, quirky controls, missing featues, and good storyline that you had to deal with 2 decades ago.Pros: A good storyline. So many indie games have horrible dialogue and story. Not the case in Heroes of Steel! Fun and constant combat. For a Turn Based RPG this game plays out more like an Action RPG. There's so much combat. It keeps the game interesting and exciting. Class customization. It's minimal, but provides enough depth to really make your team fit your play style. Epic scale. 8 hours in and I don't feel like I've gotten out of the start of the game! Solid TBS RPG gameplay. It works and it works well. They didn't reinvent the wheel and they didn't have to. Good job!Cons: Music - This is at the top of the con list because ... OMG ... I can't listen to an 8 second loop of the same battle tune non-stop for 8 hours!  Missing game overlays. When you detect traps the game doesn't highlight them. For .6 seconds a message displays telling you, you've detected them. Now go find them! When you select a ranged attack there is no radius to display your strike range. You have to litterally check the range and count the tiles yourself. UI - It's minimal, but perhaps to a fault. You're missing access to some of the games menus and can only reach them via keyboard shortcuts. No Saves. You just advance, no take backs or what ifs. No edge scrolling. Why do I need to use my arrow keys to move my view around?So that's my list! I have to say, I've put more hours into playing Heroes of Steel than I have for many of the main stream Turn Based RPG's out there right now. I think that says something. I really like the simplicity of your group, having 40 different companions with 200 skills each sounds cool, but in practice it over complicates things. Understanding the relationship between weather and elemental attacks, using terrain height, flanking attacks, special power bars, switching between live action and turn based, all these ideas have been designed and work well enough. But there's something appealing to just being able to sit down, play a game, and not have to worry about any of those things. Like I said, this is a game that lives in a world from 2 decades ago. It's simple yet solid. Fun and rewarding. It has a story that doesn't dissapoint (so far at least). I'm looking forward to more games from Trese Brothers!			"

												Why do we read game reviews and why do we write them?I read reviews to zero in on games I like to play. I don’t want to spend hours trying to find one.  Over many years you end up purchasing many games.  The real cost is how much of your free time you spent playing them.  RPG games have been around for decades and remain my first choice.  After so many years it isn’t easy to find an RPG that stands out from the crowd.  Why did I write this review?  Good reviews have saved me allot of time and frustration.  If you share what I value in a great RPG this review can save you some time.December 8th 2013 I have been playing Heroes of Steel almost daily since it was first released.February 2014 Heroes of Steel became available for the PC before greenlighting on Steam and although I run it on multiple devices the PC version is the one I play exclusively unless traveling. April 23rd 2014 Heroes of Steel goes live on Steam.  Why would I use Steam to play when I already own multiple copies?  Simple.  Very fast updates, cloud storage, trading cards, easy access to game documentation  and the Steam community. What’s in the box?  Heroes of Steel is composed of 4 episodes with 2 acts each.  There are four main characters that come with the game.  Outlander, Wizard, Cleric and Thief.  There are 4 IAP characters available which come bundled with the game at no extra charge. They are the Duelist (yet to be released), Paladin, Sorcerer and my favorite the Rogue.  Episode 1 and Episode 2 Act 1 are available to play immediately.  You get the rest of the Episodes at time of release.  You also get “Upgrades for life”.  A Trese Brothers gold standard.  Anytime a new quest, game area, new monsters, rules, graphics enhancements any change or bug fix is absolutely free and will appear on your next Steam update.  In my experience each episode feels long enough to be a standalone game. You may end up running several saved games at the same time, the character abilities and combinations are fascinating and well balanced.How do you play it?  The game is set in the Underdeep driven by a complex story line. You create a party of four to begin your journey into the Underdeep.  Each character has Attributes, Skills and Talents that are leveled as you would expect in an RPG. Heroes of Steel does it with a twist.For a quick but somewhat outdated introduction to gameplay take a look at;  http://www.indiegameguides.com/Heroes-of-Steel/tutorial To play successfully  each character must use their talents to support the team.  It isn’t about choosing one character and using the rest of the team as standby support.  In addition different characters participate in some cutscenes tailor made for their role in the saga . Why am I still playing?  When there are so many games available and so little free time.  The majority of games I’ve played are set in stone, with add ons or sequels for additional purchase. Heroes of Steel reinvents itself on a regular basis.  There have been over a dozen major updated versions with many more tweaks and fixes.  Everytime I think the game is mastered a new aspect is introduced to challenge me to play longer.  From my point of view when completed Heroes of Steel will never become stale and repetitive.  The Trese Brothers imagination and creativity never lets me down and always surprises  Having played RPG games since the 70’s I can honestly say Heroes of Steel is in my top 5.Have fun!.			"

												I downloaded HoS like a month ago, and I can say one sure thing about it. It is ADDICTING.The story so far has been flawless, with excellent storytelling and very clever cinematic-ish resources to drag you in and to immerse yourself in the world and characters. The gameplay itself is great. Everything about it is very well designed. The combat, the characters, their talents ( skills ), and the enemies and their AI. The AI is something remarkable in this game. The progression of the enemy AI combined with your learning curve and character developement makes this game a real challenge. If you play on Easy or Normal you can enjoy the ride and have a great time fighting moderate fights ( in normal  it's still pretty hard in some parts ) , but if you like a good challenge, be sure to play on Brutal or Nightmare. This game will really test your strategy skills.I loooove this game so much. Even more than my beloved xbox vanilla Skyrim. I've never invested soo much free time thinking about builds and stuff. I totally recommend this game, there are so many good things here, for every kind of player.			"

												Heroes of Steel is a fantastic experience to play. I was first introduced to RPG games by the Trese Brothers' mobile offerings, and it's amazing to see how far they've come. The artwork and music makes Heroes of Steel much more exciting, atmospheric and eerie than I had expected, and it far surpasses most full 3D games made by big companies. The talents system is my favourite feature, it’s incredibly intuitive and really lets you get into the game quickly. I also love the key bindings, mouse zoom and detailed artwork that make the game seem natural for the PC. Overall, a game so superb that it keeps me hooked, despite the fact that RPGs aren’t my favourite genre.			"

												For an I-phone port to steam this title plays beautifully and has a unexpected level of tactical depth and over all appeal.This games up to the minute auto save and straight forward game play make it the perfect choice to play during coffee breaks or when you only have 20 minutes to kill before real life demands attention.Of special note is the outstanding customer service of the Trese Brothers, I got a dev response on their forums within 20 minutes of reporting a bug, and that same bug was patched less than 72 hours later.For turn based tactic veterans the game has a nice pick up and play feel, and provides an enjoyable challenge at higher difficulties, and even beginners will find the game easy to learn thanks to the introduction that covers all the important game play elements without being overwhelming.For a light weight turn based dungeon crawler the fun factor is consistent, and it's easy to spend an afternoon exploring the various locations and finding some of the hidden treasures of the underground. (From magic rings to armor sets)Granted the game might not be on the complexity level of Final Fantasy Tactics for depth, but it delivers a solid turn based tactical dungeon crawl that's well worth the price; and is a surprisingly long game for its size. (10+ hours in and I'm still on the first chapter.)Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.			"

												I think Heroes of steel is an excellent game. Totally worth the price. It has great story arcs and good way of delivering the story with only a few dialogues. I have played about 160 hours and still didn't really finish the game. I got as far as the fourth story arc goes and have to wait for the  developers to make new content which is a bummer but the new content is free so that's nice.The only bad thing about this game is somewhat repetitive combat where you have to kill dozens of monsters because the dungeons are BIG. All in all I would give this game 9/10. If the developers finish the game then it will be 10/10 and one of the best games ever.I would recommend this game for those who:-like classic RPG-like turnbased tactical games-like immersing world and story-don't like to read too much			"

												As one can deduct from the title this is a tactical fantasy role-playing game. What you can't deduct is that this game is great. I only played it for a bit and i can guarantee its fun! At the end of the day this is why we play games, isn't it ? Character design looks great, gameplay is solid and the story keeps you wanting more and more. If i wouldn't have to get up at 6 am for work i doubt i would go to sleep. This is the first game from Trese Brothers that i played, though as i understood, this guys have done a great job so far; all of their games are updated and improved constantly, and they are also pretty close with the community. Looking forward to play it more! Review is subject to additions as soon as i'll have some more to share.			"

												I prefer Templar Battleforce from the same team, because mainly of the space-mech-marines theme, but this one is still a solid tactical squad game. Characters are deeper than in TBF, and the story is better. Progression is more like a RPG, linear story driven, whereas TBF is more missions oriented. You also keep all your squad all the time, so they can grow feelings toward eachothers, and you may be more attached to them then to your Templars.Both are very similar in combat, with even som skills in common, and that's the great part about it. You can enjoy their engine and philosophy both in med-fan and sci-fi flavour.If you're not sure, be weak and buy it anyway, to support the team. Even months after release, they support their games with fixes and content, all for free of course, no paid DLC there, and they are very close to the community.			"

												fun game. does not drain lots of resources from my pc. can have other programs running at same time. level ups, point distribution to increase power/usefulness to the rest of the party. i love party-based rpgs with experience progression. not a bad story. figuring out how combat works is quick and developing strategies also easy for experienced turn-based gamers. having fun with it. cons: cannot separate party much. i sent out thief to scout. she had an encounter and the game switched to turn-based mode. the rest of party was far away. it was tedious to move her to safety and bring the rest of the party closer to the enemies when the turn-based system limited everyone's movement based on action points. moral of the story is to use the ability to combine the party into one character when exploring, and, when combat ensues, the rest of the party will automatically appear. when combat is done return to one-character mode and explore some more. grab it if it's on sale.

												I'll recommend this game, but just barely. It has a lot of issues, that I hope will be fixed in the future. I haven't played all that far into it at this point, because it's very slow, and I'm hoping future updates fix the game. Edit: I'd like to say the developer is actively addressing many of the issues to make the game flow faster, and is listening to the players on the forum to streamline the game.1. The game is a port of a android game. A good port, but the controls are clunky and you'll find yourself clicking 2-3 times for something that should be one click. Add that up over thousands of times, and it slows the game down.2. Combat is slow. I'm hoping for an option to speed the game up at some point.3. Loot seems to be random, but it doesn't seem rewarding so far. You can go into a big battle that takes you 30 minutes and your team barely scrapes by, make it to the chests and find out you got nothing but potions and junk. I can't explain how frustrating it is to not have at least one good reward after opening 2-3 chests.4. Dialogue is clunky as well. The screen changes, then it goes into a series of text boxes, and if you want to talk to someone, you have to click on them again, then go back to the dialogue menu again. 5. Basic things like sound and music are either on or off. These are *loud*. I play with both off, because I don't want to have to adjust my volue out of game every time I play, then adjust again when I'm done. There are just many basic things that you can't do, like remap keys, adjust volume, etc. These difficulties show the android app port limitations.All in all, it's a good game though. If you are a fan of turn based, party-based games, you will most likely enjoy it.  As the developer works on player suggestions, it will only get better in the near future.			"

												Heroes of steel is a good strategy rpg that has some flaws, but is still well done. The combat can be slow at times, and the game can be punishing if your build isn't done well. There are also some areas that I feel are a little too long, and take a while to get though. That being said, the pros outweigh the cons. The story is nice, the characters are interesting, and although they do fall in the hero’s trope they aren't over-heroic to a fault. The skill system is well done, with a lot of ways to build characters and the devs do a great job of making sure to fix bad skills to make almost everything viable (as well as listening to many of the other updates suggested by users). Definitely worth a look if you are a tactical/strategy rpg fan. "

It is very similar to Avernum in the sense that it takes place underground.  It does have a few rough edges, like no help in the user interface, and a few minor bugs, like after completeing the temple and exiting the characters say they found a temple and want to enter.

												I want to recommend the game - it's well-put-together, has a nice balance of challenge, and starts off well - but the pacing just drags. By level 10 (of 45 or more?) you may be fighting as many as eighteen enemies at once, each with three attacks, each having its own animation and sound effect, so taking more than half a minute between your turns to watch the same three animations over and over again - and then you explore half a screen and slowly wade through another dozen enemies, then another half-screen or screen and another long encounter where both sides are chipping away slowly at the other.I don't know whether or not it was intentional, but with the default party around level 10 you have one character who's near-invlunerable - let him get surounded by enemies and get beat on for three or four turns, then remember to have your priest cast a heal - and three who are glass cannons. So there's a pretty dreary similarity to the hours you spend slaughtering ratkin: put the fighter out front, everybody  else a few squares back, concentrate fire as you will. Maneuver madly and heal like crazy if you're ambushed, which is a common setpiece but wasn't responsible for either of the two deaths I suffered. "

												One of the best tactical RPGs in recent years. The game has it faults - UI that was clearly designed for touch interface, simplified character progression with no choices each level... but on the other hand does a lot of things right. First of all - most turn-based RPGs these days use initiative system, these means characters (yours and enemy) move in terms of speed) this means a lot is going on and differentiates between e.g. fast rogue and slow knight. This game uses a more traditional strategy system instead - you move all of your character in any order you like, then the enemy, this makes the fights a lot more tactical and like a real wargame, you think of the whole team and not just one character.The fights are interesting, the writing is suprisingly good, all in all I can recommend this game to all fans of turn-based combat!

												I backed this on kickstarter and it is a solid game. The Trese Brothers have excellent customer service and has been very pleasant to communicate with. With that being said, I had a lot more fun playing it on my android phone than I did on the PC. It reminded me a lot about the turn-based RPGs I played while growing up. The setting actually is somewhat reminiscent of Dark Sun: Shattered Lands. Obviously being a mobile port, it is not as feature heavy. I think this is a great title for those that are new to turn-based RPGs to enter into the genre. IMO buyers considering this game should grab the android version off the Google Store instead (or both to support the devs!)			"

												For the record, Heroes of Steel is on android too, and I have countless hours logged there as well. I've been playing, watching, enjoying, and learning about Trese Brothers games for well over 2 years. I list all four of those because they are all a part of the Trese Brothers experience. Everything they do is open and engaging. They don't just make games, they make beautiful communities of players, artists and writers on their forums. With great respect to the old days, when a game was more substance and less flair, the Trese Brothers deliver a certain standard of quality in all of their releases that I find has been lacking by many standards. This isn't just ""An Indie Game"". Heroes of Steel is the first in a soon to be much larger collection of games crafted by developers with the same standards as the gamers, who hold themselves to a higher level of scrutiny than ""How much many did we bring in?""Once you've downloaded and installed Heroes of Steel, you will find a high quality, complete game worth every penny you spent, so you may be surprised when you start seeing new characters and large content additions continuouly throughout the games lifespan. Certainly, you'll be ready to purchase their new games once those become their project and the support ends for He... WHAT? what are you talking about? They keep supporting ALL of their projects. SOMEHOW (the amount of sleep they get is undetermined. probably because they're too busy making better games to measure it). I fully and strongly encourage you to get on board with both Trese Brothers' Heroes of Steel and the Trese Brothers community. Don't settle for low-quality games that get by on pretty explosions anymore! And also, grab the two pack. show a friend. spread the word. Thats how we'll keep these wonderful gentleman churning out more games!			"

												Wow... Where do I begain, this is such an awesome game & an incredible experience. The Keymap was a nice addition showing you what keys on the keyboard you'll use. I also like that it can be a mouse only game, so I can play it on the computer that's hooked to the tv and then sit back on the couch with a wireless mouse and play it from there. I started an all new group, I've added Selen the Rogue & Fyona the Paladin (I've not played these characters yet on my Android game) along with one of my favorites Vincent the Sorcerer (played him a lot in my Android version) and of course Vraes the Outlander (from the default group). This game is highly entertaining and lots of fun. I also really like the fact that the right side of the screen was changed so it will scale to your screen size and allow you to see more talents at one time. Later in the game this will be very helpful. The Android version is locked a 3 talents but on my PC I get 6 of them displaying at once. To sum it all up, I love playing this game I have lots of fun and enjoy it a lot and that's the most important part in the end ! That I'm enjoying what I'm playing !!!! Highly Recommend !!Update: I have been using what is now my favorate group; Kincaid instead of Vraes (who I dearly loved) but Kincaid is sooo awesome and I love the throwing knives that he can use. So its Kincaid, Vincent, Fyona, Selen. This makes for a fantastic group for me, they fit together so well and can cover each other. I'm almost completely thru Episode 2 again and some area's where I had trouble getting thru before was much easier this time. I use Kincaid as my Main Tank, his job is Death & Destruction and being a Shield too if needed. He is my main point man. He has a 1-Handed Sword & the Throwing  Knives, Not everyone likes the knives but I love them and think they make a great secondary weapon, they are excellent for finishing off Monsters when you get them to 10 point left and run out of AP; knives have a range of 3 so you can kill off a Monster that next to a team mate without waitting until the next turn and giving the monster an extra turn to damage or kill you. I love knives as aweapon and enjoy using them as my second weapon but I've read on the forums that someone was using knives as the Main weapon for Kincaid.. Pretty Cool Idea. Fyona is my 2nd Tank and can stand toe-to-toe with Kincaid or if needed While Kincaid battles at the Front, Fyona can battle at the Rear. Fyona is also the Healer for the group using Blessed Aura, she uses Battlefield Devotion later on to get rid of curses which is helpful in Episode 2. Fyona uses a 1-Handed Hammer & a Shield to do her damage with. So both Kincaid & Fyona are Melee fighters. While Vincent & Selen are Ranged fighters to began with but as you move deeper in to the game they need to be able to do some Melee fighting too. Next is my buddy Vincent who is a Ranged fighter who uses Lightning Spear as his Main weapon which allows multiple targets to be hit each turn. He can also weaken & slow down enemies. This Vincent uses a Staff as his second weapon which he uses during Melee battle. He kills off what he can before they reach Kincaid & Fyona or as the Melee fighters battle the first line Vincent & Selen kill off any reenforcements. Last but not least is Selen, my thief, who's Main weapon is a Bow and she can be very deadly with it, using Pinning Shot she can also hit multiple targets, her second weapon is a light blade. She can also reveal the surrounding area so you can see whats coming or where you want to go. She has the useful thief skills of lock picking & trap disarming. So as I head to the end of Episode 2, and looking forward to the just released Episode 3.. I still Very Highly Recommend this incredibly deep and fascinating game with a interesting storyline that I enjoy watching unfold. The Most Important thing is the countless hours I've spent ENJOYING this remarkable game. Afterall that's why I play games... for the enjoyment of them !!!			"

												This is a fun tactical RPG with a intersting story and a good selection of core characters.  The AI is chalanging and forces you to use the terrain to control access to your more fragile characters.The support by the developers adding extras and tweeks is excelent too.Well worth the price to play.

												""They know. Trust me in this one small thing Guardsman. They know.""I stated in a previous review of mine (Templar Battleforce, check it out, fantastic game) the I prefer to write reviews AFTER a certain time played (e.g. 20 something hours onwards), and yet I find myself, once again it seems, in the curious position of breaking said rule. Both times the games in question were developed and produced by Trese Brothers, guess that says something about their games : )Heroes of Steel has that certain ... something about it. That charm, that spark that sucks you into its world, its gaping, gloomy, caveronous world.The art fits the style (strange confusing sentance, I know) and has a rather charming qaulity to it (in particular Kincaid the Dueler, Tamlin the Thief and a certin Magus who I stole the above quote from), the music is once again truly epic and the combat is difficult enough to elicit moans and shouts but fair enough as to not result in a broken computer, i.e perfect. As other reviewers have stated there is a slight clunkiness when it comes to the UI (which personally has its own charm).The only negetive point I can think of is actually in my Templar Battleforce review too:An attack MUST target a foe. If you were to try to hurl your Lightning spear Into an unoccupied square in the middle of four enemies the game will instead ask if you want to move your Character there. Or If you were to target an Ally (there are actally situations were that could be advantageous), it will merely swap control over to that Character.It really is only a minor complaint though, and in no way affected enjoyment of the game.This is a fantastic Title and the developers deserve every measure of success.Also, check out Templar Battleforce :) You won't regret it.

												An engaging party based tactics rpg with decent story and game play and plenty of character build strategies. The Trese brothers support for their games and community is longstanding and ongoing. Even their unprofitable games get bug fixes 5+ years in, everything else gets new features and some graphics updates to boot. This is my favorite game of theirs even though Templar Battleforce is their current state of the art until Star Traders 2 comes out. For me the game has proven intellectually demanding enough, while staying perfectly enjoyable, to improve the clarity of my thinking which has been impaired by chronic illness, a very positive thing indeed for me.The world: A fallen mix of civilizations forced underground by ""The shattering"" with fallen ""gods"" and races such as Orcin, Trolls and Ratkin as well as humans of course. Some lore is given at loading screens, the rest is through the played out story.Playable characters: A set of four: Warrior, Mystic, Healer and Sneak. There are currently 2 choices for each class: Warrior: Vraes the outlander/barbarian who can use any melee weapon and shields, or Kincaid the dueler who uses swords and/or throwing knives.Mystic: Kjartan the wizard, a long ranged fire damage caster and ranged curser who's terrible at melee and super squishy, or Vincent the Sorcerer with a spell sword with long range curses, medium range lightning attacks and/or single target or AoE melee skills.Healer: Kyera the cleric, with ranged attack and cursing or melee, or Fyona the Paladin a tough melee and short ranged curser. Both can heal your party between campsites and inns.Sneak: Tamilin the thief with throwing knives with powerful short range curse or high damage potential bow, or Selen the rogue, with excellent melee and defense talents or effective ranged cursing via her bow. Both can disarm traps, pick locks and gain a surprise round through stealth if they lead the party.The art: Honestly it started off as pretty mediocre, even bad, but the artist, Andrew Trese has hugely improved his skill and has been slowly introducing updated graphics particularly for the main characters. the latest portraits have nearly reached a photorealistic effect, but the animations are still mostly serviceable. The effects graphics are pretty good though.Play time: 80+ hours in four major story segments with pretty good replayability.The good: plenty of time to engage in the story and develop tactics.The bad: Not for those interested in a short journey.The Trese brothers tend to put a lot of variables in the background mechanics to give your chances of success a lot a variations. They've gotten better about documenting these things over the years, but if you don't want to learn a fair number of hidden systems then you may either want to stay away from their games, stick with their newer games with nearly full libraries (Templar Battleforce onward), or stick to easy strategy guides set up by themselves and their player base on Steam and/or their forum etc. I'll give a couple key tips for Heroes of Steel at the end of this review. If you lose a character in battle you may retry the turn for one death on your party death counter, or restore to the previous rest point for the cost or 2 deaths on the counter.Some tips:A common complaint about the game from the start has to do with managing your spirit points, sp for short, which is how all but basic attacks are used in game. The two brothers that make the game have done a LOT to improve that experience, the two primary ways being more campsites to restore hp and sp, and sp drain gear which gains sp back for your character based on the damage you do to enemies. If you're not interested in the meta strategy and game of managing your sp, then note: character buffs expire faster on higher difficulties due to increasing fixed turn cost of ending combat, and so you'll use sp faster - It's worth playing on easy 'til you start to get the hang of it. So that way it's less a concern needing to gain sp drain gear or returning to known camp sites for restoring hp/sp. You can also rearrange party order now! A much wanted QoL and positioning strategy improvement.The 3 essentials: Defense (D or def.), Accuracy (acc) and Damage (dmg). You're pretty much never going to beat a combat in a single round, so you need enough hp/soak and/or avoidance skills/gear to survive at least one round of combat - In this game avoiding hits by reducing enemy action points (ap for short), reducing enemy acc, staying out of enemy range and/or buffing your parties dodge/parry tends to be most efficient, but high character hp and armor plus dmg cursing enemies and healing your party works too- high hp and avoidance/soak are needed for the hardest hitting enemies. Accuracy: if you can't hit something you'll never win, buff acc and/or curse enemy dodge and parry. Damage: If you can't kill something because it's armor is too high or it heals too fast you won't win battles - If you use low damage attacks/weapons then you'll need to curse enemies armor and/or resistance (resist is armor vs magical damage). All damage has a physical component, but there are four elemental magical damages that the mystic's spells or certain items do, and some enemies have those to harm your characters with as well, especially later in the game. Finally there's holy damage your party can do to enemies via some healer attack talents and items any party member can use, or conversely, enemies can do unholy damage to you.As a general rule character buffs and cursing enemies is more sp efficient in the long run than sp costly attacks, but that varies somewhat with attack type and its cost and what your party and characters need to help improve their effect in combat.Range: Not essential, but highly useful, particularly for keeping vulnerable characters safe, so having ranged support buff/heals, enemy curses or attacks is recommended until you get pretty experienced. An all melee team also practically limits some of your character choices.Area of Effect (AoE): Again, not essential, but it really makes a lot of battles go faster where there are enemies which spawn other enemies or any fight where enemies tend to cluster.Empowered attacks: Usually only raise one after leveling other wanted buffs and curses so long as the essential are met for best use of your limited talent points - there may be exceptions, experiment if you want ;)...Note: pick locks doesn't ever need to go above level one.There's way more expert advice on their forums...

												I got this game because I am a great fan of the developers' latest game, Templar Battleforce.I have to say that the developers continue to amaze me-They are super responsive and very open to suggestions and constructive criticism.My two main issues with this game, repetitive music and slow movement and animation speed,will be improved upon very soon, maybe even by the end of this week.And they promise to continue to update and improve the game, and add more content over time.This alone should be reason to support these developers.But, you also get a great little game.Do not judge the game by the, admittedly, bland screenshots.The game has a surprisingly deep tactical game play and an interesting story that sucks you in and makes you want to go on just to find out what comes next. If you can get over the basic graphics and artwork, and you enjoy turn- based tactics with a nice fantasy story, look no further and get this game. And make sure to let the developers know if you have any suggestions for improvements and more content- because you might just see them implemented next. "

												I personally play RPGs for strategy, story, and characters and this one has all three! The animation isn't bad (especially if you zoom in) and there's a wide variety of customization for skill-sets to create your preferred team. It's not an easy game: tons of enemies that attack very quickly oftentimes, but it's nifty to see the party banter and to weigh risk and reward.			"

												This is a solid tactical RPG that I have had pretty much since release. It has old school graphics and turn based party combat. One of the most impressive things about it is how the developers have supported it. Since it came out they have released consistent regular updates, upgrading the game, fixing bugs and adding whole new chapters to the story. For your $10 you are getting a lot of bang for your buck and a game that is consistently getting more content and more polish.			"

												Nice and well-done fantasy game. The gameplay revolves around turn-by-turn tactical combat at the squad level (i.e. an adventurers team against groups of monsters/enemies), it is based on a square-grid. It involves magic (buffs, area spells, individual spells), missiles, projectiles and contact weapons like swords and axes. The graphics are functional and not much more. The story is adequate without being mind blowing. The world is well-done without being extremely original nor leaving you a large liberty (the area to explore at each stage of the story is not very large).What shines is a solid turn-by-turn tactical combat, simple, interesting, though not too challenging. The combat reminds me of ""Avernum: escape from the pit"" (but Heroes of Steel doesn't have the complex world building and large open world featured by Avernum, and Heroes is less challenging than Avernum).The game is built in the same way than the other game from the same studio : Templar Battleforce. Templar Battleforce is a game centered on Sci-fi Mech-warriors fighting an alien invasion, Heroes of Steel is centered on fantasy adventurers fighting a monster invasion (and other somber projects from evil characters). The mechanic are similar. I recommend both games.Though not the most memorable or outstanding game you'll ever find, these games can very well sate your thirst for a grid-based turn-by-turn tactics for a few hours of good fun (and will put you to a moderate challenge and will make you think hard on a few occasions). Recommended for fans of turn-by-turn tactics.			"

This game is a superb fantasy tactical RPG. It has a lot of character and still continues to get updates regularly. Do not let the graphics fool you into believeing it is a subpar game. You need to play it to really find the beauty in its design and story. The UI might take a little getting used to and for me it was too, but having the hot keys actually makes this an easier experience on PC over the original Android versions. You will not be disappointed by giving this game (or any of the Trese Brothers games) a try. You need to experience them to believe. They also have superb forums and communicate with their fans daily. Oh and be sure to try out the Iron man Ladders.			"

												First, a small admission. I'm a huge Trese Brothers fan. I've logged tons and tons of hours on this game, but it's all on my phone so I'll review the phone game here, and later when I get around to finishing my ongoing games on the phone and play on steam I'll try to update this.Anyways, this is definitely one of the old school style of games. What exactly does that mean? Well, it's pretty unforgiving, and at the higher difficulties it's pretty much impossible not to die. If you do, no big deal though! You can always replay your last turn or restore to the last resting point you used.What do you get for your $12? Well, as of May 16th, 2014 you get 7 characters (2 variants of rogue, mage, and cleric and a single varient of a fighter) as well as 2 ""episodes"" of content. What is coming down the pipeline? 1 extra variant of the fighter class as well as 2 more episodes of content. What exactly does all that mean? Each character has a totally different skill set, strengths, and strategies. For example, the two rogues play wildly different; one specializes in her bow and ranged battle while the other specializes in melee destruction. The two clerics are even more different, with one being a traditional support cleric and the other being a much more combat oriented paladin styled cleric. Each episode is made up of 2 main chapters, which are both long and challenging. I'll talk about the first episode so you can get an idea what I'm talking about. The first chapter of episode one sees you protecting a town from a Ratkin infestation and is a good solid 3-5 hours long. The second chapter of episode one finds your party undertaking a risky journey to a second village and running through a nest of lizard-men. This one lasts another 3-5 hours long. That means you can roughly expect the full 4 episodes (when they come) to last for about 12-15 hours for a single play through, and you'll want to do more than a single play through!Now, I'm sure people will knock the game for being a port of a mobile game, but that's really not a big deal. The brothers built the game with the idea of eventually bringing it to the PC, and there are keyboard hotkeys. Not only that, but the entire game can very easily be played with the mouse. The graphics are nothing special in the realm of PC games, but if you are looking for a really fun, deep tactical RPG then you really can't go wrong with this game. On top of everything I've already covered you need to know about the Trese Brother's work ethic. They have 5 games (currently) out for Android/iPhone, and are getting ready to release a 6th. They've updated those 5 games a total of 642 times, each time is either tweaking the game in some way, adding content, or both. They are amazingly receptive to their players, if you head over to their forums (or post in the community group here) they are more than happy to chat with you and will take anything you say into consideration. I've been a Trese Brother follower for 2+ years, and have seen them passionately work on their games the entire time.			"

												I enjoy this game quite a bit, even if I have not gotten very far yet. It seems to have a solid storyline with enough going on in the background to keep me curious.I have a few irritations with it, but they're just that, irritations. One is how it seems like moving everyone separately is the default formation. I don't like having to go out of my way to regroup everyone.Another is the fog of war, it's generally fine but I've notice that when it comes to the diagnol space right after a corner, you have to be in the corner space to reveal it. Not a game breaking issue, and I know that I'm a bit obsessive compulsive when it comes to clearing away the fog of war, but it bothers me anyways.Lastly, the distance sight ability of the rogue/thief feels a bit wonky when it comes to the color coded squares. Not sure how to fix that, if at all.edit: Played it for a while now and have a better grasp of the mechanics involved. In some ways the game is more forgiving than I realized, in others... not so much. Unless you know exactly what you are doing when it comes to the combat system, expect to die sooner or later. Otherwise, when it comes to blessings/buffs and curses/debuffs, they are your friend and will make combat easier. I learned that the hard way. Otherwise, Talents trump everything, so look through characters and understand what they are capable of before you start leveling them up along a given path.			"

												Insane value.Heroes of Steel, and this team's other effort, Templar Battleforce, are grid- and turn-based, tactical party RPGs. In Heroes of Steel, you select a party of four from one of two classes out of your standard four pen and paper archetypes: fighter, mage, cleric and rogue; then you're off on a surprisingly well-written adventure.Your characters have individual personalities and interact with each other in thoughtful ways throughout the game's very, very, very many scenarios, which essentially consist of large grid maps, the objective of which is to navigate, avoid traps, kill the baddies and reach the exit. The game is largely mouse-based, and you can swap between any character at any time, even stopping their turns during combat to use another character. Combat is similar to the original Fallout series where each character has seven 'advantage points', or AP, allowing them to move and perform actions. Rogues can peek around corners (in a matter of speaking), clerics can heal, mages throw lightning bolts, and pretty much every character can buff themselves in some way, consuming SP from a fairly large individual pool.You level up at camp sites, free recovery points that allow you to increase your attributes, skills and learn new abilities. There's some room for character customization, but from what I've seen characters will all stay within their archetypal niche -- a warrior can't learn to pick locks, for instance.It all sounds fairly rote, and the moderately primitive top-down 2D graphics will potentially drive some people away (and is, to be honest, the reason why I have not picked it up until now, despite looking far better in action) but I am sorely regretting that decision -- Heroes of Steel is a well-written, solid dungeon romp with an absurd amount of content. A dungeon map will occupy your time for at least an hour per, and there's over 100 dungeon maps in Heroes of Steel, providing a mind-boggling amount of gameplay.Don't be fooled by the $10 pricetag for this indie gem, it's well worth it.Pros:+Interesting scenario writing+Fun, intuitive combat+Solid RPG mechanics+Good music+Very, very lengthy campaign+Good value for the priceCons:-Somewhat archaic (or ""indie"") graphical design-Interface takes a brief period to get used toAll in all, I can't really think of that many negatives. For fans of turn- or party-based RPGs, especially fans of Spiderweb-style games, don't do yourself a disservice and miss out on this one.			"

Glad to see it on Pc but the mobile version is just as good check em out.  Cyberknights and star Traders are awesome as well.			"

												Heroes of Steel is the result of a KickStarter campaign by the Trese Brothers, who have been doing this kind of massive RPGs in Android devices for several years now. All their experience and ability came through to produce an excellent squad-based turn-based fantasy RPG, and it's a delight to be able to play it on a Mac laptop as well, since that's my main gaming device for longer games. I had played the majority of the campaign on my mobile devices, but on a desktop it does feel a more authentic experience, from the old days of playing these games on a desktop, on a big screen, with a mouse and keyboard. From my brief play session after getting this version, it seems to be flawlessly translated from my playthroughs on my iPad and Android devices, so I'm looking forward to having some more play time here.Now, some things do stand out as needing improvement for playing on a computer vs on a tablet/phone, namely the fact that there are no scrollbars on scrollable lists, meaning that you scroll by dragging the items like if you were swiping a finger on the screen; hovering the mouse over specific talents or icons should show a caption about what they mean; and I wasn't able to find a list for all the keyboard shortcuts in the game, but certainly for such a game you would benefit a lot by having extensive use of keyboard for the majority of the actions and talents. I know there are some shortcuts, but I missed a few in the tutorial and then wasn't able to find a reference or exhaustive list. Still, these are minor UI things that can certainly be ironed out, and I trust that they will. Overall, it's a good - and still evolving - story, fun and engaging gameplay, and if you do not come into it expecting a Baldur's Gate - or even Avadon-like - kind of game, but come with an open mind to experience an indie RPG, you might find a real gem here.Looking forward to coming chapters!

												Just getting started playing this on my Mac -- I've been playing on my iPad since Episode 1. Game is definitely faster with keyboard shortcuts and I really enjoy hearing the music from real speakers instead of the iPad internal ones.The artwork has a hand-drawn almost comic book style which some people may not like, but personally I don't mind it. A game doesn't have to have perfect graphics if the mechanics, balance and pacing are good -- and for me, this game hits all three of those.Each of the four character slots has two options, each with different styles. I purchased all of the add-ons for my iPad and was VERY happy to see they were all automatically included and available on Steam. The replayability of the game comes from two things for me -- the different character builds (the Barbarian can be a Tank or a carry, depending on how you build him) and the plot options.The first time I played through the game, I didn't realize how many of the choices would have impacts in later episodes. Think carefully about which side you want to support, if you support the warlord's rebellion, and which family is telling the truth.My advice would be to build your fighting characters around one or two major talents, and focus on raising them to at least level 5. For Vraes I think his Savage Strike is better than Crushing Bash. If you use the archer, make sure you raise Aimed Shot and the ""critical hit"" buff.			"

												SummaryTry this if you like turn based RPG tactical games with meaningful decisions in how you develop your squad and it comes complete with a nice story set in an interesting world. Support from the developers is fantastic. ReviewA very good game! I backed the Kickstarter campaign to make this game and I'm really satisfied by this result. Heroes of Steel is a Turn based tactical RPG game. You lead a group of four characters who are wrongfully imprisoned through and escape and further adventures.The characters have a delicate and well thought out balance, You get to choose how they upgrade their skills. Higher level skills are more expensive to use, so again, there is some balance to how far you want to upgrade a single skill. This leads to many meaningful and hard decisions.AI is nothing special yet in the first part, but I'm told it starts to employ different tactics soon in the second part, making it much harder to shield certain characters from physical harm. Replayability is  high: you can retry it with different builds for the same characters, or swap out some characters for other builds. Aside from the gameplay in isolation, the storyline is also fun. The characters all have a different personality to them and the story is solid. The background story is there if you look for it, with snippets of flavour text in loading screens and hints in the game world. I think it's important in any RPG to have a good sense of the world around you and Heroes of Steel succeeds in this regard. Graphics are nothing special in terms of PC gaming, but they're crisp, functional and do help set the atmosphere. Furthermore, the Trese Brothers are extremely responsive to any questions, problems or suggestions you might have. They really engage in conversations to exchange ideas and try to see things from other people's perspective. It's incredible given that it's really just the two brothers making this happen and shows how well they really care about their customers and their products.			"

												Sadly I can't recommend this amongst the other fantasy RPGs available on PC, turn based or not.It is very obviously a port of a mobile game, and suffers for it at every turn.  The interface is horrible, both in aesthetic and usability.  Simply levelling up your attributes presents you with a scrollable list of massive text - something that could easily be on one screen.  It's full of this kind of thing.  The entire levelling process could be on one screen, but it's split into three for touch screens.Animation is basic to say the least, and the art style looks amatuerish as harsh as that sounds.  Environments are blurry when zoomed in.Barely any usability options that are expected of a PC game, including custom hotkeys that don't seem to support Shift key modifiers.  No gamepad support.You are limited to four premade characters with what looked like a small amount of talents (not sure if more unlock later).There is a massive lack of feedback for the player.  You've no idea if your characters are buffed for example without diving into their character status (which of course takes up the whole screen), and even then it won't list what buffs are on them -- just the affects of the buffs.  Maybe I am wrong about this -- I hope I just missed it. There is no combat log, so you're just left to guess what is going on unless you want to inspect and memorise each enemy's stats and yours and do the math in your head.  There is not even a basic % hit chance indicator when mousing over things.  Abilities that have a ranged component give no indication of that range that I could see, leaving you to constantly count tiles.  This lack of feedback and polish is everywhere.It might be good as a mobile game, but there is just nothing compelling about it in the PC space.  Combine that with the poor usability and you get a dud IMO.Their follow up game, Templar Battleforce, is FAR better.  Some of the usability concerns remain, but it's generally much slicker and has a much more unique theme  and structure which carried it through for me.  The theme in Heroes of Steel seems as generic as it gets.Note - I only played 90 minutes or so, just couldn't stand the shortfalls any longer to play more.  I hope the devs focus on PC sensibilities a lot more for their next PC release.			"

												Update, 7/17/2014I'm appending my review. Still not sure it's a $10 game, but it's getting closer. $7 and under it is worth buying if you like your oldschool fantasy tacticals. It'll easily amuse you, and amuse you in relatively small chunks if needed. It also has minimal overhead to get you going in the game. So, here's my updated review:At long last, I've taken some time to play some more, from the top. I'm really happy that you adtressed some of my primary concerns. Namely, while there are a number of battles, they're shorter and to the point. You kill the enemies fast, and if you're careless, they kill you fast. The cost for failure is rolling back a turn and a permanent increment on your death count (or more than a turn if you were REALLY careless). The item management is more sensible with default filtering, and I appreciated the shop-by-character mode in the shops that also showed your old weapon. I'm not sure if the chest loot is random, but it seemed a bit less annoying this time, as I didn't just get a ton of daggers like the first time.I'm still not crazy about the art style, but it is a style. I'd like to see more change in expression in the stills to highlight tone and communciate a bit more naturally. Not overused, but as a way to underline in a few more places... I also see that you've already taken a crack at this in your July release, so I should take a look to see what's new, as this may already be adressed.The story pacing is not unreasonable, though there are a number of tropes. I'm curious enough to play through and see where it goes a bit further.The side-quests were mostly clear, but I had to look to make sure I wasn't missing them.  I'm not sure there's a ready solution for this, and maybe one would have to be deliberately careless to avoid this... I don't know how enemies scale, but if you weren't leveling early by compelting everything, I'd be worried how quickly you'd get flattened.Is there a speed movement for when you scroll out and are running across a basically already explored map?I think the skill-tree might need some balancing. I'm not sure energy-cost to advantage is good. If in later towns you allow re-spec with a chunk of gold, that might not be a bad way to adress this, but variety for balance is something I'd consider. I might also suggest secondary attributes affecting abillities to spread usage, so range or aoe on heal by another stat, amount of damage on spells by another stat. Force the player to min-max less, or at least give options.For buildings that you can enter, double clicking on them should make you walk up to the entrance and also go in. If you can't go inside and talk to somebody, it should do nothing. Right now, I think you need to be at the entrance, then double-click to go in, and I think this makes it easy to overlook talking to people.I also have my notes that I took during my second playthrough for minor ""bugs"" and other thoughts:*When leveling my thief, in the talents section, when I would cancel a skillup, it would not let me scroll back to the top of the list, always missing Aimed Shot. I would just go back and then into talents and it would work again, but I could repeat it by selecting a talent to train and then cancelling once more.*Just before Kern's Stair in the ""dark tunnel"" with the spiders, some of the squares don't seem to illuminate properly unelss you step on them, and even then there are some walls that are still black squares.*On rare occasions I have not noticed that I'm walking alone instead of in a glom and a battle will start. I find most of my time quite far away. This just sucks up time.*The sums for the accuracy and defence should be given on the Accuracy and Defense section of the stats. All I want is a quick glance and I have to do the math now.*In the nordhil troll quest, it didn't seem like the troll was regenerating*""Stealth gives a chance of Surprise, even when I am leading the group."" implies a penalty to surprise when the rogue is leading, or at least suggests that the rogue's surprise bonus is applied just as well when not leading... clarifying this would help********This game is not good. It's slow, meandering and frustrating. It's not ""old-school hardcore"", it's just unbalanced and kind of bad. the art is weak, the music is monotanous and the gameplay has nothing new.Every few steps there will be a new battle. Every once in a while, you can skill up your characters with the levels you've gained since the last campfire. You gradually pick up items that uniformly upgrade your four canned characters in a systematic and even way, but most of it is still junk. Screenshots indicate ""towns"" and you get gold, so I assume eventually you can sell things. However, there is no inventory management till then, so you constantly have an unwieldy pile of crap to scroll through. Note that it doesn't even filter out items that can't be used by the current character, so it's just a pain.A lot of pain seems to have gone into making this a device for a tablet or touch screen. That may make it one of the most suitable RPGs for a tablet, since other ones may be all but unplayable, but it does not make it actually a good or useable game.I can't believe I paid $10-11 for this.

												I think the main thing holding back this game is the slow pace of combat and the enormous overabundance of it.  By the time I got done with the first major boss I was so burnt out that the next fight caused me to immediately just shut off the game and never play it again.  Plus (spoilers) the story treats the player like an utter moron.  I swear to god they must have said 'These Ratkin are behaving with greater intelligence and organization than they should be,' or variations of this statement twenty times before we FINALLY got to the reason why.  Just avoid this game.  It's really not worth it, not even on sale.  You'll waste your time and your money.			"

												I really tried to like this game. I have played a lot of RPGs and if they've tactical turn-based combat, chances are I enjoy them. Not so this... PIECE OF CRAP. There really is no other word for it.At first, you may think it's a typical RPG, you have 4 characters, they have the usual stats like strength, dexterity etc.But then you realize... the game doesn't explain anything. Is Parry +3 good? How does strength affect the tohit chance? How does Dodge +1 help exactly in combat? You get a bunch of stats, but the game does not explain the rules for combat AT ALL.You won't know why you don't hit enemy even you think you optimized your character by maximizing the supposedly relevant stats (weapon skill + str for example). You won't know why the enemies ALWAYS hit you, what armor does exactly, how your Tohit % is. Everything remains obscure and a wild guessing game.So, if you have some time, try to play Tetris blindfolded. Same principle, but a lot more fun and rewarding. "

												This is not a bad game... But it really too long for its own good. It overstays its welcome to the point where you begin experience mild irritation with the amount of combat, which continues to grow until continuing to play causes your brain pain. 100 hours in, and I barely reached 3rd episode of 4 planned. And I give up, this game is no fun any longer, and everyting that made it tolerable (it was never truly great) evaporated long ago in the sea of grinding, boring battles where you face pretty much the same group of enemies over and over and over again.This is not helped by sudden and unexplainable jumps in the difficulty. For some reason, my party was just bad at battling Orcin. The part of an episode where I mostly faced those creatures was a litany of reloads. Then, Orcin ended and undead began, and lo and behold, my combats went MUCH smoother, without me doing anything. Spirits in astral temple? No problem! But then the game went back to Orcin, and once again my character begin to die every turn. My characters miss the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Orcin constantly, and deal very little damage, The damned green pseudo-orcs, on the other hand, deliver heaps of damage, despite being 5-6 levels lower than my characters.That being said, the game had its moments. Some battles very quite fun, and bosses were relatively inventive, and not just a piles of walking HP. Character development also was OK for the first episode, but grew stale in ep.2 and completely uininteresting in the 3rd one.All in all, this would be a good game, if it contained just one episode. In its current form, and I can't help feeling frustrated by it, and give it a tnumb down. If you have more patience than me - go ahead, try it (fair notice: I managed to grind my way through the main storyline of Disgaea; this game is WORSE).			"

												The Trese Brothers make beautiful hidden gems like this game and Templar Battleforce. This is a bit more traditional yet modern Fantasy RPG. The UI is lovely, being able to contract your party into one person and boom, ready to fight? split!There are 8 character classes in total with their own personalities that move the story along. But what I care about is the gameplay, which is nice and simple. It reminds me of Spiderweb games, but with the devleopers own twist. If you're looking for a classic topdown RPG with some modernity to it, you can't go wrong with this game. :)			"

												As classic RPGs go, this one is great. It offers fun, turnbased combat and along with three alternate classes it adds a certain amount of replayability. I've only gotten a little bit into the game in the android version, but I have no doubt that the rest of the game is as well made as this one. For more trese brothers, check out Star Traders/Cyberknights RPG on android and iOS. (Note, I spend tons more time now on the game, but on android and I still stand by my initial review)			"

												Admittedly, so far I've only played the bare minimum of Heroes of Steel on Steam to be able to write a review on Steam.  I have, however, played many, many hours on Android, and even written a review of the Android prologue version of the game (see link below for more in-depth information on the mobile version).  What I can tell you without a doubt is that you, Steam purchaser, will get a deep, lengthy, interesting tactical RPG.  Several differences between this and the mobile version - Steam includes all of the DLC/IAP from the mobile game.  As of the launch date (4/23/2014), that includes just over half of the entire story, and two of the four expansion characters.  By buying HoS on Steam, you will get the remaining two chapters and the remaining two characters once they are released.  I can also assure you that the developers will continue to support and improve this game, almost constantly.  I've played all of their games on Android, and it's amazing how frequently they update with new content and improvements.  Give this game a try, you will not be disappointed.  I can't wait to dive in on PC!http://techaeris.com/2013/12/02/heroes_of_steel_review_tactical/ "

												Facing the darkness and gasping for air, the foul stench of Orcin filth filling his lungs..the Outlander stood grasping his blade. Captain Lukai's blade..a symbol of forgiveness..redemption. Vraes wielded that blade with the precision and power of a mountain lion. Back and forth slowly he moved it, as if inviting the darkness to attack. The din of battle below had all but died as they moved higher into the keep, revenge was now on Vraes's mind. Sweat trickling down his brow, smeared away quickly with a filthy forearm greased from many battles.Called back to by the click of Selen's dagger hilts he became aware..the shadows burst forth toward Vraes carrying that overpowering smell of filth. The Outlander sprang forward instinctively rumbling over the dead swiftly to meet his newest foes. Selen shadowed behind him almost seeming more to glide than to run, eyes darting hither and fro, blades following swiftly behind. An Orcin elite trying to flank Kjartan..fell dead before a grimly smiling Selen. Crackling flames burst forth from the cloaked wizard, brows peering forward..leaving a trail of acrid smoke past Selen, two of the Baron's archers collapsed with a crunch.All draws quiet for a moment. Blue radiance burst forth lighting the dark room once more. Vraes grimaces, ""I don't know that I'll ever get used to those blue fingers weaving and binding my flesh together again. The gods verily move among us, Kyera.""A brief excerpt in the tales of four unlikely heroes...Read more: http://startradersrpg.proboards.com/thread/6944/#ixzz3JO7fCAZX "

												Way too much filler battles that ultimately made the game boring.  Skill trees are simplistic so you'll likely to repeat the same action again and again. The entire ACT 1 should have been 1/3 shorter since the last 1/3 basically has you battling the same hordes of enemies for no purpose but to drag the game on for another hour or so. Seriously, the grind was so bad by the time I finished ACT 1, I was so sick of the combat I quit the game 30min into ACT 2 because you can see the same filler game design peeking over the horizon.

YouTube™ Video: REVIEW: Heroes of Steel: Tactics RPG 

			Views: 3,961		

			I got my hands on a brand new Steam release called Heroes of Steel. This is the outcome of my experience with it. Please bare in mind that a review is alway partly subjective even though the creator...		

As for the textual review (for those who don't have time to watch a short vid :): Pros+ Nice graphics + Interesting and deeply looking lore+ Good amount of skills/abilities/attributes to fiddle with+ Turn-based combat in which is important what heroes you use and how you use themCons- Seems like an unfinished mobile port- Animations tend to be wobbly- Soundtrack is VERY repetitive- Game seems repetitive (2 hours into the game, only caves)- I would personally greet more character customization options- resolution cannot be changed (27"" full hd monitor is a suffering for this in some parts, especially the UI)- weird keyboard shortcuts and mobile-controls leftoversBased on these you can make a quick picture. I probably would not recommend this game to a friend AS OF RIGHT NOW but I do BELIVE THAT the GAME CAN GET BETTER! And we will see, after all, it's an early release and things might change! :)Hope I helped with decisions,Playintosh out!			"

												i give this game a 3/10. its very basic on all fronts, except story is ok. its very easy unless you have never played a video game before and even then i doubt it would be hard. ai is terrible, most fights are me standing still waiting for the ai to attack me. when they do its generally 1 at a time (85% of the time). only the leaders are hard to hit and they dont do enough damage to worry about, just upgrade your cleric's heal and dont use the cleric for anything else and you win. so combat pretty dumb, unless u decide to charge in, you cant lose. also they have resting areas that heal you fully, so leave get in a fight, just go rest and since there is no chance of having enemies respawn or randomly attack you, you know you are safe and heal to full again, rinse repeat.Moving on the map is slow and bothersome at best. there is no map(except a world map, that you never need to use), so you cant tell where u have been. also u cant move the screen around either, unless you cast the rogues sight spell. this alone makes the game almost unplayable to me, takes a while to get around and even the way you forward is slow and dumb. also there is group walking or solo movement, not sure why thats really in the game. just another annoying thing you click on to move as a group.had to turn the sound off, everytime you see an enemy(well you never see an enemy they are almost always just out of sight), it makes a loud dog barking sound, no matter what kind of guys you fight and imo its really annoying. music is ok i guess.the game also makes a big deal about the rogue and her stealth/lock picking. never had a lock i couldnt pick yet, granted i wasnt the farest into the game. also she has a slight spell you can cast and its suppose to aleart if there is an enemy or a trap. problem is i havent once seen it be red. the problem is it shows you a big area, but the color is only based on the square u cast it on, so if you cast it right next to an enemy horde, oh yeah its blue guess its safe to go there. so far its only good to spot traps( well kind of, you can kind of tell where traps are). but even if you a trap, then you know the area has traps and you are going to look for traps... never had traps hit me in combat either.so in summary:The whole mechanics of this game are just off, slugish at best, and the ai is a push over, and the sounds are annoying and not needed. this does feel like a game for my phone. read all the like reviews and i have no idea what most of them are talking about, this game feels like its from the 90's and not in a good old school way.

												Very very very basic. If you have nothing else to do, this is a nice little RPG, but steam has soooo many other titles that are prettier and may offer more. If there were greater ability to: Choose Dialog, effect how your character looked, use different solutions to problems... or if the loot system had more depth... That said, I keep telling myself maybe I'll come back to this. Will I?			"

												""Normal"" difficultyHeroes of Steel: Tactics RPG is a tactical role-playing game that feels slow and later tedious,... with a few updates to the HUD, mana issues (IMO) and combat, the game could be great.Early on you get a good impression that the game has a lot to offer, but soon after the battles become overwhelming and slow-paced, instead of quick, fun and tactically challenging. Early in the game you get a pretty good amount of consumables to help you survive, but when the enemies start coming in 5s, even 10s, you'll be very close to death (for example, 1 minion can hit 3x40, while your healer can heal 32 hp at a time).The mana is used up way too fast because you have to keep on healing your characters. The health potions and mana potions heal/restore around 50-100 points of HP/MP, but when every character is using mana in order to look out for traps, heal characters, use buffs, debuffs etc. the potions get used up very quickly when you can't get enough of them from chests.Edit: I just can't continue right now. Im out of mana on all characters after fighting all the monsters... I can't find more and I'm stuck fighting without having any abilities. I can't possibly beat these 10 spiders with what I have at the end, even if only my tank was taking damage from the enemies and my ranged characters had some mana left.I did get pretty far (to the spider area after 2 road blocks, killing everything including 4 giant rats before them) thanks to the potions I found, but now I'm stuck after fighting all the monsters.. as if they had to be skipped in order to save potions. I'm tired of restoring characters in order to get further. I'm done with the game.I did try but.. I can't recommend the game right now.			"

												It's not a RPG for many RPG players, but those that like a lot turn based RPG focused on combats and indie game should check it.That mentioned, I can't recommend it from a general point of view because the user interface is unacceptable, there's close to zero adaption to PC interface tools, ie bigger screen and mouse, even the keyboard is poorly used.Some example of how wrong is the user interface:- The mouse right click isn't used at all, so there's many elements badly managed when similar PC RPG since many many time manage them well.- Characters states is a very important element of the gameplay and to check them for one character and go back to play screen you need 5 mouse clicks, yes five! As there's 4 characters it can lead you to 20 clicks just to check states of the party.- Many more, but I'll skip.I still played the episode 1 and a part of episode 2, so for fans, it's a real burden, but you can get used to it, more or less. If you can go over this problem and don't mind support a very bad port from mobile, it has plus and negative.The first point is the amount of contents is quite big, and there's a lot of work behind. There's undoubtedly depth in combats and party build. There's many areas quite cool. The writing is solid but not noteworthy ie pleasant to read but no originality and no depth.But as you go deeper in the game, problems cumulate:- Too many combats, and it feels more and more repetitive as you progress in the game, that's why I gave up during episode 2.- Enemies diversity is too low, during episode 1 the feeling of repetition is growing, but episode 2 aggravates the problem.- There's many mechanisms flawed that burden the play, boring instant death, bad design of stealth gameplay, ton of walk back to rest becoming more and more tedious, boring heavy random elements that could trigger unpleasant instant death.- The combat system design is flawed because you can just retreat a bit and camp to kill enemies one per one. At first you go over it, but the more you play the more this design flaw becomes frustrating, each time you try a more interesting approach and get bashed by the game.- There's good areas but also few bad, and a significant amount quite average, and as you play more, the average areas become more and more tedious to play.Still, I repeat it my introduction, I don't recommend it in general, but players very fans of indie RPG with turn based combats should check this game. The game could worth it for turn based RPG fans that can go over a very bad user interface because of a very bad port from mobile.			"

												I've only played this game for a short while yet it's already abundantly clear how little has been done to improve this game from its mobile roots. First, there are no changeable settings, apart from toggling sound, music, and blood on and off. Saving is done automatically. Frustratingly, you cannot use arrow keys to navigate menus and even capitalizing requires you to push a ""shift"" key rather than use your keyboard's shift and caps lock keys. If you want to perform an action, you have to first click it to select it, then click it again to find out what it actually does and its AP and casting costs, then click back and on your target to actually use it. Perhaps after a while you'll have memorized that information, but for a new player it is very tedious. There are so many reminders that this is a port of a mobile game that it makes a game that's not very fun to start with pretty much a chore to actually play.			"
