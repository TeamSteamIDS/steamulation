												My approach to reviewing this game is going to be at odds with its whimsy. After all, this is an action-RPG about saving the land of Shmoop from an evil chicken. I probably shouldn't take it so seriously. While I appreciate what Forge Quest is going for, I don't think it does enough to establish itself as either a fun adventure or a challenging game.As the hero-in-training, you'll brave the depths of four dungeons, contend with a handful of bosses, and craft superior gear. As far as the genre goes, Forge Quest offers plenty of diversity, with strong mechanics to back it up. At the start, you're given the choice between numerous classes. However, like Dark Souls, this is mostly just for starting out. As you gain levels, you can put skill points into fighter, thief, and mage classes. Your identity is not limited, because with enough experience you could become the mightiest arch-mage ninja warlord in Shmoop. The combat falls somewhere in-between Diablo and The Legend of Zelda. Naturally you'll want the strongest gear, so you can crush your enemy in numbers. However, you'll also have to consider weapons that suit your style of play. A sword is suitable for most situations, but you might appreciate the strength of a great sword. The bow is the trademark of any good adventurer, but throwing knives are so much faster. Each weapon behaves differently, and has their own special technique when the attack button is held down. Essentially, you have to do more than just click on enemies to kill them. Numerous spells and weapon-skills round out your offensive options. My only complaint is that the mechanics aren't sufficiently tight. Enemies can and will hurt you even if it doesn't look like their attacks actually touch. You'll adapt to it in time. Unlike most action-RPGs, the strongest gear is crafted, not acquired via monster piñatas and luck. Numerous weapons and armor are dropped when enemies are destroyed, but most of it is junk. By taking all this garbage to the forge, you can craft something powerful. All loot has its own level. Every piece can be strengthened up to 10 levels past their current. Equipment can also be slotted to hold ability-boosting runes. It's a very well-done system, too well-done really. While this likely won't be a major issue in the first play-through, crafting will lead to the player becoming overpowered. Allow me to explain just how quickly crafting can get out of control. Stats are decided through exponential increases. Early on, you'll only get a few HP when you level up. Eventually this number goes to the 10s, the 100s, the 1000s, and beyond. Enemy stats rise in much the same manner. As long as you keep your gear updated, you'll hardly notice a difference no matter what difficulty you're on. The numbers are massive, but actually change very little. To really shatter the balance, you can pile on the runes and max out particular skills. I'm at the fourth dungeon of my Hard-difficulty play-through. My twin-axes have a DPS of 150,000+. I don't doubt that there are other players at the same point with even stronger weapons. It's absolute overkill and renders much of the replay-value moot. There's no real difficulty to a game, when bosses can be defeated in a couple hits.Now I won't claim that this experience will be the same for every adventurer, but once you get a basic grasp of the crafting system, you will become overpowered. You could limit yourself by not crafting. However, this means you'll have to rely entirely on drops and your grasp of combat techniques. This is a worrying situation to consider, because the difference between 10 or even 5 levels of gear can be dramatic. The developer could always patch the game and make crafting less useful. This is an idea I'm torn on.You may remember a game for the Xbox 360 called Kingdom Under Fire: Circle of Doom. Like Forge Quest, it's an action-rpg with an overpowered crafting element. In that game, there were orange potions you could find. Basically, they worked as a multiplier when crafted to a weapon or armor. Most players just stocked up on these potions, and were able to turn their starter gear into something powerful enough to kill the final boss in one hit. It got to a point where nobody really knew how crafting was supposed to work. Eventually the orange potions were patched/nerfed severely, and everyone either gave up or stuck to the previous version. This is an extreme scenario, but I think it's worth mentioning. Balancing is an especially delicate aspect of Action-RPGs. You can't simply fix what was broken, or you risk making the game less fun. Difficulty has to expand outward by bringing in new challenges. Harder play-throughs shouldn't only result in stronger monsters. Give these creatures new abilities, throw in some new foes, and change things around when appropriate. Even if I ignore the game-breaking crafting, it's difficult to muster an appreciation for the dungeons. Seeing as how they're randomized, it's important to include numerous ideas, so that every floor has something new to discover. Instead, repetition sets in far too quickly. The situations tend to be basic. There is a room, sometimes it is filled with enemies, maybe there's a block-pushing puzzle, or it could hold traps and treasure. I won't ask for innovation, but some variety would have done wonders. This might be a symptom of the locales, which are all too familiar to RPG fans. Instead of four large dungeons, I would have preferred to see eight smaller ones. It'd be nice to explore a robot factory, a haunted cathedral, or even a castle in the sky.Multiplayer is available, although I think it'd benefit new players more than veterans. Teaming up to take on a deadly foe loses much of its appeal, when said foe is no match for even one hero. I didn't have any luck getting an online game started. One day I'll have to sit down and figure out port-forwarding.With its charming voxel-graphics and light-hearted story, Forge Quest is sure to offer a pleasing first impression. However, it lacks the crucial elements that make for a highly-replayable action-RPG.

Early Access Review
								This game is amazing with a high potential to become an awesome game for a very low price. Yes it is early access and they are still working on it, there is no release date for a final version. The developer care so much and are always present in the forums and help if you mention problems or bugs and solve them in no time. When I bought it, I had my first play through and after this I could start on a higher difficulty with the same character. I had my second play through and got the invitation to play the pre-release of the new version. Now, with the latest update, they over thought everything they made before, changed all dungeons and now on my third play through I have the feeling to play a brand new game!You start with your character and your sword in a small village. You talk with some people and choose to become a hero, start with the tutorial and your first dungeon in which you have to solve puzzles, avoid mean traps and fight monster mops, mini bosses and the final boss at each level. Don’t forget to collect the loot, weapons, boots, gloves, shields, helmets, gold to prove you always have the best one attached. Combine the runes you find, put them into the sockets to make your weapons and armor much more powerful.  With the gold you purchase better weapons, potions and (if you like to) dresses and funny hats (you will do this later, when you have more gold as you need). Also you can buy pets, which are powerful helper in the dungeons. Some can do hard attacks, other spit fire, stun enemies or just take all the agro so you have a free hand to cast spells.Spells? Of course you earn experience points with every kill you make and every new level you reach gives you one point to spent for spells and perks. If you spent enough points for one class  you can choose your subclass with even better abilities. Feel free to spent points for Warrior and Mage, this can be a good combination and depends on your style you’ll play. You really should get this game if you like dungeons, puzzles, monster mobs and tough bosses. It’s really worth its money! Get it for your friend as well to play it in multiplayer!+ Random beautiful designed dungeons+ Good Puzzles+ Tough enemies and bosses+ Plenty of loot + Customization with dresses+ Contains chickens+ Multiplayer with up to 4 players- Often way too much loot so your inventory is full and you have to discard or sell them- Puzzles too easy "

												I really like this game, I beat it on normal difficulty in about 18 hours.What is great is after you beat the game it unlocks  Intermediate, Hard, Expert, and Master. When you beat the game on a particular difficulty, you have the option to keep your levels and gear. The story and dungeons will reset to higher levels and harder enemies. I found the game very fun and challenging. It is cute and silly, but also serious and rather deep at other points in the story. I love the dungeons and the enemies, each dungeon seems to get better as you go. I found that playing this I really felt like the hero going through a fun and interesting story.Pros-fun enemies and dungeons        Fun story        Cute graphics and music        Interesting fun spells and weapons        Having a house and storage in town, plus many workbenches and mechants around.Cons-Bosses could sometimes be harder        I wish it was longer even if there is harder difficulties to play through "

								My initial thought about this game was that it looked strikingly similiar to the game ""Cube World."" Upon playing it, however, I learned that the two games are in fact very different. This is a game for RPG lovers who are up for a fun challenge. There are lots of things to do, and I find myself constantly hoping for new gear with which to upgrade my current gear. Is this a fun game? Oh, absolutely. Are it's bugs game breaking? Not in the slightest. At least, none that I've come across *knocks on wood* I only wish that armor equiped shows up on your character.			"

								I enjoyed playing this game immensely and I still do because it's just fun to keep on playing. Due to the fact that it's still in development the storyline isn't much still but it's still fun to just play and go around hacking and slashing, exploring, and looting what there is to loot. I will say that it's extremely fun to play if you have a friend to play with (Not that it isn't fun to play by yourself) whether you're actually playing through the game to finish the story or to just goof around and have a fun time. I recommend this game to anyone that has an interest in dungeon crawlers or voxel games and that just like to play games with action and/or adventure in them.			"

												This is an epic lil gem of a game! Bought the 4 pack on sale and the wife and i fell in love. Easy to join and find friends, great ways to customize your toon, through wardrobe items, gear (socket/rune) system that can be customized any way ya want through the forge, can multi class, has specialty class's. Good combat once ya get used to the controls, w/ a dodge block system. Good music, the art is well done for a voxel game, and the humor is great. Worth every penny. P.S it is an early access game so you will find a few bugs, but i have to say its more polished than some releases ive seen. Thought i would also add a cpl helpful things. First your toon can be saved and loaded to any game. Second its random gen. maps so each play through is new.			"

Early Access Review
								First, I would like to say that this is a wonderful game. Being in the state that it is now I feel this game is what cube world should of been. The classic voxel graphics, the amazing soundtracks, the dynamic sound effects,and the way the gameplay and skill builds feel. This game is in early access so it has a lot of work to be done on it,but the queston is, is it worth it for the stage that it is in right now? I would say yes. This game does not feel like an over reapeated era of gaming, it feels new and imporve and not a voxel game reapeat. There are 9 classes to pick from you can link different build together to make other unique class builds so no class build is alike,and it also features in the game a sandbox mode where you can modify quests. So if you're a sandbox building type of gamer forge quest is also for you. With that being said this game is, and I reapeat this game is not a minecraft or cube world rip off! It has it's own feel and unique features.The boss fights are also very unique, they all have speical entrances when they appear.Bosses also have unique spiecal abililtes and boss stages to make the boss fights feel more in depth and bring a more intense fast paced rpg combat feel.Also, I would like to note that in this game which alot of other games lack in is a companion fighting systems. In forge quest you can have a companion to fight with you like dogs, baby dragons,lizzard,and etc. note right now you can only obtain the dog as a pet, but later on other pets will be able to obtain. I also would like to note the maps, and dungeon depth is great , but could be change a bit like being able to see your friends on map and to be able to enlarge the map or world map in a dungeon. But, like i said its a early access game so you have to paitent. In all i'm very happy with this purchase, and can't wait until this game is released. so what are you waiting for? Go pick up forge quest today you wont regert it!			"

								This game is great. Although there are bugs and crashes for some people, the devs are more than willing to help. But, there are only two of them, so you've got to tough it out for a day or two after posting something on the forums because they already have enough to work on, so give them a little slack.     The different classes that your character can get make this game entertaining for mutliplayer. Although I haven't played multiplayer much, the puzzles and enemies can give early players an adequate challenge.    I'm the kind of person that either over plays a game or doesn't play much at all. This is a game I've been able to play for hours on end because of the randomly generated dungeons and enticing storyline. Every time I go through the game, the storyline is still refreshing. The new pet system has made the game better too, with all of the potential this game has, I'd highly recommend getting it now or keeping a very watchful eye on it. Happy gaming!			"

								Love this game. 9 hours in and just can't stop. Beaten the first difficulty and loved every second of it. Great story. I was fascinated, I laughed and even nearly cried in the end. This game has a high replay-ability due to the random generated world, (as far as I read) no Hero level cap und lots of loot, many skills and cool abilities. Story: 9  / 10 - had to take a point .. wish the story was a bit longerGameplay: 9 / 10 - just one word .. loot! lots of it!Interface: 7 / 10  - it's okay, but a faster way to sell items (like CTRL+Mouseclick on the item) would have been nice. The Menu is not really pretty, but it works. Sound: 8 / 10 - a bit awkward that fire traps have the same sound as spike traps ... should have taken the soundfile from the flame turret.Music:  -   can't really tell .. have the music muted in 90% of the games due to haveing my own music running.My conclusion:Absolutely worth the money. I can recommend this to every RPG fan that focuses on playstyle instead of graphics.			"

												Pretty dissapointed, and confused as to why the review here are so positive. I bought this game with a friend to enjoy a simple dungeon crawler, but it really failed to meet my already low expectations. Here are a few of the problems I found with this game:Too easy. Probably the biggest issue was that it was never a challenge once you get a couple levels up. Bigger issue is that it dosnt seem to be balanced for multiplater at all, so the same amount of MOBS split between two people makes it twice as easy.Not enough divercity. In each dungeon there is 3 or 4 enemy types that you will kill over and over. There all the same brain dead ""move to player and attack"" AI, nothing really changes the game up to much. I've seen worse mob assortment, but in a game where all you do is grind, it becomes really tiresome.Equipment has the same issues as well, theres a few different types of armor and weapon, but you'll stick to one and use it and it's hight stat varients for basically the entire game.The dungeon puzzles are all the same drawn out push rocks around ala pokemon and do nothing other than pad the games play time.Over all this game was a very boring and stale experience. Only play it if you've never really played a dungeon crawler before and your tastes are pretty simple, and even then it's not really worth the $17 price tag.			"

												Pros:* Interesting and fun dialog that doesn't take itself too seriously* Voxel based models, so you can modify any models you want* Fun combat* Lots of lootCons:* Only one interesting boss fight in normal playthrough (the 1st boss fight)* Could use a better UI for managing inventory. Inventory size is 500, and you have to handle each item individually. For example, allow selection of all items of a specific rarity, either for selling or merging into other items at the workbench. That would greatly reduce how long I spend in town. * No destruction of terrain, despite being a voxel based game. (Whats the point of making everything out of tiny blocks if they're not going to change? I.e. get destroyed by me and/or big monsters)* Limited spec options** 6 proper class trees and 3 general archetype trees** Shallow spec trees. most only have 6 abilities, 3 levels each. * Normal mode, which is required before any other difficulty, is a joke that will nearly put you to sleep if you've ever played any other video games* Buggy:** Issues running ForgeQuest without windows 7 compatibility on Windows 10** Issues using steam to take screenshots (screenshots are simply green blobs)** Issues using steam to stream the game (same as screenshots, green screensreen)** Game crashes when 2nd player of a coop game joins from the tutorial dungeonOverall, I recommend the game on the caveat that you can get it working! There are some improvements that could be done, but it's still worth the $15 for a play through or five.			"

												This game is a great deal of fun if you like the voxel art style and Diablo-like play. Just so there's no confusion, though.. it looks a bit like Minecraft but that's just a stylistic choice. There's no in-game building.Probably my favorite part is the loot system. All loot is meaningful (except for maybe potions, but that's a personal choice that I don't use them very often). This is because you're constantly upgrading your gear by combining unwanted pieces of gear with the stuff you want to use, leveling it as you go. There's also a huge variety of runes you can socket into your gear for better stats.I'm big into co-op multiplayer games, and this one is a lot of fun with a few friends. I started playing in Early Access, and i was pleasantly surprised to find that multiplayer runs nearly flawless, which is a rarity. Most of the Early Access multiplayer games I've played lately have had very buggy networking code.That said, I am a bit disappointed this game has gone to full release. While the game itself is finished and the game play is superb, it is very, very buggy and the developers have not worked out enough of the kinks in my mind to really call this a finished game. I play with 3 other friends online, and one had a lot of issues just getting the game to run without crashing, UI disappearing, weird stuff like that. All of us have encountered game breaking bugs like hard crashes and controls locking up. I originally wanted to play on Linux but for some reason couldn't even get it started (Ubuntu 15.04), I had to run it on my Win7 machine instead.So if you can't handle a bit of flakiness from the game, you might want to hold off on buying for a little while. On the other hand, the devs have been very responsive (check the forums) and are constantly pushing patches. But even that's kind of a mixed blessing as they frequently break as many things as they fix.On the whole though, I am very satisfied with the game and hope that it only improves from here on out!

												So far, my impressions of this game are pretty good. TL:DRPros: Good itemization with potential for end-game grind/achievementDiverse skill-tree with flexibility to pick skills from multiple sub-categoriesHas small puzzles/mini-games to break up levelsHas a specific art-style that may appeal to someAllows for some clothing customization, potential for moreLots of inventory space. Lots, it's great (and you get a stash, but not a shared stash)Has a sense of humourParty play! Works well, even with latency, group buffs for everyone!Pets, have your own follower, each with their own unique abilitiy to complement youSkill reset is possible! It's got a price-tag, but if you think you screwed up you can undo itHaven't encountered many bugs (2 to be exact), so it's good to see them being patched/fixedCons:Re-playability may be an issue for some, it has a game+ sort of mode, but only the same 4 dungeons (which are big)May be confusing to begin for people not familiar with RPG/Dungeon Crawl gameplayDifficulty scaling may need work, at this point I can't vouch for higher difficultiesGame black-screens when you close the window, this persists through windowed and fullscreen mode (game runs in the background, but you can't see to click or rectifiy)Newer players may struggle to understand the scaling resource cost, it isn't properly reflected in skill cost descriptionsPets are currently lack-luster in terms of damage/functionalitySkill bar slots are quite limited, it's not possible to cycle to a second skill bar or use F-keys etc.It comes across as a voxel-based game with similarities to games like Torchlight, with references to quite a few things (the more obvious ones being things like Zelda, which was cool and somewhat nostalgic). I personally found it very easy to pick up and learn, with most things being quite intuitive and any issues I had, I could check the in-game help/guide. That said, I had to explain a few concepts to people I got to play, the big one being socketing (the only confusion I had was seeing the rarity and mixing it up with the socket colour), I'm not entirely sure how this could be streamlined, perhaps a small image in the guide with arrows. Itemization seems good, as of posting this I've only cleared normal and started intermediate on one character (plus a few others close to clearing normal), I've found that it has potential to go quite far, with the inevitable grind for the perfect socket combinations, unique drop of the item you want, etc. This is of course fine, assuming that the challenge remains present. In my current iteration, I've found that with enough gear refines and appropriate sockets, even without building defensively at all, there's no threat from monsters or traps. This of course may change in higher difficulties, but there should still be some kind of progression. In terms of progression, I found the first dungeon and a half scales pretty linearly, then there was a gear spike where sockets and refines became more viable, new skills unlocked and suddenly what was a pain to deal with (healing wolf packs with resistance) became easy, this is completely okay, as long as there comes another stage of difficulty. Anyway, going on, skill selections are good, being able to cross-class your trees is great. Want to be a rogue with some magical prowess? No problems. Want to be a barbarian with sentry guns for backup? You can do that! I think that's a good thing, it allows build diversity. Could lead to further itemization with +skill level on a rune or added flavour on weapons/armour. I found it slightly perplexing being able to progress down one side of the tree, but then unable to come from the final skill back to the top layer (in order to skil a skill I don't want), you can only go up the tree, I guess. Resource costs for skills might seem steep at first, but this becomes more logical (and requires further investment into gear) at higher levels. Currently there's quite a few weapon choices, although more would always be welcome. Certain base items won't start dropping until specific stages of the game. By the end of the first playthrough, you should have seen most/all of them. I like that there's higher difficulties, where you can keep your character, but I feel the endless dungeon mode (rng maps, map mods, possibly with influence) which I think I saw mentioned somewhere would be a good improvement for later gameplay, especially if new areas could be introduced (or new monsters). Party difficulty scaling is great, while not everyone will welcome it, it stops the game feeling too easy with group-orientated skills. Did I mention there's a support sub-class? Group-buffs? No? Well I should have!Specific skills may be over-tuned, while it's great having that really high cost ultimate ability that deals loaaads of damage at max rank, it's not so great if it one-shots the boss. Pets. Cool feature, feels lack-luster. There's room here for much more. More pets, more utility for them, longer durations? Give them an auto-attack or make them collect gold. In their current iteration they deal pitiful amounts of damage. This may be due to a level discrepancy (i.e. pet lv.25 vs monster lv.31) but I found that they weren't useful. By making the cooldown more powerful, people might be incentivised to build around pets. Potential to have all pets summoned at once? (could lead to screen clutter, especially in group-play) would make using pet-runes viable. Skill bar is somewhat limiited, which forces you to choose your skills carefully (that's good), but having pets also require a skill bar slot, to properly use, so do consumables. Health potions are pointless, almost, the only reason I found to use them was if I had no other means of healing early-game (or I face-tanked traps later on). I feel a second skill bar would be greatly beneficial, it would allow for more diversity with skills, quality of life with pets/potions/town scroll, etc. A skill-reset is possible, that's great, unfortunately it might also make new characters somewhat obselete. The only real difference in making a new character is the starting gear and which of the 3 base classes you use as a start-point. The rest is purely cosmetic (which you can override) or can be changed in a few skill-points. Lastly, mobility skills. There's only one. Leap. Mobility skills are sort of a quality-of-life thing, not having to run 200 steps in the wrong direction to get back to that one item is a nice QoL, admittedly that could be seen as reducing the life-span of the game, but there's still that same element of back-tracking and exploration without that. One mobility-orientated skill (Dash doesn't count) would be nice for each class (not all, rather 1 per base/sub-class in total, i.e. mage gets a short-range teleport, rogue gets a vanish trick). Anyway, I'm sure there's stuff I missed, but that's my (fairly detailed) impression. I like this game and I'd recommend it, I've given copies to a couple of my friends and it's pretty fun to play in groups. I hope to see more challenge/replayability in the future. I'd probably give it a 7.5/10. That's comparing games in it's genre from established publishers with a lot more financial backing. It's a bit more niche than Diablo or something like that, but it's a good game, it's got potential to be pushed into something that can be played for hundreds of hours, it's just not quite there yet. Is it worth the price-tag? Maybe not for everyone, but if you've played (and enjoyed, hopefully) the likes of games like Torchlight, or just like the genre, give it a go.			"

												To anyone who thinks this game is easy;This game is -NOT- easy at all. Please understand this game have a in-game button that can increase the difficulty with; 50%, 75%, 100%, 150% and 200%.Here's what I like about the game:- Runs smoothly- INFINITY LEVELS. No levelcap.- You can reset talents, choose whatever talent you want. There's no ""You can't choose that, because you're a mage!"" ect. You are not stuck with your classes abillities, you can simply just learn other abillities if you want to.- This game is hard. Don't believe me? Then go ahead and set the difficulty to 200% increase, and beat the game on Hard, Expert or Master. I promise, you will die. - Really great story. Pretty sad though, in a weird-funny way.- The music is pretty chill, I like it.- You can add runes to your gear, upgrade them to more powerful ones.- If your gear doesn't have a rune slot that you need, you can simply take the gear piece and craft it with the gems you've found in the candy-crush alike minigame you've harvested, and add a rune slot to your gear. - Pets- Skins- Your own personal loot, friends can't steal the loot from you. (Which is soooo great).- Lots, and I mean A LOT of loot. You'll be swimming in loot. Not too much, not too few either.- Not all chests have loot. Some of them contains chickens.Things that I dislike:- When playing with friends, you can not always revive them.- Sometimes when you die, (Which happens rarely) you can stuck in a death-animation and have to force-exit the game.- No public games you can join :[ - Would be great with more doungens.What I would love to see in the future:- More doungens.- Maybe some sort of 'raids', which is pretty much extremely large dougens, way more mobs, and really hard bosses with many mechanics and abillities. The current bosses have very few, except for cluckins. But more mechanics is always fun.- A more open world.- That you're able to play after the ending. I want to know more about the story, even after the ending.- Live-servers with other people would be pretty nice. Unrealistic, but nice.			"

								Right now this game is a fairly standard dungeon crawler. Its blocky design is okay, though I'm not a huge fan. It's clearly in Early Access, and it needs local multiplayer and better online before I'd recommend it entirely. However, the reason I recommend it is because the devs clearly are working hard on it, and making it better all the time. They also jump on the forums to answer questions, help stuck players, and sometimes even just chat about the game. This honest effort is one thing most Early Access games don't have, and that's why I'd recommend this.			"

												Great game for the price.  Lots of content and easily well over 40+ hours of game from what my friends have told me.  I'm only 4 hours in and I've barely scratched the surface.The only downside is that the game gets pretty easy (even on harder difficulties) as you go on in levels and item strengths.  This is going to be adressed in a patch, though, so here's hoping it gets better.If you like Fate, Diablo, Torchlight and similar games, you'll like this.			"

Early Access Review
								It's a formulaic ARPG. You pick up weapons, level up when killing monsters, fight bosses, and collect gold. It has an item fusion system where items can be fused together to create higher-level versions of the same item (if you've played Warframe, it's like that).The voxel engine is refreshing - it beats the tired ""pixel game"" style currently in vogue. But there's no environmental destruction or creation. Or, really, *any* destruction that can't be found in a normal game. There's also practically no detail to the game, so it feels pointless to use a voxel render (if it even IS a voxel renderer) for this.And worst, the game is just repetative. There's ten levels to the first dungeon. Every enemy requires 6-20 hits with your sword to beat, and magic is laughably crippled (mana regen is nearly nonexistant, and spells have very low DPS compared to regular attacks). The pacing is awkward and uneven, leading to difficulty cliffs before you find a specific item that allows you to get over them. There doesn't seem to be a death penalty, so more than once I found myself intentionally dying just to get full health. Running back down the dungeon took less time than running out, healing in town, and coming back.The humor is nice, but the lack of gameplay options, uninteresting visuals, and generic gameplay just don't make me want to come back to it. Which is a shame, since it's clear that it's very polished (in the sense that it's smooth, has full-featured content, doesn't have glitches, and won't crash) and has a lot of work put into it.			"

												Forge Quest is a unique Voxel twist with MMORPG qualities (similar to World of Warcraft or Diablo for some). I have never truly been a fan of overhead dungeon crawlers, but this was the exception. Do I recommend this game? Absolutely.The Pros:> Easy to play, hard to master> Very flexible class system> Interesting gear> Rewarding progression> Easy puzzles to start off the game> Punishing difficulties> Funny at timesAlthough in most games - the term; 'easy to play, hard to master' almost always applies. But in this game, especially so. Learning how to play is fairly straight-forward, but learning how to efficiently play your character is another story. The class system is very unique in this game, as you are not restricted to playing one class, you can hybrid your class points into different class trees to reflect your preferred play-style. In addition - your class' starting gear does not reflect the gear they are restricted to. There are no gear restrictions (at the time of this review), but different kinds of gear reflects the statistics and bonuses it will give. So if you are playing a caster-esque character, but you want to be more built to take more damage, then the gear you will be looking for is Spellplate. Or if you're playing a ranged-damage character, you will be looking for Scalemail, and so on and so forth. Progression in this game is in the form of different quests that unlock different stages of the game, which inherently give you more gold that you can spend to upgrade your items (up to 10 additional levels past it's original level), make gear purchases, purchase potions, teleport scrolls, costumes, or combat-pets. The puzzles are pretty simplistic and don't take much time away from your gameplay outside of a handful later on that slowly begin to become more challenging and require some thought. The game progresses in difficulty, as one would expect, and the game becomes more challenging with unique boss fight mechanics that will keep (especially Hardcore characters) players on their toes. To wrap it all up, the game has a slight sense of humor added into it, which makes for a very enjoyable game.Cons:> Very limited replayability> No way to restore a previously, or accidentally deleted character> No way to interchange player perspective (more of a personal opinion)> You must always replay the tutorial on a new character> Two gamemodes, story and endless (personal opinion there should be more to do, considering the story mode's replayability is relatively nonexistent)All in all Forge Quest is an amazing game, I highly recommend it to anybody, as you can get a lot of enjoyment and fun out of it, however, like all games it has it's kinks, but - I would rate this game a 9/10.

Early Access Review
								So far, I see a game with potential, just needs more polish. In the combat there are a few issues with switching weapons and the lag between them. A few missing tutorials in lockpicking.. Dungeons seem a bit directionless at times, and as far as crafting goes... its hardly a prominant point in the game. I can dissesmble a high ranking piece of gear for the reciepe, but then I can only craft a lower gear, which is fine.. but, the only way to upgrade the gear.. is with kits, that can be found in the dungeons (not so frequently either). Crafting dust is too abundant.. and if you harvest ore (by playing a game of jewel quest.. without the chain combos).. after loading a game again in the same place or even exiting the dungeon you will have all tapped out ore ready to be havested again. Basically, I thought I was going to be doing some major crafting in order to progress further in the game.. but instead, i'm just buying or finding all my gear. Game at its basics are fine, just don't expect to see a major portion of forgeing on your quest. ;) (Maybe I misred the title?)			"

								Forge Quest is a voxel based Dungeon-exploring RPG game where you can explore towns, areas and delve into dungeons to find treasure, fight bosses and level up! As the game is currently in 'early access', the game is currently being updated but from what you get as of now, its a really great game and worth the price! The voxel aspect of the game is great and makes it feel cube-world-ish with a completely different approach. You can level up your character anyway you want, unlocking skills and abilities as you go through the game! The inventory and other menus are easy to navigate and it has an old style zelda appeal to it! As of writing this review, you cannot move or do anything once the attack animation has begun, which annoyed me a little, being able to move whilst attacking would make the game 100% better! All in all, a great game and since its still being developed, well worth it. - 8/10			"

								[EARLY ACCESS REVIEW]Forge Quest is a delightful little voxel RPG, with elements drawn from Zelda, Adventure Quest, World of Warcraft, and many other incredibly influencial titles. The combat is responsive, and the gameplay smooth. The options leave something to be desired, and its not fantastically optimized, running a steady 20-30 fps most of the time. In only a few hours, a friend and I have experienced many bugs and some of them a wee bit game breaking - however, they didn't stop our immense enjoyment of the game.While the performance screams early access, the gameplay is polished to a damn shine.9/10			"

												Fun little RPG dungeon crawler. Being in early access stages it does need some improvements. Pros so far: - Interesting skill trees- Fast pace fighting- Upgrading items is conceptually fair and interesting- Decently attractive story- Customizing your character is completely up to you (Multi Tree Specing)- Combat system is classic and greatCons so far:- Far FAR too easy to start. Need to be able to change difficulty early on. What if people dont feel like playing through the entire game again just to get the ""hard"" part...- Need more epic loots!- Need epic loots to be more EPIC!- Maybe add more content to dungeons? I know it's hack n slash and what not, but something to make it different.- Maybe have a less linear world. Allow the player to make choices. Not just a straight line. - No quests? Maybe something more than just the story line. Great start to what can be a great game. The ""minecrafty"" graphics to the game remind me how content is more important than visuals. I'm sure the developers have everything under control.Put on wishlist if you don't want early access. This will be an awesome game.			"

								First off this game is still under development and has its fair share of quirks and bugs in it.  That being said, I have about 2 hours of play so far and have enjoyed every minute of it.  Forge Quest takes many aspects of games I grew up loving and puts a nice spin on them.  The combat system is simple enough that you can pick it up and run with it while not feeling like you are just button mashing to win, i.e. any Dynasty Warriors game.  There are plenty of classes to chose from in the game and you can use skills from each tree as you see fit once you unlock them without being tied to a single class for the whole playthrough.I still have yet to dabble with the multiplayer so I can not yet comment on that.In the end, it is a $10 game and you will get way more enjoyment out of it than what you will have to spend.  I would  recommend this to anyone who is a fan of dungeon crawling or who grew up playing the Super Nintendo era action rpg games.			"

												Forge Quest is fun but I think other games do the same thing better. If you enjoy cutesy voxel graphics, if playing on different platforms is important to you and you like your games to involve plenty of grinding then maybe take a look. I can definitely see myself playing a while longer but I'm not convinced the game will be able to hold my interest to the end.More:

								I love this game! The combat is easy to learn but hard to master, the jokes can (while very cheesy) make you laugh at times, and the voxel based graphics are modern yet nostalgic. This game brings a new meaning to the word nostalgic, as it's jokes and ideas reflect games I used to play as a little kid, but for a modern gamer (I was born in 2001; 13 years can get nostalgic too!) The storyline is a little weak, its your basic go to dungeons and get a mcguffin kind of game, but I think its meant to be that way, as it would appeal to gamers of all ages.Overall, definately worth the money.

								I'll start off by saying, great game!The abilities are a bit basic and lots of textures are temporary, but thats alright.I wouldn't buy the game if you're not a fan of alpha or beta games.People have been saying that crashes and things have been happening, but the game is updated very frequently so I'm sure they'll fix the issue.I personally have not come across any game-ruining bugs.The humour is fantastic and there are plenty of references and easter eggs for you to find!I feel it lacks puzzles, I'd love to see some Legend of Zelda-esque puzzles. The only puzzle I've come across are pressure plate puzzles where you just need to step on pressure plates in the right order.From what I've seen the multiplayer looks very fun, you can have one person playing a tanky warrior and another person playing a healer etc. The combinations are endless!Bearing in mind: I haven't played the multiplayer.Pros:        Very fun combat,        Great humour,        Plenty of references and easter eggs to find.Cons:        I feel it lacks on the skills side of things,        Lacks puzzles.Overall it is an extremely fun game and well worth the €9.If you don't buy it, atleast keep an eye on the game.

												After one entire playthrough and 10 hours later, I can definitely say Forge Quest is one of the best games I've played in quite some time. With the hybrid aspects of groundbreaking games like Diablo, Gauntlet, and possibly a few others, it brings back some fond memories, as well as some new ones! I loved every inch of the game so far; ESPECIALLY the class system! The fact that even though each spec has a bit of a small choice of skills, the option to cross-spec between different classes and their specs is AMAZING! Plus, I'm a large fan of the voxel graphics, so that just adds to the list as to why I find this game to be so good. The only thing I hope to see is either an expansion, or an overall extention of the game's dungeons (I'm not in tune with the beta portion of the game (YET), so I am not sure if the team is already working on something such as that). Also, maybe a wider selection of weapons and armor would be pretty good as well, which I can almost guarantee that you guys are already working on even before I personally have bought the game. Overall though; I deeply enjoyed the storyline of the game, I am ABSOLUTELY going to play through the rest of the difficulties (both in hardcore and regular mode), and I have already recommended a few of my friends to buy the game when they get the chance. For those of you who are reading this and are thinking about buying FQ; do it. It's a must-play for any RPG fanatic.			"

												Forge Quest was a game that caught my attention immediately with the visual style it works with, so when I caught the game on sale I was pretty happy to finally sit down and play it. What I ended up getting was both what I expected, and not entirely what I hoped for.The best way I can describe the game is sort of a weird mixture of The Legend of Zelda, and Diablo. You'll run around swinging a sword at things, or shooting a bow all the while pushing blocks around to unlock a door. The story is very simplistic, and won't exactly grab your attention but it provides some amusing moments. Unfortunately the story is also quite short, and doesn't really feel like much is made in the way of progression along the way. True, there are skills you can unlock via skill trees when leveling up, but I rarely actually felt as if I was significantly more powerful after leveling. Perhaps you could argue that the enemies become bullet shields, but even the most basic of enemies eventually took quite a few hits after a while. You can get better equipment, but at the time I was playing there was a bug where most things would always drop as a level 1 item. This has since been fixed.The game is randomly generated each time you start a new story (and you'll have to do it at least five times to unlock all the difficulty levels, if you have the patience for it. Ten times if you also want the achievements for hardcore mode) and this is both a positive and a negative. The good is that in a game with not a lot keeping you playing from a story standpoint the scenery is at least different. The bad is that the RNG is not always smart. An example is I ran into at least two instances where I went downstairs in a dungeon to find myself on a platform I couldn't get off of. Seemingly, this RNG is meant to make use of the leap attack ability, which is a talent point issued ability, but if you didn't happen to have that skill you're a bit screwed. Luckily, on both occassions I was able to merely glitch through the edge of the platform to get down to a different area to progress.  An additional RNG annoyance is the special enemies that can sometimes spawn. I had a couple of instances where I'd get a version of a monster that was immune to physical and magical attacks, whom also regenerated his health. Surely you're thinking I could just shoot him with a bow. Normally, you'd be right, but he also spawned adds at an alarmingly quick rate that made actually getting the arrow to hit the enemy I want rather difficult. This is in no way game breaking as these RNG enemies can be ignored at the loss of their exp and item drops, but still it wouldn't hurt the game to be a bit smarter in what can generate and what shouldn't mix when generating.The game is unfortunately also a bit buggy, and prone to crashing. I had an issue where an entire dungeon would cause the game to crash to desktop every single time I attempted to pick a locked door. Thankfully, they have since patched that bug. It, however, wasn't the only issue I had with crashing. I've had it crash in mid battle. I've had the map glitch out on me randomly making it so I couldn't see where I was going, which usually resulted in a crash. The game still feels as if it should be in early access, despite the fact I believe it no longer is. I hate having to say negative things like that, as the developers are very active in the forums for the game and try to fix bugs as quickly as possible, but as of right now when I write this the game isn't fully THERE yet.It may be before long, and I honestly hope it keeps evolving into something great. Sadly, right now I can't recommend it. The game is certainly playable, but it won't likely keep your interest past a first run of the story, and even if it can the bugs and odd RNG may cause you to shy away. Try the game if you think it looked interesting as I did, just be aware the product is a bit rough around the edges before you buy.			"

								Forge Quest is an RPG-esque dungeon game.Forge Quest is all around an exciting game, packed with eloquent and humorous dialogue. The classes are diverse and have their own interesting abilities to go along with them. The dungeon's designs are unique in their own ways and really bring out some of the core features of the game. The Boss's are difficult and have their own special attacks, aside from the fact most of them die to the chicken.Pros: - Interesting Storyline- Interesting crafting system, could be more streamlined- Classes are fun, have different aspects, have build up to more advanced classes suiting your playstyle- Spells and abilities are unique to their classes and suit the builds of that character- Weapon system is intuitive and easy to use- Inventory system is well organized- Differently sculpted items, some better fit classes, same with armors- Cool petsCons- Dungeons are extremely difficult to navigate, and can take upwards of an hour to complete if you take the wrong paths- There are some spots where you can get trapped in by monsters and easily killed- The crafting system is difficult to understand and use, could be more intuitive- After a certain point, leveling and getting money becomes a grind, as it usually does in games like this- Although the story progresses, a lot of it is similar to previous points in the game- Pets can get stuck, lostOverall Forge Quest is an extremely fun game to play, but the dungeons can get tedious as you complete floor after floor looking for the right door to take. The pets are fun to have around but can get in the way. Also having to activate the pets every time you want them to attack can get annoying.Let me know if this review helps, but please, this is just my opinion.CheersYour local janitor			"

								It can get quite repetitive but the rewards and gear, even dialogue compensate for that. The story is actually pretty good and heart warming. Graphics are pretty good and the combat is very smooth and even difficult on easy mode. Mobs will swarm you so that makes you think about strategies and how you approach your enemy. The game has a borderlands loot system along with skyrim upgrades feel. The Looting WGBPO system in Borderlands is in. The skyrim upgrade feel when you combine equipment together and improve it's stats so it can never be outdated. Getting a shield is also highly recommended it's a good stalling tool because shields void ALL damage but has a limited health counter. This was well worth the buy considering it is discounted. Loved it and it'd be great if more people played this to support its ACTIVE devs.10/10 would leave waifu to pray gaem			"

								this game is amazing I can't get enough I was planning to try it for a minute and wait so I can play Multi-player with my friends but it was so good.now let get a bit of details on the game experience.at first I thought the game was very hard because I had difficulties defeating enemies but then I realized I wasn't using  any items or weapons from my inventory (I was halfway through the first dungeon) so I did a little shopping and now I can stand my ground against the evil forces.however the game reminds me of Zelda a lot except the dungeons don't seem to have any puzzles but I am still in the first dungeon so I can't say for sure.the mining(gem collecting) is fun and unique you play a mini game (similar to bejeweled)  and what you score you get in your inventory(I still don’t know what the gems are used for).the fighting system is fun and encourages you to be creative you can use many weapons and abilities(like magic).the last thing I want to say is that the game is still in an early access, there are some items' icons missing(that what I noticed while playing the game and I think there are other things not finished yet).I definitely recommend it.Yeah one last thing the developer seems obsessed with chickens.(I apologize for my bad English) "

								If you enjoy games which involve completing dungeons runs and slaying strong powerful bosses then this is for you. This is a very pretty looking voxel game. Much like Cubeworld. But unlike Cubeworld this feels more complete. Even though it is still in its Beta period (yes I know Cubeworld is also in Beta). There is a great story to follow within the game with a lot of humor even for the older gamer like myself. Lots of different mobs to try out your new looted weapons on then folllow that up with some epic boss battles inwhich you hope your forged armor you made is strong enough to keep you alive. Tons of loot to collect while making your way through the dungeons. With commomon, uncommon, Magic and Rare items to collect. And lots and lots of gold so you can go buy that all important dog to fight by your side. This is a top down game much like the Diablo series. This works really well although you currently can not move the camera which I would like to see in future updates. Yes there may be some bugs and glitches here and there but for a Beta this feels like it has a lot of promise. If you have friends with the game why not team up to take on mobs and bosses. I hope the dev team will carry on updating this game and making it better and better. So far they have produced a really good stable foundation to build up with. So fingers crossed for the future. Lets hope this doesn't turn into another Cubeworld. Overall I would give this game 8/10 "

								This is a fun game to waste time on. The music is great to just sit and listen to, while the meshes do look pixilated and blocky, the textures are done fantastically. There are a few downsides at the moment in its current early state. One is when you attack with mele, pause for a moment and move your mouse to where your enemy is. That can get rather frustrating and in the heat of battle, you can’t stop clicking. Another issue is Co-Op dependent. Some levels require you to have more than one companion in order to continue on with the game, but in this game I may make an exception to try it with someone… at some point.			"

This was months ago though, and from what I've seen there have been many updates to this game since then. I'll be playing it again and update this review in a few days.

								I do not regret a minute that I spent playing this game, the combat is familiar with it's hack-n-slash, dungeon crawler feel, the story is funny and doesn't take itself too seriously, the voxel-styled graphics look crisp and great, and the multitude of weapons gives every player a large selection to cater to their playstyle. Combat could be slow at times and was rarely challenging, except for the bosses. There are a few bugs, ranging from annoying to hilarious to game breaking (e.g. The entrance to a dungeon spawning behind the barrier that prevents you from going into the next overworld area). Luckily, a simple world rebuild usually fixes world generation bugs. Definitely worth the $10, and even moreso with friends. A great RPG, a good introduction to the genre for beginners and just a good dungeon crawler. 8/10.			"

												I honestly have to say that I am very impressed with this game. From its charmy visuals, tongue and cheek storyline and down to its dungeon crawling aspects, Forge Quest really sucks you in. I intend on playing alot more of this game. Great job Devs. This is my favorite Indie game on Steam			"

								Just think Cube World style graphics, Zelda style dugeons and randomly generated worlds. That is Forge Quest in a nutshell. Does crash but what can you expect? It's in alpha/beta. Fun and challenging gameplay with a good sense of humor. I'd recomend multiplayer because this game looks like it would be amazing with friends (I have like none). I also think that steam workshop would be amazing for this along with a game editor for making your own maps.			"

								I like this game and I play it with my friend a lot, but I always seem to crash when I get hit with the Chicken boss or I load up the upgrade screen after leveling up. The chicken boss is a more recent and may be my computer, but that doesn't excuse the lagginess and crashing of the upgrade screen. Please fix this problem so I may have a better experience with the game.			"

								Excellent game with surprising depth. Lots of content for a early access game and the devs are making frequent updates.The game has really come along since the early beta builds and feels very complete at this point.There are three ""classes"" each with two sub classes, so depending on how you want to play you can get some good replayability on it. Dungeons are mostly randomly generated so that is nice as well. For items they have a very cool upgrade process so that sword you pick up can be continually improved and compared to ARPGs you don't have as much RNG in play for your gear. Items can also have sockets and the runes you socket can be very useful and powerful.A few quirks related to controls but nothing that you can't easily get over.PS: I suck at reviews, but this game is too much of a hidden gem to not review.

								It's a random generated world with dungeons to explore and multiple classes to upgrade in (you're not limited to one class). It's pretty challenging and you will die a couple times i can tell you that. There's a hardcore mode which is not any different from any other rpg with hardcore: if you die you are dead. (not recommended for new players ofcourse. But it's a really good game and a nice concept with a lot of potential i hope that de developers stay active on upgrading this game and getting more content in it.

												It's alright, Needs more customizing options, a lot more.  I mean you can edit heads but you have to overwrite pre-existing models to use them.  Custom map making is needed to.  You have this incredibly voxel, very pixelly game, and it just cryies out for player made content. MASSIVELY SO!!!  And without that's a very small game.  Good on a half off sale but pales compared to dungeon Crawlers like Diablo 2 and Torchlight 2.Get on a 50% sale or better, IF you like dungeon crawlers.Would do well with more player made maps and character appearances.Also needs a shared inventory system amongst all characters.

								I can't play this game on my laptop, which very nicely fits into the requirements doth set upon it by this game, yet.I like this game. It has jarring controls, easy to learn aspects and a whole lot of what you could call, ""heart"". This game really blends in with its industry, though. It offers meritable customization, but you need to run the extra mile, while also noting that you can onlynarry carry so much looks with you beyond one. Its fun to play with, offering the same satisfaction as a flash game.. alas, it can always be with you.Its worth itself on sale, any sale. Even less than a dollar would be okay. 10 bucks if you're desperate.It does not run smoothly on laptops, however. Not normal ones. ( HP Notebook )			"

												I wanted to give this game a chance but ended up returning it. Seemed good by looking at the trailer/screenshots, started out with a pretty good prologue, but once the game actually started, the tedium set in after less than an hour. I had to take a break after every dungeon floor because I would get bored. The game does not run or play very well either, the controls feel very stiff and I experienced constant frame dips and laggy hit detection. Nearly half the time I would clearly dodge an attack and get hit anyway. Would not recommend this one.			"

												I really enjoy this game! I find it to be a great blend of Action RPG and Dungeon Crawler.  The game is blocky, but there is no digging, block gathering, or sleeping at night! Quick Rundown:  You start the game and can customize your look to some extent, ie dwarf, elf, human, wolf, kobold, male, female, colors etc.  You then get to choose your starting gear.  Feel free to take whatever looks cool because there are no classes in this game.  All skills are open to all characters.  For example I have a warrior that has magic shields and can heal others.  Both abilities are in the ""Mage"" skill tree but they lend themselves to melee heroes very well!  You enter the game to find yourself in a dungeon tutorial that lasts all of 2-3 minutes, easy stuff here ladies and gents!  The storyline after the tutorial is amusing and fun but rather weak. In all honesty the game doesn't need much story as it is an exploration and action game.  You will spend most of your time looking for gems and loots!  And there is an immense amount of LOOTS! The gems are used at workbenches to socket items and to upgrade your weapons and armor with various magical and nonmagical abilities.  The trash items you collect can be crafted and combined with your ""good"" items to imbue them with higher levels and new properties.  I thoroughly enjoy playing this game with my kids and wife and have no problem with boredom or it getting old.  There are modes of endless dungeons for leveling purposes or there is a story mode.  Multiplayer is fun and can be challenging but it is fun to see different character builds and each team of 4 is immensely different depending on the unique abilities and play styles of the players involved.  Controls       10/10 Mouse/KB , Xbox, twin stick, or single stick controllers are supported! Graphics      7/10 Voxel but charming and fun.Sound          8/10 No complaints.  Anime type battle sounds.Gameplay    9/10 Hack n Slash, Multiple kinds of magic, pets, multiplayer coop, endless loot! Replayability 10/10 Each game is randomly generated.  You have options to reset world or keep it!This game has a very classic feel to it, much like if Gauntlet and Zelda were mashed up and spiced with a little Torchlight II.  This game probably isn't for the serious gamer but for casual gamers or younger crowd this game is golden! I highly recommend this game.8.8/10 on the casual gamer scale.  This was never intended to be a blockbuster game, no pun intended,  but you do get a lot of bang for your buck.			"

												Sticky, sluggish controls paired with an annoying sense of humour make this a hard game to like. The randomized dungeons are a nice touch and the art style is cute, but combat is so frustrating at points that it makes me want to throw my laptop. Like I said, controls are so sticky that it's hard to get used to, and they're often slow to respond which makes combat even harder than it is (which is saying something, the combat can be nigh impossible at times with how damage is balanced currently.) With time I think this game could be good, and the devs seem active, so that's hopeful.If you can get past the sluggish attack system, this is worth the $15. Power attacks are the only thing worth using in combat, but let your enemies gang up on you with so much ease that it can be frustrating, but that's the only big gripe I have at the moment.			"

Anime type battle sounds.Gameplay    9/10 Hack n Slash, Multiple kinds of magic, pets, multiplayer coop, endless loot! Replayability 10/10 Each game is randomly generated.  You have options to reset world or keep it!This game has a very classic feel to it, much like if Gauntlet and Zelda were mashed up and spiced with a little Torchlight II.  This game probably isn't for the serious gamer but for casual gamers or younger crowd this game is golden! I highly recommend this game.8.8/10 on the casual gamer scale.  This was never intended to be a blockbuster game, no pun intended,  but you do get a lot of bang for your buck.			"

YouTube™ Video: ➜ A Quick Look @ 'Forge Quest' + 1 Steam Key to Giveaway! (ENDED) 

			Views: 102		

			COMPETITION ENDED! You can get the game here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/249950 Massive Thanks to the Dev's for the Review Copy + BONUS Steam Key to Giveaway!		

Explore the land full of chickens on a light hearted quest to become a hero. Delve deep into the randomly generated dungeons to battle monsters, find treasure and craft your equipment. Invite your friends to join your world and help you in your adventure. Long after great wars ravaged the land of Shmoop, a balance has been reached as both sides agreed to regulate all hero and villain related activities. This system flourishes as it creates the economic stability the land needed, and from it the great bureaucracy rose to rule over the land. After many years from the system's inception, you step onto the scene. A strapping young adventurer who, after being dropped off by your parents, set off to obtain your Hero license from the kingdom. Although eager to claim your title, your path is full of danger as you must first prove yourself in the dungeons below. You also soon learn that not everyone plays by the rules and what it means to become a hero is much more then just a signed paper.  - Highly Recommended!			"

												When I first looked at this game, I assumed it was just some casual voxel-based RPG. However, upon further inspection, I found that this gem of a game really had the makings of a good action-RPG. The crafting/socket system is very fluid, and all classes are very fluid as well; my mage essentialy turned into a tank halfway through my playtime. That is what I love most about this game. You think there have to be pre-defined class roles, but this game shows that all of those rules are subject to change.In short, I love this game.			"

												I'm kinda mixed. The game was fun, mechanics were solid, and though the game was short it wasn't too short. The only thing I can really nitpick at is the story really takes a backseat about halfway through the game, and by the end I kinda lost interest in it. Still a great game if you love Diablo style mechanics with a bit of crafting element added to it. I highly recommend online multiplayer to make it more entertaining. Though, you might want to wait for it to go on sale.			"

												i enjoyed this game, quite a bit, my first playthrough. it didn't keep me too much past that but i'll probably try it again here and there evenually once i'm in the mood again, it's well done and has a lot going for it. if you like hack and slashers, comedy, and voxel art this is something you may want to try... i'll probably write a full review for this eventually but as it stands there's a lot of people i'd recommend this to, and only people that are a bit anal-retentive about their gaming would be the ones i wouldn't... if you aren't sure, get it on sale. i watched this game grow before i picked it up and it went from a quaint but simple dungeon crawl to being a game with a lot of cool features that can keep you playing for days on end. they really have something here and i REALLY hope they make a sequel!

												This game is really super fun! It's like Spiral Knights' battle mechanics with a touch of Voxel graphics ( That comes with its own editor hidden in the game's files ), a bit of Diablo for it's loots, with a pinch of Nintendo Hard difficulty ramps.The game is friendly to you at first, but things gets hot fast as you progress and new monsters munches your butt as you try vainly to save yourself. There's also a sweet equipement upgrader concept in the game, where that first starter helm of your can be upgraded until its capacity is reached. It's pretty cool! Although i have a few complains, it's nothing too bad and i quickly learnt to just deal with them. If you want a fun game that will suck up many hours, that's a good pick!			"

								Imagine a top down view of a character made of Voxels.You're goal in this game is to level up by killing enemies of all shapes and sizes... Especially Chickens...The first 2 dungeons are kind of boring and gets repetitive... I believe that is just give you abit of a run down of the basics.At the third dungeon the game actually picks up pace. (Recommended you go ranged to get through the game faster).If you were to compare this to a game i would say games similar to Spiral Knights and Torchlight.Though the game at it's current state is somewhat... poor if you compare it to the two games above.Just remember this is an alpha.The Controls are: WASD = Movement[Space] = Roll/Dodge1-4 = Class based Abilties = InventoryLeft click = Fire Primary slotted weaponRight click = Fire Secondary Slotted WeaponThe comedy in this game is pretty amazing at the start of the game. But slowly dies down in later levels.I wouldn't recommend it at this current time. However, in the future i might change my mind.Only buy this if you want to gamble on how the game will turn out. "

While I did enjoy my time playing this game it very quickly felt very samey and it does the one thing I hate in video games where it gives you a prologue where you have a really powerful character only to strip you of everything and set you back to lv1 where you die if something even breathes on you.

												Buggy UI, glitches often, problem with controller where if partner dies you cannot move, use abilities, items, anything, and most the time you end up dying with them as a result, so instead of having a fun co-op experience, you're constantly yelling at your partner not to die; knowing it will lead to your end aswell. The game often glitches, not letting you cast abilities until it feels like letting you again. The only thing that I honestly enjoyed about this was the towns' OST, its DECENT. But other than that this game has nothing going for it. Each skilltree has less than 10 abilities, bosses are not difficult, and often bug out themselves, resulting in an easy win (Cluckers Especially glitched a lot) Honestly if I didn't pay $15 each for two copies of this game I would have never played through it all but I didn't want to see my $30 go to waste sitting in my steam library.

												Decent time killer, but the positive stops there.Story: The story uses cheap lampshading as a crutch and lacks any real substance.Gameplay: Dungeons are HIGHLY repetitive, ""puzzles"" are immediately obvious how to solve and tedious to actually complete, and combat is absolutely possitively trivial with no variety or interesting mechanics. Controlls were clearly designed with a controller in mind with no consideration for keyboard and mouse (for menus at least).Character building: Loot is generic varrying by one or two numbers at most with no variety of stats available or room for interesting builds. Builds are fairly linear. You go down one tree with little room for variation within a tree. There are no plot choices or anything to differentiate one character from another.I didn't hate it, but by the end of the second dungeon I was pretty much done with it, only finishing it for the sake of finishing.

												Ugh... were do i begin? First off... the game is really easy... its minecraft like graphic of models (which i consider a downside because most games try to copy that way to much) all i have to is spam one skill and i can complete the story, and then afterwards theres really nothing to do but endless dungeons. I bought this while it was on sale and maybe it was worth it then.. but this game is not worth 15$. At most its about 8 maybe 9$.			"

												I think the developer understands the technical side of a hack and slash rpg, but not the visual side. This style of game is supposed to be fluid, and visually appealing. Personally I find the gameplay dull and monotonous because the attacks are not visually appealing and therefore this game is not worth playing			"

								A great indie game that has a lot of spunk and attitude. Forge Quest keeps the greatness of rpgs while giving it that sarcastic flare that helps boost the games enjoyability. I will be playing Forge Quest often on my channel Check out my channel:  My Channel  and also checkout the first video of the series

												This game is a little slow paced compared to Call of Duty and other FPS's, but this game is by far the best military simulator with extremely large maps and a huge variety of vehicles and weapons to choose from. Singleplayer is not so great but all of the fun and action comes from the co-op missions online. You won't get anywhere in this game without an organized team which is one of the many reasons why this game is so fun. Highly recommended. Blows any competition out of the water (Op Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, CoD, MoH, etc.).			"

Then I once again, cannot connect to anything.So until this problem is fixed somehow, I sadly have to downvote.			"

You need a ""Specific graphic card"" or whatever. Nothing worked no matter what I did. So there goes 30+ dollars out of my friends pocket. So much for playing a new game that was co-op. Not everyone is on a brand new computer. I wish I could play. But I cant, I dont recommend this game to anyone unless you got a recent computer with a good graphics card and has the right software.

								For what it is, it's a really nice roguelike.  Has that Zelda feel to it, probably because of all the chickens everywhere.  Also breaking pots for money and health.I do feel however that this game is lacking in content.  Although the game does randomly generate the stats the items have, there aren't much of a variety in the items.  That, and, the skill tree feels rather small, but that's just my personal opinion.  Gameplay wise, it's pretty solid.It may not be the best roguelike that I've ever played, but definitely worth trying.  8/10			"

								Really great game! The story line isn't finished, however me and my cousin managed to play 6 hours of Co-Op before reaching the end. Afterwhich we are replaying it with the same characters, but on a harder difficulty!ProsThe gear management is nice and simple. It can, however, be quite difficult to reroll stats to what you want.The class trees are simple and streamlined, however due to the lack of a hard level cap, you can spec into everything. Although we both reached level 25 before the end, which allowed us to get all the skill points we needed (There are 3 trees for each archtype (Warrior/Mage/Thief).Co-Op is nice. The EXP is shared, and you each get your own loot. I'm not 100% sure if the mobs scale at all, but it was still fun.The mini-games are fun, but can get annoying after the 50th time your playing the resource minigame, but meh it was alright - something new to do. I feel like they should change the minigames difficulty, or at least its UI, depending on the area your in.ConsA few bugs. I had a bug where i'd get teleported to a different area of the map when going through the transition screens (On Co-Op).There were a few disconnections on either side during Co-Op. It wasn't that bad, however we'd lose items we had recently picked up. I'd say, within the 6 hours we played, we only had 3 D/Cs between us.The range of monsters are limited. Apart from the bosses, which were AMAZING, the amount of mobs were quite limited. I would love to see more unique monsters with more unique attributes, and perhaps some new types.-----------------It's cheap and amazing. Get it!			"

								In it's current state, it has a lot of potential left to be fleshed out. It's still a lot of fun with one or more friends in it's current state though.It does crash from time to time if you're playing via a tungling client, or just in general. The game is pretty heavily unbalanced if you know what you're doing, and the difficulty ramps up rather fast if you haven't been experimenting.I can't wait for bug fixes and more content, as this is a fun little game to stuff around with your mates, but if you're looking for a deep, gameplay heavy experience, you're looking in the wrong place.

Lot of good gameplay within this game, and a great story as well. I absolutely LOVE the fact that you can be more than 1 class at a time, for example, you can put skill points in Mage and Barbarian and you turn out to now be a barbarian Mage. For a game like this, i havent experienced any bugs yet but when i do ill hopefully get it noticed right away.			"

Now right now (12/1/2013) it is still in beta with some issues from what I can tell. Multiplayer can sometimes crash. Single player seems solid. Some graphics have placeholders.Now with all that being said - it is worth the price. It has so much potential on top of what is already so great about it.It really feels like a Zelda (earlier) game. There is no jumping. You attack, dodge, block with shield, and have quick slot abilities.			"

I don't think that's a bad thing, it's just funny. This is also a much better game than Cube World (and much more complete)you wont find anything new here. it's a very standard RPG. I feel like they're adding to it on a regular basis though, and I'm not that deep into the game. But it's not bad at all!I feel like it's a bit too expensive for what you're getting, to be honest.

												I've never been enthralled this much by an RPG game. The best part about this game is the combat, and how simplistic the story is. The story its self is forgetable, but it's made up with excellent combat and randomized dungeons. I don't know why chickens are such a big thing in this game but I don't care, as long as I get to have 50 sets of armor on me at all times.SPEAKING OF THATThis RPG is different from the others. You can use weapons no matter what level you are, and you can hold up to an infinite amount of... well... just about anything.This is a game you MUST buy got the summer vacation, you can spend countless hours in it.BUT TRUST ME, THIS GAME IS NOT PERFECT!The flaws aren't game breaking, but they are pretty annoying. For an example, at the start of the game you will come across these Jelly Monsters, I forget their name... sorry. Anyways, no matter how hard you try it seems that they ALWAYS hit you, taking about 5 HP in the process (And when you start out you have low HP).The Bats can go drown in a cess pool, nobody needs those, ever.

								For what it is, it's a really nice roguelike.  Has that Zelda feel to it, probably because of all the chickens everywhere.  Also breaking pots for money and health.I do feel however that this game is lacking in content.  Although the game does randomly generate the stats the items have, there aren't much of a variety in the items.  That, and, the skill tree feels rather small, but that's just my personal opinion.  Gameplay wise, it's pretty solid.It may not be the best roguelike that I've ever played, but definitely worth trying.  8/10			"

								This game is fun. It's a pixel dungeon delver with some comedy thrown in. You make your own items and use them, though when you level you have to make new items to replace old, so no gear getting better with you. Some npc monsters are really easy, and some are very very tough. The bosses are an extra challenge. You get a rival kind of like in Pokemon, but... I wont spoil it. It's good quick casual fun with randomly generated dungeon layouts. And continues with rpg's hatred of chickens.			"

								Pretty fun game tbh, needs more content, but i haven't played much so i can't exactly talk. maybe spice it up a bit? make it more enticing, and more exciting to gain levels, because getting 1 perk and not actually really noticing a difference when you level up is a bit of a shame, and maybe a better UI interface for items, and being able to actually see items on you, not actually just editing the sprites manually! really fun thought:) i've been enjoying it			"

								This game is fun to play. has very easy controls. (great XBox 360 controler support), great witty humor, and some really well made levels. Now right now (12/1/2013) it is still in beta with some issues from what I can tell. Multiplayer can sometimes crash. Single player seems solid. Some graphics have placeholders.Now with all that being said - it is worth the price. It has so much potential on top of what is already so great about it.It really feels like a Zelda (earlier) game. There is no jumping. You attack, dodge, block with shield, and have quick slot abilities.			"

								excellent game. diablo 3 and minecraft had a baby who met the baby of skyrim and wow. they then had a baby who met legend of zelda, which lead to another baby born named Forge Quest.very simple in terms of controls and ideas, which leaves the devs to make really tough content. i love that anything equal level is scary (one monster can kill you if you play stupid solo) while coop makes normal mobs alot easier but bosses will still wipe all of you. best $10 value in the arpg market today for sure!

								The villain goes bawk/10.Right now the game has about 2,5h/€ as lifetime value if you play all the difficulties up in singleplayer. More content will be added and stuff, but right now its actually worth more already than alot of stuff on steam.			"

								Forge Quest is another one of those early access games that seem all fun and fantastic, but in reality just don't work because they're still in beta. Yes, I would recommend the game, but if you're seriously considering it you should wait a few months or maybe even a year.			"

								This game is fun. It's a pixel dungeon delver with some comedy thrown in. You make your own items and use them, though when you level you have to make new items to replace old, so no gear getting better with you. Some npc monsters are really easy, and some are very very tough. The bosses are an extra challenge. You get a rival kind of like in Pokemon, but... I wont spoil it. It's good quick casual fun with randomly generated dungeon layouts. And continues with rpg's hatred of chickens.			"

												This game isn't just a dungeon crawler. This has everything a proper adventure game should have. It has:- humour- mini-bosses- great design for each and every dungeon floor- that upbeat in the forrest or the mountain that excites your inner 7-year-old- chickens- a lot of different ways to develop your character- co-op so you can show-off your amazing-ness- that annoying rival hero-wanna-be- more chickens- pets- costumes- a lot of chickens, like a lot!- oh and chicken refrencesHow can I not like or recommend this game?

												Its not just a good substitute for a computer that cant run different RPGs, but its a good game in general. There are multiple classes to choose from and even if you a certain class, you can always invest in a tree of a different class. The gameplay is easy to understand and runs smoother than most games. It is also replayable with a mode that increases difficulty after you beat the game. 9/10			"

												A fun simple ARPG style game that happens to have voxel based graphics. A few things that would improve this game are fading terrain when your character is standing near a wall that's blocking your view, as well as an animation for picking up items (they currently just vanish when you stand near them long enough.) Other than that, the game is fun and quite polished!			"

												I enjoyed Forge Quest. I played through the campaign with a mage, while a friend played through with a tanky, melee character. The game has a silly sense of humor which definitely got us chuckling with puns and pokes at the genre. The game consists of four dungeons and a final boss, and we finished it off in around 7 hours or so. I appreciated the variety in equipment, and I was actually able to find pieces that fit in with the build I was trying to create. The skills were solid, both active and passive, although somewhat limited. Based on achievements, the game seems to have something like 3-4 difficulties. However, I felt like I'd seen all I wanted to see, both in terms of skills and equipment, after only one. The main con for me was the repetitiveness of the dungeons - all seem to be about 7 levels (including the boss floor). The dungeons were all distinct, but within each dungeon, floors were extremely similar. We had much more fun once we decided that we would simply head down as soon as we found the exit, rather than attempting to clear the whole thing out. Another con was that by the end of the game, your character is extremely powerful. This seems to be primarily due to the crafting mechanic. Crafting in Forge Quest works as follows: you may ""feed"" the armor or weapons you find to your currently equipped armor or weapon to increase its potency. In this way, you can eventually make your equipped item the equivalent of one ten levels higher. I thought it was a fantastic mechanic; however, perhaps each item ""fed"" should increase the level of the equipped item a little less than it does. Overall, Forge Quest has some neat ideas, a decent sense of humor (though the chicken motif was a little overplayed), and a cool graphical style. However, don't expect a deep story or mechanics, and refrain from being meticulous during your playthrough.			"

												If you liked the Baldur´s Gate games on the PS2 era and like, its kinda a good choice for you here. Forge Quest (in short now FQ) is a good old hack´n slash game ala Diablo 1+2 and the old games on the PS2. The voxel graphic is more or less for the style only and has nothing to do with minecraft, cube world or games like. I like the still and it deal nicely with the game and its gameplay. As i said its kinda simple, even the skilltrees. But as simple it is as much it makes fun and it is to understand, really. If you also play it with some more people you will have a lot more fun for sure. As i said, people who love(d) more the classic kinds of hack n slash games (with a looooooooooot loot) should really give it a try.			"
