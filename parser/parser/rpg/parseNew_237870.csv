Early Access Review
								I have only played the singleplayer story mode so far so I'm basing my experience on that bit.The game also includes a build mode, and even online co-op play among others which I will definitely be trying out later.The game offers a day-night cycle which is faster than real life, but still long enough to have an impact on your plans and adventures. The nighttime is pretty dark and you will have to use torches, headlights, flashlights or other sources of lighting to find your way around the landscape.This game is in a really good state for an early access game! I would recommend this game to anyone who likes survival, exploration, crafting, and building games.If you like survival, exploration, crafting and building this is totally the game for you!You can craft anything from tools to guns, building modules, sentry guns, you name it. There's a lot of different crafting materials you can gather such as wood, stone, iron, copper, tin, different types of plants and more.The game plays very well and runs smoothly (> 60 fps) on highest settings on my quad core i7 920 (3.2 Ghz OC) with 6 GB RAM and a GTX 770 GPU.The terrain deformation is absolutely the best I've ever seen. You can literally mine out a cave or structure the way you want it.It's a voxel based game which means the terrain deforms a lot more natural than a block game would. I can see why this is one of the strongest selling points for this game. This opencl (cuda?) technique the devs are talking about does really seem to do a lot for this game!The textures are not ""next-gen"" at the moment, but very much acceptable for such a complex game. I guess this could be improved once they near a final release. It's definitely not game breaking though.The combat is very acceptable. It's pretty straight forward, click to smash (a la minecraft) but that's totally fine with me to be honest. You are also rooted into place when performing actions which is awesome and makes combat somewhat harder.Now, this is an early access game, but the only negative things I've been able to find after an hour or so of gameplay is that the world feels a bit empty. It doesn't feel static, since there's a lot to see like different types of animals and foliage/trees/mountains. It could feel a little more vibrant.The music is fantastic, although there is only one song which loops. It doesn't get annoying because it's a really calm and smooth composition. It runs for a while too so it doesn't get repetitive at all.Sometimes the combat music can get a little annoying when you're entering and leaving combat in fast intervals.There is voice acting for most if not all conversations so far. Some of the voice acting is great and some not so great, but also by far not the worst I've experienced. Could use a little more work in some areas though.There are some basic quests to help you figure out how crafting and gathering works which is great. The game really does a good job of easing you into the game so far. But it doesn't hold your hand too much either, which is a great thing.I haven't touched the real storyline so far, so I'll have to see how well the story is played out. But I have high hopes!This game is definitely worth the money and I would certainly recommend this game in it's current state!			"

Early Access Review
								Has a lot of potential and plays very smoothly for an alpha build. Quests and item collection work well, although melee combat is wonky (due to lack of damage animation for monsters, you have to watch the health bar). Building and terrain shifting with various tools is surprisingly functional; I didn't focus on building at first, but it's pretty easy to dig yourself a cave to hide out in, or build some platforms to get around plateaus. Vehicles and item building is also easy; the built-in creator is both powerful and simple to learn and use.Disclaimer: I wanted to play this game mainly as a wilderness survival game at first, but a couple of things I noticed in singleplayer (story mode) made me reconsider. I wouldn't call these problems since they're mainly design choices, but they're worth noting.1. ""Surviving"" in the sense of keeping your character fed/healthy is trivial; you can carry something like hundreds of thousands of items on your person (including a couple of vehicles).2. The main difficulty in the game comes from combat, which feels frustrating; you can upgrade your armor, but it seems to do little to prevent most large creatures from taking out >1/4 of your health each blow, and there's no simple way to dodge if you're stuck in melee (say, against a flying enemy with an AOE ground attack and who's faster than you).3. Due to infinite NPC shop storage and basically-infinite inventory, the story mode game sometimes feels like ""kill x monsters for meat (currency)"", buy next tier of supplies from vendors, do quests to get to new vendors, repeat"". To be fair, it's pretty much the entry point for new players, so the parceling out of goods is understandable; it lacks the urgency a survival-oriented game might have, though.			"

Early Access Review
								     I am so hooked into this game already.  I havent even begun building my base yet.  But what i really want to share with you guys, after having played for so many hours already. . . .      The way you need to describe this game to your friends.   Its monster hunter, just a little.  Its state of decay, but bigger.  Its Minecraft, but prettier.  These are some of my favorite games.  Lets not forget, you get to build your own weapons and rides if you so choose to do so.  What else are they going to create with this?			"

												Edit: 11/17/2016Well here we are, Release.  If you can call it that, While i understand the pressure the Devs are under to get the game out, It was still undercooked.  That being said, Considering some of the updates its had before this, its very playable!  Bugs? Yes! Multiplayer issues? Yes!  Enough of them to break the game? NO!A big plus as well is they have promised to keep working on the game, bug fixes, stability ect. for at least 6 months, which i think was the time table for release anyway.  So its not going to be a Doublefine situation where they say "" ♥♥♥♥ it, you all deal with making it better!""Edit:2/5/2016Its been a real rollercoaster for this one, went from good to unplayable and back a few times now, buts its getting nothing but better as time goes on it seems.  To all of the ppl that say its a ""dead"" game that will be in EA forever, I guess they havent seen the recent improvments that just pulled it out of one of the low points i spoke of above.  Ive seen even thru the low points the devs do their best to get patches and content out...the game may not have a large player base ATM, but its far from dead and poised to be great!Old review that still stands:This is the game I wanted from StarForge.  This review is wrote in haste, i think i have maybe 3 hours into the game, and just in survival mode at that.  Game includes a Story mode and multiplayer.  So as of right now, the game does show a few bugs, most of which i have been able to over look, and one game breaker when trying to load into a saved game, not sure what caused it but i can imagine being 20 hours in and BAM, saved game corruption.  But becuase of the future i can see for this game, every bug can be overlooked ATM IMO.  Still I would call this a early beta if i didnt know better. So the best way i can compare this game to others you might know is a SCI-FI Minecraft with Better Graphics, the ability to create your own Weapons ( completely design swords and sheilds from scratch ), and design your own Helis and Cars, Recruit others to the bases you create.  You can mine for minerals, hunt monsters, but its set up where you could not have to do one or the other.  Meat is used as Currency, so hunting can get you what you need to build anything.  Or mining can get you the ""meat"" you need buy selling ores.  Needless to say, im fairly impressed with this one.  Playable and fun in Alpha, Thats hard to do....GOOD JOB.			"

												REVIEW UPDATED  Sat, Apr 15th, 2017         will update if patches release. Or if I come up with anything worth mentioning. For years I have been A huge supporter of Planet Explores, A game that (to me) had/has massive amounts of potential- but all the updates dodge ALL of the REAL issues with the game. There is so much wrong with it/so much unpolished. Devs still charging Full price = F-ing Madness.   ::PROS:: Love creative aspect of the game. It has kind of 3d editor that allows you to eventually craft just about whatever you want, down to the smallest detail. Armor, weapons, vehicles (jets, cars, air ships, copters, etc), a base, turrets... all kinds of potentially fun stuff; However there is A great deal of polish needed to make any of this worth your time or fun. Still the most creative crafting system Ive ever come across though.   Most recent patch now allows you to ride animals (will update this once I have had time test animal riding in great length) Mineral mining (can be boring mining, but it is not over the top boring, so it is fine.)Terrain editing. Mining resources and using them allows you to shape terrain. Mining itself also has an effect on terrain, such as leaving jigostic holes in the ground.You can eventually set up your own camp, and fend off beasts. Adding various upgrades will allow you, farm, train AI skills as well as followers, let AI run A shop, repair/upgrade gear, etc. Needs fine tuning, more depth, better quests, but it gets the job done.Semi large open world to explore.  Decent solo player story mode.  Decent co op. When it works.  80+ hours of game-play to get A solid (non rush) play through. Has replay value. Adventure Mode. It sets the world up for A random solo rpg-esk game. Everything is randomely generated. You have the use of A very small talent tree. The donwside is the world generator needs work, and can spawn you at impossible starting locations (like underwater in the middle of the ocean). Can make npc's unuasble also. Character creation tool. Face details, hair, height, fatness, skin color / hair color, name.Custom Mode. Choose what% your terrain will be of each biome / choice of the use of talents or not.Has tall trees and mountains. High sky box, vast landscapes, ocean, rivers, and lakes also. Which feel nice.  Quests. The game has them. Has sci fi guns. Would love to see more Variety... however you being able craft your weapon to look like whatever you want helps, but still. Basic functions of each weapon (or weapon kits) need some uniqueness/creativity. Just spit-balling here, but maybe some ability mods for weapons, like changing the element of it to fire, ice, poison, etc? or maybe make it you where you change the rapidness of a weapon with some sort of draw back? These are just typical examples. Think unique and creative Devs.  Has A NPC recruiting system. You can take NPC's with you on your travels, or just leave them behind at base camp. The Npc's also have various talents that you can use to your advantage, like bonus damage in combat, gathering.... that's just about it. Sure there are A couple more, just cant recall them currently. They need many more, would add A whole new layer to the game. Currently as is you instantly just think, Meh, liking the idea but nothing is really done with it.Graphics maxed out looks... okay. Good luck with that though.  ::CONS::Should NEVER have left Early Access. Unpolished elements in game make it very hard to feel immersed. Character walking into large trees when chopping them (every kind), glitching to vertical surfaces when jumping on them, allowing you to climb almost any veritcal surface. Creatures walking on vertical surfaces (serious emersion killer here). Un-responsive Followers; often ill finish A battle before My AI buddies even ingage ..sometimes over 20sec, or worse,  they dont engage at all! Not engaging happens around 1-12 battles. Ai followers have issues traversing terrain, causing them to telleport all over the place, often being the cuase of not engaging the enemy. Followers wont engage large deadly creatures.Single player needs A lot of love (*sings*whole lot of love!). Ever since the co-op players starting bitc-hing endlessly, the campaign has greatly suffered. If co-op is what your after you will find far more modding Minecraft to whatever you want it to be, as well as get some mental stimuli. What you cant get in Mincraft is an awesome solo player campaign. I guess you can't get that playing Planet Explores either. At least, not yet. Almost nothing but fetch quests, and A few kill monster quests. Plot holes in story. Very... basic writing. Not mutch happening here quest / storywise, sadly.Not rewarded for exploration. Meaning ore, quests, creatures, and terrain is all your going to find in story mode.The humanoid species on the planet (one of, if not -the-, primary plot point) serves little to no purpose and almost never utilized.Needs more Humanoid enemie varieties.Fear; you never feel afraid for your characters life causing quests to be that much more dull. Still not optimized enough, and runs pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ even on damn good gaming pc's.  Ground vehicles need phsyics ajustments in how they interact with terriain. They need shocks. They tip far to easy. Abit more horse power for hill climbing also.Un-realisticly Pointy/Sharp/Jagged terrain (big issue causing ground vehicles to be that much more useless) Dungions in Adventure mode have almost no effort put into them. Walls and floors look super tiled, with ugly, and repetitive textures.Physics are wonky at best.  AI (though improved) is Mediocre.  Building large amounts can drastically slow down your pc.  Trees, grass... well, anything involving nature is just okay looking. Needs more to make the planet your on feel alive. Bugs, birds, wild life, and sounds (or lack there of), etc. Where are the insect/animal sounds at night? or far off beast howls? give me something! How about some voiced NPC banter in camp or in battles. The game is missing soooo much AUDIO. Including sometimes being unable to hear what npc's are saying, crappy/no ambience, causing the game to be very un-atmospheric. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sounding effects. Needs better Vehicle sound effects across the board. Needs more effects. Ranged combat is sluggish, melee combat is almost useless. Devs should be thinking action melee combat; fast paced, flashy effects. Or at minimum Darksouls melee combat. No sensitivity adjustment for aiming causing bows to be almost worthless.Cant enter most buildings, and most look awful. Not enough in-game music, and out what little music the game does have, only one is worth listening to.  The game has some cool concepts but do to the sloppy core mechanics this game may never reach it's true potential. For whatever reason the Planet Explorer devs preferred to focus on adding co-op content instead of making A strong core (smooth combat, fun and function controls, sound, good effects, etc). Content comes after the core, not before.   ::Final Verdict:: The game is well worth playing IMO, but not for $20 bucks of your VERY hard earned money. If Planet Explores ever drops to $10-12 or below, go for it. Just go in knowing the game is far from complete. If you do, play your own music. Something atmospheric, something relaxing, and you may get some joy out of the game, like I did. The GREAT ideas are there guys/gals, and I sincerely applaud you devs for that. The ideas are all just lacking the much needed polish/fine tuning. To be honest overall I am feeling A little let down. This game could have been one of the greats. PLEASE FIX IT. It wont take much more to change this review to A positive one. Most of what I mentioned can be fixed rather easily. With effort.			"

												This is definitely a great game with a bright future. Even though it's in Alpha, it still has a lot of content and things to explore. The in-game creation editor allows you to make pretty much whatever your heart desires in terms of weapons, shields, vehicles, and decorations. I was never an artsy kind of guy in terms of drawing or modeling, but it is fairly simple to figure out how to work the controls for the editor. Also, there is a small built-in tutorial along with of a bunch of help amongst the community.There is also a build mode that allows you to place blocks and build structures. Unlike many other games of this type, it allows you to build multiple blocks at once through dragging vertically / horizontally, and offers you various shapes such as cubes, spheres, cylinders, cones, and much more. Along with this, you can also enter a free-view mode, which makes building much easier to control and look over.I haven't played the single-player campaign to its fullest yet, but it has been nice so far. I have primarily been playing on my multiplayer server with a couple of friends, and have been creating and exploring for many hours. Personally, the game is much more fun when you have others to play with, since you can go on adventures or see what others created themselves.To server owners: I personally prefer hosting a server from the game itself by going to Multiplayer > Host. I say this because the server controls are a bit iffy right now, and from what I understand, the ""correct"" way to shut down the server is to find it in the multiplayer list, select it and hit 'Delete'. With this being the case, the admin of the server is whichever character created it, and thus, they are the only ones who can do the process stated above. However, when hosting it from a .BAT file or whatnot, there is no specified character as an owner. As such, the only way I've found to shut it down is to either just exit out of it, or kill the process if using batchmode. Of course, there could be something I'm missing entirely, and I'm sure this will be refined more in the future.I'm rambling now so I'll just start to rap this up with some of the current, noticeable issues* Crafting currently seems to be split up between singleplayer / multiplayer, e.g there's some stuff you can apparently craft offline but not online...doesn't really affect gameplay that much though* The camera can feel kind of unrealistic and annoying to control, but they're supposedly redoing it entirely in the next update, so we'll see    * First and third person are both options (use scroll-wheel to change between perspectives / zoom in and out)* Entities (players, vehicles, mobs, etc) can sometimes fall through the world (primarily when in vehicles going at fast speeds for players [~100+ Km/h])* NPCs appear to multiply in multiplayer each time the server is restarted (e.g. a town will spawn all of it's NPCs...server restarts...those NPCs spawn back, on top of another set of NPCs.)   * Their town decorations seem to do the same (some houses end up with 5 doors on top of eachother, etc)* Along with that, objects such as turrets sometimes don't spawn in or fall through the world when spawning in in multiplayerOver all, as many other reviews have said, this is an Alpha game. If you buy it, expect some bugs and crashes. That's why there is a notification telling you this game is in Alpha. I myself have only encountered a couple bugs in game and maybe one crash or two. However, I don't know how other people's computers will handle it and what their experience may be like. All I can say is that if you don't want to deal with bugs or possible crashes, then I'd suggest waiting a while for it to become a bit more stable and then buy it. Currently, I'd rate it a 10/10 for an Alpha build, as it is honestly much more than I would've expected.			"

Early Access Review
								Open ended sandbox, storyline exploration crafting game. Build a base, populate and grow it.  Make weapons, vehicles etc.  Explore the world and search for resources such as ores and plants that are found in certain terrains, then use them to craft everything you need based on schematics you earn or buy from npc's.What it does right, it does very right.  What it does wrong, is horrifically bad.You can craft almost anything you can imagine.  Guns, vehicles, buildings, etc.  You make them.  All of them.  There are very few premades available in the game so you must make what you want or find the plans another player made.  If you are creative, you can make almost anything.  If you aren't and don't find other players plans, you shouldn't bother with this game.  A year ago, there were numerous ISO's for everything you could imagine, but now there are very few since updates have broken previous ISO's and creators stopped making and updating them.Vehicles include cars, bikes, planes, helicopters, boats, submarines, etc.  They all share one thing in common.  Movement with them sucks.  Real bad.  Helicopters can't seem to fly above the trees and that would be fine if they didn't get stuck on the trees if you hit one.  The ground is so uneven that any ground transport bounces all over the place and hits everything in sight, or just flat out gets destroyed from bouncing and hitting the ground constantly.  Turning vehicles is not as easy as you would think and often times hitting an object, backing up turning, then turning more going forward still results in you hitting the exact same object.  Vehicles can get stuck on the ground, on the plants, on rocks, etc.  Most areas of the map are actually faster to walk through than attempt to use a vehicle.  Drive into anything and your vehicle gets damaged.  Park near a predator and they will attack your vehicle until it is destroyed or they die.  Fly a helicopter into a flying creature you didn't see because of lag and who knows, maybe it stalls and you drop to the ground and die while your helicopter blows up into pieces and leaves you stranded there.The map is a limited use abstract with very little details but does allow fast movement between discovered points.  The scanner map shows you more of the terrain, but is very difficult to decipher if you are looking for ore and quickly becomes useless if you are digging into a ore vein since it clutters up rapidly.  Lighting is almost useless since personal lights point directly forward with no means to use them to light up areas above, below or to the side of the character.NPC ai is getting better but followers still get stuck on terrain sometimes and can easily be lost when you are crossing a long distance.Combat is very basic with melee attack only or manually shooting a weapon.Most quests are easily completed but some hunting quests give you only a name of a creature that is useless if you haven't been playing long enough to figure out what the different creatures are.  Some creatures for hunting quests are also difficult to find since they can be very rare creatures or travel around a lot.Updates are fairly slow in coming, but progress has been significant in the last year.   Crashes still happen fairly often but autosave keeps you from losing more than a couple minutes of progress so they are a minor problem.  Overall, the potential for this game is great, but it does need more work to be really enjoyable.  Mostly the vehicle controls and ground smoothing hamper the game at this point.  When it takes forever to walk from known areas to new mission areas, it gets tedious fast when you know a vehicle would be faster, but are so not worth the trouble to use.			"

Early Access Review
								This one is difficult...In previous versions we got a game that was almost feature complete and had working graphics with legible font. Combined with an interesting story, albeit not complete, this game showed great potential.I played 50 hours and thought 'Great Ill look into this again when the story is done'.Now I'm back after about a year and I found this:Worse graphics with illegible font and horrible normalization of the sound (which has great voice acting). Now I can't tell what the characters a saying and I can't make out the story anymoreSome freedom in the item creation system removed, fx. max one barrel in one gun (I guess it's now more realistic, but also less fun)Long loading times and also closing time of the game is extremeThe time to exit to desktop is extremeHardly any new features were added, apart from a half complete skill system, which takes the gameplay down a whole different track from where it came from. The game wasn't RPG'ish previously, and to be honest I don't think it should beConclusionAll this forces me into the conclusion that the developer either lost interest or lost financing.The developers will have to take steps toward completing the existing story content, and build a flawless GUI or at least a decent GUI.Also they should probably optimze the game code. Particularly reduce load and close time.As it is now I just can't recommend the game. It's not done and the developer didn't achieve anything significant over the course of a whole year.I do still think the potential is there, and the existing content is still good. So if you want to check it out, you should wait to get the game on sale.			"

Early Access Review
								So I have put quite a few hours into this now, which gives me enough of an impression to actually write this. That is not to say that time played by default makes my opinions correct, or at all helpful, but I will try.So I have been keeping an eye on this game since pretty much the start, maybe 2 years, not sure. But so far I have noted these key points.The Developers:#The developers seem quite dedicated.#They seem ambitious, almost to a fault but not quite.#They are a recent announcement to upgrade to unity 5 shows they wish to improve even what seems to be set in stone. #They are slow, but they are also detailed, few game crushing bugs have ever popped up.#They are a small team, and not as vocal with their community as I would like. (keep this last one in mind when I describe the game, as it means alot when it comes to visual assets.)The Game:#Graphics are pretty good in some ways, but a letdown in other.#The art style for humans leaves them feeling a little less real, and can be seen as a little cartoonish#Character customization leaves a lot to be desired but has come a long way since earlier versions.#Animation leaves a lot to be desired but it has been already announced they are going over the animations from scratch and making very impressive leaps, set to be released in 0.90 along with Unity 5 engine.#Combat is currently clunky, ranged weapons are your only real weapon, use a bow at first but aim for a laser weapon ASAP and a large supply of batteries. Combat in melee is not an option at the moment but in a recent video they have shown great progress in the combat system coming in 0.90 Unity 5 update.#AI is parted into what seem to be factions, often you will see animals fighting in clear and defined rolls of hunter and prey, truly one of the fantastic parts of this game.As for my impression of the game as a whole?I like it, I played through all the story that is currently there, and when I hit that first message saying I could not take this mission because it was not currently complete, I was left begging for more.However I do worry the 0.90 update will require a total restart of my play through, but with all I have learned, and baring major changes, I will be able to do everything even better and even faster next time round, I know where you hid my aluminum you sly dogs!I would buy this game again, but there is one fact I must stress to all consumers. So please read this and take it to heart.This is an early access game, you may end up with something you did not expect, it may be bad, it may be good, it may be total trash, but you knew this going in, you paid for an unfinished untested product and it is your risk alone to take!

Early Access Review
								Yesterday i came back to this game after a year or so away, and found it seemingly unplayable compared to older versions. I posted a bad review urging people to stay away from it until the devs fix the issues i was having (unresponsive keys/mouse) then something happened about 15 minutes after i posted that makes me change my recommendation to thumbs up. I got a message on steam from one of the devs (very quick response time) who told me how to solve the issues i was experiencing... very easy fix... reset key bindings to default ! I had never thought to do that as i have never changed keybindings on the game, but low and behold, instant fix. I have over 100 hours on this game and was / is among my favorites. Keep up the good work on this game and I want to thank developer zede05 for the quick response and help to make this one of my favorite games once again. VERY much recommended.			"

Early Access Review
								In short: Yes, I recommend this game. It's beautiful and fun to play alone or with friends. Just remember it is early acces alpha and give it time for updates. It's already improved leaps and bounds in the past 9 months.This is actually the first game I took the ""early access"" chance on and I don't regret it! It has however, spoiled me with high expectations for other early access titles, lol.I love building games and for me, this was the first voxel builder that let me work with different shapes. Awesome.It also has furniture and decorations. The creatures in this game have a wonderfully alien feel to them and the mega-huge boss mobs are very impressive and inspires a definite ""holy $#!+, we are supposed to kill THAT?"" *runs away* feeling. Exploring is great, even early on before you have the materials to craft the ridiculous aircraft and such, you can make jet packs and grapling hooks for some seriously fun travel through the world. The feature I'm most looking forward to at the moment  is farming to be fully functional in multiplayer mode since that's where I spend 99% of my time, playing with my friends and family on our lan based servers.Combat needs to be a little more interesting but they've already stated they're working on that and sooo much more. The devs regularly communicate with their players and are regularly pumping out updates and hotfixes. They're also working on making the single-player story mode into multi-player which was a huge request from the players. Yes, it's alpha, there are still bugs though most of the game-breaking-frustrating bugs seem to have been taken care of since I started last spring. This is without a doubt one of my favorite games I found on Steam. A hidden gem of sorts, and while it isn't finished, the progress it's made already is phenomenal and I always look forward to the next major patch to see what craziness they've managed to pull of next!

												Planet Explorers stands proud as having the most creative freedom of any fleshed sandbox/survival game I've ever seen. From mining the terrain to collect resources, to crafting, colony creation and NPC recruitment, to being able to build your structures, weapons, armor, helicopters, jets, motorcycles and tanks, and even your very own Kitchen sink how you wish. PE utilizes a fully minable voxel world, along with a building and creation system that lets you bring your imagination to life. *The voxel creation system. You can build weapons, vehicles, and even armor through a voxel creation system that let's you shape, color, and even texturize. Not only create them, but use them ingame for their determined roles.*Colony NPC recruitment. While there are plenty of games out there that have colony management, It's noteworthy to mention that recruiment in PE is about finding randomly generated npcs (aswell as pre-made npcs if you're playing story mode), that you can recruit into your colony for different roles. You can have them farm, gather resources, upgrade equipment, or patrol your colony to protect it from assailants. You may equip them as you wish, and even recruit them as followers to acompany on your journey. They all have unique appearences along with names (The names list is a bit short at the moment though..). They also come with their own sets of skills that you can have them train other colonists to have aswell.*Sandbox Creative Storymode. This is a big one.. Pathea has created a sandbox creation game that includes a storymode, without any cut functionality from adventure mode. Not only have they done this, but they've also gone and made it multiplayer. You can either play this on a public server, or host a private game with friends only!*NPC combat AI.Monsters have been programmed to act according to what they are, rather than a default all-round AI slapped onto everything.. One creature will not engage the same as any other. Birds will keep distance, and swoop at their pray, or come in close temporary for a close range attack before swooping away..  Different bird creatures will even do this differently than others.. Not only do they have their own AI packages, but they also have their own animations specifically designed around them. Humanoid NPC's, followers and colonists, utilize the different tools and weapons you give them based on situation. For example, you can give a follower a sword and shield, and they will engage into melee, until their hp gets low, in which they will withdraw a distance from the enemy. If you've given them a ranged weapon aswell, they will draw their bow or gun and continue firing at the enemy from a distance, while they heal. If they have an axe in their inventory, they will aid you in cutting down trees.If you have an inkling for design, and would love to see your very own creations have a purpose and use in a sandbox world, Planet Explorers is a must!

								Pros: Nearly unlimited creativity. Want to fly a Millenium Falcon? No problem! Even if you are not very creative, installing other peoples wondrous works is as easy as drag and drop.Exploring is fun! Some cool scenic locations as well as hangliding through alien canyons. Storyline is solid. From the intro with Carl Sagan's quote to the mystery behind this planet, I really craved more.Cons: Everything that comes with alpha. Bugs mostly that range from annoying (falling through the ground) to storyline breaking (Mainline npcs turn invisible). Despite there being over 200 different animals, most of their animations and actions are too similar. Runs up to me, swings claw defines most animals (not all though).Overall, this game is great and worth the buy. You can put a couple hours into it or hundreds, there many possibilities.			"

								One of the best games I have played that has to do with surviving, hunting, and crafting.Do you like jetpacks, gliders, parachutes? Cars, Helicoptors, Boats? All kinds of guns from using bullets to energy? Making monorail trains even? Then you got to get this game.Comparing this game to other games out there, like Minecraft or Terraria/Starbound, this game is like those but plays even better, and with better graphics. Not to mention, you can either go for co-operative survival, or free-for-all/secretive teaming survival like you would in a game like Day Z. I should also mention, this game allows you to create your own items/vehicles that can be used anywhere in the game!I very highly recommend this game to anyone who has played any of the mentioned simular games to this, I bet you'll love it, no doubt.

Early Access Review
								I really enjoy this game;  I've put almost 900 hours into it at this point;  The game is worth it, even if they never finish it, it is very fun.FOR REVIEW OF CURRENT BETA GO TO BOTTOM.Current form:32-bit, memory threshold limit is 3.6 gig; game locks up if your system memory allocates 3.5 gig of active memory to the client; does not affect the server.  Game has some story bugs that can crash or ruin a game save; always save your game in multiple slots and often!!  The interfaces are not scalable; that is being fixed.Multiplayer:You can create your own server or join others; you will have to open ports on your router and direct that port traffic to your computer; as such, you need to set a static local IP for your server within your router (lock your IP to your mac address), so that if you reboot your computer it will retain the same IP.  Take that IP and now open the ports that the game tells you to in your router, directing that traffic to your server only.   MP servers can be set to allow pvp, or simply cooperative.  The creator of the server can set people to be admins, unable to build, or kick/ban people from the server.  Once you start the server, you do not need to join the game for it to run.  At a certain point your digging will cause some parts of the map to not load (due to the 32-bit veersion and 3.5 gig memory threshold),  when this happens, you cannot log in.  To fix this, stop the server, and delete the files in the voxel folder of your server, located in your steam folder.   Multiplayer is being worked on too, and will hopefully have the ability to capture the flag soon.The Workshop:The game workshop only allows you to share your items after you start the game; choose to play multiplayer; select or craft a character; and then open the workshop to upload your item.  Sometimes it is difficult to upload, just keep trying.  The only way to find items however, is to select a category and then page through all the items under that category.  Search by name is ridiculously bad.  Icons of your items are super lo-res and blurry, unless you load a picture of something you made, then people won't know what the item really looks like.  The Workshop on steam makes it so you can easily find stuff, but you cannot download the item when you subscribe.  So the in-game workshop is hard to use and has blurry pics, and the steam version is easy to use but you cannot import from thereThe ISO creator (voxel crafter)This creation system is awesome;  There are pre-crafted parts for:sword handles; gun and barrel handles for single shot and multi shot, rifle and barrel handles for single shot and multi shot, laser blaster tubes and handles, vehicle tires (multiple types), vehicle engines(multiple types), vehicle batteries (multiple types), vehicle lights(multiple types), vehicle exhaust, vehicle Cannon, vehicle tank cannon, vehicle machine guns, vehicle gatling guns, vehicle laser guns,  vehicle  missile tubes, motorcycle seats, vehicle cockpit, aircraft cockpit, boat wheel or cockpit, boat scews, boat rudder, VTOL engine, jet thruster, helicopter rotor, and some I probably missed.  These pre-fab items can be scaled in size in any or all of three dimensions (changing size modify's the item ability), made invisible.  The material editor allows you to craft voxel creations, in solid forms, paint by single voxel, extrude from voxel, a single voxel can have its volume changed and that single voxel used to make very thin walled items, swords, etc.  The creation system currently allows you to make static items from the size of a toothbrush to a one-room schoolhouse, it allows you to make swords, hammers, maces, axes, rapiers, a pistol with up to 4 barrels, which shoots one shot per barrel or multi, a rifle that allows the same, a laser pistol, a 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 wheeled vehicle such as a motorcycle, car, truck, tank, any of these vehicles can be made small (volkswagon) to super large (stretch hummer), you can make a boat, a raft, a submarine, any large ship from a battleship to an aircraft carrier.  You can make hovercraft, helicopters, jet aircraft, flying platforms such as dirigibles, air carriers, air battleships.In game Crafting with BLOCKS:Like minecraft, you can take blocks of material which you have mmined or crafted, and build shapes suh as buildings, walls, platforms, houses, castles, forts, and other mega structures out of multiples (10+) material types including diamonds and glass. Once you make the house or building, etc, you then can selct a box around the house and SAVE that structure to memory.  If you ever need that structure built again, you can select that recorded item from your memory and drop down as many copies as you want (so long as you have the proper materials).The Storyline:Its unfinished and needs some serious polish.  Adventure mode is super boring.  Much of it can hang/crash the game.  Make sure you save often and in different save slots every time you save.  Since the story is so unfinished, I can't fairly critique it.Game Physics:Currently its Unity four, so physics are standard;  the new version will radically change physics, wheel collision, weather activity, material reflection, water movement and reflection.  The combat engine is weak and is being worked on at this time.Game UI:Too busy, unscalable, and seems like placeholder;  This is true because the UI has been completely overhauled and we will see many complaints about the UI to be resolved in the next update.  UI is standard from inventory sort, split, multiplayer drop, discard, to the standard row of hotkeys, and a minimap.  Once the new version is released all of these UI elements will be changed to be a blue interface which will be scalable.World Editor:This editor works on its own, but will not allow import into the current game build.  There are many more ores which can be mined in the world editor which are not in the current game build.Future versions:Currently the game is still Early Access, and the version .90 64-bit version has not yet been released.  It is approx. 1 month late at this time; 5/17/2015 10:00 MST  This is still an alpha build.A cool item that will be released before beta:  armor designing in the editor.I recommend that you buy this game.-MeatballBETA .88 & .881 of Alpha .90 review:The new beta is much more visually stunning.  The shadows and light attentuate over distance, giving real world lighting.  The character's hari animates when moving, and the body muscle groups shift as the player is animated.  This also occurs on creatures that spawn.Creature AI is much better than previous versions.  Creatures seem better able to dodge and run if they are in flight.  Be ready to have to run downsome creatures when you are on a quest.The rope gun is currently not in the game as it causes major issues that the programmers are unsure they can overcome.The game is now GPU intensive and I can hear my video cards rev up when I am in the game, and instantly slow down the moment I go to main menu or alt-tab out of the game.Creatures actually seem to be walking on the ground, and when on inclines, they match the incline.Wheeled vehicles now shift their tires according to the ground elevation, so a car sitting on a hump near one tire will elevate that tire into the car body to simulate real world suspension.Guns have been weakened and they only allow one barrel now.  I am unsure if I agree with this as some bosses are overpowered and a supped up gun is almost always your best bet.The build system has been modified, and the game makes it much more like the creation system for ISos.  It needs serious tweaking and due to its new interface and clunky way of highlighting the area around the brush, I find it difficult to use, especially when trying to mate a block on an already crafted block.

                                 Should you buy Planet Explorers?Let me preface this quickly by saying a few things. I used to do almost nothing butplay Minecraft. I was running servers and had little free time to do anything else.With that said, ever since then I have had an underlying desire to find a game that allowed an in-depth level of creativity while being set in a world that isn't Minecraft.I played Starbound for awhile, but I was craving the full 3D world that Minecraft had. Anyways, enough about Minecraft. My point is, I honestly believe that my search hascome to an end. This game is amazing. It has the creativity aspect I longed for, it has the constructionI wanted. It even has a sense of danger while exploring.From what I have played, it sucked me in, and hard. Now, I am not going to say this game is without it's faults. All games have them and this is no exception. It can take some time to figure everything out (I still haven't got it all), but that is part of the fun.It still needs some optimization to fix some minor issues, but it is getting regular TLCand updates from the developers. On to why this game is awesome:• You can build to your hearts content   • Buildings/Houses   • Vehicles (Cars/Flying)• You can mine deep into the planet for resources.• You can craft a massive amount of items   • Armor/Weapons   • Food   • Furniture• Jetpacks and Gliders!• There are HUGE Monsters to fight• Multiplayer!• The planets are gorgeous• There is a solo ""Story"" mode with missions• You can have companions• + A lot more!Seriously, I feel this game has the potential to be the next big game to play withyour friends and shape the world to your hearts content. If you loved Minecraft and have been looking for something new to play. BUY THIS GAME, DO NOT HESITATE! "

								Simple reason for voting down: This game is stuck in early access hell. Many of this game's old problems still exist so very long after it was first released. I'm sad to say i'm not convinced the studio is/was serious about making this work, and every month that goes by with minimal development gives birth to similar games and projects.The longer you guys wait, the less chance your game has.A game with great potential, possibly ruined by uncommitted developers.

												As others have expressed, I really tried hard to like this game, but it all feels very underdeveloped and unrefined. After playing this game for over 30 hours or so, I wanted to compile a list of things that I had a problem with, for those hesitant about purchasing this game as I have.*LONG load times: Regardless of which mode you play on (Story, Adventure, Build), you'll find yourself having to fast-travel around the large maps provided. However, each and every time you fast travel, the game has to load in. I've experienced loading times as long as 5 minutes or more and in worst case scenarioes, even had to reload an autosave after the game froze \ crashed. I understand that games do need to load in lots of data at a time, but having to wait so long just to get back to my colony is ridiculous and tiresome.*""Story"" Mode needs more STORY and character development: I cannot stress enough that there needs to be more STORY in Story Mode. When you first begin Story Mode, it will give you an introduction cutscene showing you and a group of colonists travel the stars on board of a starship. Only moments later, some kind of event triggers and you and your shipmates get shot down and crash land on an alien planet, where you have to survive on. The story then thrusts itself upon you as you pick up the pieces. The characters that you meet say that they have met you on board the ship you came in from, but use the stupid excuse that, ""Oh you must have hit your head and forgot who I am"" thing, over and over again. I'm sorry ""Gerdy"" and ""Dr. Allen,"" but I don't know who the HELL you guys are, as the game never gave me much of a chance to meet you prior to this event.*The voice acting is TERRIBLE: After the introduction cutscene in Story Mode, you'll quickly notice that after talking with the first NPC you see how robotic and how stale and flat-toned the voice acting is. Most people you talk with in conversation don't even sound like a human in real life voiced them; i.e. they sound like a voice similar to Microsoft Sam. It honestly sounds like the voice actors recorded in the bathroom stall at their studio \ home. This is an issue because with a game focused on ""Story"" and ""Character Development,"" it's really hard to get immersed with all these different characters you meet along the way with the dialog so bland and boring. Either hire more talented voice actors or allow us to read text-only dialog, like in Adventure Mode. *The same BGM (background music) over and over: You can count with one hand the amount of BGMs that are in this game, as there aren't many to go with. It's not so bad at first, but after a few hours you begin to resent the music so much that you eventually disable the music altogether. *The majority of the questing is BORING: If you've played an MMORPG before, you know the routine: go from Point A to Point B, collect and kill stuff, and turn the quest in. If that's something that interests you, though, then this game will be great for you, as there are a PLETHORA of these type of quests.*Monster fighting is BORING: Enemies come in 2 varieties, just 2: Charge and attack you straight on with maybe 1-2 abilities, or ARMAGEDDON TERRORS that shoot laser beams and missiles at you. The enemies that just charge and attack you may have some abilities that also knock you around literally like a rag doll. Fight with enemies that use knockback are as follows: hit them a few times, dodge roll back, hit them a few times, etc. Repeat this and you win.Then there are some enemies that are like if Godzilla fused with a Gundam and proceed to start a mini-war with you. If you're playing on Normal like I did, they a virtually impossible to kill, unless you have great gear, a vehicle with weapons on it, or an hour or two in real life to spare taking it down.That's not even to mention that one of the only ""difficult"" parts about the enemies is that some of them can take A LOT of damage, e.i. they are damage sponges. *Skill tree system extremely limits to what you can or can't do: In Story Mode, you don't have the opportunity to use the skill tree system as you are with Adventure Mode, so when I saw the option, I thought to myself, ""Oh cool! This should make the game more fun!"" ..... It didn't and made it pretty frustrating at times.The skill tree system in Planet Explorers uses skill points that you can allocate to different skills, such as mining / chopping faster, gaining more materials doing those, doing more damage with weapons, etc. You get these skill points by killing monsters(2-8 SP each), mining(1-2 each node), chopping trees down(1-2 each tree), etc.Maybe you think to yourself, ""Well, the map is a pretty big place to just be walking around only, so I'll go get the parts and make a vehicle to ride around in!"" You take the time to gather everything you need, maybe even pimp out a custom vehicle ride in the vehicle creator. When you try to ""Export"" the vehicle into the game, though, you'll quickly realize that you need a specific SKILL to even Export something from the creator to in-game (which will cost you hundreds of skill points to farm up to that point). So say you farmed up everything and got the skill to Export the vehicle to the game. You place down your sweet ride and you're about to ride it, but OH WAIT! You need the specific skill to even DRIVE the damn thing (costs another 90 skill points). You see where I'm getting at?To even do the most basic gameplay functions requires you to unlock specific skills within the different skill trees. Can't use your new tool or weapon? Get the skill for it. Can't use a specific type of building block or building block shape? Get the skill for it. So on, and so on.I have played many sandbox survival games for many years and this is the first time I've seen such a system as appalling as this system. If you're playing this game on Adventure Mode, make sure to uncheck this broken system and just stick with the default.*Food and sleep meter doesn't have much of an impact to gameplay: I never once felt, during my 30+ hours of playing, that the food and sleep meters had any significant consequence against me. I never had the thought that, ""Well, my food meter is almost depleted. I better go eat something before I starve to death."" There's doesn't seem to be any weight or impact of the gameplay with the current food / sleep meters, other than just losing some stats temporarily.*NPC Followers and NPC colonists never shut up: This is just a minor point, but every time either an NPC follower or NPC colonists is in need of something, they will vocally tell you that they are in need of it. (I.e. ""I need more ammo!"" or ""I'm too sleepy to work!""). They will NEVER SHUT UP about it until you give them what they want, much like a toddler does when they want a toy real bad. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I could go on and on about many different aspects about Planet Explorers, but the point I'm trying to come across is that this game needs MORE work on it. There's lots of potential in this game, such as the in-game object / weapon / vehicle customization system (very easy to learn, fun to use), and the NPC followers with the colony feature (colonists can farm crops and material for you, base defense, building stuff, etc), but everything else around it needs refinement.If what I said above didn't dissuade you, as a customer, in your interest to this game then I suggest you at least download the demo of this game before purchasing and find out yourself.

												This! THIS is the direction open world sandbox games should be taking!I enjoy survival and crafting games, but the biggest problem most of them have is a total lack of purpose beyond simply not dying. They usually very quickly become boring and repetative because in game life, even more than real life, mere continued existence is simply insufficient as a motivator for the endless tedium and overly-elaborate crafting systems that lazy developers throw at us in order to disguise the fact that there is only a sketch of a premise for these events to be occuring as they do, or worse, no premise for their game and the player's reason for being there at all.Too many times have I played such games and tossed them aside because it's just another ""I'm here, because I'm here, because I'm here, because I'm here..."" game. Pointless. Useless. Devoid of purpose or meaning. You may of course have that experience with this game too, if you wish to do so in Adventure mode, etc., but I prefer having some story.Planet Explorers is not one of those pointless games. Playing through story mode once just racked up 96.8 hours of interesting and fun gameplay for me. While the dialogue and voice-overs themselves are bit on the amateurish side, the scope and breadth of the story as well as the concepts it seeks to convey are actually quite impressive even by triple-A title standards. Every effort you go to has a purpose. Has meaning. Right from the very beginning.Constructive purpose, no less. This is important, as most of these kinds of game when they have a premise at all, it is based solely around defense against onslaught by one kind of ravening hoard or other after the apocalyptic downfall of all human civilization. Usually lame♥♥♥♥♥zombies.To be sure, Planet Explorers also takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. It just wasn't our apocalypse, or our world. Yet.The story has a little bit of everything. Humor and meloncholy sadness. Drama and light-hearted fun. Treachery, betrayal, vengeance. The triumph of hard-earned peace and safety along with the horrors and loss of a senseless war no one involved can afford.The thrill of real exploration and survival in a harsh environment with the odds stacked against you from the start. Not because of one single reason or agenda, but because half a dozen agendas or more and the chain of events they set in motion converge to create an unforseeable disaster from the viewpoint of any one group.Why are you chopping down a tree with this dinky little starting cleaver? Because old Gerdy was in the lifeboat with you and didn't fair as well in the crash. Now you have to craft a shovel to dig up the medical supplies that got buried when you came down.Why are you bothering to design your own armed aluminum hovercraft in the creations editor? Because you can sneeze a hole in wood and besides, you want your colonists to look badass when they fly four of them in during their show of force for the Puja in your efforts to bring them to the negotiation table for a peace treaty.The game actually strikes a very good balance in the players themselves between the impulse to get more done so they can see more of the story and the knowledge that they must pace themselves, or be caught unprepared at a crucial turn of events in that storyline. A story which has a lot of twists and turns that most often really are very much an unexpected surprise, which is almost always based around a 'Big Thought' concept.That's hard to find in nearly any genre of entertainment these days, much less a survival/sandbox/crafting game. This is stuff you usually only see handled in any way by hard and high-level Sci-Fi novels. And even then, only rarely are so many disparate such concepts brought into play for one story.I would love to see the implied sequal made and would happily buy it in early access. These developers did this the way games should be done. They created a world and a story, then built a game around that, rather than building a game, THEN hiring writer to give it an excuse for existing, automatically hobbling any creativity or flexibility in the resulting story, or it's method of delivery.I could be wrong about that, but even if I am, I must still credit them based on the grounds of their giving the writer(s) a great deal of freedom to tell an interesting story with their platform.I mean really, when was the last time you actually CARED about your NPC colonists in a game? Knew them by name, personality and profession? Sorrowed if they died, beyond a mere loss in your colony's efficency or production or some such?Story matters. Purpose in this kind of gameplay matters. Yes the game has some minor faults, but they are made less obvious and more minor because of the engaging story and sense of exploration. Easily overlooked.Game developers who wonder why their games are being ripped apart in reviews by players on techincalities of gameplay mechanics need to look at this game and realize that the reason it's happening to them, is because they have offered the players nothing else by which to experience or evaluate their games.No Man's Sky being perhaps the most recent and glaring example of this downward trend on a lazy treadmill. A game which reached legendary status as and has subsequently become synonamous with the very concepts of nihilistic futility and uselessness of effort.This game really does make you feel like you are exploring a new and interesting world, while still lacking in enough specific detail to allow players to fill in the blanks with roleplay if they like, or just fleshing out in their own minds for fun because the concepts and scenario are compelling to think about.This game was on sale when I bought it, but it would be well worth the money to experience, even at full price. It's sadly pretty much one of a kind.			"

Early Access Review
								A beautiful mess, and the reason I'll never buy another ""early access"" game on steam again. PRO- enchanting atmosphere, real alien planet feeling, vivid colors, everything is alive- nice music complements the beautiful scenery- crafting is great (can make vehicles, weapons, etc.)- you can fly, glide, jump, soar--- - you can CANCEL QUESTS!! (Skyrim, are u listening?!?!) CON- crash, burn, freeze like no other game- has been in development for ages and no end in sight- QUEST BUGS such as:    - get stuck in a quest coz NPC ""doesn t recognize you""    - unfinishable quests    - self-repeating quests (you finish it and then the same NPC        asks you to do the EXACT same quest again...)    - You never know if you did something wrong, or just bug Like when I had to protect my village from monsters and they just kept coming. After a while it became suspicious --- and when I looked it up online it turned outthey were supposed to stop after 3-4. I killed like 3-400 and they still kept coming. bull*hit.  Many times you have to escort NPCs (hate these in every game but especially here) and theyjust get stuck in the environment, or worse, simply disappear. Even when you escort them, sometimesthey dont seem to recognize this and they just keep following you ad infinitum. SUMI really love this game and it shows so much promise and I absolutely love the atmosphere. Unfortunately development has been...slow... and mostly unreliable. They seem to be more concerned withadding flashy stuff than making the game playable. At this point it feels more like an editor than a game. This game could be so much if it could ever get finished....tldr: add to your wishlist, buy when it s done "

												It's a game I have enjoyed and think with continued development it could be pretty amazing. I wouldn't have described it as release quality however.Before I say anything more I should probably say I only play offline/single player. With that said the one 'campaign' that ships with the game while not 100% bug free (And how many games are 100% bug free these days?) is pretty well done, the terrain is well made, the progression is steady and it doesn't take long to learn how to play and to reach your goals. There are one or two areas that could do with sharpening. A large amount of work is placed on the player to create their own vehicles. Yet the tools don't take into account mass, center of gravity, etc. And yet once plaed into the world both of these are pretty essential. Furthermore when using the templates that the game gives you to - I assume - get you started, they either come with parts you have yet to unlock, or don't work as expected. Case in point: The quest was to deliver an NPC to another area, she suggests that now you have unlocked some of the boat parts that you should build a boat to take her to the place she's going.I'm not a boat builder... so I used the templete provided within the system. The boat it produces looks amazing, however most of the parts used are still locked, having removed those parts or replaced them with the parts I can actually create, the boat will barely move without turning turtle. In the end I make a simple log raft that works pretty well instead.Often the obvious mistakes are like this, oversights as opposed to actual bugs or poor design decisions.The game as it stands has three 'modes'. Campaign mode (as mentioned above), Adventure Mode & Creative ModeAdventure mode is as far as I can tell there to show you how much better campaign mode is. It's full of bugs and overall badly designed.Creative Mode is fun for about five minutes, until you realise that while you can build anything you want, you can't interact with the world as there are no animals or NPCs.The game is officially now a full release, but if you want to try it in it's current state just pretend it's still in beta. It's not polished enough or infact complete enough (to my mind) to be called a finished product. It's given me some good enjoyment, and the system to design & buiold vehicles and weapons while not perfect can be quite a bit of fun. So do I recommend this game? Yes but with caution. Good sandbox game it is, finished it isn't.			"

								Ive owned this game since it came out almost 2 years ago, and I originally reviewed it as positive.  I cannot in good conscience recommend this game anymore to anyone.This game has (had) huge potential to be a good game.  It's voxel based, doesn't focus on graphics, and would be incredibly easy to add content to (presumably).That being said, I've waited 2 years for major changes to the game and they never came.  Workshop content and build sharing is fun, but to be point blank the devs let this game stagnate to the point where it's been outstripped by miles, by too many other survival/builder games.  We went over 1 year without an update, 1 year.			"

												I've had this game for years and I pick it up and play it now and again to see how far it's come along. I usually play for a few hours, put it back down and wait for a few updates, because it's still the same buggy mess. Well, now I find out it's no longer in early access, but the game is still extremely unpolished. I know they will still release updates, but it is NOT a finished product in my eyes.Other than that, the game has/had a lot of potential. Visually it's different from other similiar games, the crafting is really cool because you can make custom items and even share them on steam workshop, you are able to shape terrain, the way you build has a lot of potential, it's not prefabricated walls, you place them block by block, giving you the freedom to build incredible things. I wish these guys would have had the funding or team to bring this to it's full potential, but as it is now as a ""full"" game, I simply can't recommend it.			"

												I don't recommend this game at all.  It feels like Pathea rushed development on this to hit their publish date so they can just get it out of the way and work on their new game, Protoform.  I'm not sure why so many developers think that they can handle the development of multiple titles, but it is very frustrating.  I'm sure that the developers will continue to address persistent bugs through updates and patches, but now that they're moving full steam ahead on their new game, I seriously don't expect them to stay on top of delivering the game that they initially promised two years ago.

								This game is really fun for an early access, although I waited until a steam sale and got it for 14.99 (gotta save those shekels, oy vey!).It's like minecraft with great visuals set on some planet with dinosaurs. And jetpacks, planes, boats and bikes. That you build, from scratch in a CAD editor that is actually very simple to learn. It also has a story.It has bugs, nothing too major apart from pathing issues with NPCs. I give it 9 out of 10 yarmulkes. "

								An excellent addition to the sandbox adventure/miner sub-genre, Planet Explorers is, in a nutshell, what people who fell for the hype over StarForge were and still are looking for.Where Starbound is basically Terraria in space, Planet Explorers has that same relationship with Minecraft but manages to be better. While Minecraft uses block-based voxels to construct its landscapes, Planet Explorers uses OpenCL. This enables the terrain to be just as malleable as that of Minecraft, but look a damn sight better. Though admittedly OpenCL, being a prototype, has a few bugs, one of which is that vehicles travelling at high speed over rough ground have a tendency to clip through the terrain as of 0.85. That said, the bugs present in the alpha of Planet Explorers, albeit slightly frustrating at times, are easily more forgivable than those in certain AAA games (*stares viciously at EA and Ubisoft*) and barely put a scratch into the rest of the game.Story mode is easily the best of the three game modes, the other two being Adventure (basically Minecraft Survival) and Build (creative mode). Beneath the magnificent visuals - not to mention the aliens themselves (which look slightly less silly than those in Starbound) - there is a surprisingly well-crafted storyline with interesting lore and bright characters to explore. Item crafting in Story is tiered depending on how far you are into the story, with simple wooden equipment available for use at the start and more powerful armour and weapons being available for manufacture later on.Speaking of crafting, Planet Explorers has what far too few games of this genre have in my honest opinion - a fleshed-out  and incredibly detailed item creation system that is easily mastered to boot. One can create a huge amount of useful, fully personalised items and vehicles - swords, guns, bikes, tanks, helicopters, boats and airborne dreadnoughts, to name but a few. Unfortunately, it is not possible to create custom tools or armour, and firearms are limited to pistols, assault rifles and laser rifles (but this might change soon). Nonetheless, Planet Explorers' powerful item creation system gives it a big leverage over other games of its genre.To conclude: do I recommend this game? Of course I do. If you can forgive the glitches and bugs (take into account that this is an alpha, and not a fully released game yet), a wonderful sandbox adventure that has the potential to surpass even Minecraft in its scope awaits the lenient.

								This review is as of update [A0.85] and may change as the game progresses.When I first seen the game over a year ago I realized not much has changed.Never heard of pathea before but this game might put them on the map if they can execute it properly.Up's++ Stunning art design/concept art (Impressive)+ Able to build colony+ Amazing build functionality (Near perfect)+ Creation Editor to create vehicles, weapons, objects, vtols+ Open world voxel game+ Never lags even on full detail at full view distance (If it dose this is your computer or you got to many turrents up)+ Resource scanning (In games like mincraft dig anywhere, this game keeps you moving and building mining camps)+ Find NPCs and equip them for your colony+ Object editor (I built my own flag and it worked great)+ Power generators to power thingsDowns-- It's listed as a survival game, but doesn't ever feel that way (You can stand somewhere ALL NIGHT and most likely live)- Once you have a home monsters can't get to you (Except the robots, I'M firing my laser!)- Unfun no skill needed combat (Minecraft has better combat, and that's saying a lot)- Vehicle collision is awful (Tried to use my tank to climb up to get on a rock and fell into the tank and had to load a save, one guy online built a siege tower and couldn't ever use it)- Some mook is attaching grenades to my wooden arrows (Some effects are cheesy)- NPC's are gods that walk among us (Balancing issues, 2 of them killed a Coelodonta Greenback rhino in under 5 seconds)- planet explorers? Other than biomes, cretures and caverns nothing to explore in adventure mode- Needs cave systems you can access from above ground in adventure mode (Hopefully big enough to get lost in, and hopefully a cave exclusive resource to give you a reasoned to go into the dark and scary caves)- Cant edit natural landscape in build mode (Ex. Place Islands or Landscape around your structures)- Cant play adventure mode on build mode maps I make/download- Easy to become to powerfull for the game world to remain fun (Hopefully this is solved with moon travel)- Starting adventure mode with a alredy built town, where is the survival aspect?Don't think they will get it right>>""Negotiation with aliens, War with aliens"" This is the bigest thing being talked about with this game. A diplomacy system sounds incredible and would open this game up to strategy gamers. But will probably end up a quick and weird one time dialog option. It would be cool to fight your way out of a war chefs village after you insult him and break trade agreements or even have a rival tribe join your faction because your fear of there army>""Story Editor"" Would be great to add NPCs (Even hostile) >""Missions to the moons"" (Like build a ship for outer space and fly in it there? Go home pathea your drunk!)>""War with aliens, Missions to the moons"" (Hope their are stronger aliens on the moons to keep the game balanced)>""Hardcore survival mode"" Don't just make the whole game a fustrating pissoff, make nighttime a living hell where looking out your window might get you into deep $#!+> Increasing game difficulty gradually> Adventure modes survival aspectNotes** Low gravity makes for higher jumps, so it's not going in an unrealistic anime direction like some people thought* Would be great if aliens also had more complex bigger types of city's and not just small camps (Kinda like Aztec citys)* Multilayer in alpha ALWAYS needs work, so you can't complain* My friends are all going to wait until full release because of all the early access letdowns that have come out in the past, and I think they might be onto something* Terraria, Minecraft, Starbound and more had an area that looks hellish that you could go as your level got higher (Hope to see this in planet explorers* They need to make explosion and escape pod noises in the opening cut scene and get rid of the talking children it kills the mood of the game* Story mode probally will end up a 30-70 hour game so I hope they pack tons of content into adventure mode* My girlfriend dose not like very many games but the sci-fi aspect intrigues her (Gives me somthing other than NPCs to shoot at ;)  )Some reviewers think ""this is the next big step"". Some think they ""wasted more money on early access indie trash"". ---Only time will tell---			"

												It is very difficult to me give a straight Up / Down thumb.If I can I would give it a MEH thumb.The main problem of Planet Explorer is being ambitious but lacking on every aspect of the game, except the crafting system. The developer worked hard to provide a full feature sandbox game: dozens of creatures, materials, terrain types, procedurally generated worlds, game modes including a coop story mode, a super detailed crafting system, quests, dungeons and a loot system integrated with the Steam Workshop.What you get is all these stuff but lacking the right amount of deepness, they feels like still in prototype stage.All served with LOADS of bug, glitches and optimization problems.Once I started a cooperative game with a friend of mine I had a great sense of wonder... we really wanted to get sucked in this game. Sadly that feeling dropped after about 16 hours of gaming.Everything got repetitive and pointless really fast. We found ourself stuck in repetitive tasks  (mostly mining) and playing separated.In fact there is no reason to stick together, and even if you start playing willing to stay together, you'll end very soon wondering and doing tasks alone.Why does it happens?It happens for two reasons: 1) it is hard to find your mates (they are showed on the ""big"" map but you don't get directional clues on the minimap, so you get lost in no time)2) it is pointless being together because every ""quest"" is easy enough to be accomplished alone Even Dungeons are best in solo. They are just repetitive corridors fulfilled of monster where you get the loot just running through the enemies (ignoring them) and picking up the the loot crates  (mobs and bosses never drop useful stuffs).There is no real boss fight and when your colony is under siege, all the defensive work is made by the turrets you've placed all around.There is no reason to do real coop. Even the exploration.You can craft huge vehicles to carry all your party members... but ground vehicles are useless (they got stuck in the terrain every 30 meters) and flying vehicles are boring AS HELL.Even when  I found an entertaining way to travel (that is JetPack + glider) the exploration got boring pretty fast. You'll find soon that there is no real danger (you can overrun every creature), no real mystery and not a real rewarding aspect of exploring the world. Even the creatures are always the same. They can change shape and size but the behaviour patterns are the same used over and over.Even death is not a big deal in this game. You can't really die. You just respawn with everything you have. Damn.. at least take out my stuff and make me get it back where I've died.The real fun I got from this game is crafting. The shame is that your creations will be used in this doomed and boring world.Ok maybe this review ended to be too HARSH.Planet Explorer is NOT really THAT BAD, but the lack of deepness and polish in almost every aspect of the game is annoyingly hurting.Planet Explorer has A LOT OF potential but the developer needs to refine it A LOT more, because it still feels like an Early Access game.FINAL WORDSI don't regret buying it, IF it will get improvements.I hope I'll can give it a thumb UP as soon as possible.PS:I suggest the devs to focus on a single aspect of the game and heavily improve that, something that would keep up the desire of playing.My idea is to add some unique creation scripts that you get by EXPLORING the world. You can find it by luck or by acquiring around (NPC shop or dungeon) some sort of clues about how to find them.And creating zones that need a vehicle to be explored.			"

												Pretty fun and fantastic looking sandbox game.However, lacks some depth in 'purpose' (what is your 'goal' in the game) and gathering of resources is very clunky and slow.Has a lot of potential and worth checking out, but seriously, don't be one of those 'I just bought an Early Access game and hated it, wtf!' people.  Watch some videos, check out reviews, and if you're just not interested in 'wasting money' supporting a game that isn't finished yet, buy it on sale or don't get it.____Recommended!  This folks stuck with it, as best as I could tell seemed to listen to feedback from the community, improved the game, and released the game!  A lot of companies try to do this, but don't make it, and a lot of early access likewise.			"

								HiThis game got me captivated from the start, making the long grinding normally associated with sandbox games, a bit easier and faster, without taking anything away from the genre. Harvesting and collecting resources is still a grind, as it should be, but just much easier feel to it.The next thing that really got me, is the very unique creation system. Yeah, you can take parts of a car, connect it with material of your choice, just the way you want, and if physics permit, it will go. You will tripple your normal game time just playing with this, and it is not limited to cars, but motorcycles, VTOLs, aircraft, boats, weapons, armours, buildings.... just about anything you can build in game, you can first create and paint in the creation system.Now, all the game modes is not implimented yet, and there is a lot of bugs still, it is early access afterall, but it is already a great find and the single player story line is as captivating and immersive, even better than some AAA games. If I could add a double recommend, I would.			"

								It's crazy.  You run around killing things and getting better items like in any RPG-FPS thing, only it's a bit rogue-like in that you have no idea (at least at first) whether you've bitten off more thna you can chew.  Combine this with almost god-like powers to build things, both permanent fixtures and crafting useable items ranging from personal weapons to land, water, and air vehicles.  And no real documentation so you have to experiment, experiment, experiment.   Oh, and you can starve to death, too, unless you learn how to get food.  And once you get beyond these basics, there's a whole alien world to explore, quests, bosses, the works.   Fantastic concept and incredible freedome.  It can easily become a total time sink.			"

								Open ended sandbox, storyline exploration crafting game. Build a base, populate and grow it. Make weapons, vehicles etc. Explore the world and search for resources such as ores and plants that are found in certain terrains, then use them to craft everything you need based on schematics you earn or buy from npc's.What it does right, it does very right. What it does wrong, is horrifically bad.You can craft almost anything you can imagine. Guns, vehicles, buildings, etc. You make them. All of them. There are very few premades available in the game so you must make what you want or find the plans another player made. If you are creative, you can make almost anything. If you aren't and don't find other players plans, you shouldn't bother with this game. A year ago, there were numerous ISO's for everything you could imagine, but now there are very few since updates have broken previous ISO's and creators stopped making and updating them.Vehicles include cars, bikes, planes, helicopters, boats, submarines, etc. They all share one thing in common. Movement with them sucks. Real bad. Helicopters can't seem to fly above the trees and that would be fine if they didn't get stuck on the trees if you hit one. The ground is so uneven that any ground transport bounces all over the place and hits everything in sight, or just flat out gets destroyed from bouncing and hitting the ground constantly. Turning vehicles is not as easy as you would think and often times hitting an object, backing up turning, then turning more going forward still results in you hitting the exact same object. Vehicles can get stuck on the ground, on the plants, on rocks, etc. Most areas of the map are actually faster to walk through than attempt to use a vehicle. Drive into anything and your vehicle gets damaged. Park near a predator and they will attack your vehicle until it is destroyed or they die. Fly a helicopter into a flying creature you didn't see because of lag and who knows, maybe it stalls and you drop to the ground and die while your helicopter blows up into pieces and leaves you stranded there.The map is a limited use abstract with very little details but does allow fast movement between discovered points. The scanner map shows you more of the terrain, but is very difficult to decipher if you are looking for ore and quickly becomes useless if you are digging into a ore vein since it clutters up rapidly. Lighting is almost useless since personal lights point directly forward with no means to use them to light up areas above, below or to the side of the character.NPC ai is getting better but followers still get stuck on terrain sometimes and can easily be lost when you are crossing a long distance.Combat is very basic with melee attack only or manually shooting a weapon.Most quests are easily completed but some hunting quests give you only a name of a creature that is useless if you haven't been playing long enough to figure out what the different creatures are. Some creatures for hunting quests are also difficult to find since they can be very rare creatures or travel around a lot.Updates are fairly slow in coming, but progress has been significant in the last year. Crashes still happen fairly often but autosave keeps you from losing more than a couple minutes of progress so they are a minor problem. Overall, the potential for this game is great, but it does need more work to be really enjoyable. Mostly the vehicle controls and ground smoothing hamper the game at this point. When it takes forever to walk from known areas to new mission areas, it gets tedious fast when you know a vehicle would be faster, but are so not worth the trouble to use.EDIT: I have played over 100 hours before I got this game on Steam.

												I have a really strange feeling about this game. I enjoyed it, thus thumbs up, but I would be really careful about recommending it to anyone. Unless you know you are into such games, don't buy it. It has nice storyline, and I spent hours downloading and tweaking helicopter models, but there is not much beside that. The main supposed feature of the game - dig anything, build anywhere and whatever you want - it is not there. Yes you can dig up any terrain, but there is little sense doing that. You need to dig mines for resources. slowly with wooden tools first, then faster and faster, as you progress through iron, steel, diamond and ultimately CheatEngine universal digging tool, giving you literally billions of any resource in a couple of seconds, because farming in singleplayer is not something I fancy doing during this couple of free hours that I can spare for gaming. Apart from mines, there is nothing to dig for. I never found any caves apart from those from the plot, I never needed to build a bridge, dam or any other stuff that took hours of my time in Minecraft. You can design literally any vehicle, item, armor, weapon, but this design is but a skin. Mechanics-wise that will still be the very same default game object, just reskinned and with tweaked numbers. Vehicles are treated as single objects with HP. You can make a dumb sheet of steel with driver, weapons and engine just sitting on top, or you can make an intricate APC with components shielded by armor, and both these variant will work exactly same. When HP drops to 0, it explodes, can't damage a weapon, engine, or kill the driver. Functional buildings are all pre-made, so you just dig resources and 'buy' a power plant, which is just an object. I remember fun I had, designing monster plants in MC (where you literally build a facility with real output from irrelevant stuff that was not specifically meant for that purpose), nothing of the like here. Building a colony is little fun after you figure that you just need enough even land to place a bunch of buildings-objects together, but can not really design anything meaningful by yourself. Guess were it not for the story, I'd spend way less time in the game, and I have no idea what I'd do in it now. The story does it though, long, catching, true-like, with well-written texts. So, if you are looking for an adventure, that should be fine. If you want advanced Minecraft, it's not that. Not that at all.			"

								   Some of my freinds mocked me for picking this game up. They agreed (almost unanimously) that it looked like something a 12 year old would enjoy. Thats kind of what drew me to the game to begin with, its cutesy sci-fi theming. So they will not pick it up in case a friend of theirs sees it in their library and judges them non adults or some other social convention i dont fully understand.    Ill tell you what keeps me playing though, this game rocks! and dirts! and sands! and you can craft almost anything you can imagine. If the item you want is not something you can get a recipe from an npc for, then you can open the object creator and create it. if you have the materials in your inventory, you just export it to the game and BAM! your imagination, now realised. I mean anything too, need a weapon? no problem. need a car? no problem! need a chopper? no problem! need a town? easy as pie!    Admitedly, the object creator portion of this game could use some better tutorial in game... but there are a good number of youtube videos showing exactly how to use it (and some tips to using it more efficiently) so really the community has come together where the developers have delayed their efforts.    Remembering also that this game is still in alpha (currently at version 0.85a as of this writing), and plans to include items the fans have taken it upon themselves to create and share (tutorials, ISOs, and the like) may be in the works still, this game still plays really well. Ive had to restart the story a few times now, due to saves not being compatible with features added/removed in version patches, but i enjoy it (after the first few missions, anyway) each time since i generally notice something in the story line that i didnt pick up on before.    All in all, i would give this game 7/10. The music is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(its easy enough to turn off though), and the grass is distracting at best (the blades are too fat, and obscure the terrain too well imho) but again, easy enough to turn off... The game plays well, but without these 2 features enabled looses a lot of its gloss (themed music that isnt annoying as all get out would increase immersion, and better grass would make surface deposits more visible). I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes this builder/survival genre.  "

								This is one of the best games I have ever played. It is a mix of survival, RPG and voxel crafting/building. The story is very good (although it can be played sandbox mode) and the crafting possibilities are almost endless. You can custom design everything from armour, weapons and vehicles to building panels and decorations, imported textures/skins and all.Eventhough the building/creative aspect is massive, you can download other player's creations if you are not creative yourself.It is still in developement so there are things simply unfinished like the story mode and it has some bugs and optimization issues but these get better with every patch and the devs are very active. The game has been around for years, but it is HUGE. Even the current content is more than any other EA I know of and it is getting bigger.The gameplay is super fun, unique and rewarding. Where other games hold back, this game goes all out and does it in a balanced way. You start out with nothing but wooden tools, but not far into the game you will have a jet pack, glider, ground vehicle, helicopter, laser rifles, diamond swords, NPC followers, pet drones and more.  Although the random gen adventure maps need much improvement (and they are being improved) the handmade story map is beautifully made. The flora and fauna are beautiful. The art style is amazing. The creatures are plentiful, well animated and roam in packs that will make you stand in awe as heards of multiple types of creatures roam on the screen simultaneously. The resources are balanced and getting them is not grindy. The ratio of docile to agressive creatures seems right and even after hundreds of hours of play I still see a new creature or new plant that I hadn't seen before almost every time I play. There are dozens of different plants and animals.The biomes are beautiful, diverse and will keep you well immersed, from the grasslands to the desert to the jungles with luminescent plants that really make you feel like you are on an alien planet reminescent of Pandora.There are so many aspects to this game that I could write a small novel just fleshing out a full review and I still wouldn't hit on every point. BUT the game is streamlined enough, has a tutorial system worked into the story mode and has an intuitive enough interface that it does not seem complicated or hard to learn for beginners.I can't wait to see this game develop and am glad to get in on the relatively early stages.I would love to see the flight controls have more freedom. Hopefully strafing with A and D will be added as well as rolling with Q and E and directional rotation with mouse movement (like a standard flight simulator) but the relatively basic flight controls aren't really that big of a deal but they could be a lot better.I recommend playing the story mode to new players as it has a built in tutorial (the story quests cleverly teach you the controls and mechanics of the game) and the map is much more beautiful and optimised. The random gen sandbox maps are pretty bad in comparison and may leave a less than great first impression, but they are procedurally generated and are being improved.One can simply play the story mode map as a sandbox by just doing whatever they want and finding the NPCs manually (instead of following the questline to them) to buy the recipes for advanced crafting.First person mode can be accessed by pressing F5 twice. (hitting it once removes the mouse cursor and allows normal third person movement). Although first person mode works alright, it needs some improvement.Remember that the game is in developement and the story is not yet finished atm (you will eventually hit a dead end) and some colony management mechanics are not finished either. BUT there are already more mechanics in the game than pretty much every other EA survival/crafting game and many hours of fun can be had with the story mode especially since you can play it as a sandbox.PE can be played single player OR multiplayer, offline on a public server or private coop with friends. Admittedly, setting up a private VPN server is a little tedious as it is not implemented natively yet, but it can be done and I did it just by wathching a youtube tutorial. Even the story mode can be played multiplayer.You will not be disappointed with this game if you like the idea of a mixture of survival/crafting/rpg and understand what an EA is.Even if PE didn't develop any further than it currently is, I definitely got my money's worth and will continue to play it for hundreds of hours, but the devs are not showing any signs of slowing down.

								Pro:- Open world- Active development- Active community- Can share and download things your create- Multiplayer is funCons:- Huge distances to cover on foot early in single player game.- AI is not the best, path finding needs work.- Lack of terrain tools to work with. Over all PE is a fun and enjoyable experience, however some frustrations come up when NPC get stuck and you have to walk a half mile back to get them. Crafting is great and you can download creations that other players have made easily. If you are looking for an open world, good single player story, base building, resource gathering game, then PE is for you.			"

								[Edited for clarity.]Wait.  If you play this game now, you'll very likely ruin the experience for yourself later.  It's similar to hearing a spoiler for a good movie or sneaking a peak at your presents before Christmas.Here's an example.  There are two epic items to craft in this game: the glider and the jetpack.  Most importantly, there's only one  first time  you'll build either of them.  If you really have to struggle and strive for it, then it's an extraordinary reward.  Conversely, as in my experience, if you're able to build both of them in the same session, after less than an hour of mining, then it cheapens the whole experience.Speaking in generalities, the game lacks ballance.  Gameplay jumps up sharply and then plateaus for a long time -- jump, plateau, repeat. For crafting, the game started well, but soon became boring.  I spent a few days hacking at trees, trading, and crafting simple items.  Much too quickly, though, I gained access to advanced recipes, thereby skipping about 80% of the game's content.Difficulty is similarly unbalanced, with roughly 3 levels: wild animals, aliens, and giant robots.  Leaning how to kill the aliens was a fun challenge.  The giant robots, however, are perhaps 10-times more difficult to kill, and there are no enemies between these two levels of difficulty.Survival is way too easy, and without that pressure, gameplay has no tension or excitement.A.I. feels very basic.  The wild animals exhibit no complex behaviors; they don't socialize, eat, sleep, or communicate.  They are nothing more than wandering bags of meat.  The aliens, who should be intelligent, are glaringly stupid, and this ruins immersion.Visually, the game is gorgeous, and I absolutely love exploring the fantasy world.  Just be warned, though, that gameplay is loose and sloppy.  I've stopped playing because I don't want to spoil the game for myself.			"

								After playing loads of Terraria, I was looking for something similar in 3D.Therefore I decided to try Planet Explorers, Fortress Craft Evolved, Space Engineers, and Starforge.Unfortunately I haven't tried Minecraft.Planet Explorers is already very content rich and focused very much on crafting.There are tons of different materials, many recipies come in different assembly possibilities (meaning you can craft the same item with different base-items). Crafting a base/colony and protecting it with automated systems is part of gameplay.You can build vehicles, design own items (like vehicles, weapons, housing) for fast crafting in the gameworld in an easy-to-use editor.There is currently a single-player-only story mode, which is fun to play and introduces you step by step into the different concepts of the game, while providing an interesting story.Multiplayer allows you to define your world. You can choose between Game Modes ""Build"" and ""Adventure"" - giving you different access to ressources (Build - as much as you can carry), recipies, and quests. This is combined with 3 different Game Types ""Cooperativ"", ""VS"", and ""Survival"". The difference between these types are how Teams are created for PVP. While in Cooperative, there is only one team, Survival offers no teams - everybody for themself, VS allows you to choose up to 4 teams.This is combined with two options: infinite ressources and play with/without monsters.In adventure mode - npcs offer random quests but with no story on the bigger scale.In multiplayer you are currently limited to 3 character slots.The character customisation is not yet very broad at the moment - but seems to be work in progress.Another cool feature are the different monsters - ranging from very little to really huge.With this the game gets a little the feeling of Final Fantasy.

								This is my most favorite game of all time.There aren’t enough tags to describe what this game has to offer. 1st person-3rd person-open world-sandbox-tower defense-base building-crafting-exploration-random gen-massively multiplayer-sci fi-RPG-survival-CO-OP, and much, much more.But that being said… it needs so much work, and yes, I know it is still in alpha.The ambition behind this game is incredible. The delivery is amazing. The overall quality… Not so much. Not yet anyhow.Gathering resources is frustrating and time consuming. It’s almost impossible to dig a hole without having it be massive because where you aim and where you dig is different every hit. The animations make me angry. From swinging a pick to having to stop and kneel to pick up plants and flowers, most take too long and there’s no weight behind them. This makes playing survival or adventure mode very, very time consuming and almost always frustrating.The game lacks any sort of explanation on how things work and you’ll find yourself either giving up in frustration or scouring the wiki and discussions for answers.But underneath the very rough exterior is the most amazing and beautiful game I have ever played. The worlds are huge and richly populated with alien animals, monsters, lakes, rivers, oceans, mountains, and caves. Each player in a world gets their own settlement where they spawn, which could be anywhere (even in the middle of the ocean) due to the games randomly generated worlds. You can farm, mine, hunt, build, explore, swim, and battle massive enemies, robots, mutants and monsters. You can build a mansion on a mountain, or a bunker under one. You can fit your base or settlement with turrets and shield generators to help fend off would be attackers.Seriously, check out some of the all-time popular screenshots in the community hub. But none of that is where the game shines the brightest.Everything from buildings, swords, shields, guns, boats, helicopters, jets, and anything with wheels can be built in a voxel editor. Anything that flies, floats, drives, shoots, blocks or swings. If you can think it, you can build it, and use it in the game. What you can create is almost limitless. This is the ultimate sandbox creative game. It just needs A LOT of polish and some time.I would recommend this game in a second.If anything you just read peaks your interest. If the video on the store page made your eyebrow raise.Buy it.But maybe hold off sinking your teeth in and getting a big bite… Just a little while longer.			"

								It's finally here after over 2 years of EA! if you enjoy sandbox games this is a great one that also has RPG and adventure flowing in its veins.  Unlike most Sandbox games it also has a good story and questlines to follow. The developers are a small team but they have managed to put out a great product and have committed to continue bug fixing and patching after release.			"

Early Access Review
								You can see i am playing this game for quiet some time now; why do i have so many hours into the game? it's because i am working on cars and ships in the ISO editor most of the time, then go into build or story mode (where i mined enough items and build a colony that works pretty well) and test those creations. At the moment PE is a great construction platform where you can test your creations inside the game environment. That said i am missing alot of tools to be able to make better shapes then you can create right now, or only in very difficult and complicated/timeconsuming ways. While i have alot of time and patience myself, i can see why many players don't really try to make nice looking creations, but only stuff 'to get the job done'. Physics are off too in the game, so that makes it even more complicated, for example leveling a ship so it doesn't tilt, or a car getting stuck on every little bump in-world ect. pp.I get more to the physics later on.The Storymode is fun, because it shows you the mechanics of the game, and introduces you to the basics (and more). At first it can be a little bit confusing when you start in the ship over the planet, but with a little patience you can overcome that.I didn't play multiplayer very long, because it crashed all the time with memory overflow errors. guess i bought it at a time where they just updated the game from 0.86 to 0.87 and a major bug or bugs kept the game crashing for me. I don't want to get too much into detail what it was, but they fixed that pretty fast in 0.871 so it was playable again. That said, you will run out of memory in adventure mode fast when you travel around alot because the game is still 32-bit, which means that you only have about 3 GB of memory for the game, which is not enough for a long playtime, specially when traveling around alot. (The Textures don't  seem to be updated, they just get added until you crash when you run out of memory space.) I can play story mode in nearly best quality for a long time before things go wrong though.The developers are working on a version they call 0.9 which has 64-bit and the new Unity 5 engine, which hopefully solves that memory problem. Gameplay: (i am talking about story mode now, because that is what i usually play:)Although it is alot of fun to play the story, you can see and feel that there is still a lot of work to be done to get the game into more then an alpha stage. i don't really need perfect combat animations, ( they promise to change the combat in 0.9, we'll see), but the world, as pretty as it looks at first glance, becomes pretty uninteresting after a couple hours of gameplay. it just lacks a certain... detail here and there. I think i can explain that to myself reading from others that it's a small team programming the game. How much more detail there will be later on nobody can predict at this point. I also have to put in the fact that the game came out 2 years ago, but they are still working on it, so i see that actually as a positive aspect, keeping a small team in mind.However, there are huge differences in graphics quality that i cannot explain: The animals look GREAT, i mean GREAT GREAT... the area around them for now is more like average compared to them. The animations could be better, but for my taste are more then good enough to make them feel very much alive. The plants, trees and so on on the other hand don't move at all, they are like statues, and if you hit a smaller tree with your ride, it gets damaged and that small tree doesnt move at all getting hit by a 50 t  4x4 tank ;-) . Physics are still lacking here big time, and that is only one example of the physics not really working right atm. I hope they fixe those things later on. The currency in story mode is 'meat', which is... something getting used to. I suggested 'protein' for a supplement, and i got a response they consider it. We'll see :-)  (this is another indicator they take your input seriously)From what i hear they use cash or credit for multiplayer, which is something people just are more accustomed to in games... why just not keep it that way? I never played a game before that uses 2 different currencys in different game modes, and it just complicates things...I understand they want to make the story mode more like a survival game mode, but just using a currency that sort of suggests that isn't enough imho. Don't make currency you can eat... no other food at home? just eat some dollar bills! :-)That gets me to the fact that i never really feel it being a struggle to survive. At all. You must be pretty dumb or very unlucky to die in story mode. (Running into animals you don't know if they attack or not for example... You can avoid those animals quiet easily.) You cannot starve to death, you just run out of stamina and you get slower. That's it. You cannot dehydrate, you don't need to drink. For me those are basics for a survival game, aren't they? I don't really see that myself as a big disatvantage, because i like to play in easy mode(s), so it's more of a relaxed gameplay rather then hectic fighting. Getting old.... ;-) But i am sure it will bother other people. Games like ""7 days to die"" do a better job on that: you take damage if you run out of food and/or water plus you run out of stamina while using tools, even more so when you are out of food.talking about 7 days: On the flipside i don't like those zombies in 7 days (again personal preference), i would prefer dangerous animals that prey on you and that you cannot avoid as easily as in Planet Explorers. But that's another game and another story. I just hope that someday they make a game where the good parts of both games will come together the way i like to play a survival game... :-) back to PE:Spoiler alert:  The whole mode shows you how to build a colony at some point, and you can build a monorail later on, which keeps you busy for a while. But survival? Not really at this point. The colony system with planing / harvesting food seems unbalanced and not really needed at all atm, because you cannot die of starvation, you just run out of stamina, and you get slower, that's it. I have a pretty fast computer (i7 3.5 ghz with GTX 770 Nvidia), and my colony is down to about 25 - 30 frames now because of the farming simulation, That really shows it needs alot of optimisation. I would prefer they start optimizing things (balancing, physics better framerates) and make the planet look more alive then filing on combat moves. But that is just a personal preference...I got this game for 50% only a little while ago for 12,50 dollars. (daily deal), otherwise i would have waited longer to buy it. I am happy i got it, i enjoy it alot, even with the shortcomings it still has right now, and as you could see i use it mostly to create stuff. Love that part to death. For 24.99 dollars it's still a good value if you enjoy the story part, which takes you about 20-25 hours to finish (rough guess, depends on many things how long you need for it), and i played that one 2 times alone, because you have the freedom to do it in many ways. Use your imagination.Oh and one important tip: finish the missions one by one, that keeps you out of trouble with bugs. I don't want to go into detail because of spoiler alert and too long of a story :-)I hope you find my pov helpful, thx for reading!			"

								I meant to write a review a few hours ago,... but the game distracted me and kept me busy the whole time!!It's not polished yet. But it's functional and fun.FUN!  It's all about functionality right now. Not much in the way of teaching you how to do what you need to do. Just quests and crafting and hunting and building. Still fun!!! and intuitive enough that you dont need any tutorials.The monsters need some kind of name bars or something. There might be a tutorial on the ship before you crash in the future.  I wish the gatherables had some kind of notice, or range ring, or somethign that says  ""get this close before you try to gather"" or "" you are using the wrong tool, you tool"" to cut down on the trial and error. The map has random features that dont seem to coincide with what is there.The focus on functionality has made this ALPHA more fun than many retail releases. Good jorb bra!			"

												Another early access game pushed out the door prematurely for the sake of profit. A lot of incompleteness.- No dynamic AI pathfinding; waves of attackers cannot detect player-made bridges, so will stand still and wait to die if they cannot find a path. Even your own colonists are unable to use staircases.- Quest triggers inexplicably fail frequently; I had to load a previous save on at least six seperate incidents in the story due to the game not detecting me having brought certain NPCs to the objective point.- Indoor dungeons have no ambient sound, no footsteps, no sfx for moving objects, etc.- Storyline ends abruptly and without closureThe game itself has potential for excellence, but it feels like one where the developers dreamed too big and ran out of budget near the end, so had to launch it without polish. A few more months of polish and it could have earned glowing reviews.			"

												TL;DR: Ambitious project with a lot of wasted potential and performance issues. Stay away unless you know that its a game you will enjoy (and have a strong pc.)It's okay but since its appearance on Steam there have been so many survival games developed that it has sort of lost its charm.When the game started being developed it was a quite unique Idea and that's why so many people probably chose to support it. Unfortunately the devs inexperience became apparent after a while. They obviously did their best to make a working game but in reality a few more experienced dev teams started doing laps around them with all the survival games out there.On the postive side it has a pretty unique item creation system, which is basically a 3d modeling app inside the game.On the negative side it still suffers from framerate issues and occasional instability (i wouldnt count on that getting fixed), and the graphics are reaaaally matter-of-taste (I dont like the style we ended up with at all unfortunately)I can not really recommend this game to the masses, if you have a very specific taste and like the functions this game has it might be worth it. Everyone else will have more fun with some of the more polished survival games out there.here is a list of problems I've encountered.Constant microstutters even on ""fastest"" setting.occasional 1 second freezes-Objects pop in visibly on the horizon, vegetation is visible before the ground textures are shown which creates ""floating"" grass textures.Picture looks very blurry at high settings.My System is Win 7I5 3350pRadeon R9 270x16 gb ramI can basically play anything on ultra (In some games I have to reduce Anti Aliasing)Possibly the game runs better on Nvidia cards (because of physics calculation) but a game should be optimized to run on any current system within reason.

												Backed this game way back in 2013, tried running it on my potato, gave up, forgot about it.Installed it on a whim and 75hrs later... wow! Now, let's start with the bad: This is definitely not a buttery smooth polished triple-A game. Planet Explorers has every mark of an over-ambitious idea that the developer struggled to fulfill. Gameplay is a tumorous mass of many different systems that range from kinda fun to passable to downright infuriating. I could pick nits for days: The durability system is rage-inducing. The combat could use a lot of tweaking. The creation system, while cool in and of itself, has only a marginal effect on gameplay.That said, there is about as much jank and brokenness here as there was in Skyrim or FO3 at release, and those were triple-A titles with a similar premise.Now that I took a dump on the game, here's why you should get it: Do you want to feel like a Planet Explorer? Get this game. Planet Explorers gets a thumbs up and a permanent spot in my ""good games"" bookmarks because it captures the joy and wonder of exploration. Up until the very end of the story playthrough, the game consistently delivers moments of ""whoa, this is awesome,"" or ""what the hell is that? I should poke it and see what happens.""  There are several different biomes - not a new concept. Yet, unlike those of some other games, the biomes of Planet Explorers actually look, feel, and sound different. There is an astounding amount of (visually) unique flora and fauna. The landscape is sprinkled with several landmarks and points of interest that are not marked on your map until you find them (unless it's for a quest). Sure, my companion NPCs may be teleporting repeatedly into midair behind me, but I don't care because I'm hang-gliding through a massive freakin canyon with like three kinds of weird lookin' birds flying around and HOLY ♥♥♥♥ IS THAT AN ALIEN DAM UP AHEAD?!A word on the story: It's actually pretty good, and, dare I say, engaging! The pacing of the story is interesting as it progresses from pure survival, to exploration, to colonization. There are a few twists and memorable moments. I was also pleased that, despite the glitchiness of the game systems, I did not run into a single case of the story getting stuck or quests getting messed up.TL;DR: The gameplay systems are quantity over quality due to overreaching ambitions, but the atmosphere is freakin A+ good. 8/10, would explore again.Aside: The original kickstarter for this game asked for only $100k, and got $140k. Comparing this to all the KS's that got millons and produced jack diddly (looking at you, Broken Age), I'm impressed with what these guys managed to pull off. I'm sure they had other sources of funding, but the fact that they managed to spin up with so little is still impressive.			"

												This game is a unique experience that you won't find elsewehere.  There are a lot of really cool aspects to it that make it fun and intriguing if you can get past some of the rough edges.  Whether you gets hours and hours of entertainment out of this game (like I did) or get annoyed with it probably just depends on what you're looking for in a game.If you're looking for a game where you can explore, gather, craft, DESIGN & build at your own pace without worrying about frantic optimization and balance, this game is for you.  If you enjoy a mysterious and compelling story taking place in the early days of interplanetary travel, this game is for you.If you're looking for a super-polished, combat-focused, silky-smooth gameplay experience, this game is probably not for you.Overall 8/10.Here's a breakdown:The Good:Smooth voxels!  Rest in peace to damn ugly cubic voxels.Compelling story left me wondering what happens next.Resource gathering, crafting, colony development, and customization is well-developed.The environment visuals are pretty good considering almost everything is desturctible/interactable.The Mediocre:The music is well composed, but the lack of variety makes it a bit repetitive.Combat is passable, but not exceptional.Needs improvement:Voice acting is not the best.  The engineer in me cringes at some of the mispronounced technical jargon.NPC behavior can be erratic at times, especially during quest transitions.I was certainly able to look past some of these underdeveloped aspects of the game and still derive a ton of entertainment and satisfaction playing it.

								I have gotten way more gameplay out of this game in its alpha phase than I have in many other finished games.  The worlds here can be massive, the creation options are only limited by ones imagination, and the potential for further game development is endless.  The devs are active, updates are steady and useful, and there's already a ton of user content available.  The coming addition of the world editor adds further customization options.  It's all pretty exciting... hitching a ride in the development process is groovy.  This game and Prison Architect have generated a ton of goodwill from me directed towards Early Access.Highlights for me so far include:- Exploring certain luminous areas at night.  The flora and night sky can be striking.- Building a massive base in a cave system- Learning to use the jetpack... and sometimes going SPLAT- Building some crazy/interesting/useful community ISO items, like a VW bus, great weapons, and the Millennium Falcon- Running into the Giant Robot once or twice and getting absolutely (and humorously) destroyedNow, I would say that this sort of gameplay has to be your thing... not everyone is going to dig it.  Mining and gathering can get a little tedious.  Harvesting plants is sometimes a large pain.  And like any alpha, there are some bugs (though I've not had any real problems), and things are going to need to be fixed as development continues.  But the potential... stacked on to what's already here... is, again, pretty exciting.If you like rpgs, sandboxing, exploration, creation and all that jazz, this game could be a great fit.   And there's still much, much more to be added to the game, so the potential is limitless.  I can't wait to see where the game goes in the future.  I hope to be playing it for years.			"

								I think the game is worth it in its current state, you can build cars, aircrafts, boats, and different buildings in the world, so the creative part of the game is 100% playable and very enjoyable in my opinion. If you only want to build and build and build you should definitely get this game. But you can't really do much with the stuff you built (in survival/adventure) because of performance issues, so if you only want to play survival you may want to wait until they fix the performance related problems/release a 64bit version. I played my world in adventure mode for over 15 hours before I stopped because it just became unplayable. It happanes after some time, the game will constantly run out of memory and will run at 10-15FPS (it starts at 60 and gets worse and worse as you build, mine and do stuff). I have an i5-760, 12GB of RAM and a GTX 770, for reference.			"

												this one is really hard to review. Pros - really good sandbox, with lots of crafting options etc. Nice graphics. Great soundract. If only it was a finished product...after a few hours in adventure mode, when my base was finally set up and had lots of colonists assigned to all task the story mode got to a point where I had to deal with a virus. It wouldn't be a hard thing if it wasn't for the fact that a key NPC went missing Adisa just dissapeared. Even though I can see her in the list of colonists she is nowhere to be found. Too bad as the last dialogue suggested she found something related to the virus.Several times I saw my colonists drift through walls, ceilings/floors so I assume my key character got stuck somewhere among voxels :( All in all I cannot go any further in the story mode. Also it is worth mentioning that when a base grows it also happens to affect controls in some way - right mouse button does not work as it should near my base (i.e. I cannot pick up my vehicles). When I move certain distance from my base - problem dissapears.All in all the game is far from finished. If the devs finish it and solve the problems with dissapearing NPCs and other stuff the game will be simply great.			"

												Why tf would you leave early access when the game is not finished. Devs you say future updates will occur but I doubt it will be anything major. This game needs work and you need to finish it if this game doesnt get fixed I have no intention in buying anything else from you.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has been in development for many years now and it's gotten no where basicly and by the time this game is actually something that can be recognised as done, it will be outdated, especially with the VR system slowly nipping at developers' heels. I feel this statement should be made before anyone bothers to read on.As a long term game for people to immerse themselves in and love. A long term game that will be one to come back to for many years to come, this game is NOT that game.This is a broken game now and a waste of an investment for the rapidly changing future to come.First off, I'm going to state how low the patch rate for this game has been, the type of rate where there was a whole YEAR before a patch came out.Everything about this game is a bit dodgy, down to the operating system problems that developers roll their eyes at crying ""alpha, alpha."" to the harrassment of reviews, I've seen countless reviews including my own being hounded by a developer and a community spokes person or whatever they call themselves. I'm sure as someone reading this you'll notice comments on others' reviews by such persons as well as mine. Comments saying ""we re-wrote the game so that's why it looks worse"" on comments from those saying the game has managed to look worse two years later, which it has! To things like patch releases claiming fixes but in more than a few cases any fixes aren't even noticable among the CLUNKY crap pile they expect us to be blissful over.In 2014 the developers told everyone they were aware the game does not work for Mac and they were ""working on the problem"", today STILL many MAC users suffer much hardship with this game down to simple things like the launcher working properly or caarrying on with their fingers crossed praying for things not to crash for the millionth time, and they still sell it advertised as compatible for Mac. I guess you can call it compatible if you really want to stretch the truth paper thin. What makes me laugh though is this situation has been approached with such ignorance by developers, like ""it's your rig"" but let me tell you when someone has been playing games on their new MAC for a couple months with other games with no problem and then crash endlessly with Planet Explorers, I'm feeling there is a bit more than a rig problem there. The game does crash even with windows which I currently use. I've had crashes with this game on windows 7 and 10. ""Oh wait, give me a moment the launcher is not responding... My computer just froze"" problem...Also the personal issues, this game makes me feel like it induces headaches, legitamitly, the graphics somehow a hint of fuzzy even with a GeForce GTX 960 and 8G of RAM I should be set for this game and the sounds, I feel like there is always this static background noise going on, but they want us to think it's a breeze or the ocean... I'm sorry but a breeze doesn't sound like that. I feel like I spent most of my time playing this game just taking excedrin migraine pills just to continue not to mention the clunkiness of the game in general is stress inducing.The game suffers constant crashes and corrupt save files and when a update does come around you need to restart your game.The developers have been working on this game for two and a half years before being put on steam, now an additional three years and its practically in the condition and place in development as it was in the beginning of it's steam release, some would even argue it's gotten worse since it's steam release.250k copies sold at $24.99 give or take. I bought this game right after release and I bought two copies, I have so much regret250k x 24.99 = $6,247,500http://steamspy.com/app/237870I see such little effort on this game it hurts, this game needs a better budget plan. They have enough money to develop this game more than they have, anyone can see that by glancing at the patch notes.Had a great time struggling through constant crashes and corrupt save files only finding myself to start all over again many times.10/10 Would Prefer The Stinging Of My Zoom Teeth Whitening Treatments Over Crash Landing On This Planet And Exploring Ever Again.

								Hello, I'd like to state that this game is simply amazing! If you love minecraft with a mix of Sci-Fi then I can declare this game is for you. However I must inform you this is the Alpha so you can expect bugs, freezing and loss of items however they will appear again later when the latency in the server pans itself out. There are many pros to this game in its current state which is Alpha, most games in this state aren't even playable however this truly is.      The combat system could use a little work however it still is pretty good, multiplayer could use a little bit of work due to the fact you need to port forward to host.. maybe there will be server hosting in the future for those who can't do it on their own. All in all this is a great action, adventure game jam packed with all of your creative desires! I would recommend this game to anybody and I would say buy it while it is 24.99 because most likely they will require you to pay more for the beta or the full game.			"

												I have a little more than a hundred hours on this game, so I feel confident to give a complete review on it.The cons: Although it's been released, it still feels a lot like an early access because of little bugs and weird behavior of some feature. Here some examples: - Water behave weirdly. It is in infinite quantity (like in Minecraft) and therefore is not always very realistic. Water passes right through wall and any placed block so when it rains, it rains inside houses...- NPC are brainless (e.g. they dive of cliffs and roofs without care), have the weird ability to pass through walls and the uncanny habits to always end up where they will most bother you.- the world is beautiful on the surface but in adventure mode you will have things like sand on roof of caves, patiently waiting (without falling down mind you) for you to mine it. In general caves are plain unrealistic (and there is no cave-in so mad miners can feel free to dig and dig and dig)The good:The concept is truly great and I SO wanted a solo game like wurm or rising world where you could built towns that would not be just empty ghost towns and where NPC actually do some work in it (farming, processing)The replicator concept is great and work really wellOverall, I do not regret buying this game because it is fun and has all the things I really was searching for. But it really feels like it needs some polish to feels less like an early access and more like a finished game (with the potential of a blockbuster). I do hope that its release doesn't mean that it will stay like that and that patches will be released to fix all that needs to be fixed. Anyway, it is already fun the way it is, so I won’t cry if there is no meaningful patches in the future. "

Early Access Review
								Epic game, lots of fun if you like building games. For $24.95, even at full price this game is well worth the value. The developers have made good on many of their promises, though they may have set their own bar too high. As it stands, if this game never got another update I feel like a certainly got my moneys worth - much better than many AAA games that costs $49 or $59 on Steam. No Man's Sky will have a lot more stuff to do (a similar game on the horizon), but it will also be a $60 game. ;)So a couple points about Planet Explorers:Build Tools ROCK! Love how easy it is to just pull and drag out whole walls, columns, floors you name it. What might take a few days in a game like Minecraft to build you can get done in 1 day since the tools make building both faster and more fun. The barrier to entry in regards to building your first castle right from the start is almost none.Exploration is pretty cool. You can walk around for hours discovering new stuff, new mobs, locating hard to find resources. If you like to just explore and see what the world has to offer, this is a good game to do it in.Smooth Voxel epicness! No more Minecraft cube clone with this game.Combat is OK. It could use a little more fine tuning obviously, but it is there, it works and plenty of weapons to craft to take down both standard enemies and bosses. Yep, it has bosses and they are HUGE and dangerous. ;)Colonies and multiplayer. Multiplayer just makes it great - team with friends, load up a previously worked on world and work on building your empire together. I currently play this with two other friends and we always have fun.Active developers. It is a small team so what you can expect for a game of this complexity? As I stated before, in it's current state, $24.95 is a steal for how many features are in this game. If it never got another update I would be fine. That being said, the developers, while sometimes a little slow, stay on top of the project and continue to work on stuff and make it better and bigger.In conclusion, with the transition to Unity 5 an already great looking game just got even better looking. Don't expect lightening quick updates and constant patches every couple weeks or month - and honestly, this game doesn't need it. It is stable, it is fun and offers something differnt from all the cube based Minecraft clones out there.			"

								Absolutly amazing Game I recommend this more then any other game. it has gorgeous visuals and many aspects of gaming. You can build what you like Conquer whom you like, Hunt the aliens explore and mine and gather resources its a mix of all good games in this yearIts a 10/10 rated game in my opinion only problem is some lag as they are still trying to get the visuals right. You most certainly need a very powerful Pc like and i7 and a powerful Graphics card to play this but its worth it. no other game i have seen on steam is as good as this this has everything the average gamer needs  possibilities are almost endless on this game And the replayability is really good.

								One year has passed and the game is still in alpha stage, not even beta and be sure it will stay in alpha for ever. The proof is that we now have ""beta updates"" of an ""alpha game"", totaly nonsense, if the game is in alpha then all updates are normal updates. So don't be fooled, what you buy now is the final game and should be criticized like every other game, not as early accessAnd for now, here is what is the actual game:- Really poor optimization. FPS drops/ stuttering (often 20 fps with a rig wich run every actual games at 60fps ultra )Nearly unplayable when fight againt more than 2 or 3 mobs- Graphics not as good as in trailer, sometime look like a 10 years old game, crappy textures/models/animations- Bugged story mode due to awfull pathfinding (npc can be teleported undermap, you have to save/reload many times)- Most sounds are missing (turrets have no firing sound, fighting creatures have no sound, etc). The few sound wich are present are crap (gunshot sound, footstep)- There are 3 music running in loop, they are awfull and absolutly no SF.- Memory leak that makes the game laggy as hell after an hour- Crashs Crashs Crashs "

												Waited for years for it to develop. Recently it came out of EA and it's still the same buggy/half-made game it was 3 years ago. Instead of the price increasing as it went out of EA, it actually received a price drop, basically screwing up all the supporters (I actually bought it more expensive as an EA than the price it currently has as a released product).Oh well, they probably realized it ain't even worth 5$...Briefly:-Clunky controls.-Bad UI.-Non-existent combat.-Weird animations (from weird movements to/ not being sure if you actually swiped your weapon and hit the enemy).-Big but mostly uninteractive and non-immersive world (Yes, you can dig and make a boxy hole anytime in the ground and so on, but it feels empty and dead - no soul to it).-""Settlements"" are worst than Diamond City in Fallout 4, no real place where you can tell some civilization exists.-Not bad per se but monotonous music.-Some lines are voiced (I'd rather it was not voiced at all than suddenly having a line in a paragraph voiced and the rest just text, leaving me waiting like an idiot).-Limited character creation (Just a few preset heads/hair styles but weirdly many colors).-All NPCs are basically the same copy paste so nobody stands out or is memorable.-Story a bit decent but consumed by the negatives. It could actually become a very good game, but unfortunately it didn't receive the love it required from the Devs.I'd probably not pick it up at all, but if you are THAT interested, then don't pay more than 5$ - 6$Although short, I hope I've been helpful.

								I have to open with the fact that i really like this game.  Its fun, it has a load of potential and the devs are quite ambitious.  I bought this game well over a year ago now and its only a tad further than it was at purchase.  I really enjoy what this game has, but there is just so little.  I might recommend this game at release, but as of right now its progressingly slowly enough that I worry the devs will just eventually lose interest.			"

								So I put a decent amount of time into this game and these are my thoughts on the game.- The ISO systemThe ISO system is easy to use you pick some base parts (like gun barrels and handles.) and put the materials you pull out of the ground onto them to create new and personalised weapons vehicles and aircraft.- Adventure ModeThe Adventure Mode is the sandbox mode essentially and you get dropped onto a randomly generated world that can be fairly large with just the basics and you can do anything from there.-Story ModeFrom what I played they have an interesting allbeit cliche story. The background information and the landmass you play on are both plentiful and interesting. They added a lot more since the last time i played and I am genuinely excited to play it.-Build modeThis mode gives you all the equipment all the materials and is just for testing ISOs. No AI spawn which is unfortunate because i would like to test my weaponry to see if they work well or not and build a huge colony.-MultiplayerI have only played Multiplayer a handful of times it seems pretty well fleshed out it plays like Adventure mode but has other players in it.All in all I enjoy the game and will continue to play it in the coming years. This game is still in early access and still needs work done so while playing I recommend not looking at the bugs to hard and to make note of them and let the Devs know.			"

												My first review ever so bear with me.To start of with the good things:- Huge world- A lot of customization- A ♥♥♥♥♥on of exploration- Enormous amounts of things to craft and buildNow for the ""less good things""- The music is absolutely terrible. It's so cringey that I almost wanted to refund the game right away before I even loaded up singleplayer. It really sounds like something Family Guy or South Park would make a complete episode about.- The combat is awful to say the least, it feels really sluggy and most of the time you will be bashing your left mouse button because there is no option to hold it down and keep attacking. Also a lot (all?) of the enemies won't even flinch when you hit them with a 5 meter long sword, making combat feel more like a turn based system then action.- The movement is buggy as hell and is very unresponsive, feels very unpolished.- Dungeons, those pop up randomly on your map, and most of the time come in forms of a huge mountain with an entrance or some desolate factory which you can enter. Thing is, these things are so big and pop up randomly, making them vanish just as quick again if you just run slightly from it. Very immersion-breaking, they also make some weird noise when they show up which sounds like a seagull being strangled by a string of plastic. The dungeons itself feel mostly empty and get boring really (i mean really) quick. The mobs in it are way to strong for their level and take a lot of hits before they actually die. I wouldnt consider this a bad thing if the combat itself is actually good and responsive, but most of the time mobs just miracolousy dodge my attacks despite me standing half a meter from them. - The map drawing and fps is low considered to other games of the same caliber, but this could be due to the slugginess the game itself already has. Overall this feels like a game which hasn't been polished at all, also the fact the devs consider this game ""finished"" makes me suspicious for the future for this game. I do not recommend this game for this price at the moment.			"

								Around a year and a half ago I gave this game a negative review, which I felt was honest and accurate at the time due to the lack of progress and multiple missed deadlines by Pathea during early development.Because of the recent beta release, I am happy to be able to change my review to positive.There are still issues in the game, especially with melee combat controls, but generally the game is enjoyable and the developers seem to have learned from past mistakes.I have only been playing story mode in single player since beta, so I can't comment on multiplayer functionality, but for me the game is currently worth the money and probably one of the best voxel based survival games available on early access.The quest system in story mode, ISO creation system and lack of zombies makes for a refreshing change to standard “cookie cutter” survival games that have flooded the market in recent years.

								Ok, I started playing this game long before I actually purchased it over a year ago. I instantly fell in love with the shear magnitude and pretty much being able to design ... well anything, weapons, vehicles, armor etc etc etc..! Every update seems like alot more content.  So when I seen this game was on sale.. I had to buy myself a christmas present.  Which I did and I quickly began to work on the story mode for probably the 8th time (always got as far the game would allow me to) So when I got up this morning and started the game and realized it wasnt going to let me continue where I left. Let's just say I was a little piturbed (did I spell that right?)  But after I seen that there was an update. And began to play... well just say  5 minutes later here I am writing a review.Thats right, the game is still running in the background because I couldnt hold this in... Before this latest update the game was cute, well drawn, and just fun to play.If you read the update notes, they state this latest update is pretty much a complete overhaul.So after the update? This game is no longer cute, it's F-ing BEAUTIFUL!! The graphics have been completely overhauled, and the GUI made more user friendly, this game is looking more like a different game every second, but they kept the best aspects of it. I dont normally get too excited about games, but if you dont have this one... you are wrong!! I am going to buy a second copy as a gift for my friend.. I suggest everyone do this before they ""final release"" this game and start charging what it is actually worth, even in its current state.			"

Early Access Review
								Ive done my waiting! 4 Years! And still we dont get a decent successor of minecraft!Planet Explorers has the first engine which look decent. Other than other Unity voxel games it goes a new way, away from the block shaped minecraft clone worlds.What is the engine capable of?- generating a very nice looking 3D environment, with rivers, lakes, hills, mountains and endless oceans. A whole map can be 40x40km, thats not even close to be as big as a minecraft world, but still big enough to satisfy a great number of players.- having a lot of free roaming animals, that even work in groups, defend each other or fight other species.- having building sized boss enemis, with a great amount of different attacks (I mean seriously building sized, they are ♥♥♥♥ing huge).- complete voxel based 3D mapping. You can dig through every mountain for ressources, still the areas arent made of simple cubes, also you dont have a restriction of placing objects in a square system. And sometimes you can find gigantic caves, that even have lakes and rivers inside of them, big enough to fly through them with helicopters.- oh yeah, the game also has vehicles and guns. And the best part is: You can build them all by yourself (this would be maybe the current core element of the game)- A colony system with real working NPCs like a Real Time Strategy GameWhat are the cons?- lack of actual exploring stuff- lack of balance (if you start on a gold and iron / aluminium spot, you can make your end equip in 30 minutes, or you die over and over again, because there is an enemy alien camp right ahead and constantly raiding you)- from patch to patch fluctuating between super stable and crashing every 15 minutes- you need a high end PC- you need to be very creative in crafting, or you are bound to other players workshop stuff- overpowering open world bosses are way to easy- sometimes annoying gamebreaking bugs like selfkill with a melee weapon- lack of content to doThe main course:Crafting:The game comes with a complex editor, that allows the player to design his own guns, swords, shields, vehicles, boats and helicopters. It also allowes to craft free style objects without deeper purpose, that can be used as furniture, from a simple chair to a laptop with detailed screen.Being awesome as it is, the editor doesnt glance with user friendlyness. Even making a corner or edge or diagonal structures can be a pain, creating round, sharp, beautiful looking or complex filigrane objects are only possible by...I dont know...havent figured it out jet. And the other players arent really helpful in answering this question.Also using material for your objects changes its abilitys. Every ressource has stability and weight, with aluminium being the most useful ressource, due to its strength and low weight. Creating a good looking weapon and also giving it good stats can be a painful balance act. For example I figured out, that a strong gun should have 40 aluminium as building costs. That way it would have 170 damage and exactly 100% accuracy. Every try of building it bigger would decrease the accuracy under 100% so that the gun wont shoot a straight line anymore.Swords are even worse because I still havent figured out, how to craft sharp blade structures with the editor. But the damage of the blade is calculated from the size of the weapon and how sharp the front is. I have found a workaround, but I dont think this is the way the game should be used.Building vehicles is awesome, but currently the game restricts you, wherever it can. You are not allowed to use every vehicle part for every type of vehicle. You have restrictions of maximal parts of one type. I dont know if that is supposed to be some sort of balancing...For example you can use big thrusters instead of rotors for your helicopters, but you cant use those thrusters in other vehicle types. Yeah, maybe it doesnt work this way, but...why do I also cant use the helicopter energy cells on ground vehicles? I can use them on boats, why not in a car? That way, a tank rapitly runs out of fuel and ammo and isnt capable of doing long range scouting + fighting great amounts of enemys.All in all you still can do a lot with the editor. More options are already announced (armor crafting).Colony:While in minecraft you only build houses to feel happy (and be save at night), here you can build up a functional colony, with defence systems, factorys and farming. Also you are able to recruit NPCs to work for you. This currently only works in Singleplayer.All in all Planet Explorers is a decent try of a open world sandbox, where you finally literally can do, what you want. I hope they wont let us down.			"

Early Access Review
								I've just recently started a single player storyline version of this game. Overall I have to say I am enjoying it. There is not much to not like. Sure, there is a slight grind collecting materials (if you've played MMO's like WoW, I don't think it's as painful as their grinds!!). While collecting materials however you're immersed in a vibrant world with creatures fighting between themselves for survival.The UI is straight forward but I haven't started base building or item creation yet. The basic replicator usage to create 'recipe' items is very easy, and I like how you can click up and down through the layers of items you need to build up towards a more complex item - for example, you need gunpowder and copper to make bullets. But you have no gundpowder, simply click on the gunpowder Icon and suddenly you're looking at the gunpowder creation screen... how intuitive! There are a few tricks with the UI that had me briefly confused, such as 'do not have the inventory box open while trying to loot animal corpses or interact'.The story line is easy enough to follow, and the quests are interesting enough. The side quests are optional but you can get a lot of handy stuff like the recipes you use in the replicator section. Buy the recipes in shops from NPC's, don't waste your meat (meat is money) on the actual item. Meat also can be converted to fat... fat plus charcoal equals gunpowder... you get the picture... A few tools like made of copper or iron, and suddenly you're collecting resources like a boss!This game has some slight challenges, a sizeable world to explore, but most importantly it is thoroughly relaxing to play with it's intuitive gameplay and music...ok, so I have my music turned down but I haven't turned it off completely like I do in most games!

Early Access Review
								WAIT TO BUY THIS GAME.P.E. still needs a lot of polishing, but I think the game is, even for Early Access, at a point that it can be very fun and is playable, which compared to other Early Access games is saying something. The downsides start to pile up when you look at multiplayer, which honestly is pretty damn lackluster, as well as a HORRIBLE mess for server admins, and personally I bought this game to play with friends, not by myself.The creation and sharing system is by and far the strongest plus for this game, it's fairly easy to make things that look and perform well, and even better that you can spend more time and effort to make something that mimics something from real-life, another game, book, anything. Single-player and the story-mode are fantastic, and paced well, it allows you to learn the game at a fairly brisk pace without swamping you with all the extras and nuances to the game and others like it. However, multiplayer is a bit of a different beast, and the main reason I can't reccommend the title.My first issue with multiplayer is that a large chunk of the game is inaccessable. All the stuff is still THERE, buildable, and the like, but it doesn't actually DO anything, because a few other bits and pieces are not buildable, so essentially you waste a lot of resources getting to what would have normally been considered the mid-game from a single player standpoint, which is establishing a colony. Essentially, multiplayer in its current state is adventuring and roaming around in whatever vehicle you may whip up, fighting the bosses and building houses that house nothing but yourself. Which, if this is your cup-of-tea, you would love multiplayer as it is now.From an admin perspective, you may as well just be another player. Your UI is not changed save the ability to kick and ban players from the server - but only if they are online at the same time as you - there is no server log of players actions, any way to report bad players or similar functions. You need to rely on a 3rd party resource such as a forum to get this across and *hope* an admin is online at the same time as the offender. Not to mention, there is not console for admins. If the server bugs out, as it frequently does due to being Early Access and people lose things, well, tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ The developers at Pathea don't agree that admins should have the power to spawn anything, it exists, just not for anyone who isn't a game dev: http://board.pathea.net/index.php?topic=391.0IMO: that's the stupidest excuse I've ever seen. as it boils down to something akin to 'We can't trust you with the console' which is silly. If players don't like how an admin operates their server, they'll look for a different one.At this stage in the Alpha, I DO enjoy the game as a single player experience, as the game is decently polished in that regard, but if you are looking to buy this more for a multiplayer focus, wait until it is further polished.EDIT: It is worth noting that the main site, where the developers post updates has been hacked several times in the past month, so the forum link may be inaccessable. Not entirely the developers fault, but a show that Pathea is a bit rough-on-the-rails and slow in development in part due to their attention being elsewhere. Prior to the hacking, development was still pretty slow, but they maintain contact with early-adopters, which I see as a plus.			"

Early Access Review
								If your looking for something different in the action/adventure/survival genre, different game options, and a great story then you need to check this game out.   I have put many hours into this game (prior to Steam version) and I'm still loving every minute of it.   So the good-*Story-  Yes there is a story!!  This is not just mindless survival there actually is a story that sets the stage for your adventures and definitely adds to the sense of mystery, adventure, and discoveries.  If you like science fiction novels or are looking for a break from zombies/horror then check this out.   I found it a refreshing change from games like DayZ or/and Rust.   If your a parent this is a game your younger kids could play.*Ambience/Setting-  Although it's on the Unity engine the game looks fantastic (especially if you can max it out) coupled with the most relaxing music (yet not boring) I have experienced in a game.   Normally I turn down or off the in game music but this is the first game I not only leave it on I turn it up!   The map/area to roam is HUGE and definitely has a science fiction feel to it and reminds me a lot of Avatar.   Add in a day/night cycle and random weather patterns and you really feel like your in a strange and new world.  *Game Options-  This game comes with quite the package of options that work quite well for it being in early access phase.   There is a story/campaign mode, build mode (get all resources for building similar to Minecraft), adventure mode, coop, and versus mode.   The building interface of the game works quite well in both ""build mode"" and ""story/campaign"" mode.  I actually found myself in story mode taking a break from NPC quests and just building a huge fortress over a mine I dug...was a ton of fun!   There is a creation editor where you can actually build customized items (to include vehicles, weapons, etc.) and then introduce them into your game however there is a bit of learning curve to use this feature (at least for me).   It is a totally open sandbox experience so you can choose your own destiny.Needs Work-*NPC Quests Story Mode-  The NPC quests are still a little glitchy and will need more polish.  They work however you sometimes can get hung up on a quest due to strange behaviors by the NPC's.   For example they may get stuck running into a wall and you may need to get creative to free them up (i.e. dig away the wall).   *Combat-  Combat works okay but definitely could use some polish.   Sometimes when you engage an enemy/creature up close there are clipping/blocking issues and you will end up inside the enemy/creature & hit detection could be improved.   Camera angles also could be improved when in combat especially if you are fighting a creature that is above you & your looking up.*Sound- While I LOVE the music it does sometimes cut in/out at strange times.  For example when you get into a combat scenario the sound will change to a more suspense theme but in the middle of the combat just turn off or switch to the flute/guitar music.   Also the NPC voices could be louder when interacting with them.   I also think animal sounds could be polished a little more as I think they could even add more to the ambience of this world.  Overall I think this is a fantastic game and will improve over time as they work the bugs out and add new features.  It's a refreshing change from what we have been seeing and all of it comes together quite well.   I am sure we will be seeing some very creative builds coming out of the community (similar to Minecraft) in the very near future.Okay heading back to my mine....never new digging could be so much fun!!Cheers!www.ShakesPub.net "

Early Access Review
								Planet Explorer's is a good game, much better than other Early Access Titles - I know I'm kinda against those but I took a risk one more time with Planet Explorer's and boy did it ever pay off.Pros:+ The Creation System allows for a wide-range of creativity You can ride and create vehicles (air, land, sea, submerisible), swords, guns, armors, bows, and some other objects with the Voxel Creation System. In addition to the creation system there is a ""Standard"" Selection of items you can make or buy if you have the resources. Unfortunately Vehicles are custom jobs only but you can d/l some from the budding library of multiplayer workshop items.+ The Game has really great detail of graphics.+ Those who follow my activity thinking know I concentrate on 2 things when it comes to games, Tools, and Crafting, this game has a stellar crafting system in SP and MP it has that potentional but - more on that in the cons section. + The Game has a definite level of challenge that will make it not overly difficult but certainly not too easy to found and run your own colony. + 1st and 3rd Person Perspective (Switch with f5)+ The Technology range is massive - For future explorer's you can make some pretty primitive and very advanced stuff.+ Multiplayer is working now.+ Patches are MASSIVE - in terms of additional content per patch.+ The ""Skill Tree"" - is completely optional at the maps outset. Don't Like to be limited? Just find/create a map that doesn't have it enabled.Cons:- Naturally there's bugs, but hey it's still in Alpha Stage so that's pretty normal. I can see strides being made with the previous patches (which I wasn't around for but got the benefit of) and I wonder where it will lead.- Patches are rather slow, in timing.- Skill Tree doesn't progress very fast. (Which is OK since it's optional)Finally I saved the most ""neutral"" thing and imo the ""best"" thing about the game for last.+/- The Game is unfinished, and from all accounts the devs listen to those who are playing the alpha when they speak.  Unfinished doesn't refer to a lack of quality, but the presence of potential. As you all know potential is very hard to find in games that force you to do it ""their way"", I see at this stage atleast the ability to make a great game, but it's not quite finished yet. I was going to reserve judgement until after it made Beta Stage but I decided to review it anyway to let you know this might be a great investment, and pretty low risk if you like the idea of creating your own objectives/world/objects/stuff.1/6/2016 - Updated Review to reflect the resolved Multiplayer Issues.

Early Access Review
								One-line review: Highly recommended. Planet Explorers is a remarkably good game, once you've learned the controls and UI. More in-depth version:I bought this game ages ago, and it's come a long way since I first tried it. The more I play the current version of Planet Explorers with my friends, the more impressed I am. It just clicks with me, in a way ARK did not for many reasons. Here's a real story from last night's gaming session with my friend Bandito. He and I went to the beach in search of petroleum (I have to say, that scanner tool is AWESOME). Finding some about 100 feet from the surfline, we started digging. I wasn't sure how the game would handle a hole in the sand, so close to the ocean; my best guess is I'd hit the water surface when I dug down to sea level, or maybe no water at all. As it turned out, we dug below the waterline without a problem, and after a few minutes we had joined our two tunnels and met back up, underground. A few minutes later, Bandito said, ""Oh no, water incoming!"" He'd dug too close to the actual shore and now seawater was filling our mine at a rather troubling rate. I frantically dug myself an exit and barely avoided drowning underground. When we were both safe, the entire excavation was filled to sealevel with water. It's impressive that the game actually modeled fluid water voxels filling up a cavity once it was connected to the ocean. There are so many things I like about this game. The world feels vast. You can see for miles, and somehow the distances feel more impressive than they do in ARK. While ARK is graphically amazing, it also gave me a curious feeling of confinement which I didn't realize until I played PE.The game is suffused with a sense of discovery and strangeness. I really feel as if I'm exploring an exotic alien world. There's an actual story to the game, and it's interesting. The crafting system (indeed the whole UI) is remarkably good, far better (in my opinion) than ARK's. For example, your replicator shows the items needed to make a thing right on the creation panel, and you can click directly on the sub-ingredents and go to their own production screen. Thus if you are lacking a sub-sub-sub-ingredient it takes only three simple clicks to drill down to the thing you need. It's astonishingly well designed and should be the gold standard for any game that does crafting.The Inventory is similarly well-handled, with subtabs for the various types of stuff. They also include a ""Reorder Items"" button that does an awesome job of tidying up your inventory and putting things in an order that makes sense. One-click magic! I haven't dived into the voxel-based builder yet, but the tutorial videos I've seen are amazing. You can make weapons, vehicles, all sorts of things. Planet Explorers has just the exact proportion of danger/sightseeing I like, whereas ARK was far too brutal for my taste. I can roam much more freely in PE, and mostly avoid (or successfully flee from) the really dangerous predators. Mishaps do occur, but they feel fair rather than punishing. The game handles co-op story quests better than any other game I've played. If one player takes a quest, all of them have it. Everyone gets the rewards, too. And if one player does quests alone on the server, while others are offline, her companions will have the rewards also when they log on. It just feels right, and works perfectly.If you want to host a game, you need to set up port forwarding on your router for UDP ports 9900-9915. But that's not necessary to just join a game. My friends and I have been very impressed with the smoothness of connection, and only occasionally saw rubberbanding...but then we're playing in Canada, the US, and Chile. Quite a lot of internet between all of us!Because this game is still in Beta, the game has some unfinished animations and outright bugs, but they're not too bad and Pathea has a good track record of fixing those that crop up.  My least favorite thing about the game is the horrible music which plays at the multiplayer server screen. It's pretty enough the first time you hear it, but it can't be shut off and loops endlessly. It's also far too loud, I can't even hear my friends over Teamspeak while it plays. Please, please, Pathea, give me at least a volume control for that music.			"

Early Access Review
								 Alot to say here...This is a story worth telling: Yours.This game is in Alpha but shows more promise to be a huge hit than most others I've seen. It is the future and you are on a ship heading to a distant planet to colonize it. As you begin landing preperations you hit something in orbit and the ship crashes to the surface. You wake on a grass- grass on this planet anyway- grass covered valley. Your escape craft smashed half burried in the new planet's soil, a crew member is injured sitting nearby and you are her only hope to survive. You must hike over a hill in the distance to bring a doctor to help her. Luck has it, he survived as well.You learn that other escape ships have landed around the planet and you need to find them. To do this you must EXPLORE.Okay. That is roughly the first ten minutes of the game.The rest is literally up to you. You must gather resources from the planet to survive. You have a handy replicator in your pocket and as rewards the people you help give you some ""scripts"" that you add to it, then when you have the needed supplies it can create what you need. It is slightly difficult for example to make a working weapon you may need two or three componants. Raw metal or wood and some maybe refined items. The refined items would have to be made ahead of time from the needed resources they call for. Once you ave all the needed building blocks you choose how many to make and press the button. Easypeasy.You start with wood tools and weapon and as you find other resources you can build better stuff. I hate to disapoint but their ar no zombies in this game.The main currency is meat. You get meat from... Thats it boys and girls! Animals. This planet has alot too. The creatures they have made to inhabit the planet are... interesting. The seem to mostly be six limb based and multi-eyed. Very cool all give a feel of alien and I found myself running to the next hill thinking ""Wow, what the heck is that?""You interact with left and right clicks after equiping the correct tool. To fight you left click with weapon. To gather you right click. You have a portable scanner you can use to scan the area around you to look for resources so you know where to dig. Probably alot more I didn't try but what I did manage to check out looked good. The planet has a day/night cycle and when it gets dark mean buglike creatures that are very aggressive come out to feed. On you. Thats very bad. They emerge from the vast underground caverns that are everywhere under your feet and if you tunnel a mineshaft into one of these caverns you better have some good weapons. And a light source. Because it is dark and dangerous. All this is played in the single player mode from your computer. An online peer hosted multi-player option is available with play modes of: Adventure, Versus and Build. I tryed Adventure and found them to be alittle buggy and some lagged alot. you have the option to host your own but you must do some port forwarding and I had no luck with that. If the devs of Planet Explorers keep up the pace, this will be a fine addition to your library if you enjoy adventure. I believe it is made with the Unity Engine so the games graphics are fair and the models are slightly cartoony, with some animation flaws and simplistic actions. The maps are gianormous!! With many types of biomes.   I have read some of the ideas they have for the future and am impressed and waiting to see it implemented. Entire player created worlds you can visit. All kinds of ecosystems. Fully player DESIGHNED weapons, armor, vehicles, housing and more. In fact an in game building tool allows you to add texture and colors as well as the look of alot of things already. Not to be confused with the standard building in the game anyway...did I mention it is a voxel based game- You can alter the ground's look and build structures via the ""minecraft"" like build system. This promises to give adventure, exploreing, building, gathering fun for many, many hours with endless possability for replay.Dang forgot the natives- big, armored, flame throwing owners of the new planet you dropped onto... And boss fights with giant robots and flying things and....Oh nevermind. You will find them... Of course they could find you too...-GrAnD   "

Slowpoke simulator 201... which year is now?In short - yes, its one of these games. Devs tried to include everything, but did nothing right. As result - 2.5 years of early access and game is still in alpha.Pros:+ Concept. Its rpg meets survival. From survival - huge world with terraforming and ability to craft almost everything you can imagine. From rpg - mobs, farm, quests.Cons:- Bugs. Whole thousands of them!- Terrible optimisation. Fps drops and overheatings included.- Soapy graphics. Its... Ever on screenshots it looks better than in game.- Speed of development. Yep, listed problems may be ""ok for alpha"", but THIS GAME STAYS IN THIS STATE FOR 2.5 YEARS.Game has awesome concept, but its very-very raw. If you are intrested - subscibe it, play on youtube, but dont buy it before full realize. Who knows - probably it will never happens			"

								I first got the game when it was very, VERY early access - and honestly, there wasn't much to it then and it needed a lot of polishing. I decided to give it time. I recently picked it back up, and can confidently say it is much better now! Honestly, I really am waiting for more NPC polishing to give the world extra flavour, because there are so few good survival/building/exploration games which focuses on the sense of community between survivors. I would love to see that better implmented in Planet Explorers, and it seems that is just what is planned!			"

								Put simply: this is one of the most promising sci-fi sandbox games currently on Steam. The graphics are bright, clean, and attractive, and the gameplay is largely intuitive. I find the vehicle building system to be a bit clunky, but the irritation is minor. I have sunk a fair amount of time into this game and I've enjoyed every minute of it. I love building long-distance rail networks to connect interesting points on the map, and I love the random alien encounters!If you're into early-access games and like the idea of supporting indie game devs, then I'd suggest picking this game up.

Early Access Review
								Planets Explorers is a vast world of discovery, creation, and survival. This game is simply too complex to describe in just a few words. This review will be a challenge to write, as the game just has so much to offer.Planet Explorers is a survival sandbox adventure game developed by Pathea Games.  While the survival sandbox genre might seem oversaturated, Planet Explorers has several features that make it stand apart from similar titles.First, there is the Story Mode – a single player campaign experience, complete with numerous quests that send you out into the awe-inspiring world to create your own adventure. Collect resources, fight fantastic monsters and aliens, battle giant bosses, explore the huge map…This is the game mode I spent the most time on, and during my time in Story Mode, I learned how the game worked via the starter quests. It showed me how to use and equip items, how to use the crafting system via the Replicator and Scripts, and how to use the very powerful Creation System to make and edit weapons, tools, objects, and even vehicles.The Replicator is very simple to use. First, you need a “script” for the item or tool you want to create. Think of it as a blueprint, which tells you what resources you need to craft a given item. Scripts can be bought from shops or obtained from quests. Once you have the script for an item, you can use it to learn the recipe for the item indicated on the script. There are Scripts for nearly everything, from weapons and tools, to medicines and clothing.Next, we have Adventure Mode. In Adventure Mode, you are placed in a randomly generated world with random quests, missions, bosses, landscapes, and enemies. It still has the survival elements of every other mode. What this means is each time you play Adventure Mode it gives you a brand new experience. No two playthroughs will be the same!Finally, we have Build Mode. This is the mode for the creatively inclined. All the resources you could want, in infinite supply, at your fingertips! There are no monsters or aliens in this mode, and full terrain destruction is allowed. This mode is ideal for trying out new builds, vehicles, and objects with the Creation System.Wow, that’s a lot, isn’t it? But wait! The fun doesn’t stop there!Planet Explorers also has Multiplayer! You can host and/or join servers with friends to enjoy the world of Planet Explorers together! Multiplayer has 2 different modes: Co-Op and Versus. In Co-Op mode you join up with friends to explore the world and create fantastic structures and objects together. In Versus Mode, you are put on a team of up to 16 players against another team, each earning points for kills, resourced mined, and objects built.The game is currently in Early Access on Steam, and is actually an early alpha build. But it is stuffed full of content for you to enjoy! You’d never guess it was in alpha if it didn’t tell you on the title screen.Recommended! "

								I love this game. I have 200 hours in it. The ability to craft your own vehicles and weapons (and now even buildings though it works a little different) in the built in 3D editor is amazing. I've never seen this feature in another game or nowhere near to this extent.  There is a rich and vibrant world to explore and it is growing all the time. They are finally striking the right balance on resource harvesting vs. time. My only complaint is that combat can feel a little flat but they are aware of this and making improvements. I can't wait to see it after they migrate to Unity 5. I would HIGHLY recommend this game. When you are skimming the tree tops in your personally made VTOL gunship and fighting 10 story tall alien deathbots you will know what I mean.			"

												I've been playing this game on and off since the very beginning of the Early Access.  It's one of, if not my favorite game in the Sandbox/Open World/Survival genre.  You should consider this as an early access review since I haven't yet played the release version of the game.What sets this game apart from other games like it is that it has an epic story and feel, and the story mode can be played coop.  It's a ""go at your own pace"" story where you do quests and/or side quests which usually reward you with gear/recipes. However, you can also skip all the quests and just purchase most of the gear/recipes at the npc shops if you prefer to do it that way.  The scenery is awesome and many locations feel epic.  This is because in story mode the terrain was hand crafted and not randomly generated like other games.  There are plains, deserts, huge forests with giant trees, etc. each with different creatures.  The creatures and vegetation are some of the most unique and alien I have seen in any game.  I believe in the adventure game mode the terrain is randomly generated but I haven't played that mode much yet.The crafting system is very unique and you can build custom weapons, vehicles, boats, helicopters, etc. and the materials you use matter.  NPC ""shops"" exist where you can buy most of the recipes or if you are patient you can do quests which usually reward you with recipes and/or items.  Once you have discovered a point of interest in the game, you can spend the game's currency (meat) to fast travel between any point of interest, It has a unique mining system where you can scan for ore deposits, and you can put comments on the map, so you can get back to the deposits later. The voxel terrain is destructable, and contains underground caverns to explore.  You mine for ores, cut down trees, hunt beasts, etc. to get materials for crafting.I personally really like the sound track.I can't think of much not to like about this game. I guess bugs were probably the greatest deterrent a while back.  Multiplayer had some syncing issues when I last played it a few months before the release but most of the bugs were tolerable at that time.  I'm guessing they have fixed most of them for full release and I can't wait to do a full play through again now that it is out of early access.The game also has several other game modes.  I haven't tried them so I won't comment on them.  The coop story mode is almost everything I have always wanted in an Open Sorld/Sandbox game.I highly recommend this game.			"

Early Access Review
								There are many open world sandbox survival games on Steam, a lot of which are still in Early Access / active development, and even though the market is currently saturated, there are some titles that stand out from the crowd due to unique features or simply having enough to do to appeal to a wider audience.Planet Explorers is one of those. It even has voxels.Sure, it has the usual story mode on a hand-crafted map,  and a more open world approach in the way of adventure mode with procedurally generated maps, of which many other games also have. And because it's voxel-based, you can always change the terrain to your liking.The game sports a rather impressive array of flora and fauna, as well as a much larger selection of ores than many other games offer,  for players to utilize in crafting, building, and just as basic currency since most merchants will buy most items or raw materials.Then there's the camera modes - not every game has zoomable third person AND first-person. Though admittedly, this game's first-person feels uncomfortable at best. The third-person view, for me, is far more attractive.Combat is awkward and lacking, players flailing about clumsily as they attempt to strike down creatures and enemies in melee, and desperately trying to see a thin white reticle against a light or white backdrop in ranged combat with a mouse that feels as if the sensitivity has been turned all the way up leads to much frustration.Yet, all that aside, I find myself playing the game more and more. Why? Because it's a huge world, with unbelievable freedom, and though the graphics aren't AAA quality, the overall experience and malleability of the game more than makes up for its flaws. From standard foot travel to motorbikes to cars and trucks to boats to aircraft to actual railways and railcars, even though it does offer a fast travel option, there are far too many better methods of travel and transportation to make good use of.And that's without even mentioning the creation feature. I have yet to see any game that offers the ability to custom-make a weapon or vehicle one subvoxel at a time, add mandatory sub-components like a hilt, handle, engine, tires, propeller or whatever, and simply export it from the creation screen and wait a few seconds for it to pop into your inventory. Go ahead. Name one other game that has this feature.I love this game. I've been killed by bandits, drown while digging my way out of a cave, flipped my fugly cars and bikes while travelling over the unforgiving terrain, murdered by creatures I couldn't even describe without sounding like I was looking at an imaginative child's drawing (it has short hair, like a polar bear, and a horn, and two tentacles flowing from its back, and sharp claws and teeth, and six legs...). And yet, I've also driven my own creations across the various biomes, built towers that loomed over the landscape, climbed said towers, jumped from their apex, and soared across the land on a simple crafted glider.It has flaws, sure, but it more than makes up for those with its features and replayability. If you're looking for a game to play with your kids, or just looking for something that feels like a fresh, modern Minecraft, you won't find many games that can hold up to Planet Explorers. And for the price? I estimate that by the end of the year, I will have spent less than 10 cents per hour of entertainment.To me, that's one hell of a bargain.			"

								Definitely going to have to recommend this one to anyone who happens across it, great way to kill time with your friends (or single player). The game still has a lot of development ahead of it and so far what is available is amazing! Even once you've covered all the in-game content, the creation system and the player made equipment and vehicles are all incredible, on top of that the developers are actively updating this game (last version was Dec 29, how's that for active!) so if you find yourself bored after the first 20 hours, you will still have lots of fun to look forward to in the future.In summary, great survival game, good looking (albiet cartoony) graphics, the hunting is fun, the mining is fun, the building is... well, a lil less fun but I imagine they have lots more tweaking to come in all categories. Buy this game and enjoy!			"

								This game is just... Wow. Ever play a voxel sandbox game and think, ""wow this would be great with vehicles"", yet those vehicles never really come?Well, dont worry. Here you build it according to YOUR IMAGINATION. Although learning how to build one to function well does take some time, you can literally build any kind of vehicle; aircraft, boat or land vehicle, it's your choice. Not to mention the same can be done with weaponry: guns, swords and shields all able to be built from scratch by YOU. The creatures come right out of Spore, much of the equipment is fairly original (minus the standard pickaxe, shovel and axe that can be made stronger with better materials), and although the combat is slightly clunky, devs are remaking combat animations to be more comfortable as i write this review, and the combat isnt even terrible right now; actually, it's not even bad. If you can handle Minecraft combat, this is twenty steps upward and still improving so it's hardly even a bother. All I have left to say is, why are you still reading this review? GO BUY THIS GAME, and add me so we can play together!! :D			"

								Yes. This game has a kind of 3d program within the game. I don't think any other game has that level of creative fulfillment.Speaking of, It would be great if they had workshop support for player made ISOs. I've played through it several times at different stages of development and have enjoyed it every time. They have definitely been ramping up the production because it has had big changes in the last few months. This is a good one and well worth the money.			"

												when i bought this game many years ago, i was blown away by how cool it was and how much potential it had to be super awesome. then, over the years, with each new update the game actually devolved . every time the game got updated it got worse. the mining originally was tricky till u got the hang of it, but it got the job done. now the mining is soo slow n unproductive. and irritating. the game environment was good at the start and became more fake and hollow feeling with updates. i could go on n on with examples of how this was a better game before the dev's ""finished"" it, but u get the point. i highly recommend buying this game if u can find a way to purchase it back in 2013.

								Very  ambitious and many good qualities but sadly the storyline is incomplete and the progress of the devs completing the project is slowwwww....Ive put several hundred hours playing different versions of the game over the past year or so and in my opinion the crafting aspects of creating vehicles, mining and building (and experimenting) objects/buildings etc. are incredibly satisfying however there are limited things to do once youve built them (mainly due to story etc)..   Not trying to dwell on its shortcomings because the potential is huge so definetly Give this game a shot  --- when it is truly finished..			"

												It's a playground for your creative vision, a whole alien world of it. Has some story to it to get you accustomed and help you stay afloat when you've just run out of ideas for a short spell. But don't  be mistaken, you'll have the most fun while you are building, designing, building again. Then using what you built.  Rising your castle, your sci-fi fort or your flying heli-carrier. Make tanks to fend off the local alien wildlife, or buggies to make deeper incursions into the map. Items to decorate your home, research station, outpost.You will need to learn the item editor built into the base game to get the most out of it! (Or, wait a bit til people share their stuff, if that's your style.)This is one awesome, different game, that let's you express your vision within its world. And a different vision every time you play it, if you so desire. It worked well all through the early access, I expect nothing less for its release today.Also, Planet Explorers screenshots are actually taken in game. ;)			"

								It's more of an action adventure game than ARK and more of a survival game than GRAV. It does both very well. The game world is interesting, the story is enjoyable, and the building/creation system is impressive (but mostly optional if you prefer to stick to adventure gaming). As you get farther into the game, throw in some colony management that reminds me a bit of Kenshi.Although the game has been out for awhile it does still have some serious bugs (semi-frequent game crashes). The dev team is still active and the game recently went through an engine upgrade, so there is hope these will be worked out in the next few months.Overall it's just a lot of fun, if you like survival adventure/creation in a sci fi setting.

												Quick rundown of what's good and bad:+ Player freedom+ Terrain remodeling+ Crafting and building+ Cool designs of plants and animals+ Exploration (if by some miracle you get anywhere)- Almost everything ranges from not pretty all the way to uglier than plastic toys caught in a house fire- User interface is awkward at best, incomprehensibly moronic at worst- Ugly and stiff animations that can't be skipped even if your life depends on it, you'll stand there and statically swing that pickaxe in a painfully slow awkward arc and NOTHING in the universe can let you abort until it hits (as in, hits the end of the animation, usually not the thing you're mining)- Artificial Intelligence? More like Artificial Idiocy, for the first couple of seconds animals will look like they have some behaviors that make sense but it's bare bones and often doesn't even work properly. I'd love to elaborate on all of the flaws but humans only live for like 75 years so no time for that.- Voice acting will have you in tears of either laughter or despair at how embarrassing it is, it sounds like they kidnapped the crazy cat lady down the street along with uncle George that hasn't been sober in 30 years and some random hobos and locked them in a room with a mic and a script. Actually this could be a selling point if you love hilariously awful things.			"

Early Access Review
								I don't usually write reviews because i feel it is unnecessary; But this time i felt i just had too due to the really undeserved bad feedback this game is getting from people who haven't even played it for a couple of hours.Planet Explorer is a free-roam, open-world, voxel-based sci-fi RPG game.You're free to roam and explore a huge procedurally generated world filled with different and colorful flora and fauna, gather resources to survive and have NPC characters join your colonization efforts, and fight off various creatures who'd have you for dinner or as a doormat.The game has a story mode with a really interesting quest-driven plotline in which you explore the world after a crash landing and eventually gather the survivors for a colonization effort, while facing off with an unexcepted native threat.The gameplay is somewhat articulate to grasp and isn't all that easy early on - which is why so many people tend to leave the game in the first hour of playing. However, after you get into the kiting and dodging mindset and start getting confidence with the commands and the somewhat wacky interface the door opens for a whole lot of fun.The game world offers lots of fighting opportunities, but the main treat of the game is undoubtely resource gathering and crafting.Aside from the standard RUST-like crafting system with which you can craft various basic parts, armors or food, players have acces to a voxel-based editor under which you can create your very own weapons and vehicles. This is probably the funniest part of the game and you're given complete freedom over choice of shape, materials, mechanics and so on. The game then calculates the weight in each resource you've created your item/vehicle out of and prepares a crafting recipe.I said resource gathering: The totality of the game world can be harvested, broken, dug, chopped down - thanks to the dynamic voxel engine.Additionally, players can create a colony -think of Terraria NPC hosting mechanics, but much deeper- which will require food, for which you have to hunt or farm, protection, and so on.Overall the gameplay is vast, rich and addicting.The main downside is the uncompleted state of the game, which is however kept under a continous updating regibe my dedicated developers. Aside from that, the animations and graphics are kind of wacky, but the gameplay strongly makes up for it.			"

												(Meant to edit this and accidently deleted it...)PROS:- Great variety in mobs/animals and plants.- A building system which allows you to place down whole walls at once, and allows you to save a building and then build it somewhere else if you have the resources.- You can build your own guns, swords, shields, vehicles, and turrets.- You can turn this into a Tower Defense game if you want.- Pretty good crafting system.- Excellent hand-held scanner which allows you to search for high-mineral deposits and underground caves.- You have pretty much an in-game workshop in multiplayer, where you can download different things people have built and then use those blueprints (ISOs) in any game mode. Great for those less-creative/new users.- The save system is pretty great, it generates 3 auto-saves over time, and you can also manually save at multiple points. This is useful if you accidently take on the hardest enemy base and then very quickly get killed when you respawn. (Like I did)- Great customer support. I've asked them questions multiple times, and they have always responded within 24 hours, even when I've done so on a weekend. They will tell you what is wrong or will ask for more information if needed, and are very polite in doing so.CONS: - Lots of crashes, though really if you won't play this game because of it, why are you even looking at a game still in development?- Developer Reliability:  The developers have been trying to do the 0.9 update for quite some time. They recently anounced it would be released during November. That doesn't sound so bad, no? Wrong. Looking at their past update history, when they announce that something is going to be released, it'll be another few months past the ""expected date"". So we'll probably be getting the 0.9 update sometime in February. (EDIT: They seem to be getting more and more consistant with updates, releasing at least one monthly. If they keep this up, then my review will continue to be positive.)- Not a whole lot of variety in quests; most are just, ""fight these things,"" or, ""bring me this."" This is fine, seeing as story mode is yet to be completed, but I'd like to eventually see more variety.OVERALL/TL, DR:-  I can't recommend this in it's current state. Even though it's fun, and will probably eventually be a full, playable, non-crashing game, that is clearly going to take some time. The developers try to get things implemented for an update, but then in the update logs, say that it wasn't working out well for this version. Updates are inconsistent, and often don't add much content. There needs to be more frequent updates before I view the pros as outweighing the cons; as long as I view no further cons. I'll edit this review as the game gets developed. This is an excellent game, and the developers seem to have learned from their mistakes. They've noticed the dwindling player base and have acknowledged that it is due to their previous infrequent update history. They're improving upon that and have begun monthly updates. They are also very responsive to suggestions and have a great customer support system, should it be needed. I'm looking forward to the future of this game.Still TL, DR: Put it on your wishlist and get it on sale.DATE OF LAST EDIT (Excluding Typo Corrections): 14 November 2015Note: From the date of last edit^ onward, I have not played the game. I have reinstalled it and plan to play it soon. This review will be updated and will reflect the new experiences shortly after I get a good idea of what its become. From a few update notes I've read, I do look forward to playing this.			"

												This review is based on multiplayer story mode via LAN.Bought an played on 17 Nov.UPDATED 26 NOVI wont explain to you all what the game is about since you most likely have already watched a few videos and read the game's description. If not, take the intiative to do so before reading on.Here I will provide a list of findings from myself and my gaming partner playing through story mode on ""LAN"" setting.My considered PROs.--------------------------------1) Single player game mode doesn't require an internet connection. 2) Creativity. This needs further clarification. You can design your own gear, and vehicles with a combination of premade 3d parts and voxels (cubes), which includes a somewhat rough ability to colour them as well. Once designing is complete, as long as you have the required materials in your inventory you are able to bring this design into the world as a fully usable/interactable object, as well as it will upload this creation to Steam's workshop.If you aren't the creative sort, you have the ability to download other people's uplaoded creations.3) The world itself is huge to try and fit as many different land types as possible onto a single island.4) As long you wield gear bought from NPCs or crafted from your replicator, combat doesn't last long against almost all opponents you face.My considered UNSURE OFs.--------------------------------------------1) Quests mostly consist of gathering specific items, talking to particular people, moving to a specific location on the map and killing specific critters and buildings. There are singular instances of getting the player to make use of user created content, introductory tool for players to make their own content. 2) Few quests require the construction of objects you do not have access to unless you find other specific NPCs to do their quests as well. When you do gain the object scripts (recipies or crafting papers you learn how to build stuff from) through quests they are useless since you will automatically already know how to produce them. Inventory clutter. 3) There is no inventory limit of any sort. While not a bad thing in of itself (and certainly not an issue unless you are looking for some kind of realism XD), it is rather amusing to be able to just pull a colossal boat / car / tank / flying machine / buidling out of your pocket and when you are finished using it, able to pick it up and put it back into your pocket. If there is a limit, I have yet to reach it.4) There is no levelling at all here to be done. A character's strengths and weaknesses are directly tied to the gear you wear and wield. 5) illnesses exist but are an incredibley rare occurance since they require very specific things to make them happen. A rather pointless addition.My considered CONs.--------------------------------1) LAN requires players to have internet access. ( wtf )2) Quitting a LAN game, PE_Server.exe will continue to run the background which counts as the game still running. Need to manually close it through the windows task manager.3) Syncronization. Cause delays in actions, and animations to not play when they should.4) in LAN game, characters and NPCs ignoring player placed blocks. This will lead to NPCs impossible to interact with should they be several layers under placed flooring. NPCs will also plant crops under player placed blocks should there be any fertilized soil under them.5) Some items created are largely useless. Created swords wont ever be as effective (roughly 1/3 as effective in fact) as those you can buy from NPCs or build from their scripts, uless you are planning on having over-the-top huge anime swords). Vehicles are largely useless except the helicopter, and even then you only need to use it to get to a destination once as fast travel exists.6) To edit any of your custom creations you will need to build an entire new one. You can get back all the materials for your original custom creation by recyling/deconstructing it however, it will need to have 100% durabilty to refund all of its materials used. You can't just add to your custom object without rebuilding the entire thing. I personally understand the reasoning for this choice however it creates the next point below.7) Any kind of recreation of custom item will be put into steam's workshop again. No, this doesn't replace what you've already put onto the workshop.8) Steam workshop clutter from everybody having created something. You'll see a host of copies of the same named thing and no idea how any of them a re different, if at all.9) The controls for creating custom things is not explained in detail anywhere easily.10) Some of the game's missions are very vague. Good thing there are people who will answer how to complete them. There shouldn't be a requirement to look up an outside source to understand what a quest requires a player to do.11) Talking with an NPC does not stop them from wandering off. This doesn't affect conversations, as they can still be finished. Shops, however, close once the NPC moves a certain distance away from the player. The experience is ok as a casual thing. Still there's a lot of room for improvement and from my opinion should still be in early access given the large number of issues present.I paid for this at full price. Developers these days a pretty eager to just shove their product out there regardless how complete and functional it may be. I wouldn't recommend this as it is right now, not until it gets some major fixes. Also it would be wise to change the ""LAN"" aspect since this isn't LAN at all.I'll try to keep this updated with the help of anyone who kindly informs me of my mistakes or game updates.			"

								So my only main concern with this game right now is why did they change how the clustering works with resources you gather. It seems to me that in some patch (while I wasn't playing for idk how long), they decided that resources you gather shouldn't be completely clustered together and should have alot of trash resources, like dirt and stone, in the way. That sense of a realistic touch.. is a bit too much for me. It already took a bit of time and effort to find and gather them. It seems to me as if its take up a rediculous amount more time to gather resources now, making the game undesireable when I feel like I'm spending all day trying to get materials, instead of building the many awesome buildings / vehicles / miscellaneous objects.Take a look at my hours spent in game and you'll know I'm not fibbing. I seriously had a lot of fun up until now. Now it is a serious grind session. I'll not be playing a game if the work to fun ratio is heavily disproportionate. That being said, I currently will not recommend this game. I will check back in months coming to see progress and hopefully change my mind.My suggestion to fix the problem would be to either make resource gathering the way it was (heavily clustered no trash in the way), or give us better gathering tools to mine through resources at a faster (or MUCH faster) rate.You guys would also get extra bonus credit from me if you got rid of the 3ish second 'waiting to stop gathering resources so my character can do something ANYTHING again' wait time. Double bonus credit if you allow me to move while mining.			"

												I think this game is a  great  concept and has climbed a fairly steep ladder. First let me make a point: Why I got the game I got the game to play with some friends that were playing it and convinced me to purchase it because it looked really interesting and entertaining; ofcourse when I got the game they all suddenly did not feel like playing it, go figure. When I got it I pretty much immidatly found out that this game reaches many SP aspects, but it does not quite feel right in singe player. I wanted to figure it all out and enjoy it but I really started to hate the game, it made no sense and I had felt like I waisted my money. The game was so difficult to understand alone and personally I think videos kind of play the game for you because of how much is just thrown at you and you don't really get to expierience the base game because somone has played it for you. I have to say find a decent community to rock out with befor you get crazy with this game. I say this because at first this is what I thought:  This game sucks  Physics are screwy. Recourses are hard to find and obtain. None of this crap makes sense. So on so forth.......However when I gave it another shot with a little more paitence I have to say   (This is why I had not posted my review yet, I did not feel like I was being in a fair mood. After playing and being paitent...)  Recomonded  The game presents and active chalenge. The devs are  working  on it, they have proved that the money I spent was worth it.(for a short time without any updates I was worried this was a starforge project.) Many creatures and day-to-day monsters or aliens to deal with. can start a civilization or colony of sorts (tad bit buggy, but the core concept is in place) Many creative build options. I love the vehicle creator and wepon creator. Fantastic ideas. Negatives  With the latest updates I have not found anything to mark down as negative. Suggestions?  Maybe some kind of jet option, I understand it is somewhat there but a more plane-like option would be sweet! More PEW PEW options Bananas. I really enjoy this game and I know I was fairly impaitent before but I have gained a better understanding of how game developing works and that it is not a couple month process, it is a multi-year in most cases.

Early Access Review
								Minecraft and Alpha Centauri bumped into Skyrim and Spore leaving the over-budget rejects club. They all hooked up and had a weird four-parent-baby and named it Planet Explorers.But enough about the game, lets talk about me. I have learned SO MUCH from playing Planet Explorers! I thought I needed friends and family and a life and a job and a future, but now I see those are all optional. All I really need is to mine more copper, find all the survivors, investigate the interference, learn more about the natives, help the earthlings and Martians get along peacefully, and always eat before I get a stomach ache because the ingredients for stomach medicine are so rare.Planet Explorers gameplay is way too fun. I hate to admit it, but they may have finaly made a game that is better than real life. Some of the controls are quirky, and I'm sure that will bother a few at first. For example, RMB is for both moving the camera and stoweing your weapon/tool. So any time you are using your equipment, it gets put away the next time you move the camera. It is most annoying in combat but once you get used to it, it's fine.The graphics in the game are way over-the-top. I have to run it on 'simple' just to get >10fps. I have an old computer though, so I doubt many people will share that experience. But, even on low graphics, the artwork is quite charming. It doesn't look -bad- until you get to the minimum setting.The new content creation features are very well thought and add tremendous depth of freedom to the game. You can design almost anything- armors, weapons, tools, vehichles, buildings, etc. Getting your new designs into the game however is another story, as I have not yet been able to figure out how. Problems- Combat gets interrupted frequently by poorly designed pathfinding and physics interractions. I've watched an animal run circles around a tree trying to get me while I stood still maybe ten paces away. It doesn't happen often, but it is annoying when it does. NPCs will run at trees. They seem to want to get someplace beyond the tree but they can't seem to see it, so they just stick to it and run in place until you chop the tree down. That happens a lot. While fighting, your body will sometimes get tangled up with and enemy's body and you can't do anything until they sepparate. So, you may die a couple times because one monster decided to get freaky with you while the other uses you as a punching bag. That happens way more than it should. In story-mode, you will sometimes encounter invincible enemies. They are invincible because they are part of an event or scene and not supposed to die, but you can't know they are invincible until you try to kill them, at which point they start chasing after you and there is nothing you can do about it, because they are invincible. That is a real pain. The build features (for placing blocks/dirt/etc) has no proper in-game introduction, and unfortunately isn't idiot-proofed. There is a sort of mini-tutorial, but after reviewing it I still had no idea how to use it. I think I am finally figuring most of it out, and now it's fun to use, but it is not intuitively designed. At one point (while trying to build something, though I don't know that is necessarily the cause) the game gave me a 'critical error' and my save-file stopped working, so I had to start the game over.-YOU MUST SAVE REGULARLY AND USE MULTIPLE SAVE FILES-Because you may play for two or three days (seriously, not a game for addicts) and then -CRITICAL ERROR- and all your progres is lost.In conclusion, I happily accept the game's few, though dire flaws, and I'm sure you will as well! =DAnd I feel bad about it really, because I bought maybe a dozen games in the steam winter sale and now the rest may never get touched.

								An enjoyable game with a lot of potential. One of the first of the SciFi themed minecraft-alikes and IMO still one of the better ones, even in it's incomplete state. The crafting system  is particularly noteworthy and powerful and in the hands of someone creative produces amazing results, from vehicles inspired by the Catbus from Totoro na Totori to replicas of weapons from Aliens and just about everything in between.One thing to be wary of is although it is updating fairly regularly at the moment, it went for about 6 months without updates and little communication from the devs at one stage and that might happen again			"

								My life its to short to wait XD and planet explorers is the game i was waiting for, even if the game is on alpha state, have a little bugs but, trust me when i said i am having a lot of fun i cant believe it, they give me a game of full sandbox you can create everything you need even a sword, Car, helicopters, tanks, even ships. I enjoy passing the time with my friends in the game XD, today we make a test of how its possible to make a Air deploy with parachutes, and the test was really good. they need to fix the bug than when you leave your air vehicle this sudenly lost poder and fall off and explode...  i am just wating for the next update, they said they are going to add the Map editor and finally the Skills and levels... what game give you the oportunity to create everything with your imagination, you can create your own map, vahicle, armor, weapons etc. except the animals or NPC i dont know if they are going to go that far. But FOR ME THIS GAME IS PLAYABLE EVEN IN THIS STATE AND IS AWESOME.			"

								I have had this game for well over a year and the game is absoloutley terrific! The games music is repetitive but it syncs in and never gets dull. The battle music is amazing as well. Voice acting is a bit lousy but the good lousy its something different.Voxelated mining is really good feature as well and is much more better with the water physics implemented. Creating your own swords, shields, guns, buildings, etc etc is an amazing quality that gives you an advantage over the game.The storyline is intense and offers a varied array of experiences. The developers of this game are amazing and their skills have been prominent to the games feature.I would really reccomend this game to anyone that was looking for a survival RPG type of game with a few strategic components.I would rate this product 8.5/10 very well done and congratulations on getting it on steam.

												Had this game for a while and finally decided to play through the Story mode again.  I played through the story a couple of years ago and it ended in the middle of the story, so I wanted to see if it went any further since release.  I managed to finish it this time around to the very end.That being said.  Not much was improved since my original playthrough to this recent playthrough.  Yes.  The story can be completed.  The beginning of the story was very interesting, but after a while it just felt like elements of gameplay were thrown on top and the story was rushed.The game had (has?) a lot of potential, but it was thrown away due to the disjointed story pacing coupled with the technical issues that still lurk in the game itself.  Nothing about it seemed smooth and organic.  Things happened so suddenly both story wise and technical wise that the story was barely holding together.That being said.  From what I got of the story, it IS an interesting multi-layered story set in a very beautiful world (most of the time).  The game has a great range of freedom, at the cost of glitchy engine problems.More time could have been spending nailing down these issues.  More time could have been spent on things like underground systems (which when you get down to it, all the underground cavern systems are butt ugly and featureless).  This same blandness flows into the mountains and canyon biomes.  Seems most of the time was spent around building up the initial plains area you start in (which is gorgeous) and just starts going downhill from there.There was a great game being made here.  But it becomes quite obvious as you progress, that a lack of passion and attention petered out at the later stages.			"

								There seems to be a horde of crafting/voxel based/survival games coming out or in early access, so some quick bullet points on how Planet Explorers differentiates itself from the others I've played. The ""ISO"" system. When crafting guns, armor, swords, shields, vehicles...well, anything really, you have the option to slap down a few base parts and basically design your own 3d model of the item from the materials you choose. Very easy to make basic items of your own, and you can download other peoples creations that they've chosen to share. Someone willing to put in the time and effort can make some very nice looking items. Building a colony. Constructing the buildings, recruiting colonists, handing out jobs and keeping them fed--I found it very satisfying, much moreso than other survival games where the only person you're responsible is yourself. Getting around is quite enjoyable. The maps can be quite large, but they seem much smaller when you have tools like gliders, jet packs, parachutes, grappling hooks...and let's not forget your fighter jet or helicopter (or mech or speeder bike), either. This is a low gravity world, as well, which has its own amusements.As of beta 0.2 the game has come together nicely, and become easily one of my favorites of the genre. All features appear to be working and are of (at least) average quality, with some in the above-average-to-exceptional range. There are still some hiccups (poor documentation on how to do certain things, for instance) but more or less exactly what you would expect from a beta. I have very little experience in multiplayer (aside from snagging some talented player's ISO's) so i can't comment on that.I reccomend this game with no reservations. "

								I LOVE this game! This game has everything I love, there is questing, adventure, building, town management, upgrading, mining, engineering.I have 25 hours in a this point with no end in sight to the single player questline, and it just keeps giving, every time I venture out further for a quest I am rewarded with new visuals, new mobs, new dangers, I was flying a helecopter to a location and got ambushed by two giant flying creatures, that was awesome!  There is a lot of voiceover work done with this game, and I have never felt like...ugg that was a bad voiceover.I love that the building is block by block yet you can place multiple blocks at a time if you choose for faster building.The ability to make completely custom items is really interesting, I can't wait to see what players do with it.I have not tried multiplayer, I plan to after I finish the missions in single player.

												Only 18 hours into the game on story mode, If I was able to make a game, it would be something like this. Massive modifications available. So far, it's been low on the resources for my computer as well...Now with over 200 hours of game time...300+ with 0.9x (Alpha)With the voxel sliders, that I have made a short guide for here on Steam, you can hone your weapon long before it reaches the Enhancer a recent sword I made, Submarines, Axes and armor pieces have been added to 0.9. You can now make Axes to go with your swords, shields, bows and guns, design your own armor pieces, add ballist tanks to your boats to make them submarines... And I know I missed several added pieces.Success, when building a colony underground, you can actually save and load underground.I still stay away from the multiplayer aspect, but learned you have to join at least a multiplayer loby in order to even browse the mods and ISOs from other players.System resources still remain low for my Story mode game.... Now I am playing a0.9, Going to see how far the story goes, as they have added some new missions to the play.And I still recomend the game to anyone who is extra creative.-------------------Oct 12,19160.7 (Beta)Had my first experience with Multiplayer option Took a bit to figure out how to set up the router, Now seen and playable with those I know.My attempts to import my blade into the game have failed. with every attempt, even grabbed one from someone else.. Still unable to successfully import the ISO  *THIS HAS BEEN FIXED*-------------------February 17, 2017It's been released some time ago, yes.I had been talking to a friend about this game, they were looking at the current reviews, and seen all the negative reviews, and asked if I still loved the game, I told him yes I do. Then proceeded to share my game with him through steam's share game view.First, hopped into an online game I created, and was hosting, forgetting it was still rather new, so very few items available. He loved the graphics.Next, hopped into Build mode, unlimited supplies. used the jetpack, hang glider, tossed out a motor cycle, high speed tank, VTOL, boat, and used each, got to the boat, noticed it bobbed more than floated, hopped into the creator, fixed it, and tossed the new version into the game to keep it level. And then he said,""You really can make just about anything for the game""Then hopped into an existing single player game, went around, and got him to see the starting area creatures, and using a sword I made in the creator, with an attack of 343, I was swinging once or twice on most of the creatures and slaying them. He plays Monster Hunter as well, and his words are,""This game is a monster hunter's dream!"" and ""Come monday this game is MINE!""The creator is the most important function for crafting, and can really be a game changer in the long run. If you know how to make swords in Real Life, and use that knowlage to build a sword in the creator, you can really maxamize your damage output in the game, making melee the way to fight in the game. I can make a decent gun, but they aren't anywhere near as good as my swords, but the range is really good on the guns I do make, so that is a bonus.The open world aspect, even in story mode is awesome sauce!recent issue:The problem used to be traveling so fast that the ground would not be there as it resses in (in build mode), causing the vehical you are driving explode as it resurfaced (this could kill you in adventure mode) and made for a good laugh, the problem with the way it's set up now, when you reach that edge, instead of generating in front of you first, it seems to leave it wide open. Pauses your movement, and if you are in a hang glider, well, you just fall, messing up your glide range. My recomendation would be to rez what you can see first, starting in a narrow strip in front of the path you are heading, then out from there to the sides, then under the surface ground area, as needed.If you don't have at least 40 hours in story mode in the game, you really haven't gotten anywhere in the game yet. Story mode can take quite a while to complete. And being an open world, you can do what you want, when you want, there is no rushing through the game, trying to rush it, will only make you miss things, that could be considered as ""hastilly put together"" because you are jumping pages in the book. The game is not designed to be rushed through.The new tech with Voxels is astounding, it is ground breaking, there have been others that have tried to duplicate what is created here, and have not been even half as successful.I wanted to make my collony under ground, but with the recent changes, that isn't possible, making it so that you can't even live inside a cave opening, All collony items must be placed above ground, meaning, that even an area with an outcropping or overhang will prevent the item from being placed. Totally lame!The game was designed for Win 7, but now with Win 10, it will randomly crash, something needs to be updated to include Win 10.			"

Planet Explorers is a super ambitious project that will probably reach most goals. Hopefully. The problem for me is not the game itself, or the direction its going in - its with the current state and the price. This is a HUGE project, and so what do you get for your twenty five bucks, right now? In my opinion, you get an unoptomized sandbox that has a moderate-albeit reasonable for the current developement state-amount of bugs and glitches. I just hope they keep going and get it done in a timely manner.This is an open world, do-whatever-you-want crafting and base building game.Pros:+Huge potential (but then again, so does nearly every other EA game)+Multiplayer could be really really fun in the future, and is even fun now, to a certain extent+The idea of vehicle crafting is awesome+The world is beautifulCons:-Personally, I think this should be first-person-Its glitchy, and in this case, is fairly bothersome (glitching through the world/builds quite frequently)-It is unoptimized. I can run it at full graphics on my gaming rig, but it sweats.-I would bet money that developement will cease before the original vision is completely met (not a bad thing, but this is ambitious)Get it on a sale, and make sure to play the demo first (I think its on their website). Problem is, the open world crafting genre is a super crowded market. You can do better. "

The crafting system as a whole takes some time to get used to, and structure building isn't really functional yet - but a damned good start!I'd like to see the updates be more substantial and frequent. Selling an EA title doesn't give the developer permission to never finish.*************************Over two years later...The game is frozen inside of some sort of engine upgrade limbo. The small studio had to outsource most of the coding change over to other studios when moving up to a new game engine. What we now have is an almost incoherent collection of low quality features that Pathea is trying desperately to tie together and smooth out. Many of updates you see are from these contractors patching their shoddy work. It is a shame. I am not sure that it can be salvaged in time for a real game to be playable.Uninstalled.*************************Three years after purchase...I do not think that the game will ever feel completed. A large price drop prior to the official release, a reduction in the frequency of updates, and the developer announcing a newly started project are all signs that this game is about done. Bugs, glitches and poorly exectuted features remain.			"

Need a bridge in a hurry? No worries! planet explorers has it covered. Need a watchtower to snipe stuff? No worries same applies.* Still in beta. much more to come I'm sure.CONS':* Still in beta. much more to come I'm sure.* Early game mining is realisticly tedious. : /*  Main menu music is annoying.  yeah they fixed that one. music theme is so (muchly so) better.all in all I rate a ""You should buy this game/10""Nice work devs. Love your work.

								Easier and faster building, limited-free roam style building (you can leave your body for a short distance), you can save templates!!! Imagine building a tower, build a base of 8x8, highlight it-save and now its 8x8x500.  (10 seconds)You can paint your blocks- in game, create the color.You can create weapons or other items from scratch!Build helicopters and fly them around. Explore a beautiful landscape. I HIGHLY recommend checking this game out.  Story is a work in progress- all about the adventure mode unless you are happy to look to for directions out-side of the game. Are you the creative and exploratory type?  This is THE game for you. Mining has a natural feel to it as the blocks are not square.  Sometimes I will dig to far if i put too much 'effort' into it. Planet Explorers and Starbound are easily my now favorite pre-release games I have ever purchased.  Thank you to the game makers.  THE ONLY suggestion i have:  rpg elements to it.  But honestly, its really not that important and can be easily modded in.			"

								If you have spare money, you will enjoy this game if you love exploration games with slow to fast grind of progression. Slowly work your way up on becoming a powerful nation/faction, discover and use new technology of your own and expand. When I first started, I was just a naked weakling, now I mine and made powerful high tier armours and considering those armours was only around mid-range. Theres many aspects you can learn and do things than just crafting armour, weapons. I have only played a small while and only played around a quarter or less of the content it offers, trust me if you enjoy suvival games, look for friendly peeps to help you out and play with you. This is one of a gem of a game.Planet Explorers & StarMade are the only two games that I really think have a similarity that are very unique and does things differently than its own but in a similar theme.

								I waited and waited to review this game cause I had really high hopes for it. But after the long awaited 0.9 update I can't help but write this review, so that maybe I can save others from the useless expense that this game is.It's new year's day and I'm still on a little hangover so i'll just list what i hate as things come to my mind. Forgive possible mistakes :)- This game is overpriced. Highly overpriced.- Optimization: this game will fry your GPU even at lowest settings. I don't have a monster GPU (Radeon Dual-x R9 380) but I can run almost every game at high settings without problems. Here, at fastest settings my gpu still works 100% at 78° with fan speed over 50%.- Fastest settings will make game unplayable since fonts will become unreadable (really?!?)- Even at fastest settings I'm having random fps drops and stutters.- Character creator is always the same obvious placeholder, which was there 1 year ago or so.- Controls are clunky, would best fit for an mmo in my opinion. By the way combat and object interaction are so bad... to gather materials from plants you have to target the ground under the plant, not the plant itself... really?!?- Bindings are the most unintuitive I've ever seen. Alt+Y to open replicator menu? Really?!? Yes, you can rebind, but seriously?!?- Updates come at a slow pace and seem to just introduce more bugs. They've changed the UI several times, onlyu to deliver another clunky and unintuitive UI.- Music. It's nice for the first 5 minutes, After that you'll want to turn it off, since it's the same super-short song playing over and over again. - A LOT of backtracking, in story mode. At the beginning you won't have a vehicle to ride, but still the first quests need you to go back and forth between points that are miles away from each other. That's boring as hell.- The game, at least in story mode, never seems to demand that you build anything. What's the point of giving us the possibility of creatingour own guns and armor etc. pixel by pixel if I can just use the blueprints I find? Plus, creating object, as fun as it may seem at the beginning, it's super time coinsuming and I really cannot see myself craft more than a couple objects in an entire playthrough.- About creating weapons and such: why should dps of a weapon be based on how much material you use to create it? I mean, why should a gun that uses the same barrel (and so the same bullets, I guess) as another one do more damage just because you've put a lot more wood or anything around the barrel?!?- Monsters: You'll encounter thousands of identical monsters in each area, which makes the world boring and exploration super repetitive. Now I read they've randomized monster size, so you should have a little more diversity but it's just not enough.Is it enough?I really can't see this game getting any better, even in a year or so, plus there are a lot of better exploration and survival games that play, look and feel better than this that I really can't see the point of buying it, so beware...oh and Happy new year to everyone! =) cheers "

								This game promises to be one of my favorites for quite some time.  Not only does it have most of the stuff I look for in a game, but it also allows multiplayer co-op so I can enjoy it with friends!Got this game recently and am rather enjoying it.  It is presently in alpha version a0.8 at the time or writing this, so some of its bugs are bound to work themselves out.It's part RPG, part voxel builder, part engineering CAD developer, part 4X, part tower defense, all exploration and adventure.  I have been utterly absorbed in playing it for the last few days.  I have one beef with it, though.  Companions.Throughout normal gameplay, you get tag-alongs, whether you want them or not.  You cannot control them, and they are basically along for the ride.  They are mostly benign, and will even SOMETIMES help with combat (which is nice because they cannot die like the 'hired' companions can).  There are some issues, though.The first is the pathfinding A.I.  If you are not EXTREMELY careful with where you are going, any following monster bait will get stuck... in a hole, on a tree, in the water, on a herd of turtles.  You can either clear their obstructions so they can get unstuck, or you can build an advanced piece of machinery like a car with spare seats, and HOPE they teleport to the seat.The next issue with these hoodlums is the fast travel system.  Let's say you have a waypoint that happens to be in the direction of your next quest spot(which itself is a 35 minutes walk), or just somewhere else you want to go for supplies.  If you are babysitting, you are not allowed to use this mechanism in the game without automatically aborting the quest which demands their presence.  Often, they don't go back to where you got the quest, either.  Nope.  They park themselves right there and wait.  And then you have to go find them again if you manage to get the quest once more.I'm not saying this makes the game bad or unplayable.  But, if a game developer insists on an underwater escort quest, they had better take some special measure to ensure that you don't have to spend an hour fighting water mechanics to dig out a quest giver stuck in a wall.That's it.  Just the NPCs.  Everything else about the game has drool running out of the corner of my mouth.			"

								Can't in good conscience recommend this game; it's just too early to say whether it'll be good, but for now it's best left alone.My entire experience in this game comes from the Story mode, so keep that in mind. My experience so far has been of sticky controls, tentative sound effects, and pretty much no combat system to speak of. In the game you can design your own weapons and vehicles (the vehicle creation is reminescent of Spore's, or any number of similar games). The system for building weapons is great, it allows for incredible aesthetic maneuverability; it falls a little bit flat when you import your gun/sword into the game and try it out. The ways the game determines what makes a sword have high damage are difficult to determine. The highest damage I've ever managed to reach came from a sword that was a literal block of metal, as big as the game would let me make it. Personally, I prefer SHARP swords, though this may be a stylistic disagreement.Likewise, my long-barrelled rifle seemed awesome and had great damage, but its accuracy was somewhere between ""none"" and ""none at all"". This would contradict the little bit I know about real-life guns, which tells me that a longer barrel = greater accuracy.I have about 19 hours of playtime in the game, and about 12 of those hours I have estimated to be travel time. It's amazing how long it takes you to get from one place to another, then back again when the quests tell you to go back. There are enough monsters on the way to keep a player docile during this transit, and the crafting can eat up a lot of time, too, since it's so detailed. What SHOULD be taking up some time is the scanning for (and mining of) resources, but I've found that to be a very arduous process. The map is huge, so when the main quest demands you make something with, say, petroleum in its schematic, you're pretty much screwed when the NPCs tell you to head west to look for oil (and the oil is southwest). I guess that's what forums are for.Then your scanner tells you the targetted resource is deep underground, and it's a pretty peaceful, Zen-like experience to use the game's terrain shaping to tunnel down into the earth. You get a palpable sense of accomplishment when you look at the big cave that used to not exist before you needed something from under it. Getting back out again is a Stygian nightmare. You will hop, you will slide, you will accidentally click and swing your pickaxe and be unable to make actions until your character is done with his animation. Eventually you will use the game's building mechanics to try to pillar-hop, like in Minecraft, except you will clip into your pillar and slide all the way down it.Then you will write an angry review for a not-nearly-finished game.

Early Access Review
								This game gotten better.A lot of improvement and multiplayer now have official server.TL;DR - Get Planet Explorers if you like being creative with your creation and your world.multiplayer community is so nice, it's great they put this as survival not focused on survive from another player or just stomping noobs like certain games started with an A and ended with K.PE is for science fiction geeks, nerd in good context. EVER HAVING DREAM ABOUT EXPLORING? FOR SCIENCE? FOR COLONY?This is the best game for it, people may keep yelling this game is so bad because it's too complex and boring. But we geeks enjoying it, you can see smug on our face.PE has endless possibilities and i will keep looking forward to their every updates.*)Review beforeMonster Hunter+Tomb Rider+The Sims+Harvest Moon in sci fi settings!you can hunt, surviving, farming, creating a brand new props and vehicles!live your creativity to the fullest, this game also stimulate your imagination and adventurous feelings.very promising, you won't regret buy it even it's still on alpha!note: i made this review without thinking about how many the errors / ctd i got. still enjoyable as the game itself has a high repeatable game factors, you won't get bored.you can try multiplayer too for surviving together or hunt each others.last : though im not really a fanatics of futuristic setting, im pleased with the role playing concept, esp building colonies![Hope in the future there's a spousal system too lol].

												I've now played about 60 hours in story mode, most of it on the final build. In that time I've experienced one crash to desktop and three slowdowns so bad I had to quit and restart, but overall I've had a very good technical experience on max settings. The game looks great and the gameplay is fun and varied. Some of the locations are absolutely gorgeous and the design on some of the creatures is very impressive. Creation is a blast, but if you don't enjoy the process (understandable, as it does get rather fiddly) you can just as easily download ISOs or use ingame templates and items. Item creation is not a must to finish story mode, it's just another fun thing to do. The soundtrack is amazing. I'm probably buying the OST too, and that's something I've only ever done for one other game. Combat is pretty basic. Once you get decent weapons, there's not much of a threat. (Tip: almost everything can be circle-strafed to death.) There's enough of a challenge to keep it engaging, but it's not very complex. You've got your attack and defense, ranged or melee, and that's pretty much it. I'd call it elegant rather than simplistic, but YMMV.There's some negatives. The voice acting ranges from bad to atrocious, some plot twists are really awkwardly handled and most of the NPCs spend their days stuck in walls and falling through terrain. This is never gamebreaking, at least not in my case. My character does a lot of clipping through walls and getting stuck on the terrain, but never to the point where I have to reload. Neither me or an NPC have ever gotten irrevocably stuck, but it is annoying. Your own Minecraft-style buildings and vehicles can look jarringly blocky and out of place in the beautiful smooth landscape if you're not willing to spend many, many hours lovingly crafting them. Add it all up and you end up with a game that's very engaging, but not very immersive. Still, the good outweighs the bad by a very large margin, and patches are still being put out. Fan created ISOs are already out there and there's some good stuff. I'd highly recommend this game. If it looks appealing to you, give it a go.			"

												Five and/or seven out of seven, depending on the quantum state of Dr. Allen Carter's interpretation of the afterlife.It ain't a perfect game by any means.  It's very unrefined, even after release; voiceovers of inconsistent quality, text sometimes reading more like a foreign language than English, story left open-ended, performance issues here and there, an end-game cutscene that makes the Uncanny Valley look shallow in comparison, those sorts of things.  Planet Explorers has its trouble spots, to be sure.Underneath that bit of rough, though, is a diamond, raw as it may be.  This game's got good bones.  Unlike most voxel-oriented games (including ones in the public spotlight much later), Planet Explorers offers the ability to build things on a smaller scale than terrain and buildings; vehicles, weapons, and even (to an extent) body armor are all able to be custom-designed by the player, and sharing these custom creations online with other players is an absolute breeze using the in-game workshop.  Both the pre-defined map in ""Story Mode"" and the procedurally-generated random maps in ""Adventure Mode"" offer spectacular landscapes.  The wildlife feels both familiar and alien at the same time, and the storyline - while rough in execution in many respects - is believable and engaging.Most importantly, though, is a development team that has demonstrated itself to be committed to working with players to fix problems and continually improve the game.  Communication has been bidirectional and top-notch, and the developers are quick to squish bugs as they're reported (even amid the influx of post-release feedback).All in all, a great game.  Rough around the edges, sure, but shiny and clean is for AAA shops; Planet Explorers is an example of an Early Access game gone right even amid the risk of things going horribly wrong (as tends to be the case for games with even a fraction of the scope offered by Planet Explorers).

												I am very impressed with this game. It takes a very different turn from trditional survival games, adding a story-mode that is multiplayer. A more down to earth crafting setup along with an open workshop to share and borrow creations. To name a couple things.Albeit the graphics won't knock your socks off but I have been impressed as well with an AI that seems to act very differently per animal. Animals hunting others or running from you while your hunting them, etc. The crafting to me feels much more creative too. Craft EVERYTHING, and not just presets. You can go into an editor and actually make a pair of gloves or a helmet in your own style, if your creative enough. Or just steal a cool blueprint from someone else. The possibilities are immense.

								Even in its early access stages, I have enjoyed this game. The ability to create your own vehicles (ground, sea, and air), and weapons is extremely fun. You can also download ones others have created to use in your game if your design abilities are lacking. You can also save buildings you create, to easily share with others, or if you have the materials, easily replicate again in your game, or even a new game.Yes, there are bugs. Some of them nasty and will crash you, or stop story progression in single player, or other crazy things. For an early access game, I think they are acceptable at this point as the developer tends to keep us up to date on the known ones. Multiplayer has some... issues. I don't play it often to really know them too much, but lag at times was one of them.Overall for an early access game, I think they are doing a great job.			"

								Alright, I had this game a pretty long time during development, and I have to say, something just doesn't feel polished about it. It isn't that the art is bad, it's not. It's not that the interfaces are ugly, they're not. It's that everything feels somewhat clunky. I dig in the dirt with a pick, and it shapes the polygons oddly. Combat feels a bit off. Interacting with things feels a bit off.To summarize, when you try an action and results are consistently not as you expect, that's what defines clunky.Also it really could do with a lighting engine of some kind. Nothing like digging underground and having it be like daylight. Makes you wonder why your helmet has a light on it.I know it's not quite finished, but as it gets nearer 1.0 I just feel like the clunky parts of it are here to stay.			"

Early Access Review
								What to say about Planet Explorers?Well, I play it since March /14 (almost in its release date, few days later).I watched some videos, seen some screnshots, and why not, right?Some indie games have a tendency of not completing its development to full release, because of a lot of reasons, but what the hell? I tried and bought it anyway.Of course I do not have a lot of hours, playing since 2014, because I tend to stop playing and watch the development, by the Devs or Youtubers, so I can have more accurate opinion about it and it give me the way to play.So, speaking about the game itself: It is a sandbox, indie, open world, survival crafting adventure (that I love most). I may be exagerating if I say that this is a better Minecraft, but this is my opinion, so yeah.You can craft components, weapons, furniture and ETC, and can build your home / base / castle / whatever. Did I mention that you can CREATE your own weapons? you can use their Voxel Tool to create the most beautiful and weird weapons and shields (weapons: sword, guns), but this doesn't stop there. You actually can create your own vehicle by the same voxel system. You have a limited box of creation, but this does not mean your creations will be limited. You can create small and large ground carriers, you can create aircraft and boats. The adventures with your own creations are so awesome!I must admit that the game have a lot missing, and I don't need to explain what is it, because, the game grow in every update released.Some may think about the update time, that it takes too long to hit Steam. I must agree on some of that, but cannot stop thinking that they are still working. I say that because I tought, long time ago (end 2014 / beginning 2015) that they gave up developing the game, because of the great delays of updates. I had uninstalled the game a lot of times, because of lack of hope, but then, I redownloaded it and played again, with new features that I didn't see it coming.Now I know one thing: they release updates, not too frequent, but when it hit Steam, the updates always come with very good improvements, and I mention bug fixes to new features.So, pleople, don't be afeared of Planet Explorers. They are working, and the game looks beautiful.I have invested in the game and it is showing its potential so far.Obs: If my words seem a little weird, I am not a native of the language, so I apologize, and no, I have nothing to do with Pathea Games.Thank you and support them.

												I really tried to like this game, I tried for 7 hours. But I just cant, I tried to look past the optimization issues, the fact that you do EVERYTHING REALLY REALLY SLOWLY, and that you will probably spend more time trying to fix it rather than play it. I thought by launch, the game was going to play well, and that it was going to be fun to play, but its just not. The story is pretty bad, the quests all comprise of ""you see that person half way across the entire freaking planet? I want you to go and bring them here at the speed of a crippled snail."" or sometimes its just a fetch quest, that also takes place miles away from where it started. But I kept thinking ""hey, its in early access, I'll give it a pass for now."", but then  A WEEK LATER  the game came out, in the same state as it was every other time I came back to it.Also it has a horrible memory leak that has been there since I bought the game a year or so ago. Not to mention, if you decide you DONT want to play the story, and just want to screw about on your own planet, that planet that you created takes up LOTS of space on your drive, I'm talking at least 100GB, and if you happen to run out of space because of what you did on that planet, your entire save file gets wiped forever. There's no bringing it back, it just turns into a brick. Also all the font ingame is white text on a sky blue background, because thats how you make sure no one can read anything you put there.However building your own weapons and cars is pretty cool, and it has nice music. Not nice music thats worth $3.99, but it is nice music.			"

The world is really fun and rewarding to explore, and I love the gather animations. The story line is branching but the game is mainly based of the Open-World/Sandbox feel to it. There arn't many biomes yet, like a snow biome. The only thing that brings this game down is it's technical issues,EARLY ACCESS VERDICT:7/10PREDICTED FUTURE VERDICT:8/10 - 10/10Once they fix the tech issues and add some stuff to the melee combat system.

								Gotta admit after playing 8 hours of it, it is a pretty horribly written gameWhatever the opposite of intuitive is, that’s what this game is... I mean I’ve played some games that took a bit to learn, but once you did, you’ll be like oh yea makes sense (anno 2070, sins of solar empire, space engineers, endless space) 1. AI is pretty bad, there’s no follower debugging teleports to player if they get stuck, I had to double back and tunnel them out in the direction they were running (into a wall horizontally and not in line with my tunnel...)2. Lots of content, no explanation or tutorials, masses upon masses of unexplained details, prepare to spend more time watching people play the game (tutorial) then actually playing the game3. Back to horribly written game, I. single player has no pause (I could be wrong), my pause in main menu, no pause in inventory or crafting menu, and being most critters can kill you in 1-10 shots, yup FUN!ii, main mission has near location marker, but side missions is a total guessing game tortoise missioniii. during the free the Martians mission an AI decided to run away from the open caged door, whereby making me unable to finish the mission until i teleported back to the same enemy camp, which they got a free respawn and I wasted even more heal/resurrectNot since eye divine cybermancy (game that uses amost 100% of the keyboard keys as hotkeys) to game has made me so tired of playing it4. Crafting is a bit of a chore, no level multipier so instead you have to buy schematic or armour which is just a +2 of what you currently have everytime u move on, or meet a new npc. I'd be happy to change my review once most of they issues is fixed... this game has potential but as it stands id rather be doing house chores, it'll give me more satisfaction effort for payoff then this game gives me right now..

												I recommend this game but with two VERY BIG caveats.1. Typos and grammatical errors are very noticable. So far while in game this has not yet been a problem though I could not not do the tutorial without a walkthrough. Caveat 1. is: Find a decent walkthrough and don't rely on in-game text to do the tutorial. It was incomprehensible in parts.2. This game has THE WORST audio I have ever experienced outside of sixth form video journalism classes. It's dreadful. But it is also hilarious. Five minutes spent clicking on people to make (clearly dev's best mate from college) say really stupid phrases over and over.Bird sounds are also rubbish, I find it immersion busting to hear magpies and pea♥♥♥♥♥ while on an 'alien' planet.That leads me to Caveat 2: Turn down the music completly and reduce the in game sounds a touch, then crank up Spotify playlist 'Cyberpunk SciFi RPG' and suddenly everything changes! You're in space on an alien planet and you no longer care that you're surrounded by breaking teenage voices. It's magic.I was minutes away from claiming a refund but something kept me playing the singleplayer story mode past the 2-hour cutoff and I'm glad I did. I love the weird story, creativity and so far questing has been pretty variable. It's not just kill seven wolves etc.I'm getting hints of space Minecraft with a bit of Albion thrown in, which was my favourite scifi fantasy game from the 90s.There is much to be improved with this game but devs are continuously updating, which is reassuring, and I do like to support indie gamesmakers.There are, two massive issues that were pushing me towards the refund I chose not to take. I think if you're going to spend £19 on a game you ought to be very aware of them first and be clear on whether you can live with the caveats above.			"

								I don't feel the need to really put a fully detailed review here as we're still in alpha, so I will keep this short. Planet Explorers has achieved what Everquest Landmark has tried to achieve in its alpha, and has done it better. I have not had this much fun playing a game like this in a very long time. The building system is very functional and easy to use far better than even Landmark's. The creation system allows for even greater ability and customization.  Reminds me very much of Kerbal Space Program's ship creator, and even has a high level of customization options then that. What this game achieves is bringing all the best parts of Starbound, Minecraft, and Landmark and brings them into one beauitful sandbox. For Sandbox lovers, this is a must buy. I can't wait to see what this game is like in its finished state.			"

Early Access Review
								I've had PE for quite a while, since about two years ago. It was not very polished then, it had a fair clout of content but it was clearly very early. Years fly by and the game seems to be in development hell. Fortunately for this indie gem, it clawed it's way back thanks to a remarkably dedicated dev team, so kudos to them for that. The game itself has improved in leaps and bounds, since the long awaited v 0.14, to the current 0.4, to become much the same game but so much more polished and rounded. Truly, it has been improved to the point of becoming a good game in its own right, which sets it apart from the rest of the herd (The title screen song is a real masterstroke showing the effort and attention of the devs, again, kudos). Not only becoming a good game but really becoming fun.With a fair bit more polish, optimization, content and general improvements, this game really shows a lot of promise, rocketing past it's slow period. The real only things that let it down are twofold:One downside I can complain about (and complain I most certainly will) is the camera control. Make no mistake, things are definitely getting better, but it's still definitely a pain having to switch control methods just to talk to a character, or having to hold tab to use a cursor. This is the main irritation most of the time, which slows the pace down to a crawl unnecessarily, especially when coupled with infuriatingly limiting keybinds! (TAB REBINDABLE FOR INVENTORY PLEASE!!)The second thing I would like to quibble about is the blizzard of menus and interfaces that all do different things, with different modes of access. At least now they are all in one list but I feel a lot more work needs to be done on the GUI usability before the game will flow appropriately. While gorgeous to look at, the user interface being all over the place is becoming somewhat archaic, especially when compared to more polished/larger budget titles which, if possible, would definitely make interfaces much more enjoyable to use. (Perhaps something more like a single master interface, with tabs for inventory, character, replication, map, etc.)TLDR:This game is FANTASTIC, in so many regards, having crawled out of a period of inactivity to rise to become magnificent. If you can get past the maddening difficult-to-use blizzard of GUI, and the camera controls from the black lagoon, there is a simply stunning game there, and it is meteorically improving.			"

												I finally finished the story mode. I want to say, great job to the devleopers on creating an egaging system that keeps nerds like me wanting to go ""just 5 more minutes"".The game is well worth the time and money I spent on it.My biggest issues at least for story mode -- The player might need to be given more ISOs ingame to help offset the learning curve behind the creation tool. Theres a big learning curve and a major time sneak into your game as you try to figure things out.- Colony set up. After hours of gameplay and such I would say this is the biggest issue (next to mining/lumber gathering) I have. I think I would rather see the NPCs auto-fill open roles in the colony based on what their skills are. Walls didn't seem to work nor did buildings. as the NPCs just sort of ran through them and I'm sure i kept getting rained on. Along with this is player inventory and colony inventory. I feel that the player should be able to fabrecate items from ether storage location. NPCs should build more things along with what they gather. Complete ISO items, wepaons, armor, defense weapons etc. I would also remove scripts from the store(s) if the player already has it learned.- Missions. There are ton of them which is awesome. Some of them can be very . . . confusing on what to do. Probably need to introduce a more indepth mission/quest log with details of where things can be found (I'm thinking more along the line for the gathering misions). We have a monster wiki in-game, might need to expand that to include the different plants as well.- Mining/Lumbering are pretty easy from the start through out. The Drill and Chainsaw IMO are worthless with the current development behind them. So we get stuck with a space game mining ore with a pickaxe and lumber with an axe. I think, the development team might need to look at taking all the gathering tools and merge them into a single item (like the Matter Manipulator in Starbound)... The current system to me seems half baked and not thought out. We have space traveling humans, I'm sure their ship wasn't crafted by men and women farming ore with pickaxes. Some of this I understand is because they don't want us terraforming the entire planet.Overall, besides my nit picking on development choices. The game was fun and I will return to it often to spend more time... Need to perfect my colony building and location.			"

												This game is truly a great game. It makes the player feel like they can expand and create most anything they want. It's only bugs at this stage of development is in tthe missions as somtimes the codes will gltich and events will not trigger. Besides this, it is quite stable and fun to play. P.S. I suck at writing review but just want to show my support for the game.			"

												I finally finished the story mode. I want to say, great job to the devleopers on creating an egaging system that keeps nerds like me wanting to go ""just 5 more minutes"".The game is well worth the time and money I spent on it.My biggest issues at least for story mode -- The player might need to be given more ISOs ingame to help offset the learning curve behind the creation tool. Theres a big learning curve and a major time sneak into your game as you try to figure things out.- Colony set up. After hours of gameplay and such I would say this is the biggest issue (next to mining/lumber gathering) I have. I think I would rather see the NPCs auto-fill open roles in the colony based on what their skills are. Walls didn't seem to work nor did buildings. as the NPCs just sort of ran through them and I'm sure i kept getting rained on. Along with this is player inventory and colony inventory. I feel that the player should be able to fabrecate items from ether storage location. NPCs should build more things along with what they gather.

I simply cannot understand the reviews for Planet Explorers.It is such a brilliant game, and has...🚀 1, the best vehicle, (Air ground, and water, underwater) And weapon building system in any game ever.🚀 2, A real sense of ""being on a strange planet.""🚀 3, A brilliant story, with missions, and quests.🚀 4, A HUGE play area, open world map.🚀 5, A choice between Story mode. Creative mode, or adventure mode.🚀 6, Beautiful music.

🚀 7, 3rd and 1st person perspective.🚀 8, Lovely graphics.🚀 9, Great in-game foraging (mining / harvesting etc system, to facilitate the design / build you own gear system.🚀 10, Workshop support, where you can download other peoples vehicles, and weapon designs. (in the form of ""ISOs."") Planet Explorers,  has a real ""oldschool"" adventure vibe.In fact the only thing I REALLY wish the devs would add is VR support.But they have said they wont, which is a REAL shame, as it would be utterly Amazing in VR. ⛔But for none VR fans, this is a fantastic game. I have most of the BIG ""survival games."" (minus horror and zombie titles which I do not like.)And this is one of the very best IMHO. Dont believe all the negative reviews.🌟Really solid game that will give you many hours of ""planet exploring"" fun, action, and immersion.🌟			"

								This goes a step beyond most building games, allowing you to design your own inventory items & vehicles... with tons of bag space for both materials and finished products. Not a typical survival game, but you'll encounter dangerous alien-dinosaur things while collecting recipes and materials. It's still pretty buggy (especially using the rope gun underground) & I'd like to see more frequent updates, but it's already strong as a creative sandbox. The mineral scanner and creation system are BRILLIANT. Looking forward to making custom armor. Custom weapons are already in the game; I made a glowing Bat'leth[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com]...			"

								Very well done, I am looking forward to future updates. Purchased due to a random viewing, did not plan to purchase or even look into it. Though I am now so glad I got it, very low price and so much more fun than expected. I really hope in the future the AI might be a little better and a few bugs through, but all in all very stable and very fun. Cant wait to see where the creators plan to take the game, so much hop efor the future.Game reminds me of minecraft for very clear reasons.Also somewhat Starship Troopers, not so much the gameplay, but more the enemies and look of the characters, many of the enemies look like bugs.

								I have been playing this on and off over the past year! I have been waiting for this game to come out on Steam! It is awesome!!!! Best alpha I have ever played! Lots to do, share with others so even in single player mode it makes you feel like your playing with others. Are there bugs, yes of course as in ever alpha but the Dev's have been outstanding with their responses and communication with the community!  There are alot of Utube videos made by experienced members of the Planet Explorer's community which are extremely helpful in learning  how to use the creator. This includes how to  import your own textures to sharing ISO (creations as in weapons, vehicles, flying vehicles and objects) Being new to the game myself, I have found these extremely helpful.			"

The only problem with it is that even with my computer (which is pretty good, but not the best) I can only run it at the second lowest graphics setting. I think that this will be fixed when the game updates more. Overall, it is a great game.			"

												The way the character controls and interacts with the environment is clunky, awkard, full of ""gotchas"" you have to learn to avoid or end up wasting time animation locked as punishment.  Let go of the mouse while digging?  That's punished.  Trying to dig a voxel that's out of range?  That's punished.  Your character will happily spend the rest of eternity producing a dig animation on a target that both you and the game know are out of range, and this happens often since you absolutely cannot move at the same time as digging.  Very fundamental things are tedious.Movement, mining, and some very important UI interactions (the scanner in particular) are extremely poorly designed and suck the fun out of what could otherwise be a game with some unique positives.Extremely disappointed to find the entire year they went silent produced nothing in this area.  I had assumed that would be a main product of an engine rework.			"

								Planet  Explorers is a great exploration, mining and crafting game. It has many cool features, such as a building tool to create weapons, vehicles and buildings in a 3D modelling type engine, which is easy to use, then allows you to import them in to the game to be used.  So creating custom content is easy and fun. The large variety of creatures and resources make it fun and dangerous. Some of the nicest features are: Smooth voxel terrainLarge variety of creatures, dangerous or not hostile. Custom building tool to create custom content and use it in game. Vast endless  world Resource mining and scanning is fun and intuitive. Farming as well as mining.NPCs you can befriend to help you gather resources, run your farm or otherwise.

								Tired of the simplicity of Minecraft and sick of waiting for Starbound?  Sick of Zombies and tired of Bambi killers but still want to survive and thrive?  I know I was, and boy am I glad I stumbled onto this.  I feel like I may have passed it over in the past because of bad reviews but as they had recently taken an upturn I decided to give it a shot.Now I can't speak to the multiplayer aspect (As it's in alpha I can only assume it's sketchy at best, but that's to be expected.) but the single player is excellent, the story (which I'm only a few missions into since I jumped right into adventure mode at the start) has been interesting so far.Here's a few aspects that make me want to play this over minecraft clones:Need creature parts but tired of running around hunting?  Set up some turrets and throw down a creature lure.Tired of running everywhere?  Build a rudimentary vehicle and ride into the sunset.Ten story creature?  Grab allies, outfit them with whatever you can find/buy/create yourself, make turrets, tanks and Take. It. Down.I'm only twelve hours in and have barely done more than get iron weapons, a few turrets, and dug a few really impressive tunnels (Which I was way more proud of than anything I ever built in minecraft.) and made a few rudimentary shelters to keep the rain off my head (which didn't work, it is [or was when I wrote this] an alpha.).  You can also build gods-know-what in the creation engine which is far too daunting for me to even touch at the moment, or if creating from scratch isn't your thing I'm sure you'll be able to download untold numbers of things others have created via steam in the future (Or now sans-steam with a little know-how).All in all you should keep an eye on this one, and if you have the extra cash go ahead and buy it.

												Finally!  A totally open world game which allows infinite possibilities.  This game is delivering upon the potential of the ambitious concept. I cant recommened it highly enough.You want an open world game?.  This game allows you to do almost anything.  You gather resources,   many types of resources.  You can make everything and anything. You can use pre made designs. Download others designed by players or design your own from scratch.   The only limit I found is that I couldnt build the nuclear missiles I wanted.  Battleship? Fine.  Stealth fighter, fine.  Motorbike, Star wars style land speeder, Monster trucks and madcap mash ups all fine.  Works really well.You want base building?  You can do anything.  Thought the style is a little tiny bit limiting it is vast.  It is somewhere between the complexity of Landmark (which most people cant use well) and other games with more simiplified base building such as Ark.  A nice middleground allowing the free use of imagination to create some awesome settlements towns and fortified structures.  Great fun and probably the thing I get most distracted by.  I am crazy about base building in games like this and Ark. You want to explore?  Ok, 2 sides to this.  It is a massive area to explore. You will soon realise you need to develop and get vehicles though nothing stops you wandering on foot.   Hostile alien races and local wildlife abound and the whole thing feels very nicely balanced.  It doesnt feel like a world setup to support your game but a world you literally found yourself in and now you have to survive and thrive.  This works well too. Sound?  I love the title theme loop (now with some beautiful vocals to make it one of the best game themes I can remember) and the in game sounds are all well done.  I think overall the sound effects could havemore attention to atmospherics but it is a small criticism and it was done well enough not to be any sort of problem.   One absolutely stand out moment is the (in my opinion) very beautiful opening title music.  It really sets a nice an atmosphere and is a beautiful piece of music in its own right.   I wish it was a longer track as I like it a lot. Probably the only real criticism I have is the NPCs in the game.  They just seem like props.  This was a lost opportunity.  If they actually went and did more with astmospheric sounds supporting it, settlements would have felt much more alive.   This is not a major issue because of the nature of the game,. later they will be doing stuff at your direction but for a long time they feel less alive.Graphical?  Erm. Interesting one this, It uses nothing in terms of the capability I have, yet somehow, strangely, it is enough. Its not great, it's not bad. Its alright. I should say, that the only relatively limited aspect is character creation but this is not a big deal, though I try to stay in first person.I have been having a smooth experience for a while for the most part but there does seem to be a few serious bugs still in the game but not so many that it stops me playing and miles ahead of many other games. This is a game you will have installed for years and will keep coming back to.  Bang for buck, fun and for the open world nature of the game, I cant recommend this enough to people who like;Open WorldResource GatheringSettlement Building and DevelopmentDesigning Vehicles and EquipmentExplorationLongevity and good value.One of the best games of its type and the best pre release game I ever purchased in terms of meeting all expectations and delivering the game that was promised at the end of it.Overall though, This games development  reminds me of PC gaming pioneers in the days before you just wrote a game to rip people off on Xbox Live.  This is a magnum opus and you should all be very justifiably proud of yourselves.   I dont think I have ever been so effusive in my praise for any game and nor would I be if it did not deserve it.

												I booted this game up again recently and played through the story mode.I really enjoyed it, so it took about 44 hours.Looking forward to more story, but it plays well to this point, with a rich storyline.Graphics are good and gameplay is similar to a mmorpg style control system.Part of the fun of the story was investigating the event that preceeded your arrival to the planet, even outside game I was thinking about what had happend based on the evidence I had at the time.Building your own bikes, cars, aircraft and aquatic vehicles was also great, though I admit mine were mostly just adjustments from the useful templates. I didn't get around to building Cloud's Buster sword, but I'm sure I'll look into later.Run down of the gameplay:I started with a stone knife and leather armor, got a jetpack and enjoyed flight the first, built a small helicopter and got shot down by the locals. Built up a base and then packed it up and moved it to a more defensible location.Built a train track halfway across the map and fought some sea critters becuase why not?All in all, for the pricetag you get an adventure and some fun game mechanics, which, while not perfect, are fun to explore.

												I was thoroughly surprised by the game. We bought it well before it was being greenlit on steam, played it for a while and found the experience of very early access to be rather disappointing. It went ignored for a long while, until our interest as a gaming group was roused again by the recent release. After installing and setting up a server, we started to explore storymode. This is a true sandbox game, even in the mission based story mode. It allows the player a lot of freedom to explore, to build and create.The voxel based design system is unsurpassed. Never have I had so much freedom in a game.I can highly recommend this, especially at the price of 23 Euros.			"

								the fact that you can create your own weapons and vehicles makes this game a one-of-a-kind exploration game. i spent hours and hours to create guns, swords and aircraft. you lose yourself in the editor cause you always find something new to add to your creation. and later when you finished your creation you need to find or craft the ressources you used in the editor. its not easy to get all the stuff, but it isnt hard either. all in all the best early access exploration game ive ever seen! the updates take a long time sometimes but when an update comes out, its a huge, well done update.

												First off, I'd like to point people to the available free demo. You can find out if you enjoy the game by playing that first. I did.  I found this game quite enjoyable. It's survival and base building and resource gathering. It's not for everyone, but again, there's a free demo to see if it's for you. Some of the features are harder to figure out, even with hints. But a little trial and error, or even just looking online helped out quite a bit. It's not completely polished, but it seems like it's a ""complete"" game, which is better than any other post-early access game I've played.			"

That said the developers work on this more than I've seen pretty much any other develeper. They really love their game and it shows. The world has so more personality and the gameplay stems from a deep seated passion for creativity.

								I would like to state I have only played this game for a small amount of time, so I am not the most experienced with this game and have not seen all features.A very interesting concept, space age open world where you can gather rescources and build like minecraft, a somewhat open world like skyrim, and a diversity of species similar to spore.Pros:- A simple crafting system, took a few minutes to figure it out, but easy for anyone to understand- More creatures than you would expect, where else can you be chased by a horde of four-armed baboons then have a bird-like dragon swoop down mid-chase to try and kill you, AND THEN be chased and killed by a wart-hog monster the size of a tree- The graphics are not ground breaking, but it's something you can appreciateCons:- The character customization is almost non-existant: four faces, eight hair styles (some don't connect to the skull fully), and no different body shapes, but you can change your skin and eyes from white to black from green to purple. You can be a tall oompa-loompa if you want! (that's a pro I guess)-There are some glitches and graphical errors, but this game is still in early beta I think, you should be expecting that, nothing game breaking though-Very few things your character can do, for example you can''t run (may be an upgrade, but that wouldn't make sense)Overall:This game genre is something I enjoy and it is in alpha/beta stage, if you enjoy minecraft, 7 days to die, or any survival game like that, you will enjoy this, and keep in mind many things will be updated. Of course there will be issues of some nature, but if you're expecting otherwise, don't buy it because you will be dissapointed because you didn't know better.			"

												After playing it a bit more, I've decided to change my opinion a bit. I still recommend the title, but there are caveats. Lots of them. The game has good parts and ... very awkward parts.Good: Voxel creation tool. It is absolutely amazing. Editor is well designed, and this how in-game object design should be done.Awkward:Oh, boy... there's a lot of those.Enemies are bullet sponges. Not just a normal bullet sponges, but supreme bullet sponges. Every fight is equivalent to fighting M1 Abrams tank using bb gun. Except that driver of m1 is drunk or asleep and for some reason has hard time overrunning or hitting you. You plink everything to death, even with very tough weapons. Especially on foot.  Judging by in-game comments (left by NPCs) they were turned into bullet sponges on purpose, to demonstrate ""how tough"" the planet is.Combat in general. All enemy movements is strange. Creatures have very hard time hitting you, and you have very hard time moving around with a ranged weapon. For some reason it uses MMO game structures. Meaning you have a lot of fairly useless npcs with floating ""!"" and ""?"" over their head. Haven't seen this since playing HellGate: London.Voice acting. The studio tried to introduce voice acting, BUT it is quite hammy at times. Some npcs are alright, but intro would work much better without voice.Design vs Utility. There's something very strange going on with armor and weapon designs. Basically, due to amazing editor, you can design any gun. Except its stats will suck compared to in-game generic bullet rifle. Apparently in the past it was possible to make weapons with multiple barrels, or with barrel pointing in different direction, and then this ability was for some reason removed. Which is a pity. There's not much point in designing your own gun, unless you go after specific look. Armor design process has similar problem. You can make a breastplate out of diamond, and its defence rating will be very low.Designing wearable armor is also awkward. Unlike vehicle/gun design tool, which works flawlessly, the armor design tool has trouble remembering to which body part it is supposed to be attached, and to which gender it is designed. So, if you design a ""belt"" part of armor, and try to equip it, the game will stick it into your character's chest instead. Armor must be equipped in specific order, apparently. Also, designed armor doesn't even go into slot you specify. It is on separate page, and you're apparently supposed to manually adjust placcement of individual items. So, this functionality looks unfinished.Audio issues. Audio that is being played in your spekaers is calculated relative to character's head. Even if you play using third person camera. meaning if your character looks at the camera and something explodes to character's right, you'll hear sound coming from left instead. Strange that this bug exists (it is easily fixable)Bringing an item from creator into the world is awkward too. You see, in the game you find ""scripts"", which allow you to make items with replicator (as long as you have resources). So one would assume that making something in editor would produce similar ""script"".. but NOPE. For some reason, this is done very differently - you're supposed to have parts of model in inventory, and instead of using a script, you need to go into model editor mode and ""export"" the model.Resource trees aren't properly automated. Let's say you need to create item X, that requires components A, B, C whiere A requires D, E F, B requires D, G, H and C requires D G F. You can't just click on final product and order the game to automatically create missing components for every level. Instead you need go through individual components and create them manually. Very annoying.The whole colony management thing is, frankly, weird and feels out of place. Everything about it is very poorly explained, and making a colony turns the game into tower defense. Also, you can apparently bring ""story"" npcs into your colony, even if they're givers for main story quests. I'm not sure if this even supposed to be possible.I still think the game is decent, in the sense that roaming part of it is fun, and voxel creator is very cool. However there are a lot of weirdness and strange design choices going on, and the game feels very rough around edges. It looks a bit dated by now too.So, it is worth checking out, but it definitely doesn't reach its full potential.			"

												An enjoyable expirience. You get many modes to chose from and hgave the abilty to host a server and play with friends. The editing tools allow you to make anything you can think of from final fantasy armor to you name it. Your only limitation is your imagination. The sandbox is full of quests and aliens and fauna. Worth the price of admission.			"

												story mode, adventure mode and a build mode. with a lot of character and world options. a massive array of parts to build whatever you can think of.   Extremely robust custom build system, your imagination is your own limitation.  mmo or fps type preset controls, although a little awkward at first using a ranged weapon.  it's not bad once you get acclumated.large array of unique creatures.  build your own settlement, npcs have unique skills to enhance your settlement, also to help defend against random attacks from the native creatures. great overall sandbox game.

												This will be my first review on steam, but I shall do my best anyway.This game is an interesting answer to a gripe fans of the Build/Survival genre for a long time. Most games of this nature are rarely unique and often feel like digital cut-outs of something like Minecraft (which in its self is virtual Legos), but Planet Explorers feels different. Not only is Planet Explorers different, but it feels as if the creators genuinely cared for the title they were working on. The game uses a system for creation that feels a bit like it may have been used by the developers themselves, when a Planet Explorer player says that you can build or create anything they mean it (you have been warned).Now that does not mean it does not have problems.- The graphics are not all that impressive 7/10- The sound needs some serious work 4/10- The procedural generation has many many flaws -/-- The worst of all are the controls 2/10The controls are seriously in need of work. There are three control schemes; the first being similar to many MMOs with the mouse cursor having free movement across the screen and requiring the right mouse button to move the camera, the second is an awkward version of the first with the cursor locked and mouse movement directly translating to camera movement, and the third is a wonky hard to use first person camera. In my honest opinion this game would have done well with a simple over the shoulder third person shooter camera angle. In conclusion the game is very fun for the niche gamer, but without a proper control scheme it will not hold much appeal for the average gamer (and many Build/Survival players as well).    "

Early Access Review
								I don't even know where to start.  As others have said, this game is exactly what I've sought for a long time.  In a nutshell, they managed to take the positive aspects of various sandbox crafting games and made it fun and removed the tendency to become boring.I love this game and can't stop playing it.  I can't say the concept of the game is simple because there are so many directions it can go.  There isn't a clear direction on the devs' part, and I mean that in a good way.  They've built a really solid foundation and I'm hanging on the edge of my seat waiting for the next update.I came across this game looking for something that gives me open-world exploration and crafting.  This game delivers that and then some.  Easily one of the best games I have in my library.It is tempting to try to compare this to games like Minecraft, Starbound, Terraria, etc., and it wouldn't be wrong to do so: there are a lot of similarities, and feels like some of the devs either worked on one of those or took a lot of inspiration from them, but then again many of these aren't really new concepts.  And in my opinion there's nothing wrong with borrowing ideas that work.Where this game really delivers is graphics -- the lack of good graphics made the aforementioned games quickly boring for me;  the Creation Editor, where you can build fairly detailed models from base materials and attach crafted assets to make fairly complicated structures such as custom weapons, vehicles (land, air, AND sea), etc. -- the CE really is a game within a game and I've spent a good chunk of time just creating things there;  and the beginnings of a pretty nice ""town management"" system; you craft the various components of your village, invite npcs to live with you, and assign various tasks. not a lot to it right now but it has the makings of a really fun mini-game... and that's all above and beyond (what i find to be the very zen-like process of) mining and scavenging raw materials to build with, and doing actual exploration.  The time in-game shown as of right now (just over 38 hours) is how long it took me to get through the ""story"" part of the game, and several quests are incomplete, so it just goes to show that they intend to do more with that part of it.  As expected, there are plenty of bugs to work out, but the game is so engaging I barely notice them, except for the ones that break quests at which point i have to reload from a last save or something, but overall the game is amazingly well done given it's still in alpha.This game easily gets a 10/10.

Early Access Review
								Since I bought the game I have been playing it for 4 days straight and not even stick of truth was able to keep me engaged so much. This game is basically Minecraft plus with better graphics (compared to other Minecraft-ish games), better mobs (from the cute little woodland critter to giant dinosaur roaming the plain), somewhat better crafting (you can craft modern tools and equipment) and a better story (does Minecraft even have a story except killing the dragon?) Of course there are many aspects that are not on par with Minecraft such as water/lava physics, processing items on other items (putting meat on fire to cook) etc. but we shall see how the final edition will be.Pros:1. Best graphics among Minecraft-ish games so far (DON'T YOU EVER COMPARE THIS TO CALL OF DUTY. I AM SICK OF STUPID COMPARISON. CAN YOU DIG YOURSELF A KHAZAD DUM IN CALL OF DUTY?)2. Somewhat cool story (as a Black Isle worshiper, I can't say I am impressed but the story is at least solid)3. The world and the atmosphere are awesome. It does give you a feeling of adventuring in an unknown planet with cool (sometimes crazy looking) creatures and weird plants and landscape and ancient ruins.4. The ability to drive land vehicles and fly helicopters and construct missile launcher/laser cannon etc. 5. The ISO system is fascinating. You can literally create anything you can ever imagine.6. JET PACK AND GLIDER! seriously, try it out. get to the top of a mountain, run, fire your jet pack, switch to glider at max height and enjoy ;)7. other minor pros listed by other reviewersCons:some technical issues1. memory leak crash. It seems quite some people have this problem and I encountered it a few times in the game as well. luckily it does not seem to happen too frequently (for me) and the game autosave every 10 minutes so you won't lose much.2. lag? not really a con but the game somehow confuses people by including an option in the launcher where you can choose video card. THIS IS NOT WHERE YOU CHOOSE GPU FOR THE GAME. if you are using Nvidia card you have to manually set the game (PE_client) to use your gaming GPU in Nvidia control panel or I guarantee you that your game will lag as cr*p.3. possible problem with fast travel and sleeping and saving at meteor crate. Some players report bugs that delete all your autosave files when they fast travel from meteor crate and sometimes it involves them sleeping or saving at that location. Personally I didn't encounter any problem but just to put it out here.4. if you delete your steam and then reinstall steam and play the game using your old save (the same version)... you may see some empty texture in places where you dug. when you jump through the empty texture you will somehow reappear in the sky...5. I somehow encounter a bug where if you put a roof closely on top of your defense cannons. they will magically appear on top of the roof...6. multiplayer is still quite buggy so don't expect too much fun from theregameplay issues:0. NEED CHANGE ASAP - monster corpses disappear too fast. when you are fighting a pack of monsters, before you can finish the last one, the other corpses may start dissolving already. it is like you have less than 1 min to pick up the loot and it is not cool.1. NPC SELLS TOO MANY STUFF. you can literally buy everything from NPC with meat. In multiplayer you can even access this one global shop where everything is on sale. I think it is better that only the uncraftable/uncollectible items and some basic starting tools are purchasable. 2. combat still needs a bit of work. 3. can't dig and move at the same time. when you start digging you are rooted.4. monsters are not very threatening, except that black crab thing. don't know why but black crab can sometimes one hit kill you.5. can't use weapon while flying with glider (imagine how cool it can be when you rain death from above :D)6. the bottom of the lake/ocean is always flicking... also the color of your vehicle will be changing randomly if you alt+tab out and get back in the game7. many objects are not solid, for example, trees. only a small part of a huge tree is solid so you can walk through a tree and fly through a tree but sometimes you can't because that part of the tree decides it wants to be solid and you hit the tree and crash :(8. the mineral scanner does not seem to work properly when you are moving so you are forced to stand still in order to scan. 9. unlike in MC where you craft items by placing materials in specific ways, this game uses crafting scripts and the crafting script list can be a bit overwhelming later when you collect a lot of them or when you play multiplayer where you are given all scripts at the beginning. although you can search them by types it is still not very convenient. In summary, a cool game that is still at alpha with alpha problems but definitely playable and just look at the cool features the devs are planning so if you like Minecraft-ish games then try this out. You can't be disappointed, unless you are that kind of player who likes hand holding all the time then why are you playing a Minecraft-ish game in the first place?			"

								This was a promising game, back in the days. The recent update contains enough bugs to completely ruin any game. Collision detection is completely random (this means that there's a good probability of you getting stuck in the air), the controls are awful (some can't even be remapped, because for instance, the tab key doesn't want to be recognised, despite already being mapped), and the AI is one of the worst I have ever had the misfortune of play with\against. I'm sad to say that in the current state, it's not even worth a quarter of what they charge for it. MAYBE one day, when all the bugs are fixed, it will be worth it, but this is not that day.Edit 29th of May: One of three gamebreaking bugs is fixed - AI no longer terrible. Two more to go, and the thumbs down becomes thumbs up.			"

												Great game, overall I found myself impressed with the scope and diveristy of gamelplay. The game appears to be quite polished and the graphics are pretty lovely as well.The creative system in itself is probably already worth giving this game a 5/5 stars. I had a lot of fun just playing with the creation system, making several creations and testing them out inside the game. Probably the most solid boxel design system I've seen so far.The combat is fun and engaging, some of the enemies are pretty tough, which in turn made powering up feel very rewarding. Defeating foes which I struggled with in the past was very pleasant.The characters are very well written and the story so far is looking great too.The exploration is amazing, probably the best component of the game, scouting the unknown alien planet felt very engaging. That being said, I did not love the mineral prospecting system. as valuable resources were scattered too thinly and searching for them was not incredibly enjoyable.That being said I give this game a 5/5. It is incredible that I could get such a great game for such a nice price. Thoroughly recommended.			"

Early Access Review
								As expected, Planet Explorers is a work in progress, and aside from the bugs, what's there could easily be a stand-alone game.  The number of hours of playtime I have enjoyed is staggering when compared to most AAA titles, so I consider it money well spent.That said, the game is very rough around the edges, so if you are the type to get frustrated easily by bugs, glitches, and terrible ally pathfinding, you might want to give the game some time to mature.  I lost count of how many times I arrived at a quest destination after a long journey, only to realize that the quest NPC(s) was nowhere to be found.  Most of the time, retracing my steps would lead me to said NPC(s) running mindlessly into a tree or rock, which I would have to destroy to snap them out of their strange trance.  Occasionally, they would get stuck on nothing.  Occasionally, I would get stuck on nothing, too.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.But if you can tolerate typical early access issues during early access, I think you will find the story is quite atypical--in a good way--for this sort of game, and the city building is shaping up to be something special.  It isn't quite there yet, but Planet Explorers has tons of quests, tons of dialog, and tons of ways to utilize and/or manage your colony.  The voxel system itself is pretty flexible, and once you get used to it (which does take some time) the in-game editor is surprisingly easy to use.  You can make decorations, equipments, and even vehicles.UPDATE 4/29/2016Quite some time has passed, and that time has not been kind to this title.  It is nearly as clumsy as it ever was, and other Early Access games have since been released in a worse state only to progress leaps and bounds beyond Planet Explorers.  I am not yet ready to change my recommendation to a ""No"", but I am close.  I suspect I will have to, at some point.  For now, if this is your niche, I still cautiously recommend it.			"

With that, we all agreed that I was pretty correct. For an open world, voxel-based game where you hunt huge♥♥♥♥♥monsters sounds pretty damn amazing. And amazing is what this game is.

												This game in a word: Ambitous. There are a lot of things I love about this game and its a shame that it isn't more popular. Being honest here, I thought the game was still in early access. Its definitley a bit rough around the edges but its still pretty enjoyable. Likes:-Fantastic Crafting System-Custom Vehicles and Gear that you get to make in an easy to use editor-huge variety of flora and fauna, all excellently modeledDislikes: -Audio design is kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥a lot of the sound effects are awful)-Textures aren't as high resolution as I would like-Cringy main menu music(seriously, who puts vocals in a video game soundtrack???)Notes: I've never seen voxels used in this way before. The level of customazation is over the top. However, in adventure mode the terrain can do some very weird things like make spikes and ridges out of nowhere that make no sense. Also the caves are quite boring. I'm not fond of the Sexed armor/clothing, I was trying to go more androgenous with my character but now she's running around in a skimpy hunters outfit because she can't wear male clothing lol. For the Devs: Excellent models, the terrian generation needs some tweaking, and you should fire whoever did you audio(lol). AND LET ME CROSS DRESS FFS!!!!!7/10- Can't do a Mulan "

Gives me a bit of faith back for early access games :)  EDIT: looking like the game will be finished in the next few weeks, i will keeping my fingers crossed for DLC, although as the game stands now there is ALOT to do, just creating the perfect car, boat, copper, tank or some other contraption ya head can dream up can take hours. For me at least is almost gaming perfection, maybe better textures and a more in depth character creator and more choices for vertical parts or the ability to crate your own parts.			"

Product received for free
Planet ExplorersPlanet Explorers is a game about exploring alien hostile lands while trying to survive and build your own kingdom. Does it make the exploration worthwhile or shoots itself in the head, let’s find out:Gameplay:Planet Explorers contains 3 game modes: Story mode, Adventure mode and Build mode.  The story mode is where the real meat of Planet Explorers lies. You start off in a ship that crashed on the surface of a strange planet with only a few supplies at your disposal. From here on you need to scavenge various materials, complete objectives while fighting various hostile creatures and explore the planets and thus the name.Everything about Planet Explorers screams MMO. From the graphics to the mundane quests, Planet Explorers checks off every box in a MMO genre. First and foremost, you will be grinding a lot to create weapons and buildings but that is expected of a survival game in this age. What really impressed me was the variety present in the game. From the creatures that populate the planet to the amount of weapons and diverse buildings you can build inside the game, everything is varied and creates a truly alien atmosphere. When you start a game, you are given a few biomes to choose from including grasslands, forests etc. All these biomes are different not only in their visual style but in terms of their fauna. Every new biome had me looking for every new creature I could find and see what it did. Unlike a game like No Man’s Sky where the wildlife rarely attacks you or differs in their actual nature instead of only appearance, the creatures in Planet Explorers are a sight to behold and they cause you to flee in terror when you realize you do not have the proper equipments to actually withstand the mighty beasts. Even the smaller of creatures which appear non-alarming from a distance can easily overtake you when they approach in hordes. It’s a shame then that the combat in Planet Explorers is utterly lacking in depth. While the weapons are diverse, the feedback of these weapons are nothing more than firing a water gun. You don’t actually feel the impact of a sword striking a massive beast or a gun actually killing an enemy. The hitboxes in the game feel off and there is a certain disconnect between the player and the weapon he is wielding. The movement is also very clunky and the animations are very poorly designed. The building in Planet Explorers is pretty great though. When you have done the required grinding and are ready to build something magnificent, the building system comes into play. It is easy to use and if you have the required materials, you only need to pick and place the wanted blocks. It is one of the biggest strengths of Planet Explorers aside from its creatures and definitely has appeal to it. What lets it down though is the UI. While the diverse amount of weapons are good, it hampers the UI down. There are a lot of icons cluttering up the screen and you will more often than not lose an important item in your inventory because it gets so filled up and is difficult to separate from your other items. The Adventure mode is pretty similar to Planet Explorers. Here, instead of starting on a crashed spaceship, you start out in a town and get quests from various NPC’s. What separates it the most from the story mode is the fact that you can choose the biome on which you want to start and you will most likely get a headstart because of the available resources in the town. The Build mode is a mode where you are given a biome free of every creature and are left to explore and build. This mode is good for the people who really want to get in depth of the building system and such.There is also a certain lack of polish to the game which suggests it should have been in Early Access for a few more months as I am doubtful that the devs will continue to support it as they have been till now. The multiplayer is also pretty much dead and I was unable to join or create any game with other human players. VisualsThere are both good and bad parts to the game’s visuals. On one hand, the biomes look so diverse from each other and create beautiful vistas along with terrifying new creatures which intrigue your inner explorer while on the other hand, the human character models and the fighting animations are really bad. There is also a lot of texture pop in and that causes the player to break out of immersion.SoundFrom the get go, you are treated to one of the most beautiful soundtracks that could have accompanied this game. From the menu to the world itself, the soundtrack is so soothing and melodious that I found myself constantly just drowning down in it. There is no voice acting as to speak of but some of the creature sounds were simply amazing and to the point.OverallI would have more heartily recommended Planet Explorers had there not been a slew of other survival games on the market. It has some really nice ideas and has a huge potential but is still in need of fixing. Had it still been in early access, I would’ve hoped for the required polish but since it’s fully released, I have to recommend it but only when on a sale.Pros:Great atmosphereDiverse flora and faunaSoothing SoundtrackCons:Clunky movement and combatBad Combat AnimationsLots of bugsRating: 65/100This review was brought to you by Review Experts through the generous contribution of Daniël - REX ♥ Gaming "

Early Access Review
								I absolutely recommend this game!As I described it to my roommate, it's like Minecraft and Skyrim had a baby in space. And it is fantastic!There are certainly still some bugs to work out; like written and spoken dialogue not matching up or having typos, at least one instance of a completely different character's dialogue from a completely separate mission being heard, and characters walking away while still talking to you.But that all pales in comparision to just how great the game is as a whole. The landscapes, plants, and creatures are all exceptionally crafted, incredibly alien, yet subtly familiar, too. The creatures run the gambit from squee inducing cuteness to don't-play-alone-in-the-dark scary to I-hope-that-colossal-thing-is-friendly. The different biomes feel very different from each other, yet blend seemlessly.Then there's what YOU can do! You can full sandbox it or follow storyline quests and sidequests. There's harvesting, learning ISO's (blueprints), crafting, and even making fully customizable weapons, vehicles, buildings, you name it. And when I say fully customizable, I don't mean you have a few skins to slap on or mods to click in place. I mean you can go as in depth as you want, from the ground up shaping or borrowing in game assets to create a wholly orginal item which is fully functional within the game.I'm incredibly excited to see them polish this gem so it shines the way it deserves when it leaves early access to become a full release.

All other block building and mining games allways resulted in spending the entire game mining for materials and I hated that; this game on the otherhand does not require spending the whole game mining ffor hours and hours. There is am inpressive balance between mining, building, and missions that make this game in my opion one of the best games I have ever played. It is in beta and there are bugs and crashes, but the game auto saves so often that you will not lose much (THANK YOU PROGRAMMERS!!!!!!!) :)The level of weapons, vehicle, and building creating is the next generation of mining/building games. From a weapon reciever and barrel you can design your own gun (or other items) to a great level of detail how you want it.If this is Beta I cant wait for the full cook.  Keep up the great work programmers..			"

								There are things to really like about the game. More realistic graphics as compared to Minecraft. Sci-fi theme. The world is not generated, but carefully crafted, with a storyline to matchHowever, I could not get into the game. The UI is poor and difficult to use. The main elements of the game - crafting, interacting with NPCs, and harvesting resources are tedious. The controls are not intuitive and lack feedback. As a consequence, combat feels boring.It's a great idea with poor execution that made the game not fun to play. And if a game isn't _fun_ what's the point of playing it?			"

								I found the game to be quite bland. It has a variety of landscapes and creatures, but they seem to be slapped together with an algorithm that doesn't make much sense and can make worlds seem awkward.Constructing anything seems needlessly complex, which makes producing anything not so much a challenge but a grinding task. Some may enjoy this but I find the cost/reward to be very imbalanced.For a voxel based game I found digging to be far too awkward and time consuming, which led me to avoid digging where ever possible.The vehicle construction is fun and I like the option to design your own weapons, too. I also enjoyed the variety of transport methods like jetpacks, helicopters and motorbikes.Planet Explorers is mediocre and there are many games that do each element better, but perhaps few that combine them into a singular game.

								Interesting mix of Monster Hunter with Starbound/Minecraft. Most of the game mechanics are in place (as of v0.752), although some things still require more work (combat and AI in particular).For more in-depth look see video.

								I totally recommend this game, and a Big Praise goes out to the Dev's for the dedicated work they are doing in getting this game off the ground and flying. I have challenge the forum personnel as well with some different  attitudes they are well adjusted. and do their best to answer and help with Bug testing of the game. The game is well done though still has some bug issues that are being worked on. and some things still being added. personally i like that they are taking their time with the full release and the beta. Most Games come out half finished and not even playable anymore . PE is NOT one of those games. They care about what they are doing and this game and their Gamers. A few things i would like to see:Would like to see the Stand alone version updated. Some sound issue : needs a bit better equalization of sounds, around some water areas it's like white noise, but still playable. In another words the sounds all seem to wash together and becomes nearly white noise. Like to much wind with the water.Eating sounds needs toned down. Does need a better save system between the different modes of the game, instead of the one save in a bucket system(The game has 20 saves 3 of them are auto saves) have had it save a build save and it used all three of the auto saves with the same save. which deleted out the auto save of what i was doing in the story, you should be able to have a lot more hard saves in this section of the game as well. Though these are Birthing pains as it is for the game.Water and animals are good and the build system is good and they are improving even more on that system from what i can gather on the forums and the many posts i have read.The AI does need improving on, but that to is something they are working on, with some fix's to be out in the next update.Crafting is a breeze in the game, just get the materialsThe care system still needs some balancing ( Would like to see Water not just Food and a ton of medicines implemented in the game and not so much sickness,) these are suppose to be healthy bright individuals that do the colonization.  So some balancing there though i had read somewhere that this was still in flux on it's balancing. Need a better way to source water for the colony other then a Pitcher. All in all though the game is very well polished and the Dev's do listen to suggestions and problems and try to fix whats wrong. This is something i find to be a necessary as in a lot of games the Dev's seem to be nowhere to be found. These people are on the ball, and i praise them for that.As for Beta release, this game is close to it from what i can see, I can hardly wait.Just a Note: I set on the side lines for about a year and a half watching as this game Developed. I play mostly AAA games, even Beta ones like Warframe. I play Games 8 to 10 hours a day, One of my friends told i should check this one out again so i did and love the game.I've been gaming since Arcade was the only way to game, Have done Pro Beta Testing both in Closed Alpha and Closed and Open Beta and finished versions of games like Black Prophecy. ( thats a year and a half on 3 continents of Servers)  Have Admined many DayZ Servers and run a couple have done extensive mods of some games like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and run fully Modded Servers for it and UT as well. and worked with a group of Modders. ( A whole different breed of people ) Have built gaming Forums and had one of my own. Also Admined them and set Moderators and the like. Have also been in a team building a gaming site or 2. So i know the dedication that is needed. They have that DedicationSo my hat is off to you and keep up the good work. I'll keep playing			"

								The new sandbox experience. Please note: It seems that the 0.75 version (the first version uploaded to steam) has more features than I know of - I only played 0.72 (pre-steam) to the full extent of it.It's an alpha, so please do play the Demo before buying (and check the demo version since those could be outdated)!Be aware of the minimum system requirements! Also, saves can be incompatible between updates - if you don't like ""wipes"", you should probably wait!A beautiful, fun and full of potential game that features a very interesting Story Mode, great weapon/item/vehicle editor and easy-to-use build mode with free camera.There's also an Adventure mode (think Minecraft's Survival Mode - infinite randomly generated map), Build mode (Creative Mode) and also Multiplayer.Since the game is in early alpha, the storyline isn't complete yet, nor the editor or many other features, but you can already see the game shaping up very nicely and there's a decent amount of stuff to do already. Fun items like jetpacks, gliders and hooks are already in the game and only need a bit more polishing.The player-made vehicles (cars and helicopters, currently) and items (swords and guns) add a lot of nice content to play with.You'll also be able to make objects like tables and paintings, and put decals and effects on your creations.The (current) cons of the game comes from the fact that it's an early alpha. The movement/camera scheme can be a bit annoying at times, the optimization must be worked on, and a few other bugs regarding monster movement and AI, terrain loading and collision detection. But the developers are aware of all those issues, and are working on them (things that slightly annoyed me on 0.72 seem to have been fixed/improved on recent versions).The plotline is very interesting and engaging - I can't wait until they write more and put more quests & story in the game! The remaining features you can easily read & watch videos on, or discover for yourself on the demo.The game is worth it and I hope it succeeds and the development goes on smoothly.Along with Starbound, it's one of the most worthy sandbox games to watch currently.Have fun! :D			"

												Very fun adventure/building game.  The creation system is on spot and is simple enough for a child to operate it.  This game has several elements that would make it an amazingly fun multiplayer game for a group of friends.  I highly recommend this game to anybody who loves to make thier own weapons, vehicles, and go on adventures spanning massive landscapes.			"

								Probably the most creative take on the voxel buildersurvival games currently. Lots of diverse creatures, plants etc that remind me a bit of spore in terms of the many different kinds of critters. The vehicle (land, sea, air)/weapon(melee,ranged) creation system is crazy... you can build anything you can dream of pretty much.Single player campign is pretty solid for an alpha. Multip[layer is OK, although i've never tried pvp. Still in alpha and apparently they are doing a big rework of the game code. My main beef with the game is that it isn't farther along b/c I want to play it more. However, it is quite unique and ambitious. Also in its current state I bet you could get quite a few hours out of the campign and multiplayer and the creation system could provide endless hours.			"

								I greatly enjoy this game. Making custom items, weapons, and transportation in a simple editor is what makes this game just that much better. I love the sounds of the enviroment around you as you play. It gives the sense of beauty to an uknown planet and how alive it is. I have started to get back into the game since the latest update and I'm not disappointed. The graphic changes are amazing from what it used to be! Still can't believe this was made on Unity. Overall, it's a great survival and building game. It's even better with friends! If other reviews or images make the game not seem worth it, the game is still worth a try.Tip:The bigger the weapon the more damage it does. So if you're building a sword, make it a big one.			"

								Feels like a combination between Minecraft and The Sims, but with a space theming. Definitely worth getting for anyone who likes building, survival, and exploring. The vehicle and weapon creation is also very cool. The only downsides are the combat and the textures, as well as some issues with animation, but since it's in early access I suppose these will be improved eventually.			"

								This is a good game. As you've likely read it has some bugs, but at 12 hours of gameplay no deal breakers. I have a short attention span so it's already got a little boring in single player. I wish the NPC's were a litlle more lifelike to keep me interested. I can't comment on the online portion & servers due my awesome (really bad) internet preventing me from this. Crafting vehicles & weapons is great though!!! If you can imagine then you can build it. Only lacks a cut & paste feature to move sections of your creation, instead of delete & rebuild in another area.I will update later with more info.			"

								I have been playing this game since version 0.53 a year before the release on Steam. This is a beautiful and fantastic game so far and it's not even done yet! Though some of the character animations are not the best, controls are a little weird, and the game can be buggy at times. It can still use some work, after all it is an alpha, that's expected. The problems still does little to dilute the width and breadth of this game. Not only do you get to experience the creativity of the world the developers give you, but they also give you the means to create anything you want and share it. You can literally create your own sword, gun, vehicle, buildings, and even your own community! This open sandbox gives me that sense of freedom that Minecraft gave and more. I'm more excited to see what others will do with this game rather than myself. Either way, I will enjoy it fully. Thank you Pathea Games!			"

Simply does not work on Mac. Launches a black screen and crashes. I could play it through bootcamp, but if you're going to advertise it as Mac compatible, it should at least launch. From the developer: ""The 600M and 700M series have a crash bug right now that we're looking at"".... That was in March of 2014.  So not only did they know that there's an issue, but they've continued to advertise it as being mac compatible for YEARS now, and it still doesn't work. ""But Steve, it's still in Early Access!""... Plague on society. If you're going to charge money to have people ""involved"" in your game, it has to launch. If it can't at least run when you hit the play button, it's not even ready for EA. Period. More and more companies are using early access as an excuse to get money without being accountable, and it's a shame.			"

								I hate early access games. I think that whilst the principle is nice, it's far too tempting for devs to take the money and not deliver on their promises. But this game has interested me from the time I first saw it. I've been looking for a good survival and crafting experience that doesn't rely on multiplayer and all the griefers that come with it. This game offers that in what is already an impressive array of single player and co-op experiences. Yes it is still noticeably alpha in some areas but the important things all work well and the graphics are good for a game of this type. I'm still discovering new creatures and elements and it sounds like there will be more added by the time it's finished. Building and crafting is very simple and intuitive. I was impressed that the story mode had at least some voice acting, hopefully they finish it off for all the quests and maybe add more than just the 2 or 3 soundtracks they've got.But yes looking at the other games offering similar experiences I am satisfied that at the moment this one offers the best experience for those who want an exploration game without forced multiplayer. The direction it's heading at the moment it seems it will end up as a combination of Elder Scrolls, DayZ and Minecraft, blending them all together for something unique.Obligatory throw away line: ""It's like skyrim with aliens - 10/10""			"

												I don't usually review games good or bad, but I had to make an exception  in  this case. First off, I have always been an adventure game lover and especially sandbox games, but in recent years I have started to enjoy exploring and survival games. After many so so games I finally ran across this one. I couldn't be more excited. I have been playing story mode for 5 days...wasting the entire 5 days off work with this game. The graphics are beautiful and unique, the story flows well and I never seem to get tired of mining and crafting. There is always something better right around the corner or from the next quest.  The battling is great too. Some animals will kill you in one or two hits and you can never carry enough ammo to kill some of them...takes turrets (of which there are plenty). The instructions aren't the best, but that is what keeps it interesting. Trying to figure things out rather than just having them outlined for you. Then there's the crafting. This is absolutely the best crafting system I have ever used. Once you find/buy/are awarded the scripts, just click it and it cascades into everything you need, and if you don't have an item, just click it and it again tells you what you need to make that. It is totally awesome. Now, flying machined, jeeps, boats, subs...you name it and you can create it, or just use a premade template in game. The creation system leaves a bit to be desired and has a steep learning curve, but seems rather simple once you get the hang of it. The building system on the other hand is a virtually useless. If nothing else, it makes it easy to make a wall or a floor etc, but the shapes don't seem to have much use, or at least not with any sort of effective tutorial, and that is another weak point...the tutorials. Pro's: Great graphics. Awesome creation system. Great story line that keeps you engrossed and adds some mystery. Gathering is great. Nice mix of primitive to modern/space age tools and systems. Great upgrades for everything. Critters for days. Can't really say enough good things about it. Con's:  Building system. Tutorials. Locked keys, can't bind tab and q for movement which SUX for me. Over all I am 100% satisfied for the first time in a very long time.			"

								Planet Explorers is the makings of a great game.In its current state, it is clear that it is an alpha. This isn't to say it is intolerable. As a matter of fact, it is remarkbly put together for an alpha. As advertised, there is a campaign mode. It is a surprisingly interesting story about tensions between Martians and Earthlings (both human), as well as a believeable ""first contact"" scenario. The writing isn't ground-breaking, but it is definitely better than many cookie-cutter stories released nowadays. Regretably with much of the important dialog missing voice overs, it can be difficult to follow. Granted, some people adore Morrowind style dialog, but much of the important voice overs are missing throughout the game. For example, it is very common to be ambushed in the story and forced to run. The problem is that there is no audio that plays signifying a retreat. This can be mildly frustrating, especially when you are killed thinking your teammates are backing you up.Many of the games descriptions can leave you lost or downright confused. Two examples: when you are picking something up, the button you click is ""Get"". Not ""Take"" or ""Pickup"", but the awkward verb ""Get"". In addition, quest descriptions can confuse you. Such as receiving a quest with in the first hour to start a colony, only to find out that you need to complete a quest 5 hours in to fulfil that quest. But I digress...The art direction is rather impressive. Jungles feel thick and plains are reminiscent of rolling wheat farms while still having still having an alient quality to them. It is clear that some of the creatures that inhabit Maria are inspired by apes, cats, and dogs, but the artists did a wonderful job distancing from many obvious qualities. Be it multiple armed, hairless, ape-like creatures, or pseudo-tiki faced giraffe creatures, the game will always take what you expect and tweak it so that only base features are recongizable. It is a shame that the game doesn't have a strong backing, because it is clear that the artists are talented in making the familiar seem alien.Graphically, it is passable. It has its moments of beauty, such as watching the sunrise shine through a mass of tree branches. The biggest gripe I have is the combat in the game. Melee is a wonderful way to ensure you die repeatedly, which is fair when you're fighting creatures that are usually 2x larger than you. The main problem is the lack of a basic notification for when you deal/take damage to/from a creature. It leaves most of the combat to be spamming attack, holding shield, then spamming, all while staring at your health bar. With the vehicles, I can see damage notifiers in the form of numbers, which almost feels taunting. Another problem with the combat is the random difficulty spikes. For instance, while in the mountain/desert regions, I moved from quest point to quest point willy-nilly, but once I reached a random point, I got killed in one laser blow. Repeatadly. The only warning was ""Take these turrets! It is our only hope!"" And before you ask, the turrets didn't seem to help me. This is forgiveable however. As it is an alpha, the primary focus isn't on balance but in addition of promised features. And thankfully, there is plenty to do as you gain stronger resources.Finally, the most important component: the weapon/vehicle editor. It is clear that it is a robust system, if a little difficult to learn. I am not the most creative person, so I have difficulty putting my plans to editor. Thankfully, it is simple to download ISO files (the files that are used as ""saves"" for the different created objects) and install. While you are forced to download from the game's forums, this game has a pretty strong case for Steam Workshop integration. All things together, the game is currently in a very accessable alpha. A creativity akin to Spore & Minecraft's community filters through every facet in gameplay, be it through developer or player. If you are a fan of exploration games and creative building, you won't be disappointed by this game. Even if you don't buy today, I really recommend keeping an eye on this game cause I only see it getting better and better.			"

I would recommend this game to anyone who has enjoyed playing ARK Survival Evolved, Space Engineers, Minecraft  or similar.. it has a lot of the same functionality but lets you take it to the next level in terms of customisation, invention, exploration and building.There are plenty of hostile enemies out there in the wilderness and you really do have to survive, you can grow crops.. start up a settlement... get into trades with NPC's or other players if that's your thing.The only thing I would say is a potential issue currently : The game needs some Officially Hosted Dedicated Servers..

												I've had this game since it's first public release and one thing I can tell you is, not much has changed. I've logged more hours than what's listed here on steam since the early plays I didn't do through steam.Like everyone else said, this game could have been great, but the devs have abandoned the game. I believe devs that do this, push a game onto us as an Early Access and then just up and quit should be punished by Steam. No more future games to be released as EA on steam, no greenlight, no support. I really wanted this game to be great, but as it stands now I only wish I'd never spent the money on it. If you can get the game for 5$ then sure it's worth buying to play through real fast. Otherwise steer clear. I'll likely never buy another title from this company. When the game was first released they promised way more content for the release and yet settled for less, screwed the fanbase, and pocketed the cash. Early Access titles like this make me sick and never wanting to support EA ever again.			"

								Not really pleased with my experience whatsoever, for a number of reasons:-There is no feature in the game that currently feels polished, the voxel terrain, the character/creature models, items, at best the animations are mediocre and everything feels placeholder-The only selling point is the ISO designer, of which you'll soon realise that there's nothing else much that makes the game worth playing-The campaign is unengaging and repetitive-The game hasn't been updated in too long a time for my liking, there is no sense of progress and to be honest I can see the developers abandoning this-Overpriced for such limited content, however it is going on sale more often nowadays (which is an indication of a number of things i.e. it's not selling very well)It's like the game has been built around one functionality and that is the designer, without it, then you literally are playing the most generic open-world/sandbox/RPG out there.This is just my personal opinion, I had expected more development by now considering I bought this around 1 and a half years ago, and it's still the same game pretty much.

								It's definitely better than I was expecting. The story mode feels like an MMORPG without the MMO part. Because it's a voxel sanbox game at heart, you can tear the land up basically everywhere from the start of the game. And the ability to port forward to set up a private server for friends is also pretty good, due to the creative aspect of the game. It's PvE or PvP if you so desire. There's things like turrets, jetpacks, and vehicles. As well as a way to create the look of your own swords and stuff. Definitely has potential. The price is a little steep, sure. But you can get your moneys woirth if you allow yourself to.Only downside I've found so far, is a LOT of things larger than you want to kill you, and early on you can't kill them. And the game is kinda slow paced as you bbuild up. But since you're building up from nothing, I feel thats understandable.It''s definitely worth a go if you have the money! I have to recommend this one from the bottom of my heart! It has a bit of charm to it. I hope they go heavy on the character customization later in development. The ability to create your own backstory and lore with a unique character each time would help the creative aspect of game I feel, once you're done with story mode.			"

												I'm really liking this game. I just keep finding myself losing track of time. I've played both Story and Adventure mode. I Liked the Story mode a lot so i had to try the Adventure mode and i like that mode even more. This is the game I've been searching for for a long time.			"

								To start off with, this game is not worth buying. Several updates ago it was almost playable without being too glitchy or crashing, now all of the landscape z-fights around you, you constnatly lag and have fps drops, and it overall looks shitier. This games idea isn't that bad, and the overall concept and creating vehicles/weapons I like, but currently it's annoying to look at.			"

								I really would like to try this game again in the future but for now I cannot recommend it. In my opinion it still requires more bug fixes.I've been waiting on this game for about 18 months to move forward in progress, but it still appears to be aggravating and clunky. I play the game in 4k and even though it allows for the resolution it is certainly not set up for it. I cannot fast travel to most eastern travel points as the fast travel confirmation doesn't appear in 4k, but they do appear in 1080P. My firearms shoot about 3 inches lower than the reticle and monsters still attack through structures and the ground while I am mining and crafting. The game has been out for some time now and I figured coming back to it that a lot of these issues would be dealt with. I guess not..Pros:Graphics are pretty good @ 4kMusic is pretty good as wellVoxel creative tool is still awesome(I could spend hours in it)Interface is intuitiveCons:Gameplay is clunkyBugs remain that were present in the game 18 months ago.4k Resolution problems(Read above)I guess I will check back in another 18 months.

I like the story but the combat is lackluster with melee attacks, however the gunplay feels cool not amazing animation kinda sucks but it's cool since I can put 4 barrels onto a block and that's basically my gun. lol			"

								This is one of the rare gems that I have seen in the latest trend of Voxel game engines.  If it continues in it's current direction, it will be one of the best games that I have played in the last 20 years. Machine Specs:    i5 OC @ 4.4 Ghz - Nvidia 660 - 16gb 2400 MhzFPS (High Settings): 60+ Summary The game is in an alpha - so the story line is not complete.  There is about 20 hours of playable story content, and what I have seen is extremely interesting. They have the potential to weave a great story out of this game and are headed in the right direction.It is a hybrid of a FPS/BF1942 (Yes, the old one) land, sea, air combat - mixed into the crafty style of minecraft, splashed with colony/base management & building. The game uses a Voxel engine, written in Unity, and while I am not always a fan of Unity 3D based engines (Mainly due to it having such a low barrier to entry - so you get alot of shotty development teams using it), but this game is written so that you would think it's using CryEngine or some custom engine. It has no signs of Unity slowness. There is a huge technology / crafting tree..  Its not perfectly balanced, but it is so engrossing, that I think they will have no trouble balancing it. The crafting works well.. the UI is intuitive and makes it a good experience.They have a unique system for 'scanning' for minerals - which makes finding materials much easier and helps with base/colony planning. A great idea.. and it also looks amazing. There is a great system for crafting your own items/weapons/aircraft/boats/cars - the system is easy to use, reminds me a bit of Google Sketchup, except with voxels - and is fairly realistic in material usage, weight, and physics (IE.. heavy planes don't fly)They allow you to import models from other users in ISO format - which is a great feature if you are lazy like me and really don't wan to spend hours painting and building a really cool ship. All of the importing is integrated using Steam Workshop - so its' very seamless.. It reminds me of the model importing from Spore.The multiplayer is still immature - most servers are lowly populated - but it is an Alpha game, so I suspect that will change in the future.  It has a bit of the DayZ appeal in multiplayer, so I think this part will come around as game development progresses.  It offers Adventure, Surival, and Coop modes - but there  is no Coop for Story mode.  Game Development The game does not feel like an Alpha at all..  The game is fairly stable. I have seen a few crashes due to array indexing issues, but for the most part, its not bad. The developers have pushed content on a regular basis and seem to be a very worthy team capable of completing this project. I have no fears that my cash used on this project will yield a solid product. This is one of the few Early Access projects that I have jumped on where I feel like I immediately got a return on my investment. There is a playable demo available at their main site too..  It would be nice if they would add it to steam and maintain it, but that may not be easily done. Graphics EngineThe game uses Unity - but the graphics are quite nice.  I've done a bit of indie work with Unity 3D and until I read about it on the forums, I couldn't tell it was a Unity based game. The only real visual hint is that the frill is batched, which shows up in open plains areas.The terrain blending is done to perfection.. mineral types make sense, the textures look realistic to the terrain (IE.. no gold rock sticking up in the middle of the terrain).  The forests are lush and all of the models are well done. The animations are 'ok' - though they could use a bit of work, but it is an Alpha, so no worries on that getting cleaned up. On my system, it runs very smoothly - renders distant terrain without issue and feels very well optomized. It is processor intensive and uses a large amount of RAM (4gb after playing a while) - so if you have a system with less than 8gb - you will likely see some slowness loading the areas (They make heavy use of caching..)The minimum system specs are really low.. I don't see how you could have a fun play experience with just those specs. Game PlayThe gameplay is fun..  even the crafting isn't bad (I'm not a fan of minecraft/free form building). It has several game modes, Adventure, Story, and Free Build (unlimited resources) -  so it caters to a variety of play styles. I see alot of potential in the story - if they can pull it off..   Multi-content base battles.. large battleships (all destructible), very similar to the combat of BF 1942 or PlanetFall.  The best part is that it is voxel base, so the entire world is destructible/buildable. The story starts off very slow.. I had this game in my library a few times.. thought it was just another voxel garbage game - so I didn't give it much of a chance.  If you play the story, give it atleast two hours as it can be very overwhelming at first and will easily turn you away. However, consider the story to be more of a tutorial on the interface.  It gets better after you get into the vehicle/guns part and actually turns into an intrigueing story of alien races/who did it/why are we here.. This game is lightyears ahead of Landmark - the only other engine I've seen come close to doing what it does. Overall.. this is one of the best games I've seen in 2014 and has so much potential and seems to be backed by the developers who can pull it off. If you understand that the game is an alpha and that your story will most likely be spoiled by playing early (before it is complete) then this a definate buy for your library.  However, I would recommend waiting on the story to be complete as my only disappointment in this game was reaching the point in the story where it was incomplete (I really wanted to play on.. it was addicting, fun and a great experience)			"

												I waited over two years to write this review. I wanted to write a good review back when this was early access. It was really good back then, for a time being. At some point one of the updates made the optimization terrible. I'm able to run the newest games coming out and wasn't able to play this game above 15 FPS. I remembered how fun it was though, and waited. Hoping they would eventually fix the issues. I kind of forgot about it for a while, till just this last week. I saw it had been released and thought I'd give it another shot.I'm pleased to say it's better than it was, I mean it's finished so that's to be expected and all. I'd recommend this game to anyone really. There is enough here for people to play the way they want. It does the whole voxel thing, which some people don't like. It does it better than most games do however. If you were snake bitten by no man's sky or those ""spaceraria"" type games. This one will scratch the itch. You're on only one planet, but you can tell from the screenshots alone that there is a lot to experience. Almost everything is customizable, which a lot of people are going to like. I just want to give one warning about that. Play and beat the main story line first, then go crazy with the custom weapons and such. The reason I say this is because pretty early on you can make custom weapons and basically overpower yourself right from the get go. If you don't have a problem with that, and that's what you're looking for then... well that's now an option you know. There is too much for me to point out, just know that this is an amazing game. I'm glad the developers kept working on it and didn't abandon it. It shows and more people should play this game.			"

								Wow, an Early Access game that's actually more complete and more fun than many ""release"" games. This is what StarForge should have been: consider it a Sci-Fi Minecraft with better graphics and all the cool gun/flight/ship/monster mods already installed. Unlike many prereleases, everything you see in the videos above is totally possible with the current build... and then some. Planet Explorers is fast becomming a dream come true. If your computer can handle it, BUY IT NOW, you will not be disappointed.Pros: Realistic terrain, an RPG storyline, followers (2!), hunting, mining, farming... excellent crafting... did I  mention crafting? Axes, guns, lasers... use prefab ones, or even design your own using a built-in 3D editor. Build motorcycles... tanks... jets... a helicopter... totally customized... you can even paint them and add decals, then share them with friends and other players. Just... wow.Cons: UI is still a little clunky, especially in the 3D designer, the ""follower"" AI is far from perfect, especially if leading NPCs underground or between trees, and there are a few quest annoyances, none of which are game breaking. The good news is the developers push out regular updates and are VERY responsive to customer input.Even in alpha, this one is a must-have.			"

								A lot of potential here. Though it's not quite yet to all be realized.Monster Hunter is one of my favorite franchises.I also love Dark Souls.I also love Terraria, Dwarf Fortress, Minecraft, etc.I love jRPGs, open world games, survival, exploration, etc.I also love MMOs.At a glance, this game seems to be all of those things (minus the massively multiplayer part).Execution-wise, it still has a bit to go.I'm aware it's early access, so I'm just hoping all these things get addressed soon.Large monsters walking about, and you have the ability to craft weapons and fight them which looks like a typicalMonster Hunter battle or a Dark Souls boss -- only mechanics have yet to catch up.It feels clunky at best. The hit boxes are unclear, and the enemies don't seem to follow a set logic.Also the lack of real movement options for the player -- rolling being the key one, and the lack of attack animationsthat are conducive to this kind of gameplay really pulls the experience down.I found myself avoiding these fights more than not.It's not a skill issue, either. I would classify myself as ""good"" to ""Very good"" at monster hunter, and ""well-versed"" in Dark Souls.I appreciate a challenging game and a challenging control interface. I like to take difficult encounters and learn themuntil I can beat them untouched and unharmed.That being said, I found that next to impossible to do even on the easiest of enemies.The method of combat thus far does not seem to be to outskill your prey, but rather to out-tech it with armor and weaponsuntil its damage and defense becomes negligible to your own.Exploration is fun, but could be streamlined a bit and sped up.Being that it is not massivelty multiplayer, making mining and chopping wood take arbirtarily long amounts of time don't haveany meaningful reason. It's a single player game that focuses on mining and exploration, so let the exploration feel fun.Tune the amount you dig, the way you dig, and how fast you dig to better reflect this.Though that sounds like a lot of criticsm, I do in fact enjoy this game. I played it a lot before picking it up on Steam. I still continue to jump in and play every now and then.I am looking forward greatly to upcoming patches.This has potential to be one of my favorite games.I'm hoping the developers pull through.			"

								Think Minecraft but with all the stuff you wished minecraft had...Its a great game, combat is nicly done but wish there was a dangerous night setting or other such so more enemies spawn / attack the player forcing them to actually have a base...Some quests in the story mode need work on clarifing objectives (escort said person... doesnt have a to where).The ability to make your own items (especially weapons) is epic, it takes awhile to do but that just adds to the fun when you're finally using a sword that looks how you want it to look.Love how you can place many blocks at once, oddly if the cell count exceeds the block count (even if it wont exceed block usage) it sometimes prevents placment.. odvious work-around is if you want to place a 8x8x1 patch then have more than 16 blocks.^Also love how you can put the blocks in the shape you want, so a ramp, bumb, spike, curb, ect... and place that all the same as normal blocks so if you want a spiked wall you can do it in a matter of seconds.Its a great game and I highly recommend it to minecraft players, and people who love open world sandbox games.

								For a game which currently at the time im writeing this is in Alpha im very impressed. The voice acting, character modles and animation, storyline and multiplayer leave a little to be desired at the moment but dont really take away from the experience if you enjoy this type of game. The singleplayer story mode gameplay is where this games strong point currently is, offering plenty of main and side quests, and actualy giveing you good reason to build up ""villages"" and trying to defend them. The hexagon voxel's are also a refreshing sight, as it makes the game look much more fluid and natural rather than blocky and awkward. If you're looking for a new sandbox voxel game this definitly one to pick up.			"

I have not played them but Adventure and Story mode also seem to have much to offer if that is what you are looking for.The game does have some issues with lag and charactar control but the dev team seems to be working on the game and are good about keeping players informed about what they are doing and where they are going.

Early Access Review
								This game has the potential to be a big deal, but like any other indev game, it needs work.First, I'll talk about the positive things the game offers at the moment. Environment- The world has such an original look to it. There's a huge variety of trees, greenery, and plants, all of which are obtainable, can be interacted with, and all have their own uses. This brings such a rich experience to adventuring, something a lot of other voxel games don't seem to understand. Variety. Wildlife - I absolutely love the critters you come in contact with in this game. They are all so unique, and so diverse. It really does feel like a world that could exist. I have to admit, this is what pulled me in to this game. Some creatures are hostile towards you, some are passive, and some are only hostile if provoked. There is also a touch of ecology with the animals. Some animals prey on others, so again, this is something that really helps make the world feel alive. You got the Hoolock Gibbon, a small goblin/monkey type creature that travels in packs and will attack with rocks if threatened, the Testudo Mariturtle that is breathtakingly massive, and much much more in between. Just watching them walk around is an experience (especially in the forest). What I hope to get out of this game in the future is more AI with creatures. I would love to see specific creatures eat and forage their own favorite vegetation, and interact with the player and other creatures in many other different ways. Interaction - Imagine playing a game like Skyrim, now imagine that you can interact with everything in the world. Chop down trees, dig a hole in the ground, carve your own cave out of the side of a mountain, whatever you wish. This is what Planet Explorers offers. You can mine loads of different materials, whether it be marble or limestone, and build with it as you please There are loads of shapes to choose from. You can make ramps, stairs...ummm...pointy thingies. Seriously, there is no limits here. This is voxel at its finest.Customization - Planet Explorers takes interaction to the next level. With the materials that you obtain in the game, you can make your own weapons (Whether it be guns or melee weapons), and vehicles (whether it be for the ground or the air). Literally create the look, the size, and the color. This is an amazing feature. Now, I have to say, it can be a bit overwhelming, and it requires a good deal of learning, but in this case, learning is rewarding. There is truly no limit to what you can make.Now, for the things that need work. Controls- This game begs, and I mean begs to have better first person controls. I find that the game is so much more immersive in first person, and it DOES have a first person perspective, but a lot of things you need to do are more convenient in the 3rd person. Doing some things in first person makes it feel as though you're taking an extra, unnecessary step. I find myself accidentally going out of first person because I forget you can't scroll through your items in your hotbar. You have to use the number keys. Also, while in first person, interacting with some things is very tedious. You can't look down as far as you need to sometimes, and this makes it difficult to mine.  I understand that being in first or third is all about preference, but first needs a lot more love. Difficulty - Now, this is a tricky one to explain. Simply put: Most enemies in this game are too damn hard to fight. Yes, with good equipment, it can get easier, but there is a very thin line between weak enemy and strong enemy right now. Some enemies take too long to put down. It's not about enemies taking time to figure out as much as its about their HP being too high. Like I said, better equipment makes battles go by quicker, but a lot of these enemies can be encountered waaay before you get the equipment suited to fight them. You can go through a whole set of arrows and still not have taken down an enemy. It's time consuming in a weird way. Item display - This isn't really a big one on my list, but it is an issue for me. It can be very hard to see what items are, and what your quantity is. I find myself squinting to see how much meat I have, and most of the time, just guess. I would like to see in the future a way to hover over items which would allow for a zoomed in display of them.  Okay, I'm done. A lot of these cons are simply things that need work, and by what I've read, it's going to get it. This isn't actually negative criticism. I'm simply reviewing the game for what it is now. As a whole, the game is well worth attention, and I have no doubt that when completed, it will be amazing. I recommend this one for sure for people who enjoy watching games grow.			"

Early Access Review
								Bought this game a few months back before it was on steam and I'm pretty pleased with its current progression. Right now the game is still in early access, so it has its share of bugs that will obviously be adjusted by the devs down the road. Despite this, the game is definitely playable and has a lot to offer even in its current premature state.  I have yet to even try out the main story mode of the game, because just tinkering around with the build features and creating custom weapons and vehicles through the creation system proved to be pretty awesome enough. If you enjoy the scifi genre and adventure games with building aspects similar to Minecraft, then you should absolutely give Planet Explorers a try.			"

												Note: This review was done at release, not before.Compared to other survival games, this one hits a solid middle of the road at best. @25 bucks, it's not worth the price. For the quality of game, it's not worth the time.Here's why:ProsTheir item/vehicle creator will let you build just about anything. Really, it's pretty good.Co-Op Story in a survival game.You can roll male or femaleIt's very pve-centric (one of the few multiplayer survival games focused on pve)You can build a colony, very cool concept.ConsSaid item creator has a bit of a learning curve (about 2-3 hours to get it down)It's survival, but not as good as 7 Days or Ark.It's got adventure, but the adventure is numb after about 5 hours.Controls feel wobbly / delayed.Character creation is stylized, but circa 2003It's got combat, but the controls make combat feel ""meh"".This is the big one: There's this haze filter over EVERYTHING used to trick you into it having good graphics.Bugs galore - I just tried to create a coop game with the wife, our first act was to start item duping out of the starter chest.

								I'm going to write a dissenting review. I do not dispute the advantages listed in the favorable reviews, but:1) The game has sluggish performance and desperately needs a tutorial or three2) As an early access game, it receives regular updates which is good except that the patches frequently require starting the story over from scratch. 3) There are still bugs and storyline gliches. To those who say ""Of course, it's early access"" I will point to Kerbal Space program, Prison Architect, and a few others. My verdict: Let this one age for a bit to see how it develops.			"

												This is a beautiful game with a great soundtrack though admittedly I turn the music off to make the game more atmospheric. If I was better at iso crafting I'd make a jurassic park styled jeep because I feel like I am in that movie while driving through the jungles. I'm not so I'll just keep my eye out for someone else to make a good iso. The creatures are amazing and story mode actually provides a good story while adventure mode generates unique maps for replayability. One downside is that even with normal mode, which is the hardest mode available at the moment, the game is not very hard to survive. It can be a little slow at the beginning when you only have wood tools but once you start finding better scripts the game gets easy. Pretty soon you get a pulse rifle and type 2+ armor and you run around in adventure mode effortlessly soloing level 9 and 10 dungeons for the custom items they randomely reward you at the end.If you enjoy the freedom to build whatever you can imagine provided you are willing to devote time and effort then this game is for you. If you enjoy casual survival games with no real penalty for death then this game is for you. If you like sight-seeing across very large randomely generated maps full of flora and fauna then this game is for you. "

								Serously keen for this game to be great, Looks really good and prehaps could be, sadly as many other people said it is still in alpha. Updates have been far fewer and less added I sadly feel the game might not survive to come out of beta, idk if its funding or lack of devalopers either way both are achiveable if the devs can put thier mind to it. e.g. cruching a few weeks into just bug fixing to move the game to beta would boost numbers and sale a bit as well as bringing some hype to the game and hiring more devs their are plenty out there that would be keen for a learning experiece even for free (cough me cough). Any way good luck looking forward to hopefully posting a postive review for this in the future.			"

http://www.cublikefoot.com/planet-explorers-first-impressions/Planet Explorers is a solid third-person exploration game with a lot of content, even in early access.There's so much to do in the game, so much I've yet to do. I spent most of my time fooling around, fighting random animals, exploring caves, and just generally doing nothing productive. Planet Explorers combines its excellent gameplay with some great ambience, an awesome soundtrack, and some pretty nice graphics. It is in early access, so the game is not without its flaws. I ran into a few bugs while playing, plenty of ""getting stuck in the map"" situations. Hopefully the game becomes more polished as it reaches a release date.Planet Explorers earns my recommendation. although I still have plenty to learn about the game. Can't wait for an actual release!			"

												Played this one a lot mainly due to restarting during beta testing. It's still got a few bugs here and there though, they've taken care of the vast majority of them. My favorite part of this game is the ability to create custom EVERYTHING! Takes a bit of work to get used to the item creation tools but, once you do you may find yourself spending more time creating and tweaking your items then you do actually playing the game. Only drawback to me is that I would like the voxels to be finer as well as having the ability to change rotation and direction of shapes. You really notice this when you're trying to make custom armor. Voxels are vehicle sized when they should be scaled down to human size.			"

								Well, lets sum it up:Good graphics : only the animations do not have much variety, but they said it will be fixed in the future updates, and they are really doing it so a 10/10, even if it is not from some big money seeking coorporation like ubisoft or EA GAMES (no offense to them of course).The music : Good, i hope they add more tracks to the game, but the main menu song reminds me of Two Steps From Hell, Audiomachine, Adrian Von Ziegler, Thomas bergerson or Jo Blankenburg.It sounds just soo good to me! 8/10 for variety, if more music and war songs like to glory or fallen army from GRV music, then it would be a 9/10 or even 10/10campaign : IT IS BIG, i mean not big but BIG BIG, i mean, you get like 20 square kilometers to do whatever you want. build a bunker, a big freaking colony, it all depends on your imagination and possibilities. also of recources and enemies and surroundings of course! a 10/10 for that one! (in my opinion)Possibilities : ENORMOUS! design your own chair, weapon, vehicle, dreadnought, spaceship, whetever the heck you want, AND USE IT IN SINGLEPLAYER AND MULTIPLAYER! (campaign works too!) so a 10/10 for that one!Multiplayer :Good, 3 gamemodes : adventure, cooperation and VS mode. then we have more generation options for the map like river width and depth, map size to limitless from 4x4 km. so it is big, we have a infinite recource mode to suit your testing(-grounds ;D )you even have a leveling in multiplayer and a role info, that shows what kind of roles you do and if your good at that. they will expand it with the updates.a 8/10Character creation : YES YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN CHARACTER!not like in skyrim of course, but it gets the immersion a bit better done!hair, skin color , body parts, all you need. not much hair types but a 9/10 for the possibility to even create your own character!Politics :That will be implanted soon. no score for that yet.Colony:You can have your own colony in campaign and adventure mode!pretty sweet, because you can build your own buildings and make the interiors to your taste!~make a frigging castle, i don't care, but it has to keep your citizens safe from aliens of all kinds, from small little irritating bugs to titan walking exterminators that destroy everything with they're full armanents.you can build turrets, upgrade the buildings and make your own custom buildings, that the game will script and use like a base or something else.A 8/10, if more upgrades would be implanted to the core building and secondary buildings, that would be good, and worth a higher number!NPC'S :Well you have citizens in your colony and you can appoint them to do various jobs, from farming to fighting and mining or fishing and cutting trees. some can't fight but they can mine, because they have no strength to do the fighting part. sometimes tough some npc's can't do sh*t and they just eat all your food, soo, have some good NPC'S in your colony! a reminder : you get your first colony later in the campaign mode, and faster in adventure mode.try to understand the factors that play when you are leading a colony. like happiness or food and fuel to fuel the buildings.A 9/10 for this one!The first person mode will be back in alpha 0.90A .the developers of the game say they will also do more impact improvements and animation fixing, so it will be a big update. and i also understand it can come out later than the 0.90A version. so don't get mad if it is the 0.90A version and you still can't get to 1-st person mode!And at last a 10/10 for the hardworking people that are making this game for us!~a good game where you don't need to pay 50 bucks for and get only 30 hour's main campaign and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ multiplayer!KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK DEVELOPERS OF PLANET EXPLORERS!and I hope I helped you with the preview of this good game!Have a nice day everyone,greetings, Daniel.

Early Access Review
								I won't go into a lot of details of the gameplay. If you want a review on that look further in the other reviews. My review is based on two things: my experiance playing the game as of nearly 2 years ago and the current build of this game as of July 12, 2016.I remember a time when Alpha builds were considered proof of concept builds that were for in-company testing only. The product at that point had enough in it that the vision and basis to continue developement was clear and sound but would lack enough content to release publically for beta testing. Beta builds of a product meant that they has passed the preliminary in-house testing and featured enough development and content that it was suitable to release for public beta testing. This game... this game came out on steam early 2014 and now, 2 years later, it hasn't even entered Beta stage testing. What does this translate to? Well it doesn't mean it is a bad game. It doesn't mean that this game won't ever be completed. It isn't a prediction on the quality of the game when it is finally completed. What it DOES mean is that if you are thinking of getting this game... DON'T. Seriously, just don't. At least not yet. Come back in 5 years when this game MAY have finally exited beta stage and moved on to full release. Until then you are going to just end up paying $25 for a glorified psuedo demo with less content and more bugs than a real demo.			"

								Note: I originally had this as a thumbs down, but the creation kit has changed my mind.  This game has great potential, but has a number of issues associated with its alpha state.  The game basically has four play modes: -- Story; which does exactly what it says on the tin.  - Adventure; in which you jump into the world with some friendly NPC's and the foundations of a settlement to build upon once you have collected the prerequisite materials. - Build; in which you are given free reign and unlimited materials to build whatever you want.  - Multi-player; in which you can set up a server with friends/ family.  The Bad: -The combat is sluggish, locks you into animations and largely involves swinging a stick in the general vicinity of monsters.  The controls for vehicles (especially helicopters) need a rework (they are simply poorly realised currently). The build and multi-player modes barely work, the map in build mode has such short draw distances that the use of any vehicle results in you driving off the edge of the map and dieing.  The story mode is the most complete, but it does involve some needless time sinks, and needs a lot more polish.  It also stops part way through while the remainder is in development- but provides circa 20 hours of gameplay currently.    The Good: -The story mode is fun (but is orientated towards gathering and crafting). The creation system, in which you can design weapons and vehicles (wheel based or rotor based), is the high point of the game.  Certain pre-made items are required such as a cockpit or energy cells, but beyond this you can create almost anything you set your mind upon.  Of course to use these items in game (other than in the buggy build mode) you will need to collect the materials first.  There are limitations to the system, for example, building a vast rectangle with rotors all over it will give you better overall stats than taking the time to build a realistic, aerodynamic chopper.  Look at the time I have spent in game, most of them have been spent in the creation system.  If this appeals to you, this game is worth buying.  In conclusion; this is clearly an alpha game, and as such it lacks a lot of polish and features, and is fairly buggy.  Once the development has progressed it should be great fun.			"

								I backed this game on Kickstarter so I've been playing it for a while. It's a lot of fun. I did the storyline a little bit, but stopped because I wanted to do it when the game was finished and free of bugs. But I have plenty of fun just running around digging, building, crafting, hunting, and just exploring. They even showed a Han-Solo-in-carbonite shield that was made in the editor, so your imagination is the limit. It's Early Access ALPHA and it shows, but it has come a long way in the last year. It's one of the best campaigns I've backed on Kickstarter in regards to getting updates and making progress. They are hard working devs and very open about the development, good or bad. Very good at keeping you in the loop. About once a month they release a new update with a big list of changes each time. I suggest you go look at the updates on their Kickstarter page and view the Changelist in prior releases to see what I mean.I haven't tried multiplayer yet, but think I will give it a go sometime soon.I have no doubt this game is bound for(What I would consider) greatness.

								I have such mixed feelings about this game. Out of positivity I have giving it thumbs up. It is in top 3 of my most hopeful games to watch. My concerns are that the game might be trying to accomplish too much. controls in terms of building and designing things are not intuitive and it just doesnt feel like things click at times. If you want a limitless architecural tool I think this might be pretty good. Make your own vehicles, guns and settlement.I started a world and spent a few hours in it. A couple of days later they patch the game and now parts of my village are a few hundred meters in the sky. Buggalicious! No way of getting home on this planet.I will still continue to revisit each time after a patch and see but for now dont make your own world and dont get too attached to things because you may never see it again... for now.I really hope the devs keep up the awesome feedback as well as the pace at which they are making improvements. This could really be something special. To the devs get the basics right and the rest falls into place.			"

								     I've been burned so many times on early access games showing me a demo video, then me buying it, and half the functionality is there.  Well I'm happy to say, this is not the case.  It's everything its advertised to be and more.    If you're a gamer, you'll understand the following: ""Its like Minecraft had sex with Starforge, then WoW was genetically infused with its off-spring.""  I know there are many more games you can swap out for that analogy, but bar none this has been the early release game of its type.  Good job and high-fives to the devs.     P.S.  A little about the game-  There is a whole lot to do.  I'd suggest new players start out with story mode so you can understand the crafting aspect of the game.  Then, if your so inclined, go over to adventure more (survival mode) and get to building that awesome base with a helicopter pad and garage so you can really dominate this planet. "

								I have been playing this game from back in version 0.4 and was very impressed with it back then and still am today. I am a very big fan of voxel games and sandbox building games and when you add in the 'distant planet in the future' factor, that was a huge hook for me. Gathering and creating is very well implemented and feels nice. The ability to custom build your weapons and vehicles is so well done that it can take hours (If you want to spend that log that is) to make something. This game still is in early access so the only complaints I have are moot because they will be addressed. First, the control of your character is blocking and weird at time, not smooth at all. Secondly, the difficulty is too high when you first start out and then you turn into god as soon as you get any decent weapon. And lastly, and I know I am being nit picky, when it rains it will show up inside your home even if it is closed up. All things said, if you are a fan of sandbox games or voxel games, get this game!

								I enjoy exploration in games. I usually put on my own music via Google music and enjoy wandering around, getting lost and stopping to look at the world around me. This game is one of the best Ive come across for this type of gameplay.  You're thrown on to an alien world and you have to survive but things are not so dire that you have to constantly fight the entire time. It's paced wonderfully. The alien life is great to discover, plant and animals. Not every mob is out to attack on site. you can walk right up to all kinds of friendly animals, big and small, and get a closer look at them. I really like that. There is digging, mining, crafting and all the things most everyone is familiar with by now. However, the graphics are excellent and the landscape is a smooth, sloped surface. Nothing like the blocky voxels that most games produce. I have only been playing this game for a few weeks. Got it about 3 weeks before it hit Steam so I haven't even gotten into the heart of the game by base building, multiplayer, farming and vehicle creation. But going by the first 6 hours i've played it is amazing. A game I can get completely immersed in. With the updates the devs have planned this could be one of my all-time favorites. I searched many months for a particular game to scratch a beautiful exploration itch and I found it in Planet Exploreres. Buy this game.The video I am sharing is from the 0.72 alpha version. Before the 0.75 that was the initial Steam version. and the music playing is not in game music.

There are more playable early access games out there that you can spend your money on and feel satisfied, rather than buying this one and still having to wait.Sure, the devs could use the money, but I'm not your father or your banker so I can't know to what capacity you're willing to spend for a product that's incomplete.In any case this is an early access review for an early access game, you know what you're signing up for and I can assure you that once it's complete, it's going to be amazing!

Early Access Review
								2 years passed, didn't play since v0.7 and now 0.921, constant mini freezes/lags (i7/24gb ram/gtx970), fonts are readable only with some screen resolutions  (on 1920*1200 i can't read anything in dialogs). Controls became worse, try open map when you play in mode without mouse cursor - it doesn't appear. You see ""harvesting"" icon on the tree, but character doing nothing, you ready up/holster  weapon multiple times and it finally can harvest.I have no idea what developers do, super slow progress - no problems , but i don't see any improvements or i will not see because i can't move forward, just don't want to play a game where basic controls are crappy after 3 years of development. Last time(v0.7) i had some fun and now not going to recommend it at all. Anyway, you can always refund / buy it on big sale.			"

Posted: November 3, 2016
												I haven't play this game for over a year.Bought it just for multiplayer, which unfortunately is dead and boring. Most people I've seen are 12, 1-2 scatter on official and private servers.I played for 20 hours on an official servers.First I tried a Official story mode server (for about an hour). I found playing on this to be completely pointless. It still setup for single player. Meaning once a mission is completed, it's gone forever. Unfortunately learning new things are completely mission based. So all these type of servers are dependant on how many have come before you and how far they've gotten in the missions. Hence now no one plays anymore on these servers.Per the Dev in the forums, go play on a private server. <-- I had a colorful thought to this remake.Then I tried an official adeventure survival server (pvpve). The game still has lots of bug and glitches. You can't destroy player built structure, and there's lots of them, usually in cities where you need to go for missions in order to be able to advance. Players log on temporarly, build something stupid (grief) and log off. Imagine that, PVP with no raiding allowed. Second I was completely bored. There's nothing to really do except some missions. some are glitch and you'll never be able to complete them, some are just plain stupid, none are level biased. Example. I just created my character (that has no exps or skills), run thru the mission script (that you can't abort), it spawns some monsters that kill me instantly in one hit. You have the option to revive yourself, but there's no point since they are still standing where they killed you. You respawn and die immediately again.On the adventure server I found you get skills. To get a skill to go up, you must get experience points by mining, chopping trees, or fighting. All drops are random. I spent 20 hours to only get the knowledge to make a stone pick (after 4 hours of game play) and a copper shovel (after 17 hrs of game play). I found out I can mine ore with a shovel. A stone pick will not mine ores.If you ask the right NPC, they will give you a mission for a MK2 laser rifle, after that you don't need anything else.Shovels are obsoleted in this game. Best just use a pick, better reward and faster. Shovels only do a wider area, but less reward.Ranged combat is everything in this game, you only use melee when you first start or if you absolutely have to.They've added dungeons (adventure only). Risk vs reward just isn't there. Plus you find no scripts (to learn how to make new items) in dungeons. Just armor and weapons, mostly just junk to sell.Fighting the various monster in the game is uninspiring. They run directly at you and get stuck on whatever obsticle is in the way.  And then there's the part that hardly any spawn all. I remember a year ago, I was being chased alot. Not so anymore. Most just travel in packs. Kill half of them, the rest flee. In dungeons, the harder monsters are just too big and get stuck easily. Making it easy for you to kil lthem. To make money to buy items you have to be able to sell. Most of the time, merchants are out of money, so you can't sell anything. They've added a comfort level to characters in order to punish players that are too active. Now you must either buy a comfort shot or sit in a chair/bed and wait for your comfort level to rise. Yes, this type of innovation really make me want to play this game all the more. Watch tv while waiting for your comfort level to max out, so you can play for a while to do it all over again. And the better the armor, the less comfort maximun you have, so the more you have to eat and rest, but if you eat too much then you also get penalized. So I'm starving, b ut sincve all I had was low value food, I'm also penalized for it, makes sense. Yup, they've taken all the fun right out of game play.Was reading this game is ""supposedly"" schedule to leave EA on Nov 7 due to external pressure. Yeah, that's a very good reason to move a game out of EA, who cares if it's full of bugs, as long as we make everyone else happy, except the people who play it.On the plus side you can make your own vehicles and weapons. It seems overly complicated to me as I don't play this game much. But if you're into spending hours on something like this, then this game is for you.Got a disease, forget about getting a remedy for it, just teleport to a location to get rid of it. Kinda wondering why they even added them.It can be fun for a while, new game nostalgia, after a while you'll start to lose interest, find out it's just repetative, and finally figure out it's just boring.Disclaimer:I understand that it's still in EA, but so what, you sold it here, you get rated on what it currently is not what you think it will be.Update:Tried the Single player game.No skill advancement in Story mode.This is what this game is truely designed for.However you'll get to a point in the story where you can't proceed anymore. It's a recue mission, a ship trapped up really high between two cliffs.You have two options for the mission: Option 1: Build an aircraft (to reach the survivors), unfortunately you can't do this since you can't build a factory yet to make the neccessay parts for the aircraft. Which leaves Option 2....... Option 2: Build a ramp up to the stuck escape ship. Yeah right. I spent well over 3 hours trying to figure this out. While I'm sure the building part makes perfect sense to the devs, to the casual player it's a nighmare. Not only is building in this game difficult at best, you must build it in the right spot (where ever that is, I tried from multiple angles) and I was unable to rotate it, so you must struggle with that too. I even managed to build a ramp to the ship, however I guess it was in the wrong spot and so it didn't count.  And trying to delete what you just accidently build doesn't always work either. So you must try over and over and over. Eventually I just gave up on building the stupid ramp and on this game. Since this is a main mission, and you can't progress in the story until you complete it.Guess I'll just wait another year again.........Added note: Strange bug that clears out your tool bar randomly.

								This game is crazy fun, even in it's beta stage. The environments are gorgeous (I LOVE the bioluminescent trees and flowers), the light level at night is reasonably realistic (if you don't have light sources on you, it's really hard to see - which is as it should be imo), and the tools you use to modify the world around you work well also - shovels clear more land than picks, but yeild fewer usable resources; and unlike many fantasy games there is a good amount of medeival-style feel that for me, really accents the sci-fi nature of the game *very* well.  Swords and Guns (including Flare and Rope guns) in the same game at base? YES!It's not the kind of game that's going to give you a ton of objectives and tedious grinding to do - there is a bit of that in story mode, but it strikes me more like a long tutorial.  I haven't yet finished Story Mode, though - I spend waaay too much time just exploring the beautiful environment and running the hell away from giant flying stingrays with lazer beams on their frickin' foreheads.The best part, in my opinion, is the ability to start a colony and build it up from scratch, from the buildings to who gets to live there, and gardening/farming in addition to building your own guns and vehicles.  I'm a huge Harvest Moon, Sims and Dwarf Fortress fan, and this game seems to take the things I liked the best about each of those and rolls it into one lovely app. The monsters you fight will even destroy your constructed buildings so you have to be strategic when fighting on your home turf!I like how there isn't any money/gold in the game, either.  The closest thing that passes for currency is the Meat (the same kind you find on animals), and credits you get once you start a colony.The only real gripes I have about this game is the lack of detail on the overworld map (Not so bad in Story Mode, but Adventure and Build modes appear to not have any automated mapping ability, it's just a solid blue background with icons on it.  Though you *can* automatically fast travel to your colony and other landmarks the game creates, but at this time you can't fast travel to map markers you place yourself. The other thing I get a little annoyed by is that the buildings in pre-established villages in Adventure mode can't have objects placed on them unless you've built overtop of a space with the Build tools - for example, if you want to decorate a room on the second floor of the default Hotel building, you have to use the Build tools to overlap the flooring and walls, otherwise your lamps and chairs and stuff will go straight through it.I wish it wasn't such a RAM hog, but it does perform very well aside from that, and the graphics settings actually seem to make a difference.  Very very few crashes.  Overall it's one of my favorites - been following it almost since the beginning, v 0.3x.  It's come a LONG way since then, and the devs are super dedicated.  You can tell this game is a labor of love - it shows!			"

I am greatly looking forward to the finished product, but I can tell you it is worth every penny even in the current state for the addictive gameplay with intuitive controls.Edit:Here I am many updates tater and this game is a gem.

								This is one of a number of surivival games I have in my library, and like most the game is in early access so I find it hard to review it as I know the game is in constant flux.  That being said after a few hours of playing I have to say that Planet Explorers is one of those games that I feel let down with.   I followed from Kickstarter forward and had high hopes for this sandbox.  This has a lot of promiss and isn't a bad game per say.  This is one of those games that I really wish that there were a sliding scale instead of just a yes/no for recommending because I hate saying I don't recommend because unlike TUG I think the game really tries, but the problem is that I think it tries to do too much in some ways.   I think that while it has potential to be a better game in the end than GRAV right now GRAV beats it out.   I have to compare it to GRAV as to me that is the closest match as far as feel.   I will come back in a few months and review however I feel that I have enough time in the game to review and wanted to do so.   So while I am at this time not recommending I am doing so saying that while I am marking as No that I am rating as a 6/10 which is to say that the game is better than it is bad, however if your money is tight you might want to hold off.  However if you are a game collector like me and don't mind picking up EA games and being patient and willing to take a gamble I think maybe in a year or 18 months the game may change my mind.			"

												Planet Explorers is a game full of adventure. The game has your basic 3 playable modes: single player, multiplayer and design modes. I been playing the game for several months and followed the updates.  The main story line is a exploration spaceship crash landing on a ""unknown"" planet. Your quest is to create your own colony while trying to figure out the reason behind the crash. The story line has several hours of different types of quests. Like other games of the genre, the story line will have quests such as protection, escort, and gathering. What really sets a side planet explorers story mode, is the design of the building system in the sense that you as a member of the crew, that is now scattered through out the continent, are in charge of creating you very own colony. The creation of the colony is not a location specific task, meaning that you create it where you want. That freedom is one of my favorite aspects of the game. You can recruit almost all the members of your crew, even make some of them your companions. The colony system will allow you to manage your colony and colonists according to your desire. While not all the materials are produced at the colony, you are able to assign jobs to your colonists. After creating the appropriate machinery they can farm, train or work at a factory. Certain characters will have perks that will boost some of the tasks, combat and healing. The game features a nice menu with easy navigation making it very easy to manage your colony. You have access to this menu from every location but some of the tasks require you to be within the colony e.i. storing or retrieving items. You can even recruit some of the vendors to your colony giving you easy access to some of the prime materials needed to create whatever you want. The other highlight of the game is the creation system. This is a design system where you can design your very own vehicle. The game allows boats, ground and air vehicles. It also allows the creation of robots, tools and weapons. The creation system allows single or passengers vehicles that will increase in fire power, speed and durability depending on the parts added to the design. A lot of components of the game rely on electric charge and will deplete over time. Some of the more complex designs require a lot of work to create all the parts, but they are some shortcuts like purchasing from vendors. I only have played the single player in exploration and story modes. Exploration is a randomly or pre-generated map where you can play with out the basic main story line. AI still offers quests and AI colonies are generated for both friendly and unfriendly races.  I purchased Planet Explorers as a early access. The game is now in V1.0.3. I can say with confidence that Pathea followed through and I am very pleased with the purchase.  If you are unsure about the game please try the demo. It offers around 2 hours of story and it should give you a good idea if the game is for you.			"

								I have started playing this game 3 times now twice in Alpha stage and now at beta 0.60 while some things have improved other things have gone severely backwards, in my previous two attempts I was able to follow story mode up until the point I reached a city in the game - I wont say to much more than that as to not spoil it for others, now part of that story line has gone completely west stopping the player proceeding to that point, definately a huge step backwards in other respects the game has moved forward in playability but there is not much point if you can not complete more each time a version is released. In addition each time a new version is released you end up having to start from scratch which has become an utter pain in the @ss and the iso system which was initially fun has become dreadfully painfull. default iso's for players who don't want to mess with that sort of stuff but just play the game need to be added - this could be a great fun game if it ever gets finished but it's taking so long that one begins to doubt it ever will be,			"

								I have bought quite a few Early Access games and it is a lot like the stock market, some wins (Kerbal Space program) and some losses (Star Forge). This is a game I had played and enjoyed, but put away for a while to let it mature. While I havent gotten back into it as deeply as my first try, I will say, I am impressed at the changes the developers have made. The biggest thing holding my experience back for now is my system, that while not terrible, not quite good enough to get this games whole vision. Im looking forward to the final product and appreciate the work done so far. Keep it up guys. I would recommend this title to those who understand the development process and see this game as the diamond in the rough (though getting less rough with each update!) that it is.			"

I am barely into the game and I have already experience a huge variety of monsters, minerals, equipment. I have gotten to build a base with a defensive wall and torrents. The building and crafting system in this game is by far the best I have ever played with, even better then all the mincraft mods. The ability to import an export ISO's you and others have created are an amazing addition to the game as well, which is basically a custom crafted item. I got this on the summer sale but I would pay the full price, it is amazing this is even in alpha as it is so feature rich, I am looking forward to see the finished product.

								After a couple of less-than-stellar experiences with alpha/early-access/kickstarter games, I was pretty much set in the ""never again"" camp. A friend told me that I _really_ should check out Planet Explorer, given he knew how much I love sandbox games. This game - even at the alpha stage is, to put it mildly, absolutely amazing. Many, many years ago, an essay was written in the MMO community called ""Let me bake bread"" - in short, it said a _great_ video game lets the player play as _they_ want: Be that fighting, building, exploring, crafting or socializing. This game has it all (well, maybe not quite the socializing, but I haven't played multiplayer). The visuals are beautiful; The build system is limited only by your imagination and the content in the game - again, even at this early stage - reinforces both the suspension of disbelief and wonder.I could not be more pleased with this game. If you are a sandbox game lover, you will not go wrong with Planet Explorer.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is SO much fun. I've been having a blast playing it in both single player (adventure and story mode) and multiplayer with friends over the past week. REALLY glad I bought this- for an alpha version of the game it's surprisingly polished, and so far I haven't found any bugs at all which is amazing. I've beta tested a TON of games over the past 15 years and I'm always finding bugs to report, but so far, I've found nothing. The dev's are really quick to update it too when something breaks, they're really on their game which is a refreshing change from a lot of the 'early access' games on steam that don't see updates for months at a time. One evening, the animation for chopping trees broke. I went to sleep, and it was fixed the next day! I got this on sale, but I dare say, it's worth the full price for how much time and care thats being put into this. It's like Minecraft and Landmark had a baby with the space adventures of Terraria/Starbound thrown into the mix. All my friends who play Minecraft with me love this game to pieces and we've actually been playing this a lot instead! The ONLY thing I would add is that I wish there was more weapon/armor variety IN the game, BUT with the ability to create stuff out of voxels (called/saved as ISO's) you can make or download a TON of fantastic stuff that have been made by users, so it's not even a big issue really. The game doesn't have some decor you want? Build it, or find it on the workshop! Absolutly amazing. And so far, the community has been VERY friendly and helpful- I really hope it stays that way.			"

												Awesome game, I highly recommend it.  Don't bother trying to use the in-game workshop (hidden in the Multiplayer section) as it doesn't provide much detail on the ISOs.  Now that the Steam Workshop is up and running it's a much better modding experience.			"

								Really fun game. One of the best steam games I've played, even in it's Alpha state. I've become extremely addicted to this wanting to craft better vehicles and explorer more into the unknown planet. Tons of craft recipes you can purchase from NPCs using the in-game currency of meat. I have only played the story mode so far but it is pretty good. Looking forward to experiencing multiplayer when I get some friends playing this.			"

								This has to be one of the best games i've played in a while, Although the game is in Alpha stage and some patches fix things and some break things, It has alot of potential to go forward and become an outstanding game.You have a single player mode where you follow the story line and interact with NPC's to perpare yourself for whats to come.You can build weapons from scratch using the build mode, Providing you have the resources and the same for ground and air transport.The game offers,Single player story line, Mining, resource gathering, mob hunting, base building, designing anything from sword to pistols to 4 barrel guns, how ever you want to design them, the more damage the weapon the better. You can also build Cars, helicopters and so on. Disign it how you want it to look. It also has crafting of items that you will need in the game, from spades to mining tools, lights, food and much more.The game also has Multiplayer, which includes all the above with either Co-op or PvP.Work as a team to build a base and defend it from the many mobs in the game or fight your fellow players in PvP destroying there base and taking it to the wire.It has a great community who are willing to help those who need the help and the game has so much more to add.With patches and improvements adding to the game to improve it, and much more to come.I recommend anyone who understands Alpha phase games to join in and get on board to make this the best open world RPG out there, you will have alot of fun. If you like Minecraft and those types of games. There are bugs as there are with many Alpha games, but this is more polished then most i've played of late. Including some currently on steam.			"

								Okay, RELAX, and check if your chair is comfortable enough : This is Planet Explorers.This game has a slowlier gamplay than most of the games, but the music and the landscape will take you to another fantastic world!Basically in my a opinion, a BIGGER and truly evolved minecraft : one of the great features is that the game is sort of Sandbox-Based, you can bulid anything you want with many different materials, so : gather resources to bulid default items or create your own items, and that's a raelly cool thing.Day and night cycle last enough to let you explore and bulid and do quest of any kind without making you worry about WHAT TIME IS IT DAMN I NEED TO SLEEP....no, there's no such things in this game!I didn't play the game so much, i've bought few days ago, but i'm diggin it, slowly getting into the gameplay (only tried single player though), game looks really cool, hope that the developers keep doing this great work.In my opinion few things could be redefined : a key to run faster (instead of only a key to walk), a better first person camera, with the possibility to look down and see your own feet and body, this is still a great alpha though!Can't wait to see new features that will be available in this game!I super reccomend this game, it is really worth!

								Being as I'm a classic science fiction fan, this game immediately jumped out at me.  Of course, I had to get it and it was money well spent.  It has been a long time since a video game has given me such a sense of wonderment, perhaps not since The Dig, way back in the dark ages.  I found the writing to be well done, with an interesting storyline to go along with the fun of exploring an alien world and designing the vehicles in which you explore.  The designs of the various alien animals remind me of the works of sci-fi and wilderness artist Wayne Barlowe.  I would highly recommend Planet Explorers to any sci-fi gamer.			"

								One of the best Early Access games I've played to date. There is a lot of content here. Offline the single player has a storyline where you take quests and learn the ins and outs of crafting. There is also an Adventure Mode where the world is procedurally generated and you have to explore and survive with only a handful of NPC villagers.Online works as well. You can play on a server for adventure, versus or just building with unlimited resources.You can also create your own buildings in build mode as well as create custom vehicles and weaponry with their in game creation system. It's quite robust, albeit a bit clunky at first.The game still has a way to go, with some UI and camera issues to iron out as well as more character customization options. Like I said, it's one of the best Early Access games you can play now and with content and updates coming regularly it's must have for anyone who enjoys adventure with mixed with crafting.			"

								A review yes, because I want all my friends to enjoy and play this! The game has now seen many huge updates and was already a healthy playable game from day one. It has been fun seeing what they are contantly adding because they have listened to the players on this point too.I find myself longing back to this magical experience and will re-start it from the begining as so many changes have been made.You only have to check out any of the developers videos or reviews to understand. I have always wanted a huge alien world to explore with a complete survival experience and thats what you get.This is a wonderful voxel world dripping in atmousphere, were you decide what and were you build your base or camp; inside a huge rock, then digg tunnels maybe wide enough to drive that hoverbike you just designed straight in or maybe a huge base out over the sea?!Want to build a flying craft, you can, want to farm or just trade, you can!They have since added a scanning tool which enables you to see whats under ground; were a type mineral might be and also were there might be a cave.It fast become my fav game of all time last year and has only become better; were you just feels so good being in this beautifully colored world with tough creatures to hunt and riches to digg for. I could go on and on, yet would only amount to spoilers for the game.			"

Early Access Review
								Initially I was unsure about the game. You might be to. The UI is clunky, windows don't stay where you put them, fast travel breaks things, etc etc... welcome to alpha. KEEP GOING ANYWAY. They are making a tremendous effort to voice act the whole game. I found myself actually listening to the quests. I am enjoying a storyline that is becoming increasingly compelling as you not only struggle to rescue stranded colonists but unravel the secrets of this world. It is truely a gem. However in the interest of disclosure I am playing alpha 0.752. So I will list the pros and cons given this version, so that you can decide for yourself if its worth the money.Cons:- Alpha bugs (these will go away but player beware them) Fast travel breaks quests and resets window location. In fact theres a long list of bugs, many specific to a persons game. None of them were game breaking for me personally. Very polished for an alpha imho.-Mining is INCREDIBLY slow. Painfully even if you've ever played minecraft. If you think you are going to change the basic terrain in any meaningful way, you are wrong.-AI is often baffeling. They apear to be nearsighted and terrified of jumping over obsticals. Often I found them on an impossibly vertical surface stuck in place. Time to break out the pickace and carve em off, slowly though, because the pickaxe does nothing quickly. Or just standing around uselessly while I fire away at giant robots getting cut to ribbons by death lasers because they can't see far enough away to be useful. Same goes for turrets, which more often than not get blown up before even firing. Layerback quest is poorly designed as one of the npcs is not invincible and imediately dies unless you bury him in a hole and cover him over. Alpha is alpha.-VTOL (Vertical Take Off and Landing) design has basically nothing to do with reality, and a redesign of the controls for making them in general could use a looksee. You can do it, its just not easy to scale parts, and they don't go bigger than their original size... you'll see what I mean. They fly like they're on rails, and really need tuning up to 'feel' more realistic. See: Battlefield 2142 transport.- Geometry in general. There is no ryhme or reason for running through the base of trees. Accessing the meat from a carcase is an artform not a science. ETC. I'm guessing this is an alpha issue as well but if they don't go back soon and unfrak the situation its going to be a depressing amount of work later for the devs.-Grass... the amount is as staggering as it is GPU shattering. The sensativity of the levels isn't intelligent. Theres basically several options including: none, Too much, holy good god, 1fps, and the all important personal home computer melter level in case ur tired of your pc. I set it at too much. I advise you to do the same, unless you're running a quantum based supercomputer.Pros:-Amzaing story with believable motives, and real characters, which you actually care about because its...-Voice Acted. Hoorah for immersion. Keep it up. Some bits are misssing here, especially when traveling and they randomly talk. I really hope they continue with this effort because everyone who's ever played another MMO has been in a TL;DR accept, kill, turn in kinda mood. This game slows it down, and makes you care, without pulling teeth. Its glorious.-Great Characters. Had to add this on its own. Everyone is believable, at least human-side. Very important to stay away from the classically ""I'm evil, because I'm a jerk like that. No reason."" *Kicks a puppy*-Build your own: Vehicles ground and air, swords, shields, guns, and more with a voxelbased system that with a little more time and polish will have you wondering: How do I port this to my 3d printer?-Mining, hunting, farming, gathering, crafting, building, sandbox explosion of fun. Some people just wanna horde a million items. Personally I think its a bit in depth, and found myself just buying the finished products... which you can do. So play it how YOU like. Something there for everyone.-Varied quests. Nothing is a grind, everything has a point. None of the go here kill 40 of these because I want their guts for garters crap. If you are gathering, exploring, or killing its for a reason. IE: learning to craft something new, saving a colonist who will sell you some new interesting gear, so on and so forth.-Hang Glider. I know you are wondering, if I've got space copters with lazer beams, why do I need a hang glider? Trust me, once you get this baby and a jetpack, you'll be sold on this game. Soaring through the trees (Which you can't run into don't worry ^.^) you'll notice the terrain is actually quite beautiful.-Fully developed universe. It has history, conflicts, and you get to learn about it all. More than that it effects you, and I found myself going from npc to npc just to find out more about the lore. Tedious reading goodbye. 90% voice acted so the story is 'told' by the characters who its happening to. Immersion is not just important but an expectation these days, and Pathea aims to deliver.-Critters. Mobs. Animals? are varied, interesting, and best of all, capracious. Initially I started with the  run and gun, and getting myself murdered, because they designers clearly favor realism, and I have the suicidal heroistic tendancies of most gamers. Then I found myself cautiously aproaching new life forms. Everything has a power level, and some are over 9000. Descretion is important, almost as much as learning to run like hell. I apreciate this, however some of you would put this in the con group. Some of you can bugger off.Theres more to it, this is a highlights list. I'm telling you I've played enough games to wonder what I'm doing with my life... and I recommend this game, even in its alpha form. Give them your money, and say goodbye to the next week until you come up for air.This is sgmongo, signing off.			"

								amazing game!!! probably one of the best games i’ve played in a long time, there is so much you can do. its like minecraft and terraria had a baby, then that baby had a baby with pure awesome. the different game modes are great, story mode gives you a good feel for the game and is pretty fun to play through. but what makes this game amazing is the creative side, loads of items to create/ replicate, but the actual creation mode within the game OMG. pretty much think of something you want to make and bam you can do it. want a sick looking car just make it. theres a bit of a learning curve with it but it doesn’t take long to get the hang of. As for it being early access, yeah you can tell in some parts of the game. Some NPC’s will give you the same mission over and over, the game locks up now and again, using ranged weapons with a energy shield on, takes down the shield (not sure if that ones intentional or not haha). Over all for an alpha not really a whole lot wrong with it. Hell its more polished then BF4 was at release. Could not recommend the game more!! if your into adventure/exploration in open world get it, if your into creating/design get it. loads of fun THANK YOU to the devs you guys have done an insane job on the game so far!!! keep up the good work :)			"

								For an alpa level game this is pretty decent. Still needs a lot of polish but there is already a lot of work in this and it shows. The story mode is pretty nice and plays pretty decently with what is there so far. The survival mode isn't bad either but one thing I wish they didn't do for that was give you all the forumlas to craft things with. I like having to hunt and save up to trade with villages and traveling to buy more forumulas would have been nice for survival. Still this is an alpha level game so things can change a lot.I'm thinking you should start out survival (non-story) with just wood level tool crafting known.Update 7/26/2014: After playing a bit more I do have one problem with the adventure/survival mode as it stands right now. You can start out the game and not walk several feet from the village you start in and already there's a large monster (ogre?) with a club or gun mowing you down. This can be solved though by kiting it to the village for the NPCs to beat on. Still it'd be nice to have some breather space when you start out or maybe have a day/night spawn system like Minecraft for hostiles?Some updates went in since the last review as well, the game is getting better slowly so that's good.

								This game is fun, and with hopfully more to come in patches and updates this could be a much much more.The only issue i have with this game is that although the singleplayer campaign is oki find the game quite boring without playing with friends.All in all a good early access game to play and cant wait for more updates.

								Planet Explorers is still in early alpha stages but has promise in the already saturated mining/crafting genre.  The ability to create and distribute ISOs (crafting plans) in game allows for endless building possibilities which makes the game unique.  The physics feels just right, especially when flying.  The jetpack, hanglider combo make exploring fun and the boss fights in multiplayer keeps the online play interesting for a little while.  This game is already pretty fun and will only get better with time.  It is worth exploring this planet!			"

								At a glance, Planet Explorers feels a lot like another MMO.  This is especially true if you play Adventure mode.  Not being all that into MMOs myself, I was at first a little wary.  Soon enough, however, the lovely scenery, interesting aliens, and a crafting system that has a variety of levels of depth, and I was already humming along and happily harvesting plants.The crafting system is excellent.  There is a basic level, where you learn ""scrips"" and then build objects out of stuff that is in our inventory.  Then there is a deep level, where you can build any 3D object you want and it becomes available in the game.I also really enjoyed the aliens.  Especially at first, you never know what an alien is going to do till it sees you.  Then you learn really quick.  The scale of aliens is also great.  There are beings tiny like us meek humans, and towering giants that either ignore you, or quickly put you out of your alleged mysery.  This game can only go up as it gets more and more polished.  I'm happy to be in somewhere near the ground floor!			"

								Pretty fantastic game with interesting alien plant and animal analogues to Earth. The crafting is extensive but might need to be fine-tuned. You can build everything from a wooden shovel to a helicopter. Just exploring is half the fun but watch out for the other hostile alien race also trying to colonize the planet! Even though it has a lot of fine polishing to be done and it's not very easy to figure out how the crafting system works at first, I highly suggest buying the Early Access, as what I've seen and played shows great promise. You can play a story mode (which isn't finished currently) or an adventure mode that gives you more freedom and more than you'll have at the beginning of the story mode. There are also multiplayer servers where you can play Survival Coop, Survival PVP, or just build in peace. You can play using the seed of Planet Maria or a random seed to test your luck and so you have more control over the environment you'll be ""living"" on. There's a demo, so it doesn't hurt to at least check it out. 4/5 for me, because while the game is crazy-awesome at the moment, it still needs some polish and it will get that in the months to come.

								I have had this game for a few days now and I highly reccomend it. IT IS EARLY ACCESS. That seems to need to be emphasized more often these days, but for the money it is a great game!Think of Minecraft with better graphics, with some MMO features thrown in (and more coming!). Throw in some interesting tech and take off! You can design your own vehicles and vtol aircraft!, pick how many seats and such you want, as long as you have the resources in Story Mode, or the Meat(money)/resources in adventure mode, you can let your imagination run rampany on the vehicles.

								Steam is being flooded by sandbox exploration games right now. Next to starbound, this is one of my favorite. It still needs more work, but even in its current state, it is a lot of time sucking fun. What sets this game apart from others of its kind is that it is NOT 2D (its Voxel shaded...i don't really know what that means...) and the construction system. You can actually build cars and motorcycles in the game (as well as aircraft, eventually). You don't just collect the resources and then put it together at a crafting table, however...you use the in-game design tools to design how your vehicle will look, down to the paintjob and decals. My first vehicle was a model-T looking car with a huge turret, and 6 wheels to support all its weight. In addition to the construction system, you also have a massive and interesting environment, populated by a whole host of strange animals...like 6 armed fire-breathing bears. The music is also quite relaxing. There's a story-mode which makes it all the more interesting, as well.			"

								Completely restored my faith in early access games.  Fewer bugs than some i've seen at freaking launch, an interesting story for single player, and an amazing construction and customization system for weapons, vehicles, and aesthetic items.  The multiplayer is terrific for still being in alpha, and I can't wait for quests and/or progression in multiplayer.  The community content for the custom vehicles and weapons is already fantastic.  I bought it on sale, and it had more than earned it's full price in the first couple of hours.  Deffinitely recommend.			"

								This game is really rough for how expensive it is. Once you get beyond the nice visuals, you are shocked at how bad it is. Multiplayer is atrocious and not even worth mentioning. Completely broke. Here is a short lisr of complaints in the single player. - Your own turrets target and kill your own followers- Can't take you followers mining, they get stuck in a hole and never get out, end up having to dig a nice smooth ramp up to rescue them.- larger trees have no collision detection, you can walk right into center  and through them completely- No collision detection. While swinging a sword you swing through the mob and end up having to stop and turn around and re-target, because its now behind you. Main attack mode is to swing at air and hope you hit something.- Quest box will not resize to accomidate addl quests- Quest box will not stay in position place indicated, always returns to the default center of screen after any action (ie fast travel)- Quest box will not move to end of screen if you have more than 3 cuurently- NPCS on escort missions are unkillable. Why am I escorting them if they can't be killed?- Hit boxes way to small. Chopping a tree, looting a corpse, picking a flower, all impossible unless you are perfectly positioned, takes multiple positioning attempts  to complete menial tasks like picking herbs.- Beds actually hurt you and not heal, tooltip lies. there is no reason to sleep, except remove darkness.- Food hurts you? Eating food you lose health to regain stamina, you have to eat some food then use a bandage to recoup lost health. - only x and y position mapped, not z, so if I'm underground mining and a monster is on surface, it kills me.- monsters bounce around with no weight to them. I see huge rhinos walking on top of trees effortlessly, consider making larger beasts unable to float.-npcs have blue exclamations over their head and no actual quests for you General - Why is my char able to carry 9999 rock, 9999 stone, 9999 swords, and 9999 suits of armor? Storage is useless since your char can carry every single item in game on them. Nothing in the game has any weight or quantity restriction, besides the 9999 limit- Game is too easy. No penalty for dieing. I can craft 20 revive potions and defeat any monster in game with a wood sword. too be fun it must be a challenge. When I die send me back to a starting point, or penalize me in some way.- Why is ore immediately available for crafting. It should have to be smelted, refined, or processed in some way.-music is annoying, consider more than two 30 seconds tracks on constant loop. "

								Planet Explorers is a very unique game. While it does come with several short-comings which I will discuss later, the game itself is very well rounded and based on a sound survival tactical idealism that is reminiscient of minecraft, but has dutifully ascended to what Minecraft could never quite achieve; and it's still not complete!Before I dive into what I truly love about Planet Explorers, it would only be fair if I start with a few of it's shortcomings. The first thing is the fact that early game survivability is ridiculously odd, with a botchy combat system and not quite complete progression, this game lacks any motivation to keep on playing past the bad in hopes of reaching something good. Not to mention how ridiculously easy it is to aquire the best gear in the game through the incomplete store function. Sure, while the ability to design your own vehicles and weapons is cool, it's not really something to be all that impressed about, it's very linear about voxel placement and the damage to size ratio is far off to say the least.But putting all of that on the back burner, I would like to now dive in to what I thought was amazing about the game, and the reasons that I kept playing through the faults. The in-game world is beautifully designed, and provides motivation to explore and just admire the scenery. The colony function allows you to find people out in the wildnerness who you can ask to join you and before you know it, you can get a whole group of people following you around. The combat system is great, but part of the problem with it is just how poorly animated it is, but that's very easy to put aside. The animals and aliens in this game are not only well designed, but also are varied in appearance and combat strategy, it will make it difficult to say raid an alien colony without preparation, and it makes your troubles worth it in the end. With a good story mode and great functionality for a game that's still unfinished, it's hard to point out that many faults in it. And even then, to find anything really wrong with the game I had to nitpick.If I was going to rate this game, I'd have to give it at least a 7/10.			"

								Had this game for months before Steam release (so don't let my playtime fool ya), and I have to say its one of the more fully developed Early Access titles on here. It shares a lot in common with a ton of other games in the same genre, but does a few things a bit differently and does those things incredibly well. The creation system is, hands down, one of the coolest user creation systems I've ever come across. You can, and probably will, spend HOURS building cool things. And these cool things aren't just for decoration..........you will be driving them, flying them, shooting them or swinging them. Wanna make a replica of the Millennium Falcon? Go for it. Wanna create Ecto 1 from Ghostbusters? Have at it. Build a giant race track so you and your friends can race your crazy user built race cars? Ya, its in there.

Early Access Review
								So if you could not tell, it's minecraft on crack, addicting, fun, a small learning curve, took me only 10 minutes to get a full understanding of controls and the build system, be warned though, it is still very much in alpha, and may be there for quite a while, as the AI, enemys, turrents, and even digging are very bad. I seriously doubt this won't be changes in the future, because it is so bad an ally will walk into the wall for an endless amount the time, same with enemys, turrents will shot into the ground if the enemy entired sight than walked into a lower point then is visable to the turrent. One of my biggest problems is the lack of challange of ""explore"" mode, all crafting items(weapons, armor, so on) is giving to you off the bat, and you simply have to go out and find the mats. The enemys are randomly spawned, so sometimes a huge monster will spawn right outside the base, and the NPCs seem to kill it without taking any damage, OH and when you first spawn in you fall to your death and respawn on the spot I believe they intend for you to spawn, everytime, dont know if that is just me. For myself, I never played this type of game, and minecraft did not interest me past day 1. But I have to say, this game looks pretty good, but I also see it getting boring after story mode ends, hopefully explore mode gets a little harder. In the end I recommend it for all the things they are throwing at you for $25 and what this game will be once it is completed.Edit 1: You can build a wall(you can build these anytime, anywhere BTW) around a monster and then  delete a single stone and shoot it from a safeISH distance away, I would like to see that fixed but I don't really know how that can be with the free build system, I don't know I suppose it is your game and you can play it how you choose. :/Edit 2: Multiplayer and more on explore mode. So I guess they have a ""shop"" in the right hand corner in both co-op multiplayer and explore where oh most all the items in the game are for sale. In explore mode you start right by a gold mine site every single time, I learnt this well playing legit over and over, and once I found the shop, if you clear that mine of gold out, you can buy yourself anything from the shop. Same with online co-op so it kinda just feels like easy mode. Also there is a quick travel if you did not realize. Open map and left click on a house icon. In the end this game seems kid/noob friendly. There is no difficult part besides walking from point A to point B until you can quick travel there in story, and unless you force yourself to play the hard way you will never die/ lose a fight after the first hour or so. I still recommend it as I am hopeing for a more challenging mode/option to come out, as it stands you can play the game anyway you choice, thus making it difficult, but if you are playing on co-op I doubt anyone else will be doing the same.

But it's fun.I'm playing in story mode at the moment, which gives me some building, some adventure, and (you guessed it), the story.Its incompleteness is showing in a few places. For me, the most annoying is with the scanner: it doesn't give a clear indication of where the character is in relation to the minerals you're scanning; nor does it give a clear indication of your facing.I also would prefer a gamma or brightness control (either!) in the video settings.That said, I'm thoroughly enjoying the game.

								While this is still an incomplete game, it's very, very nice. Yes, it's an indy game: it doesn't have some of the extreme polish you get in the big company's titles. But it's fun.I'm playing in story mode at the moment, which gives me some building, some adventure, and (you guessed it), the story.Its incompleteness is showing in a few places. For me, the most annoying is with the scanner: it doesn't give a clear indication of where the character is in relation to the minerals you're scanning; nor does it give a clear indication of your facing.I also would prefer a gamma or brightness control (either!) in the video settings.That said, I'm thoroughly enjoying the game. For fans of story-driven games, open world adventure gaming, or colonisation/city building, this is definitely worth a try.			"

								This is a good game for people interested in a minecraft type of experience. Those looking for a PVP or Hardcore RPG experience will be disappointed. At this point, the game is very limited but don't take this to mean that you can't do anything. The framework is here for a super awesome exploration/building/crafting game. It has an autocad type editor that you can spend hours recreating cars, planes, guns, swords, or decorative items from films, television, and other games. My buddy and I downloaded someone's jurassic park jeep creation and rode around among the giant creatures. It was very cool.SummaryActive Developers with frequent updatesSingle player campaignOpen world exploration with NPC quest giversMining and CraftingRandomly seeded world for multiplayer with co-opMANY, MANY BUGSSLOW Game PlayDifficult multiplayer hosting and connection processMultiplayer works off and onIf you're looking at Planet Explorers wait a little bit before buying the game unless you find it on sale. Development is slow going but consistent. I DO NOT feel cheated by the developer at all. I recommend this game for those interested in it.			"

												It's a good game. Has alot to do and if you like a nice building adventuring game then this is a good one. The Devs spent alot of time fixing problems and adding content since I got this a while back. They are probly one of the only early access games ive tried so far who actualy gave something that was and is being worked on. So by all means if you like the whole building and adventuring type of game you should give this a try. Don't mind the negative reviews so far they are mainly people who like to complain and give a game they barely touched a bad review because of preference and not judging the game by what it is and how it works.Have Fun :D			"

								This game is pretty cool. The only reason I would recommend not getting it, is if you have things to do in your life that aren't playing Planet Explorers. It's pretty addictive and fun. This game has it all, and dont even get me started on the crafting and creation tools, you are pretty much limitless when it comes to that. You can make customized Airplanes, Cars, Helicoptors, Boats, All kinds of guns, Houses and Funiture. So go buy the game already!10/10 Buy it!			"

												I really do enjoy this game... but unfortunatly its just too broken. The lag on the multiplayer survival servers is unreal. Sometimes it's fine and sometimes it's completely unplayable. I would make a post on the forums asking the developers to address this but for some reason Pathea can't seem to figure out how to send me an authentication email so I can join the forums. Please Pathea, I know you are a small team but get your sh*t together because I would really like to play this game.			"

								I highly recommend this game to anyone that is into voxel based creative games, action games, and to some extent, survival games.The graphics are quite beautiful, I find myself just stopping to enjoy the view quite often. Textures could be better but the overall asthetic is quite nice.This game uses a smooth voxel system meaning terrain is made up of small voxels as opposed to other blocky voxel games that use large single blox voxels. Just like other voxel based games you can dig and build to your hearts content. One thing tha makes this game really unique is the ability to build your own weapons, shields, buildings, and vehicles using their in-game design software.Want to make Cloud's Buster sword? You can do that. Want to make the Master Sword? You can do that too. You can pretty much design and build anything you can think of so long as you have the materials to build it. In Story and Adventure modes you have to gather materials manually in the game where as in Build Mode you are given pretty much unlimited resources to build with, which from what I remember you can load up your designs from Build Mode into Story and Adventure mode, you will still however need to gather all the proper materials and craft components in the game to build your designs.This is one of the absolute best creative survival games available. I find it far more enjoyable than Minecraft ever was and the devs are adding more and more features.If you are on the fence about this game, do yourself a favor and just jump over to Planet Explorers side. You will not regret it.I give Planet Explorers a solid 8.5/10.			"

								I've not even played this for an hour on the steam version, but hear me out.People don't want to hear the ""the game has potential"" b*llsh*t. They actually want to play it right now. Good part about this is, you can.It is still very basic, the combat and AI is not really something extraordinary yet. The crafting is very good though. This game has a really good atmosphere in it, and VERY playable for an alpha. There's lopads of content in it.You can build and design your own vehicles and armor, which is really sweet if you're creative.I look forward to a gamemode which just enables PvP around the world, no teams unless you choose to.If you are on the edge of buying this after watching some cool gameplay, buy it.

								Planet Explorers is a great experience when you like exploration, sci-fi, craft, and beautiful landscapes. It's rare in a game to stay on top of a (virtual) mountain, and stay there a few minutes just to enjoy the sunset while some predators hunt gigantic herbivores under your eyes. Mining seems almost real, and the contruction kit offer great possibilities. On the other side, fighting is quite basic, and some animations may be rough. But for a beta access, it's a total success and developpers seem to take their jobs seriously.			"

												Creative Freedom 9/10Adventure 5/10Sandbox 8/10Survival 2/10Longevity 2/10Because of the nature of this game, I have to review it from 2 angles.Creative/Sandbox/BuilderIn this area the game excells.  There are all kinds of things you can make, a colony of NPCs to manage, and you can even design tools, weapons, and vehicles from scratch.  You can construct your own personal fortress populated with NPCs and defended by an arsenal of turrets.... But, to what end?  Other than being able to admire your creation, it serves little purpose.This leads me to the second angleAdventure/Survival/LongevityThe game is really not much of a challenge.  There are no hordes coming to knock down your door.  Most of the vehicles, turrets, and weapons you make are put to little use (outside of a pvp server).  Feels like you are building up an empire for a war that will never happen.  Playing on a server with the skills system will give you a few more hours of enjoyment, as it will take you longer to get to ""end game"" gear, but the enviornmental opposition is still lacking.  The quests and dungeons are generic and bland.I still recommend this game, but only if:1) You are looking for a freebuild creative mode sandbox to just build and design to your hearts content.2) or if you have a crew of people to PVP with.

								Planet explorers is fun. Once you progress a little and are able to make jetpacks and gliders, it gets more fun; the freedom of flying is great. The game initially feels kind of like a cheap chinese knockoff, but as you play you'll be quickly disuaded from that idea (at least the cheap and knockoff parts; the dialogue still makes me think non-native speaker). While you need to mine for resources and are capable of building a variety of structures, terraforming the world is NOT the main focus of this game. Instead you primarily spend your resources building equipment, weaponry, and vehicles. These allow you to fight the hostile forces that reside in the sprawling world as you explore. Both the combat and exploration are really well polished, and those aspects alone are worth the fairly low price. The story has been added to throughout early access, and does a good job of providing distant destinations for you to travel to so that you can lose yourself along the way (not literally; you have a map).

								When I first purchased this game, I played it a bit and was all ""meh"". It was decent, but nothing too gripping. So I put it down and forgot about it. And that was a mistake. Doing the campaign, while it is slow (and buggy, but ""alpha"" state), teaches you HOW yo play the game. And once you learn how to use the ISO tool properly, and how to build properly, this game is a lot of fun. The planet itself is pretty neat, and I dig the alien types. This is a game you have to dive into to truly appreciate. 8/10 for an Alpha-state game.			"

								First review ever, so sorry if it is not ""proper"".Now that got this out of the way...Planet explorers feels very nice too me, i don't know something about this game ""clicks"".Most negative reviews are about bugs and how slow the development progresses, i'll have to disagree with negative reviews on early access for those reasons.I like to give every early access title a chance that it will become a great game even if it takes long, buying an EA game doesn't say somewhere for sure how long it will take for release most of the time.Anyways for planet explorers specifically i look at the development through the years almost since it came out on steam. Although slow, the development progresses steadily and a ton of things have been added to the game. I hope/believe it will turn in a great game!P.S.:Don't dissapoint good (indie) developers with bad/b!tchy reviews/comments and cheer them while they make something that is  for entairtemaint and fun and hope for the best from them!

												This game is a perfect example of how a beautiful game can be marred by poor voice talent. I cannot say anything bad about the rest of the game, it's great and I would recommend for everyone to buy it. A lot of work has gone into it, and it's beautiful.However, the whole experience is marred by unprofessional, unenthusiastic voice talent who sound like they're just reading their lines. It completely breaks the experience of the game. Gerdy sounds like she's someone's mother and has no prior experience in voice acting. Why spend so much effort to make a beautiful game, and then go cheap on the voice actors? It just ruins the experience. I can see it being the one thing that will turn people away from playing this game. I never thought voice was very important, definitely not as important as visuals, but it's really breaking the reality of the game. It's really too bad.			"

What I mean is, thanks to huge inventory and and very friendly interface, very slowly  breaking tools and no weight restrictions, it feels like a game and not like a chore (cough cough Rust, cough cough Minecraft). I normally don't play this type of games, but Planet Explorers is a damn fine one. As for story, it's nothing exceptional but it does it's job. Group of people crash on a planet they know next to nothing about and, as humanity always does, start to♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and killing anymals, mining ores, cutting trees and harming local ecology in any way they can.

												I've had this game since 2014, but I haven't been able to play it much due to the sound effects and voice acting being incredibly cringey. I made the incorrect assumption that, when I first heard them, they were just ""dev fillers"" - developers filling for future voice actors. Boy was I wrong.In 30 years I've never played a game with such demonstrably bad audio. The music is nice, but the voice acting and sound effects are appalling. It's really quite unfortunate, because the rest of the game feels like a lot of work went into it. Performance is good, interface and movement is decent, gameplay and quests are interesting, and there's a lot of depth so far.Here's some examples I've found: Footsteps. Some surfaces don't make any sound. Walking on grass sounds like someone is kicking dirt with each step. Walking on snow sounds like someone banging a wooden spoon against a counter in the distance (wtf?). The footsteps also don't vary much, making them very annoying to listen to after some time. Earth fauna. Several sounds are very clearly from creatures on earth, like eagles, crickets, and other animals. This is especially disconcerting considering the amount of work done to create unique, alien creatures walking around the surface. Jetpack. Very bizzarre here, too. It starts off sounding great, with an ""engine fire"" kind of sound, and then it devolves into what sounds like a distorted whistle from a teakettle coming to a boil. What? Voice Acting. Whenever an NPC speaks, I'm pulled instantly back into reality that I'm sitting at my computer playing a game. It sounds like the devs chose 10 random people on the street, gave them all $5 USB microphones, then had them record at home. You can easily tell that the voice actors are attempting to do voices that they are incapable of doing. The only voice actor that I've encountered that sounds natural and professional is whomever voices Ava Azniv. That leaves maybe 15 other voices that are terrible. Sometimes the same NPC changes its voice drastically between two sentences, meaning the VO was done separately, with different equipment, and with a different distance from the microphone. 3D sound. The three dimensional sound is based on your character's standing position in 3rd person and not on the player camera, which is opposite of any other game ever made. You ALWAYS play sound relative to the player camera, not to the NPC that the player is controlling in 3rd person. That way the character can shimmy around - strafe, dodge, run, jump, spin around - but the sound from the thing that has the player's attention is static and unmoving while the player camera is looking at it. I've been running forward, looking with the camera to my right, and I'll hear an animal sound to my left. When I spin my camera around to look forward, nothing is there. I need to keep spinning my camera left because the sound came from the NPC's left, not my camera's left.  Randomized animal ambience. Occasionally while playing, a random animal sound will play. Sometimes it's an eagle, sometimes it's a group of crickets that chirp for a few seconds, and sometimes it's a growl from a creature. This is obviously quite disruptive to gameplay since it causes the player to swivel around looking for a nearby predator. But there isn't one. So now I hear a growl and think it's just ambience, but it turns out to be a predator. Ugh.Since like in movies, sound can either make or break the experience, these issues ruin it for me, but I'll keep playing. It's still a well-made game otherwise. I just wouldn't recommend it.			"

								Has something special about it. The art is unique and beautiful, the gameplay is so fun and different every playthrough, which is what I personally love. It's not a perfect game at this stage, but it has the potential to be, and most probably will be in the months/years to come.I can't name all the games, but let's just say this is all your favourite sandbox - open world - survival - builder - simulation games combined into one, with the ability to create anything you like. - Want a custom Gun? You can make it, shape the body how you want. - Need you very own version of the Buster sword, but bigger and badder... maybe in Gold? Sure why not.- Want to create your own Ferrari in the game? Sure you can... it'll take time and patience but the results would be worth it... - How about making your own Houses, with it's own furniture... yeah you guess it, you can make it.Most things like vehicles needs to have some precreated objects (like the engine of a bike) but its up to you to decide where to place the chairs then model and colour the body however you want. Swords require a Hilt object, guns require the handle and trigger object. But the overall shape of it is down to you. Everything else, like furniture or houses... you create them how you want.You will not be disappointed, it's early access and still has plenty of ways to go which only means that the final product will be bigger, badder and awesomer* (if there was ever such a word)			"

								Dont beleive the game is a bundle of glitches. I havnt died by a single tree or flung upwards hundred of meters. I have had fun in solo, and multiplayer can still be fun without friends. The creation systen is fun, creating rigid swords can add damage and the more barrels on a gun causes faster fire rate. it was fun creating items and im still experiencing more fun. gets repetitive with quests and has annoying mining and decent voice acting. 8.6/10			"

								I'm going to tell you what you want to know.  *Is this game fun?  Yes, BUT it's still annoying for me to play.  I'm not going to sugar-coat this game, I like the concept, but it's still in Alpha, people, and my impatience+curiousity in the game outweighed that risk factor when I was debating on buying the game.  In the end, I bought the game and here are my thoughts:""It looks like Gary's Mod, Minecraft, Skyrim put into one!""Sort of, if you've ever played Space Engineers, it feels somewhat similar in controls, camera rotating, item building, etc.  I'm not the kind of guy who likes playing games that aren't incredibly fluid in controls, and despite the fact that you can still fix camera sensitivity etc., it still wasn't as fluent after a few minutes into the game.  Also watched a few gameplay vids on this and thought ""what the hell, why not steam sale and I want it"", but in the end, I didn't really play a lot of it since the gameplay was still somewhat annoying.  Don't get me wrong, it comes with unique features like creating your own sword, being able to weild it, making designs for your own vehicles and guns from smaller pixels and detailing it nicely, but that only got me so far.  So now.. should you get the game?If you have nothing else to buy, go for it. If you're leaning more towards buying this game over something else, don't get this.  Keep in mind that you'll want to put a bit of time into learning and getting used to the controls.This game's controls wasn't as easy to pick up as something like Skyrim, Minecraft, or Gary's Mod. If you have patience, give it a try. If you're like me, don't bother until it's out of Alpha.*edited P.S.I have at least 2 hours of gameplay, but they're not showing. Perhaps I was in offline mode? But I know I spent one night on it going over a number of the game's features in adventure and building mode.Also, don't get me wrong or take this review negatively but I really do like this game.  I like the game and I like the concept of the game, but I hate the controls and the unfluid motions.  It's definitely a recommend for those who have time as people who have made gameplay vids on these look like they're having EXTREME FUN. But I'm not like them, so I'll put this game off for a while and come back to it perhaps when they've added many updates to it? :3			"

The Short SummaryIf you like open world sanbox games, freedom to build whatever you want and a really pretty looking environment to do it in that is filled with really cool creatures buy this game!The Pros-Amazing object/vehicle creation (see below)-Huge, pretty world-Promising storyline-Stable (I haven't had a single crash)-Nice soundtrackThe Cons-Some sounds/voices missing-Occasional bugs-Occasional graphical glitches-Not all of storyline is finished yet-Fairly steep learning curve (no tutorial yet)My ReviewI had my eye on this game for ages but was undecided - quite often Early Access games can end up being a waste of time and money.  I had previously tried an early alpha demo (available for free from their website but does not do the game justice at all) and was put off by the fact that it seemingly required a click to move the mouse.  Little did I know that pressing F2 enables ""shooter mode"" and allows the camera to follow the mouse.  Epic.  From the moment I figured that out I was snared.It is fun to play, addictive, pretty and basically everything you want in an open-world RPG sandbox game!One of the biggest selling points is the editor/creator interface - where most games will allow you to make a simple ""custom"" vehicle out of snap-together parts, this actually allows you to use both simple and complex shapes combined with prefab parts to create vehicles in any shape that you like!  When you have finished designing a vehicle you save it and it gets stored in your in-game library and can be used in any game mode.  You can also share yours and download other people's if you fancy!For me this game was the final nail in minecraft's little square coffin.  For me it was the fabled minecraft killer!  It doesn't have a huge amount in common but the things that it does (admittedly mainly mining...) are done so much better!  Smooth, voxel-based terrain makes for a much more fun digging experience and allows you to be much more creative while building defences and tunnels etc.Long story short, I cannot fault this game in any major way - but I cannot stress this enough, you still have to remember that it is an alpha version!  Although, honestly, I've paid more for mainstream games that felt less finished and polished than this one in it's current state. :)So far of the Early Access and Alpha games I've tried out this is one of the only two that I can honestly say has impressed me to this level.  For me it draws level both in creativity and content to Space Engineers - and that is a serious compliment from me considering that I have clocked up over 230 hours into that came.  It is also clear that the developers really want to create a finished product - they usually release fixes not long after new alpha patches come out and also give a rough idea of what is to be expected in the next release.There are obviously bugs, and certain things could be a little more well explained but honestly this game is worth the tiny amount of time it takes to master the basics!  Features get fixed and new stuff gets added with each update.So enough of this review... I'm off to play Planet Explorers!! ;)			"

								A unique game that really allows you to express yourself, unlike some other 'crafting' games that promised to deliver, but delivered nothing BUT promises. Other then allowing you to create weapons, vehicles, shields and constructs voxel by voxel, this game looks very unique and the design is astounding, from creatures to environments, this game is absoulutely an eye treat and also a fun experience (and probably better with friends). I see a good future for this game, support it.			"

								Never before had a game hooked me up so badly, only a week in and spent more than an entire day worth of time on it. o.oAlmost everything in this alpha is awsome! Most stuffs are polished .... let me list out the ups and down for y'all:Alright, for all you skeptic lads out there, I'll start with the down:Down:Bugs (at the state of an Alpha, this is pretty damn small)  - Turret falling through grounds  - Some funky clipping sometimes  - Moster Beacon *** not disappearing or removable.Combat(melee) system could be polished some more ... somewhat stiff.And perhaps some optimization ... might hurt a bit if you do not have a decent PC, my laptop overheated every once in a while ... but perhaps because I might have been playing for too long ;)And now, for the good part ... I could go on with this for hours ... however, here're the highlights:Voxel based construction & destruction (Has according stats, not only for cosmetics)- The crafting (editor) system is brilliant, it is freaking brilliant! you can make your own:   [VEHICLES] cars, bikes, boats, planes, airships, a flying shoe, etc.   [ITEMS] Shields, guns ... you name it. But mind you, all voxel placements and materials EFFECTS THE ITEM'S Stats. (Sadly, you can't make your own ammo yet ... hope it is added though :) )   [""Objects""] Want to make a decoration? Go ahead! Custom fence? Sure! Some dolphin you want to cuddle in game? Go ahead! RPG elements and Colony system:Putting this in the alpha persepective ... the Colony system looks quite promising ... though could use a bit of polishing.- You own a colony, which is used to produce resources/goods and houses Npcs. - Defend it or watch your work go to waste ... the ""Colony under attack"" Mechanic is brilliant.And the story. I am not sure whether it is completed or not ... But the current storyline I am following is really enjoyable. You start off as an colonist heading from Earth, with Martians ... and was promised a peaceful new start ... and so it begins [Aw Hell naw, I ain't gonna spoil it for you!]Npcs - Could use a wee bit of polishing, many of them are still as dumb as a rock ... but ah well, alpha wise some can talk and all can walk, that's fair.All in all, this is a brilliant game ... if you are looking for something to sink your teeth in, if you like games the allow you to desgin your own ways ... of travelling, fighting, living .... this is totally the game for you! However, mind you ... in order to thrive in this new world ... there are challenges to the mind ... if you think you got what it takes, then hop abroad the ship and off we go!See you soon, and safe space faring Colonists.- spongpol "

								I'll keep it short as it's a game in Early Access, with lots of stuff that has to be done yet.The game shows *a lot* of potential, with MMORPG-like feeling mixed together with third-person shooter and crafting game mechanics. I haven't personally looked much at the building section of the game, which looks absolutely intriguing and fascinating.If you want to compare it to other sandbox games like Minecraft, Terraria or Starbound, the biggest changes are that this set in a huge life-like breathing world rendered in ""real"" 3D (no more pixel graphics!) that you can modify and make yours to the same degree that the aformentioned titles allow you to.Another big bonus is the fact that there is a single player story mode, something that very few games of this genre offer; however, it definitely feels like a game that is meant to be played cooperatively, so bear this in mind if you want to play in single player only.Trying to wrap it up: if you like crafting/sandboxing games, and if you like exploring vast, fantastic territories... give this game a shot, you'll probably like it.My vote: 7/10 (current game state), 9.5/10 (potential)			"

You start collecting some wood, make your first pickaxe/shovel/axe, and off you go! There is currently enough to keep you busy for quite a while, I've played over 14 hours on my own server and have yet only discovered 50% of what I actually can craft. I love it, I hope there will be alot more content comming in the next patches, That will surely make this game stand out for what it is.

This makes for awkard hostering and rehostering in mid combat. Nobody runs around with their weapon pointed up all the time. (fix this and combat will be fun)-Melee weapons swing all over the place.So far everything in the game is pretty fun, but the combat really needs some tweeks to make fighting more fluid. "

Early Access Review
								First time doing a serious review of a game, so please bear with me.NOTE: This review is for version A0.82 so my opinion may change for better or worse over time.With that all over with, let's get to the review.Prologue and Creation/building system 9/10Planet explorers is a voxel based open world building/RPG game with Singleplayer/multiplayer support. The game is very playable for an alpha game, and deserves all the credit possible for that feat alone. It's one of the best games I've played this year, and has lots of replay value through the creation system on its own. The building system in this game is one of its strong points. It improves upon something that games like Minecraft fall short on. It gives you the ability to enter a free cam mode and build as you see fit, with support for curved edges, slopes, ramps, and everything else of the sort. The creation system is fun to use, but really flimsy with its actual usage ingame. So far I've seen little use for ground vehicles, aside from being cool looking sometimes. The weapons are terribly weak and could be improved upon. When my 1000 meat pistol does more damage than 20,000 meat tank, then you have a problem. But all that aside, I've spent a majority of my time on this game making vehicles and weapons. It truly gives the power to the players. With admins stating that they plan to add extensive mod support for this game in later builds, I see it having a very long and prosperous life. Instant classic.Combat 5/10The combat system in Planet Explorers is very clumsy to say the least. You lunge forward with melee weapons and flail around like an idiot hoping you hit something, while the massively overpowered giant monsters make scraps of you. I've used 3+ revival shots on fights that should'nt even need healing. The ranged weapons are bearable, but the Ocarina of Time camera angle it throws you into makes moving and shooting very annoying. In the end I found myself relying on grenades and placing down my Artillary cannons to deal with monsters instead of actually fighting them.Exploration 5/10The game is not very rewarding for its exploration, with all of the ore veins being deep underground and very scattered, there's no reason to use your scanner unless you know exactly where the veins are. I havn't played adventure mode much to know about how bad the ore veins are in there, but the ore veins in story are massive and widely spread apart. Its taken my 10+ minutes just to get a petrol vein I needed, and another 20+ minutes to try and make sense of how to dig to it.Mining 7/10 (4/10 without guides.)This is the only game where I've only wanted to get 20 copper out of a vein, but came out with 3000. For some reason the mining in this game is awefully enrapturing. But my poiny from before remains clear, the process of getting to the ore is very agonizing, to say the least. Especially when you're not relying on guides to find the ores. Before I knew they were in set locations, I spent an hour or two on finding a silver deposit.Vehicles 8/10Vehicles are fun, but clumsy. Ground vehicles are like moving bricks, and take damage from everything. Their weapons are extremelly lacking, and eat through what little power they have like nothing. Aircraft are similar with power problems, but by the point you get Aircraft in the story mode you have a means to refuel them. Aircrafts also have much more versatile weapon systems. I cannot give opinions on boats, I've never used them or needed to use them. Sorry.Overall Alpha score: 7/10Presumed Release score: 9/10Personal scoring: 8/10 (Meaning how much I enjoy the game as a whole, not just getting an average.)If you came to this game from Minecraft, you are in the wrong place, this game requires a lot more time and effort to get to a reasonable standing, but is much more rewarding.Sorry if my reviewing skills are undesirable, I just felt the need to review one of my favorite games to date.

								I loved this game a lot!! I only have just begun to play it, since each update corrups current worlds, but I really like the graphics. This game has many challenges, trades, and fun mini-missions. You can also custimise your character, which is another plus. I reccomend this game to people who like survival games or RPG. Planet Explorers has overall been a popular favorite, and I have liked it a lot, so far.Ups:-The graphics are great!-The game is original -The plot is good-There is a LOT to do, so it is never boring-You can change things to fit the speed of your computer, so you get a good speed of the game.Downs: -Planet Explorers has not been finished, as you know, but this makes the trailer better than the game. -Some of the details/ creatures shown in the trailer have not yet been released into the game. -There is also a lot of lag bursts, making it hard to prepare for attacks. -There are glitches that need to be fixed, during the updates-After every update, your current worlds are destroyed.

												It has a few things going for it.  The vehicle/building/weapon bulding system is awesome.  You can make some really cool things if you spend enough time on it.  Otherwise, the gameplay is boring, the crafting is lackluster, resource gathering is difficult and tedious.  It had a lot of potential.  It's just not polished enough to justify the price.			"

								This game shows a lot of promise. As soon as you enter story mode, you get this feeling of attachment to your character and story. The game is a little confusing at first but once you get a better feel of it, you'll instantly become addicted. Planet Explorers has exceeded my expectations by a land slide. For an Early Access Game, it's very well designed and runs quite smoothly on my pc. It's a combinatioon of sandbox, survival, action, exploration, space, and so much more than I can fit into one sentence. I completely recommend this game. 10/10!Check out my walkthroughs of Planet Explorers on YouTube!

								This game definitely has potential, in addition to being fun to play in it's current state. The devs are pretty transparent with their goals and timeline.There's certainly a few things that are lacking (am I the only one who thinks rotocopters should be able to strafe instead of just yaw?) The crafting system (the replicator) works quite well, and the interface is pretty intuitive. There are a few querks with equipping items and where they show up in your inventory (personal opinion, certainly doesn't affect gameplay).The iso creation system is, in my opinion, what really sets this apart from other sandboxes. Not only can you create your own things out of blocks, but you can create your own useable items - vehicles, weapons, objects. The interface is a little intimidating at first, and isn't the most intuitive or user friendly, but once you get the hang of it, you can do some pretty amazing things! I'd like to see more data displayed while in the iso creator, but we're in alpha, and there's lots of development to go.Overall, it's a beautiful game with some very innovative ideas. I can't wait to see where it goes, and I'm having lots of fun playing it as is.			"

								This game is still crude and there are a lot of things missing. BUT one of it's greatest features and at the same time the thing that makes it's early stage of development toleralbe is the vehicle/weapons/item creation feature which makes the game worth your time if you enjoy designing stuff. The iteam creation system is not very complicated, it could use a more improved tutorial that spoonfeeds you the basics, but you can find some of these tutorials on youtube. The devs keep in touch with the players and while they are not as open as I'd like regarding to the patch content and release dates. However the steady amount of content does not give me the feeling they will leave their fans hanging and leave with their money, like other games I won't name.Bottom line, if you like what this game is and what it's aiming to be, then show your support and buy it.

There are elements that remind me totally of ""Minecraft"" along with several MMOs that I've played.  If you're looking for something that a little off the beaten path, give this one a look.  I'm totally pleased with my purchase.  Once they get all the bugs worked out, this title will be amazing.  I really enjoy the open world feel of this game.  The creatures that inhabit this planet are really imaginative.  You never know what you're going to run across.  I almost passed on this title due to the generic sounding title and I'm glad I slowed down long enough to take a look at it. . . So far this is my Game Of The Year for 2014.			"

								Some people when seeing this game will immeditely think ""Yay... another Minecraft clone... again!"" and would be partly right since this game offers a lot more.First : the story mode, which could potentially be considered a big tutorial for the adventure part, is actually worth doing if you are (like myself) an amateur of the ""stranded adventures"" type, in many occasions I almost expected Captain Janeway beam down and give me a new assignment.Second : the customization possibilities go way beyond what Minecraft can do (coming from the madman who made the casle of Akashi on minecraft-europe server mostly by himself), both in terms of objects AND in vehicules with some really impresive designs you can import in the game just with a drag and drop in the right folder, even while the game is till running.Third : the environments are gorgeous ! I was a bit scared to end up in pretty barren lands like you could see in Anarchy Online but through the visual style (which reminds a lot of Consortium and/or Star Wars - The Old Republic), props and mobs runing around you already have, despite the game being in alpha, the impression of being in a living world. It really is a joy to see a pack of wolf like creature attacking a herbivore in the middle of a forest. Some may argue that the graphics are not ""Next-Gen"" but as Yathzee Croshaw would say ""Golden pixels are detrimental to the quality of all other aspects of the game"" yet even though the game is definitely not the absolute best looking you can tell the guys put some serious work in making the environments colourful and interesting to travel in (I had to pick up my jaw on the floor a few times in fact).On the less good parts :- The game currently has some issues with quest in story mode blocking (a character giving a quest that pops up and dissappear right away or conditions not validating being the most common issues), some people apparently didn't had much problems but I'm currently stuck after 12 hours of questing. Probably somethings patching will correct so I don't mind that much.- You can shape the land as you see fit in theory only because it is actually quite difficult to accurately mine things, for example trying to mine a perfectly straight tunnel at an angle can become a nightmare really fast because the character is always sliding on slopes, which brings to the next point.- Controls are a bit cluncky with a big hindrance of the camera not always placing itself in the best angle for the action and the vehicules being a bit difficult to accurately tune in regards to the power/weight ratio and turning angle, meaning a vehicule can have a tendency to do a 180° as slowly as an narcoleptic sloth or beat Sonic the hedgehod to it.The last point is nor good nor bad, it's actually something any off roader knows : there are no roads (that I've seen) on this planet so do not build a low hanging vehicule as the slightest slope will probably damage the vehicule. So unless you manually build roads leading to New Rome you will always travel in bugies !			"

								Absolutely an amazing game. So much to do. It is a sandbox game meaning you can do practically anything you want with out following a story line. However, there is a story and it is a good one. You crash on a new planet with a few other scattered survivors. As in real life you have to survive and try to get off planet or at least hook up with others.  In order to do this you mine materials, grow food, build habitations,forts,base camps,even villages.You create tools,weapons,machines,ATVs, aircraft etc. You hunt animals for meat which is also a currency, and harvest plants for mediciane. You scan the earth for minable resources.Some of the local fauna are passive some aggressive and you need to be alert and armed where ever you go. This adds a feeling of danger and realness to the game. As it would be in real life you learn about the planet through exploration, about its creatures through study and careful approach. All have there own biorythms.  Determine the hostile ones in time and you might survive. Some attack solo, others in packs. How cool is that?The world has many biomes, sea ,grasslands ,desert, forests and canyons. All beautifully constructed.The musical score is wonderful and is still being added to as is other game content.As is I am 50 hours into the game and have experienced no bugs. It is a joy to play.The characters are well animated and you can create your own at start. It appears that more features will be added to the character creation in the future.This game seems to have a little of everything, survival on a strange and beautiful world, a mysterios alien race, ruins, hostile tribals, discord within your own ranks between the earthlings and martian components.With more content coming every month I can't wait to see what is up next. You could spend hours just in the creation section building and awesome tank or helicopter to meet your own design standards.  Later import it in game and have your character climb on board and travel in style to any point in the game,The game doesen't hand hold you so you get to learn and explore and create as in a real world experience. There are small tutorials that give you the basics and fire the imagination,There is even a map that you can mark your building sites on, or locations of minerals you have located etc.There are tools for every job, shovels, picks, axes, swords, shields, guns, bows, laser guns, armour. This means you canplay the game as a medieval warrior or as a highly specialized space traveller with all the gadgets or somewhere in between.This game IMO was the best buy I have made in years.  A masterpice of fun and imagination.Hats off to the developers for such a polished and entertaining product. "

								I think this game has sooooo much potential. It is already very playable for an ""ALPHA"". The whole idea of an alpha is to support EARLY developement of a game. The feature set and future vision they have for it is pretty amazing. So as an alpha backer I will TEST the game as it stands in developement and give feedback on bugs, game play and maybe what i would like to see. Awesome job guys keep up the good work. I will update this review in the future as the updates roll out.			"

The only problem that i can see right now is that it is still a little laggy for me but i assume that it's because it's still in alpha and also there are some bugs that can be annoying.

								This is one of the best Alpha game,Thats I have ever played.I had read that they worked on this game for 2 years and boy didnt they work hard on this game.They still are working hard and by the looks of it they update every week.which is fantastic.Not only the updates are good,They have worked hard on every aspect of this game.Such as the Monster creation,I have never seen so many weird and beautiful animals.Some looks so dangerouse and some look very cute,but watch out for the cute ones they are fast and deadly I tell you!!!The animation isnt that bad at all you do get your moneys worth.There are so many things to make,like vehicles,  build your own base ,wepons ,dig ( yes you can dig) for iron copper ,Tin , you can alos plant and grow food,Which is amazing.You not only can make your own items but you can buy and sell from NCPS to.Not only that you have diffrent game modes to, like single player and multiplayer.but withing those game modes are more game modes,for example ,Single player has explore mode ,story mode and build mode.I have payed for a lot of early access games and this is by fare the best.I am so thrilled that I got this game at the price that it is set at, this game is worth much more,If you buy this game now you are getting the best game deal ever.I could and will type all of the cons about this game but Im afraid there isnt enough room.I would suggest you buy this game if you like these games.Monster Hunter Minecraft Skyrim Borderlands 2Rust (Planet explorers is much better that rust I tell you )I garantee you will not be disapointed with this game.

								Planet Explorers is nowhere near complete, it is after all, an Alpha. With that consideration in mind, this has the potential to be an amazing game. The only problems I've noticed are that the grass and shadow textures cause all sorts of lag problems, but this can be easily fixed by turning those textures off. The other being how user friendly it is. It is really not very user friendly. There is no real tutorial, figuring out how to get stuff into the game that you made in creation mode can take awhile, and the combat system is a little odd. Keeping in mind that this is in alpha, and it is nowhere near done, I'd say that most of these problems can be fixed, and I am sure they will be even better than I could imagine in time. This game is kinda like minecraft in space, so that's pretty awesome. I also love that there is character interaction, and that the interaction will only get better. Overall, I would reccommend this game strongly. It isn't great yet, but I know it will be.			"

Though the game surprised me with its beautiful textures and lighting effects... that was not what caught my eye. Instead, the ability to create on a 3D platform and let your imagination run wild stunned me. This game will hold ,as proclaimed to the title, many adventures to be explored for you and your friends.

With that said, I didn't play the game for that long until i noticed that it wasn't as fun as i thought it would.I guess with alot of work i may play it again, i don't know. until then, this game is not worth 20£.

								This game is still crude and there are a lot of things missing. BUT one of it's greatest features and at the same time the thing that makes it's early stage of development toleralbe is the vehicle/weapons/item creation feature which makes the game worth your time if you enjoy designing stuff. The iteam creation system is not very complicated, it could use a more improved tutorial that spoonfeeds you the basics, but you can find some of these tutorials on youtube. The devs keep in touch with the players and while they are not as open as I'd like regarding to the patch content and release dates. However the steady amount of content does not give me the feeling they will leave their fans hanging and leave with their money, like other games I won't name.Bottom line, if you like what this game is and what it's aiming to be, then show your support and buy it.

								I think this game has sooooo much potential. It is already very playable for an ""ALPHA"". The whole idea of an alpha is to support EARLY developement of a game. The feature set and future vision they have for it is pretty amazing. So as an alpha backer I will TEST the game as it stands in developement and give feedback on bugs, game play and maybe what i would like to see. Awesome job guys keep up the good work. I will update this review in the future as the updates roll out.			"

								What a great game. About ten hours in I started to get the hang of making things with the creation editor. About twenty hours in I started in on building a base. It's not your average sandbox and provides excellent tools for completely customizing everything you pilot and live in. I would strongly suggest this game to anyone who likes role playing games and sandboxes. I can't wait to start building my helicopter. :)			"

								This is one of the best Alpha game,Thats I have ever played.I had read that they worked on this game for 2 years and boy didnt they work hard on this game.They still are working hard and by the looks of it they update every week.which is fantastic.Not only the updates are good,They have worked hard on every aspect of this game.Such as the Monster creation,I have never seen so many weird and beautiful animals.Some looks so dangerouse and some look very cute,but watch out for the cute ones they are fast and deadly I tell you!!!The animation isnt that bad at all you do get your moneys worth.There are so many things to make,like vehicles,  build your own base ,wepons ,dig ( yes you can dig) for iron copper ,Tin , you can alos plant and grow food,Which is amazing.You not only can make your own items but you can buy and sell from NCPS to.Not only that you have diffrent game modes to, like single player and multiplayer.but withing those game modes are more game modes,for example ,Single player has explore mode ,story mode and build mode.I have payed for a lot of early access games and this is by fare the best.I am so thrilled that I got this game at the price that it is set at, this game is worth much more,If you buy this game now you are getting the best game deal ever.I could and will type all of the cons about this game but Im afraid there isnt enough room.I would suggest you buy this game if you like these games.Monster Hunter Minecraft Skyrim Borderlands 2Rust (Planet explorers is much better that rust I tell you )I garantee you will not be disapointed with this game.

								You start crash landed on an uninhabited planet with nothing. In the first hour you dig and find doctor bro. 2nd hour he gives you blueprints to a sword, pickaxe, things like that, 3rd hour you spend mining a bunch of ore for a lady who wants you to build some turret to protect yourself from the mostly nonhostile wildlife, and a gun, which can be used to kill the nohostile wildlife. Then you learn to make your own guns. At this point I took a sidestep from the quests, and decided to settle on this planet like my forefathers settled 'Merica, by killing everything in sight. A little down the road I find that the planet is in fact inhabited by intelligent life, and I kill them too, because 'Merica. 10/10			"

								I've really only scratched the surface with about 20 hours in at this point,  but so far Planet Explorers is one of the best building (voxel) and adventure games I've had the joy of playing.   There are lots of elements of other games in here, and I think this game is going in a great direction.  Before you get into specifics if you're wondering if this game is playable and worth an early access purchase:   YES this game is completely playable,  its fun, it has a lot of stuff for you to do, and is one of the best sandboxes I've ever played.That being said here are some points I've noticed so far.The graphics are pretty good, and it runs like a dream on my (somewhat) aging laptop.  Performace is 25 FPS easy even on high load.  I've only played the adventure mode,  but there are some quests - most of them pretty basic.  Collect and kill mostly.The animals seem to be fairly varied,  as well as the attacks they do.The crafting is really great,  though the creation system could use a slightly better tutorial.  In fact most things could use a better tutorial -- but this is an early access game.  There is probably a lot more I can go into detail about,  though I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, but plan on it soon.  I can't wait for the next update.			"

								As i play quite a few open world sandbox games of my own ( like minecraft, rust, terraria etc) i must say that this has some flaws. Gathering/mining takes a while and even with better tools equipped i didn't find it to go that much faster at all.The crafting system was a nice idea but too complicated, so i wouldn't say it's easy to do. With that said, I didn't play the game for that long until i noticed that it wasn't as fun as i thought it would.I guess with alot of work i may play it again, i don't know. until then, this game is not worth 20£.

Though the game surprised me with its beautiful textures and lighting effects... that was not what caught my eye. Instead, the ability to create on a 3D platform and let your imagination run wild stunned me. This game will hold ,as proclaimed to the title, many adventures to be explored for you and your friends. I highly recommened this game to anyone whom seeks hours of fun and creativity.			"

								The game could be so much than what it currently is. It needs more biomes, a better engine that doesnt crash evey 3 hours (sometomes less), and more stuff to do in story mode. I really love this game as you can craft your very own vehicles and use them! Nothing better than barreling down on some unsupecting critter with your attack chopper. Great game just needs some bugs worked out and more content. Also, it is possible to get stuck on some quests and you usually can solve this with a previous save (save every so often, i.e. before you start a quest).			"

												If any of the following appeals to you, then get this game - if any annoys you, then I guess don't get it? - Huge planet to explore with interesting fauna and flora- A story that is interesting (so far, not finished yet) and works with the open world survival crafting game- Vehicles - land, air, sea - and you can very freely create your own from scratch - flying around in your own helicopter is pretty cool- Build colonies and have your slaves... eh, colonists, work for you!- Build monorails across the world that drive along lines you create on a schedule (seriously cool)- Progression á la Minecraft from wooden, over iron, to diamond (really weird but it kinda works)I have Kickstarted this game way back and been skeptical at first since the development took very long and it was very clunky and buggy at first - but it's a great game now and I'm glad to have it.

								This is a very fun game, and feels very complete despite being in Early Access.  A few little bugs here and there don't stop you from having heaps of fun with this one.  Highly recommended if you are into the explore/build/survival genre.The only bad things I can think of is the music score of the grasslands area which can get a little repetitive after a while.  Multiplay is also bit iffy (we could not get our map saved if we both logged off) but I am confident that will be fixed; the devs are quite engaging with the community. (and the music, you can turn off :p)Now the good things, I can think of many.  You can explore some gorgeous locations, the main story line is quite engaging and breadcrumbs your way nicely through the world, the crafting/building is really fun; ISO designing can be a little clunky at first until you learn the design tools, once you do you'll never stop as it's that addictive!This is one of those few Early Access games that make the whole Early Access ""thing"" worth it.

								Amazing game and hard to believe this is Early Access! Updates come regularly and well worth getting into this!-update-This was originally a review made back shortly after its release to Steam. I have no idea why it says that it was written in May of this year. Steam Glitch...Please remember, this game is NOT final. There are some things in the game that the Devs have said in the past will likely NOT be in the final game. Lately (May period of 2015) the communication from the Devs have slowed down with delays of their latest release but don't sweat it. They have been giving us regular updates of the progress to this release even if it isn't very wordy. It has been enough to let us know they haven't abandoned this like some are thinking. TOO much effort in the past has been shown to prove this is a project they will see until it is finished. No, contrary to Gully's belief I am not paid in any way to say any of this. This is simply how I feel about this game. Well written, regular updates (and have been), Devs have been giving communication updates even if they are brief of what is going on.The Forums here are not the best to find answers and such. Go to Pathea's website and to their community forums. There you will find basic help in the general section, advanced help in the ISO creation and sharing section, Bug reports (remember this is EARLY ACCESS not even BETA) where you can and PLEASE DO report any bugs or add to any reports of bugs you have so it helps them track down the complex bugs, and simply other unrelated chat as well. The Devs don't often respond in the forums but it has been proven they do read them as some changes in the game came from the suggestion forums and simply discussions between groups of players in the general chat.

												I've had this game for ages now, possibly before steam.  I'm not sure where I got it fist.  Perhaps Desura?Anyway, this is a very interesting game.  I've only ever really played the story mission recently but previously the adventure mode was pretty lacking.  this may have been addressed.Probably the best thing about this game is that it's a fairly unique experience.  I guess if you gave minecraft a plot it would be this game.  It's fun to explore and the creatures are unique and challenging.  Probably what makes it stand apart is that this is a RPG where you build your own town and your own vehicles.  I can imagine a lot of people would go nuts with this but I found it a bit tiring.  Just give me some pre-fab stuff so I can get on with it.  Thankfully this does seem to be the case and I'm sure there are mods to add some interesting designs without needing to sink time into their design.That's not to say that it doesn't have any flaws.  The inventory management seems to be completely absent so as a result you hae limitless slots and no weight limit.  So you just keep everything you find, which is a lot.  I think I'm carrying around about 5k dirt blocks atm which are about 1 meter cube each. As you can probably imagine this throws the economy into disarray.  Meat is the currency (I guess because it's a survival game?) but it never goes off and is quite plentiful.  There is no levelling or experience so quests just seem to keep the plot rolling along.  Yeah, there are rewards but you can just buy them for meat from the NPC as soon as you meet, so these feel largely pointless.  The more I think about it it just seems that this game is ment to be played in sandbox mode because the plot, while interesting seems fairly tacked on.Combat feels a bit cluinky and relies on what feels like aut-targetting for melee and using a ranged weapon puts you into an locked in over the shoulder mode ala Resident Evil.  They're not terribe, but it's not revolutionary either.While these sound fairly critical I still had fun with it and I suspect that the sandbox mode is the more interesting mode over the story.			"

								*This review is based off an older version, around .72 alpha buildFirst off. Let me start with performance.I do not lag on this game on any settings and with my computer underclocked. And it still looks wonderful.Let me restate that,.... Space Engineers(on any world older than a day), Minecraft(for most people), 7 days to die, + any other game you can think of that is voxel based..... Planet Explorers not only looks better, but handles better.Nuff said.Music/sound: needs more variety if they are still on the same tracks as the last version I played. But for what they do have, the music is refreshing and fits right in. It is not intrusive at all. Sound had wierd glitches here and there, but stuff that was actively getting fixed and nothing that really stood out.animation/combat: I am clumping these two together for a reason,... they are closely tied for the trouble parts. Overall its pretty good, both the animation and the combat. But something about combat makes me feel more like I am aiming for hit boxes and not an actual entity. I do not like this in the slightest, so even tho I would like to be a melee combatant, I feel forced into ranged combat because of this.*I believe theres been some changes to combat that may effect my opinion on this, I will change my review to reflect more recent versions as I play them*Scenery: Yes, this one warrants its own section. The landscape of Planet Explorers is beautiful. And the variety of foliage(trees, grass, bushes, flowers) is beyond what any other game I have played has attemptedCreatures: Again, something that I might not have commented on in any other game... Planet Explorers creature deserve a mention. The variety and detail put into the creatures is astonishing. And they keep adding more! I did 3 'Main' playthroughs of the storymode for this game before the last version- and EVERY time there was more creatures that I hadnt seen before! Someone in their department is pumping them out, and I am loving it!Story: The story is actually pretty good if you pay attension to what is going on(i.e. dont skip thru text)The presentation certainly is not winning any awards, but as far as I am concerned, it doesn't have to. What is nice here is that in storymode(singleplayer), the story is not shoved down your throat. You are free to pursue the story, or do your own thing.Survival Aspect: This is a survival game after all, and thats what most of us(or at least me) come to do. And I must say that on the version I played, I wasnt as impressed as I hoped. It felt like survival was optional, and that should never be the case in a survival game. I don't know if that makes any sense, but... not hardcore enough for me? maybe.Good news is I heard there is an editor thing planned that from what details I heard, will definately be able to accomidate anything I feel is missing here.Developers: This one is of special note. I have never before PE seen a head of development for a game interact with the community, on a near daily basis. Furthermore, in the time I spent observing and partaking in the forums I have not seen so much straightforwardness and honestly from developers. This is both commendable and heartwarming. I will not provide examples, as they stand on the forums for all to see.Also, it is easy to tell these developers actually care about their game.Summary: It's a great game and only getting better,... I couldn't recommend it more. If still in doubt, try out the demo. I insist! Do the storymode first... the other modes are farther behind and don't accurately represent what the dev's are trying to accomplish.**Note: I will update this review as I play newer versions.... anything here will likely change for the better.

								This game could use some work but aside from the occasional bugs and glitches, It's not that bad for an early access game. I mean HECK! I'd go ahead and say that this game is BRILLIANT for an early access game!The single-player mode is fun but it does take a long time to get around so I recommend getting some supplies fast and building a vehicle if you want to explore.The Co-Op is in a sense more fun than single player but is a little glitchier than the forementioned.Honestly I had more fun just exploring and finding all the wierd aliens I could! My favourite landscape or biome would need to be the the canyon area but all the different landscapes combine well and feel quite natural; The creatures on the otherhand are by far my favourite aspect of the game!The amount of animals is amazing, with the sizes ranging from the tiny Vulpes Haola to the the enormous Testudo Mariturtle.The best ai would probably be the unnamed cliff lizard thing in the canyon biome, It took me Four hours to find just one and even the the ai got the best of me....

								Looking at this game from the perspective of a single player sci-fi campaign, it's looking worth the money. Now that the game has had a few iterations in the beta developement phase, the story mode seems far more playable and less buggy. From what they've said in their update notes, I'd venture to say the story mode is more or less finished. May still be a few problems to work out with their Intro/Tutorial though.I have had this game for about a year and I've played a bit in the Multi-Player Adventure mode. In the past there wasn't much progression to the Adventure story, but it seems that they have plans to change that. They had done something with their random terrain generator that created lots of ugly ridges in the landscape, which are very difficult to navigate with wheeled vehicles. I need to take another look at Adventure mode, but I'm waiting on further updates. So at this moment I can't really comment on their random generated Adventure mode.I feel that the interface and control setup takes a bit of getting used to, but once you get the hang of the controls it's pretty easy to play the game. I'm not well skilled at using 3D modeling software tools, but it's really not too difficult to learn the basics of the Creation tool in order to quickly create simple vehicles. Very elaborate designs are possible, and I've seen many examples of player created ISO's for this game. I do expect that there will be some Steam Workshop content available in the future.Altogether I think that Planet Explorers is shaping up as a good buy.			"

								I have really enjoyed Planet Explorers so far. I know its still in early access but I have been able to do so much and have yet to hit a point where I cant do anything else. The construction and building modess are awesome. you can literally make anything your mind can envision. I highly recomend this games and I cant wait to see what else they have in store for us!!

								This is a great game from an invading alien perspective! So far the storyline has progressed nicely and really helps in understanding ""replication"" or crafting. The variety of block shapes and decorations for building really gets the creativity flowing, though if that isn't enough, design your own weapons, armor, turrets, vehicles, aircraft, and watercraft! Build a colony, recruit NPCs, defend your colony or design it to defend itself. If you like survival games and plenty of complexity, I highly advise you grab this game!			"

								If you like to explore and build (like minecraft) but in a more realistic style. I'd strongly recommend this game, it has a futuristic feel and for the right reasons! If you get this game give me a call and we can explore together!			"

								Problem with the Linux client, in case your character instantly dies when entering the world, and instantly dies again after revive, put this in startup options (without the quotes):""LC_ALL=en_US.utf8 %command%""It turns out there is no OpenCL hardware support for Mac and Linux Ubuntu(*), which means really terrible performance unfortunately.(*) Apparently due to broken nvidia 331 proprietary driver. In order to fix this, you might have some luck with this approach (in the order mentioned below):- apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit- apt-get install ocl-icd-opencl-dev- reboot- revert to ""legacy 304 proprietary driver"" from nvidia- rebootUse at your own risk, the driver is outdated and might break other games, your cat might choke and the antichrist make his appearance. If it does work and none of the above happens, it does run very well.Kinda on the fence with this one due to the many hoops I had to jump to get it to run properly, still thumbs up, as it is a beautiful game and kinda sticks out of the whole sandbox crafting openworld somewhatminecraftish crowd.Now, the terrain (and terrain manipulation) in this one is really well done, is is actually quite fun digging a cave and putting stuff in there.So are the characters, they have a very unique touch to them.The crafting also appears to be a rather unique approach, havent had time to check it out in-depth yet though.

Early Access Review
								Of all the sandbox early access games on Steam, this seems so far the most promising. And indeed, the most complete ~ *cough* DayZ *cough*I was entirely taken aback by the MMORPG-like feel from the get go, and it initially made me weary. It took exactly five minutes to forget any of that, thanks to the addictive harvesting, mining, building and just generally extremely well-done crafting in this game. This game so far has *the* best customization that I have seen, and knocks Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri and Galactic Civilizations 2 down from their previously shared throne in this aspect IMO.The parallells to Minecraft are also subdued - thankfully.Apart from The Secret World, I don't think I've ever been more immersed in an over-the-shoulder perspective game. Sure, the music is mostly licenseware, the voice acting sounds like a school class project, and some textures are extremely flat; but I find myself ignoring a lot of what would otherwise be real annoyances for me because of the overall charm this game has.Probably the main strength this game has is the authentic-feeling world. Multiplayer has some procedural niggles that I hope will be gone after alpha, but the single player (and selectable in multiplayer) ""canon"" world quite possibly is the most authentic, immersive ""alien looking"" world I've seen since The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. And to be sure, Planet Explorer's flora and fauna has a lot in common with Morrowind, to the point that it feels like an homage, if a slightly more colourful one.There are a few things left to really fix for me to give this top marks. For example, I feel the multiplayer progression is way too fast compared to the single player, and people will get easily burnt out if they start out with multiplayer first. PLAY SINGLE PLAYER FIRST! The music is repetitive, and I hope a placeholder - but the choice of music, even if it's sparse, at least was a good one. Voice acting is campy and of low technical and artistic quality - which is kind of charming, actually. And I don't think many care in this sort of game. Also, I wish harvesting, woodcutting and mining were a bit more agile. Currently, herbs have too small ""pick up zones"" where you have to stand realllllllllyyyy close to the center, the woodcutting is tedious because you have to hold down the right mousebutton, sometimes for MINUTES if it's a big tree, and finally the mining animation is slow as heck and hard to abort to precision mine.Lots of minor issues, no major issues - except one:Most of all the dedicated server launcher could use a lot of work, and the parameters the worlds is created from need to be expanded. For example drop rate. Well... ESPECIALLY drop rate. Ha. Current default multiplayer servers will let you get full steel armour and a helicopter within 2 hours. AWFUL. But hey, it's alpha.			"

								There's always the impulse to compare it to certain other sandbox games... but I don't know how. Planet Explorers plays like an RPG, crafting game, exploration, adventure, even a 3D modelling program!* It's like Elements: You start with initial resources like plants and minerals, and can craft new technologies & accessories.* It's like an RPG: Beautiful open world, small & large enemies, Obtain missions by talking to NPC's, some of which can join your party and eventually your colony (city)! They will fight with you & you can equip them with weapons, armors, items, or just give them stuff to carry.* It's a sandbox: make tools to help you dig out the world. Search for ore deposits using your 3D scanner then use them to construct just about anything! (not player-designed clothing)* It's 3D modelling software: Construct swords, shields, guns, land/sea/air vehicles, or just decoration objects like stairs, utilities, household, really anything you can think of!Custom models are inserted into the game like this: If you have the resources required to build it, they will automatically be removed from your inventory and the object will appear. You can interact with it or pick it up anytime that you are next to it. An 'approved' build that has been picked up may be reused until it is destroyed; once it's built, it's built.I have spent over 10 hours on Story mode so far and I have only just built my first car. I have leather armor, sword & shield, bow & rifle. My 2 followers have Steel armor & swords; they 'tank' while I shoot. I have barely explored the south-central part of the island. There are videos of immense constructs and firepower, enemies and adventure. I have only barely begun, and I am very much addicted :).			"

												This game couldn't pull me in. I feel like it had a lot of great qualities and some interesting ideas but something about it didn't quite do it for me. I really enjoyed the crafting system and thought that was really well done. Collecting materials wasn't bad either. The quests were not great, and a few of them were broken. I just didn't really find the questing all that interesting.  "

								Man,Absolute Thumbs Up. I don't know how you did it, but this thing has me soooooo hooked. More so than any game I have played in ages. As a senior gamer, I don't find many games any more that make me want to skip all required housework and play, play play, but this one has. I love it.  Yes it's alpha and its buggy but that's why it's in alpha :-)I particularly like the mining mechanic, being able to see the mineral you are after in the walls and dig them out following the veins  just make it so much more interesting.And the inventions.... oh man talk about the contraptions I have tried to build, most of which defy physics and of course don't really work but that's the  point. My primitive car is used the most. "

								NOTE:  Review will change if they fix things.  However, I'm writing this review because things have been too rough and unfinished for too long.  Especially the game breaking bug for if you have anything plugged in other than keyboard + mouse.------------------------------Extremely, *extremely* buggy, even for an early access title.If you have any controller plugged in, or use vJoy or any head tracking, you have to disable them from the device manager before you load up the game.  There are no options to disable controllers or joysitcks ingame at this time.If you don't disable your peripherals, the camera will bug out and spin around your characters feet, making the game unplayable.If you DO disable them and try to generate a world to play in, the world is very buggy.  Your character can run through objects in the starting village, and can run up and down sheer cliffs.It doesn't feel like a sandbox game like Minecraft or Kerbal Space Program.  It feels like a very, very shoddy MMORPG that you play on your own.  Especially the combat system.			"

												I can clearly recommend, after a long waiting time and some play ons (i didnt want to go trough the story and/or the sandbox posibilitys without the game to be released) to buy this game.Sure, ~23€ seems like a big prize, compared to other indie games.But if you bought NMS, you shouldnt try to use ur thinking ability, instead listen.Vehicle and Weapon ""customizeability""-or better said, build them however u want, in which paint you want, out of the materials you want.A nice and heartfully storyline.The only thing i would still want would be workshop support for all the modders out there, because with the ability to mod this game, it would have even more great potential.So if ur just the standart CoD or LoL gamer, this game is not for you.You couldnt handle it.For everyone else: welcome :)			"

												Planet explorers is a mix of GTA and Terraria, with added features that makes it quite compelling. For example, it has an awesome basebuilding/colony feature and you can design your own vehicles/weapons/armor. The beginning is a littebit unwieldy, but you are rewarded with a huge range of things to do, if you get the hang of it. Youtube tutorials are your friend on this one. The ability to create your own vehicles/weapons/armor is quite unique and the workshop is brimming with creations that you can use. Special praise: You can build a monorail! Although, that is more of a Shelbyville feature.The music and story of the campaign are solid. The multiplayer mode has not been tested, but IF bug-free, it could be awesome.In a nutshell: I like this game enough to write a review, although I disdain writing reviews. I am not sorry that this review reads like the research article I should have written instead.			"

								When I first bought and played Planet Explorers over 2 years ago, I loved it and couldn't wait to see how it evolved.All this time later and the A09 update they have talked baout for so long finally happens, so I give it another 3 weeks and several updates to make sure things are ironed out okay before going back. Its terrible. Single player is worse than it was 2 years ago in some way and only marginally better in other ways, and trying to play any mode with a friend is still the buggy waste of time it was 2 years ago.The newly added co-op story mode I was excited to finally play with a friend was too broken to play too. At this point, there are simply lots of better games to choose from that are actually going somehwere. Planet explorers has taken FAR too long to do far too little, and at this point it shouldnt cost what it does anymore. Its a real shame, but I don't see this game ever being done. if it ever is though, it won't even matter anymore.Too little too late. Its a shame the game still has the misleading mostly positive reviews just because of the great reception it got years ago. Most of those should be negative now but I believe those players that had hope then gave up long ago and never even came back to say so.			"

								I've just spent a couple of nights enjoying the heck out of this game, in Story Mode. It is much improved since the earlier versions, to the point where it's very playable, and quite fun. I've built myself a 4x4 with a turret on the top.. it weighs 17 tonnes and is made of steel, but gets along like a rocket.IMO, this game is what Landmark should have been.. so kudos for the devs!It's not all sunshine though, the animations are quite clunky still, the jump is very floaty and slow and some of the combat is quite annoying (no matter what armor I wear, weapons I use etc.. still get killed in three hits.. not even sure blocking with my shield does anything except look pretty).

								This isn't a bad game. I just didn't find myself getting into it, or liking it. I want to like it, but it just didn't do it for me. I understand this is an alpha, but as it is, I cannot recommend it.First off, it is pretty demanding, hardware-wise. I have a 1900x1200 monitor, and had to launch it at 1280x800 to run it at a playable framerate. It is an alpha, though, so I don't know if that counts.Anyway, I found the combat klunky, and that combined with the fact that the story isn't exactly the most engrossing story ever weaved, ruined the story mode for me. Survival was fun for a few hours, but didn't grab me. You can create cool stuff in the mode where you have unlimited resources, but again, didn't grab me.I don't want to write a bad review, but in it's state, there are much better Early Access games out there. Don't bother.			"

								Difficult learning curve, lack of proper tutorial and incredible difficult controls in order to play effectively. The learning curve is too steep, and without a proper tutorial you find yourself stopping the game and checking the hotkeys in order to find out the workings of the game. Difficult to steer the camera and operate your character. Gathering resources is difficult as well, your character attacks more, and it´s overall an frustrating experience. The game could show promise if you manage to get past these things, or get used to it, but overall it made my experience very unenjoyable.The gameplay mechanics definatelty need a great deal of work, to make more user friendly. But as it is now, i don´t feel like i can recommend it to others.			"

By doing this, those player who can afford buying descent monitor, won't have to hurt their neck at the same time as the map is to small compare with the rest of the game picture on the screen.b} mission marker, please find a way to select 1 mission marker at the time instead going through those headache mission selection on the right side. sure you can make those mission marker is dissapear by clicking on menu-mission-and uncheck eye indicator on any mission you not wish to do just yet.others minor had been said enough by other players.

								I know this is early access and so I will treat it as such in my review.  Right now I cannot recommend this to all but the most die hard EA players that must try everything before they are released.  I'll be brief as I can.  There are some positives about this game but in a nutshell it's not ready yet for me to give it a full thumbs up.  Wish Steam had a way to give 1 to 5 stars.  If this were a star rating I'd give it a 3 for now. It seems like it has a lot of potential.  The graphics, while a bit simple, are attractive enough, in a cute, and cartoony way.  If that look is something that appeals to you it will fit in just fine.  I don't mind that aspect but just pointing that out.  Which brings me to the first downside.  with the simplified graphics, i don't understand with a very capable gaming computer like I have, why it has stutter, quite frequently.  I would say every 20 to 30 seconds the game stutters for a moment and although it's not game breaking it is quite annoying.  The positives from my prior game plays (where I played quite a bit more time back weeks ago) I like:  the gathering, build mode and craft-heaviness of the game at least early on.  The combat could use some polish along with the gathering aspects.  The tutorial or beginning doesn't tell you much about how to do things and although I don't want hand holding for every little thing, it would be nice for the basics like how to open the replicator.  Basics like this, I know you can find in help but I will venture to guess that most players don't like to spend their early minutes in a game looking up how to do all the basic stuff.  Again, this game could be good once all details are worked out, and I will keep an eye out but for now I cannot recommend it.			"

								Walking Simulator 2014!OK It's really a great game! But...Story mode - You can't really stop and play in a different style (like they said you can build base and farm,etc). You need hours of walking missions to get the scripts for the base. When you finally get them you are across the map and your next walking mission will be much closer. So you will go and try it. But if you start it you can't really stop (follow missions) and you had to fight huge enemies with your basic equipment because the game DIDNT give you TIME to rest and enjoy the world.Adventure - Awesome!Multiplayer - Even more awesome! And It seems like will be even better.So the game is great, the story mode is really annoying. Like a 20+ hours tutorials and after 10 hours you figure out you had nothing to kill big things...OH and watch out for saving!! Well for me but the autosave option didnt working very well... :/ And you will need your save files for sure!:)			"

								I played this for a few days as I got completely lost in the awesomely designed world. If you like exploration and get a nice vibe from hard-sci-fi-ish stuff, then this is for you. I like that it has a story and characters and that it's not all procedurally generated.However, there are problems. Why, in a sci-fi game, do we still have to craft wooden pickaxes, axes, shovels, etc, like in Minecraft? The main problems with this game are the hold-overs from the Minecraft formula. They don't find whatsoever in this game. Just give me a laser cutter or something like that. It's just silly crafting wooden, bronze, iron, etc tools. The feeling of mystery was also a bit ruined for me when, while exploring, I ran into a huge fortress with hostile aliens, but upon my return to the camp where the other colonists none of them acknowledged the discovery - immersion breaking. There are some great ideas here and the technical implementation is great. It looks amazing and the voxel engine works very well. I'm pretty sure I could do without the mining and things, however, and there should be some careful constraints on the pacing for the game if there is to be a cohesive story. Overally I recommend it because I had fun playing it, but obviously it still needs a lot of work as it's still in Alpha.			"

								Fantastic.  It's only in Alpha but I'm already having far more fun then I ever did in MineCraft.  You can only compare the games so far as minecraft was almost meant to be genious in simplicity, but this game has so much to offer with exploring and building and crafting and designing and I love it.

								I bought this game before it was on Steam, I purchased it because it reminded me a lot of Phantasy Star Online. Even though it's in Alpha I've enjoyed it a lot more! There are a few bugs at the moment (When using Vehicles sound goes and comes back when you exit them) but they are tolerable for now. They work on the game a lot adding new features and enemies, it's definitely a game to get, you can build structures, completely create your own vehicles and weapons/gear. It's a really good game to help support, check out some Youtube videos if you're not entirely sure but I'd definitely recommend it!			"

								Dug a hole , found lots of marble , iron , copper.  Found some guy to talk to and got some prints that allowed me to make stone pick axe and sword and stuff. Explored far areas and found huge wierd looking monsters some aggressive that chased me and some kind.  Controls and switching items seemed a little difficult but once used it it's pretty cool.  Im into this game its not like many I ever seens , plus I like building stuff , chopping trees , getting materials and making tools and weapons. Quite a adventure and it's worth the price. Also like how there multi player is setup so it's easy to play with others.			"

								While not without bugs, the current game is a surprisingly complete offering for an 'alpha'.  The ability to create vehicles (land and air) as well as melee / firearm weapons adds an extra layer of fun on top of an already satisfying journey.The world works seamlessly, aside from a few bugs in the later game, and the detail put into the dialogue is perhaps the most telling of the passion the creators are putting into this product.  This has been one of the rare games I have paid the full asking price for in several months, and I feel it is worth every buck.			"

								I've been saying for a while that my perfect game would be a cross between Skyrim and Minecraft:  I want big, beautiful graphics, quests and plenty of monsters to kill, and an open world I can dig up in 3D to build my house brick-by-brick.  And I have to say that so far Planet Explorers is already coming pretty close!  I love the planet's megafauna and that there's a predator/prey system in place.  I love that plants apparently have a life cycle.  And the premise of the story is just fantastic.  (Did I mention how much I love that a sandbox game has an actual story?)And there's a Thing editor.  Vehicles, swords, shields, random arts and crafts:  THINGS.  I honestly didn't expect to like it, because I'm not what you'd call an architect, or an engineer.  And then I built this car.  It was an awful car, but the next one I built was twice as awesome in half the time.  And then I built a helicopter.  A helicopter, okay?  It was magic.  (Okay, it was awful.  But the ability to make a helicopter?  THAT was magic.)Yes, the game still has its issues; it's in alpha after all, so that's to be expected.  In A0.82, farming is a little iffy (I suggest you start with a 5x5 plot of non-organic and work your way up from there) and I've had some crashing problems, but the answer to this is so simple I've actually played through until there are no more quests at present to play, my base is complete, and I have all the things.  In a nutshell:  save religiously.  Once I got out of the habit of relying on autosave, I was golden.Tl;dr:  this is an awesome game for many, many reasons, only requiring a modicum of patience, and will only get better.			"

								With gorgeous visuals, solid gameplay and an eerie, engrossing atmosphere, Planet explorers is an adventure I urge you to undertake!The story mode is the best part of the game in my opinion which says a lot considering sandbox/open world games are usually more fun to just mess with in free play. The characters are believable and the whole world feels alive and detailed.To be fair, there are a few issues in places but they're mostly minor. No game breakers so far!I'd write more but I have to go see what lies out to the west, in the desert. And finish building that buggy. And take out three more of those monsters... and collect more mushrooms...			"

								Having played the free earlier alpha on their website I was certainly impressed enough to buy it to play the latest versions.  There are some changes such as the controls (now you can set your own keys to use), graphical changes and extra modes but the core game hasn't been tampered with which even at this early stage is more playable than some full releases.A sci-fi RPG game with mining and crafting parts but it's not Minecraft so don't come into this thinking you'll be doing the same thing as you were in Minecraft.  For one thing the mining is a bit clumsier and slower.  The crafting side is more powerful but does have a bit of a learning curve to get to grips with in the creation mode where you'll be building vehicles and buildings blueprints.Try the demo first before buying but if you give it a chance you'll probably be smitten.

I haven't hit any game breaking bugs yet, but I also realize it is in early alpha. Having said that, it is well worth the price of admission even in its current state. If this developer keeps getting the support it is getting, then this could turn out to be one hell of a finished product. One of the better alpha releases I have seen. Constant updates and feedback from the Devs as well. If you're on the fence, I say go for it! It will only get better.			"

								Planet Explorers is to Space Engineers what Starbound is to Terraria.  More invironments, more things to do, and more work required by the designers.  Both PE and SE have volumetric destructible environments and player-built square blocks everywhere, which can be destroyed easily by enemies.  But PE tries to have a whole Story (actually a series of linked quests), AI enemies and helpers, and a world-based environment as opposed to asteroids.  Planet Explorers also tries to have you build up a colony.  It also channels a bit of the MMO Calypso, but with a colony that is just starting, rather than well underway.Regards A0.7.5.2:It is Alpha, and Unity based.  Highest graphical settings on OpenGL are not recommended, but DirctX is fine so far.  There is little optimisation as yet, and multiplayer parties should stay together as digging info is not correctly remembered by all clients if they are far apart.  But there is a lot of expectation, and a playable game as it stands.  I just hope that when they say the version number, (currently A0.752, or in the game 0.7.5.2) that they don't stop when the second part reaches 10.  Most basics are there, and now they need QA and more additional stuff regards the world size and colonies.			"

Report the bugs and the Devs will solve those problems for you very quickly.     Planet Explorers seems to be a group of ideas a Development Team has accumulated and assembled into a fantastic game. Having the ability to build your own vehicle and then import it into the game for your character to use once you have the resources is so easy and fun to do and the creature AI is one that a lot of other games need. Being attacked by a pack of carnivores and then watching the survivors flee once they realise you are hard to kill, or not being attacked until they see you adds a new level to the gameplay. Watching carnivores hunt other animals also adds to it. The are a large number of elements in this game and  they are not all there just to make the game difficult for you to play but they do make for a real adventure.			"

								Incredible game, just incredible. I am currently as of writing this only six hours into the story mode, but wow. The graphics are great, it is very well optimized(at least SP, again have not tried online at all),the combat isnt amazing but is still fun,there are ALOT of creatures/aliens that all have different behavioral patterns(i.e. there is a stegosaurous looking guy that travels in packs)that mesh very well togther. The colony feature is also something to shout about. It basically allows you to recruit your fellow colonists once you do some quests for them. This makes hunting in single player much more entertaining and immersive, while adding more strategy as your colonists will only have what you equip them with, including healing items and ammo.Last but certainly not least is the crafting system. On its surface, it appears much like anyother survival crafting(using resources harvested from the world) to create things like wood pickaxe,copper pickaxe ect. However, there is a crafting editor where you can make literally anything you want. For example, I saw a guy that made a laser pistol that looked just like a X-wing,again that was a hand held laser pistol. Anything from weapons, armor, robots, vehicles(land, air and sea) and more.Not only that but you can choose any kind of resource to make any of the parts from, changing the stats of whatever for example a gun made from refined steel will probally do more damage than wood or normal steel.So bottom line, if you are looking for a game that offers you the choice between complete freedom or more structured play style, do yourself a favor and pick this up.p.s.- do yourself a favor and watch a youtube video and not the store page ones, they honestly downplay how great this game really is.

Early Access Review
								UPDATE: I originally reviewed this game in 2014 and that review is below. This game was fantastic. After revisiting the game today I can honestly say it has gotten much much worse over the last two years. To be fair, I did not play the story mode today but the adventure mode which was always my favorite part of the game before is now completely shot. I can't tell you why it's gone wrong, but I can tell you how.1. In-game sound is GONE. There's a random click here and there but ZERO environmental effects or music or anything like that.2. Dialog is AWFUL. Seriously, talking to NPC's in the game is now worse than trying to read a cheap china-made fortune cookie... In chinese.3. Procedural terrain generator is BROKEN. I'm talking completely random giant divots in the ground worse than the potholes on a washed out backcountry road I didn't dare build anything with wheels to try to drive around.4. Framerates have gone straight into the crapper. Somehow, despite adding 12 GB of RAM and upgrading to a much beefier video card since my original review, my framerates are about HALF what they were before.This seems like a classic case of a game being fixed until they broke it. I couldn't even play for an hour before I felt compelled to quit. Any longer and I would probably have gouged my own eyes out. I honestly hope they can fix this game, because it was SO GOOD before. I'll revisit this review at some point in the future and I'd REALLY like to be able to give it a thumbs-up again... But in the current state of the game, I simply can't recommend it. Not anymore. Sorry Pathea... But PLEASE fix this awful mess.Original Review:Get off the fence and buy it. It's totally worth every penny, even now in early access. There are some bugs, but nothing game-breaking, and the playability and amount of content is fantastic. At this point in development it's easy to forget it's still in alpha. Being able to easily create, use, and share equipment and vehicles alone makes it worth it.If you like sandbox games and a sci-fi, survival, or fantasy setting you will love this game. I keep coming back and the dev team keeps impressing me. You can spend hours just hunting creatures, or you can spend hours playing through the story, or you can spend hours designing that next badass sandrail or VTOL. The more you put into the game, the more you'll get out of it. Now buy it and try it. You'll see.One caveat... Read the required system specs before you buy it. They're not BSing. If you can't meet those specs this game will barely run if at all. Not kidding. If you can't get a decent framerate you're going to have a very hard time with this game.			"

								Bought the Game back in May 2014, played it back then with my wife for a good bit had a lot of fun with it in that very early very unpolished form, back then it was more of a sandbox than a game with a story.  If I remember correctly it barely had the NPC in it and the terrain generation back then was terrible to the point of the NPC villages were either generated on sheer cliffs or were clipped into the ground and had to be ""mined out"".  I have only loaded it up a few times since the intial  purchase but i'm really looking forward to a seeing this game hit the ""final"" release version on 11/7.  Will certainly give the game a good play through then with the other people I know that have the game.			"

								The world feels enormous, the NPCs feel like they're made of cardboard.  The animations are chunky, the landscape has white lines in it sometimes, but the sheer number of things you can make is incredible.  Unfortunately, the creator is really tricky to use for the time being.  I'm not sure it would be harder to use 3DSMax at this rate to make my first vehicle.  This is definitely in alpha.  There's no question about it.  A lot of the AI and animations has a lot of polishing left to do, the combat's hilariously clunky, and the 'storyline' isn't terribly well-balanced.  But that said, it's a fantastic start.  There's plenty to do, plenty to build, and lots of frightening spore-creator kinds of creatures to roam about and kill vicariously.  If you want a game that gives you enormous amounts of space and room for creativity, this is it.  All that aside, though, there's a hell of a lot you can do with building up your base and your armaments.  Shields and swords can be custom-designed with the voxel editor.  Buildings can be given lovely cornering and layouts, with plenty of accessories already avaioable for use.  The cars are just that perfect blend of controllable and completely bonkers to drive, making your bouts of ATVing hilarious, wonky, and yet not actually frustrating.  This game picks -way- up once you start getting into vehicles and colony control.  That said, to get the resources needed to get there, you're probably gonna have to look at the wiki.  There are very few veins of certain resources.			"

												I've had this since early alpha and it really is a good experience.  Controls are similar to SWG (hold right click to look while moving with wsad), story is good, the process of building transportation is very interesting but not an easy learning curve.If I had any negative thing to say about the game it is that I've always wished it had a good multi-player/server element.  The times I have tried the online servers, it just didn't feel right for some reason.   The game comes off great as a single player experience, the multi-player not so much but that may be that the community just never got into it.			"

								Great to see the devs still plugging away at this!This game definitely doesn't deserve its currently mixed recent reviews. Sure the game still has a lot of development to do, but honestly having seen the devs work away at it slowly but surely over years now, I can't help but give it a positive review.I think people complaining about the speed of development really need to have a good look at all the game does, and compare it to other games of the genre. There are so many other indie games out there that are kind of similar but aren't tackling the small scale voxels, or nearly the amount of systems available in Planet Explorers.This is definitely a game to watch! That the developers haven't abandoned it yet and continue to develop it really says all that needs to be said.Don't h8 i r8 8/8 no b8 its a gr8 1 m8!			"

However, the current major downfall of this game is the melee combat, its so boring and bland, but they seem to be fixing that.

You can literally terraform the planet with a shovel with the mechanics already in place.  The Devs give you a integrated 3d modeling tool (and a good one at that) to literally create anything you want that functions in game so far without  a hitch.  I can find no design fault with this monster, when the bugs are fixed, AI tweaked and polished this could really be something epic. Buy it, stick with it and pray the devs dont give upUpdate, year or so laterThe developement is at creep, a few changes to crafting system in terms of limitations I dont like, mini nerfs of sorts.

								Who wouldn't recommend this game? o.o';Like for real..? Who wouldn't?.The game is great, and for a price of 22,99.. hell yeah.I've been playing the game for 44 hours so far, and I can't get enough.%Environment-The world itself, feels incredibly smooth. The leaves dancing around, as you walk through the forests.. just awesome.It sort of.. brings the place more to life. It's all about the little things :3And let's not forget the nature..They've done a really good job, since it's set on a different planet, many lightyears away; It'd only be logical to make a new type of nature, instead of the basic trees and flowers we see everywhere.Let's take one of the tree's as an example :D - The C which fell. <- apparently what I call it >:o.Like, it's literally a tree formed as a C, but with both ends in the ground; with a few branches sticking out here n there.I personally haven't seen that one before.And the awesome flowers which again doesn't seem like everyday flowers, but neither too fantasized..Some are quite huge and others are tiny; but they're all pretty well made.For an alpha release, this couldn't possibly get any better.%Characters & Customization-I'm all in for customization and eye candy.. I'm just that type of person.But in this case, it actually doesn't hit me as hard as in other games..The Character Creation System isn't too advanced(at the moment.)But you're still capable of giving your character a personality.Currently there is; -FEMALE-5 Female Face Types.15 Female Hairstyles.(+any colour) (not bad for an alpha, huh?)1 Female Voice.(no menu)1 Body Type. (Though you can colour your skin to almost any colour you want.)And an empty ""Other"" tab(wonder what'll be added here :D)-MALE-4 Male Face Types.11 Male Hairstyles.(+any colour)1 Male Voice.(no menu)1 Body Type. (colour applies here too of course.)And the ""Other"" Tab.-The characters aren't super HD looking in the Char Creator. But in the game itself, they're quite good looking.Plus with the visually shown armor types in-game, you won't need much more :).%Game Modes-For an alpha release, they sure have a lot for us to toy around with....The game currently has three -(+VS Mode online)- game modes in the alpha release;Story Mode (you follow the storyline + free roam..)Adventure(+ VS Mode online) Mode (open world free roaming, where you decide what to do)Build Mode (exactly what it sounds like..)I won't go indepth with the game modes themselves..Though I will say that my favorite mode, is Normal Adventure Mode(non-VS) online.%Creation System-This feature right here... FREAKISHLY AMAZING.It's like an in-game simple to use modelling program.So far it's possible to make:Swords.Pistols.Rifles.Small vehicles.Larger vehicles.Helicopters.VTOLs.Battleships(30x60x28 meters..'if i remember correctly..') (flying ones.. not a boat D:)And Tiny, Medium and Large Objects.And the best part of this feature? you can import your creations right into the game.Well, yes in singleplayer, you might say.. NOPE. The online multiplayer servers have an upload/import function, when you launch the creation system within them.All of the creations require their respective materials to be made though.Engines, metal, sword hilts.. fuel.... etc.All something you have to have in your inventory, before you're able to import your creations.Now, this feature is too big for me to indepth with.It's something you have to toy around with.%Minecraft Comparisons-Here we go.. another minecraft clone. Right? - Oh hell no!!#$@&^This epic piece of work deserves its own place in the spotlight.I don't get why every single game, where crafting and resource gathering is available -has to get compared to Minecraft.. It's truly sad to see the current generation of gamers and casuals..And for some reason, everyone seems to forget that roughly 65% of minecraft is community made.I know of nobody who play Minecraft Vanilla singleplayer/multiplayer anymore.. Nobody..Everyone plays on modified servers which were made by the community..Notch made the base game, we made the rest.%Review-This is only a lite-review.I will do a proper in-depth review of the game, once it has been released in it's 'final' state.Excluding updates of course. Well, perhaps a hotfix or two, after the release. (something always go wrong..)			"

								The world feels enormous, the NPCs feel like they're made of cardboard.  The animations are chunky, the landscape has white lines in it sometimes, but the sheer number of things you can make is incredible.  Unfortunately, the creator is really tricky to use for the time being.  I'm not sure it would be harder to use 3DSMax at this rate to make my first vehicle.  This is definitely in alpha.  There's no question about it.  A lot of the AI and animations has a lot of polishing left to do, the combat's hilariously clunky, and the 'storyline' isn't terribly well-balanced.  But that said, it's a fantastic start.  There's plenty to do, plenty to build, and lots of frightening spore-creator kinds of creatures to roam about and kill vicariously.  If you want a game that gives you enormous amounts of space and room for creativity, this is it.  All that aside, though, there's a hell of a lot you can do with building up your base and your armaments.  Shields and swords can be custom-designed with the voxel editor.  Buildings can be given lovely cornering and layouts, with plenty of accessories already avaioable for use.  The cars are just that perfect blend of controllable and completely bonkers to drive, making your bouts of ATVing hilarious, wonky, and yet not actually frustrating.  This game picks -way- up once you start getting into vehicles and colony control.  That said, to get the resources needed to get there, you're probably gonna have to look at the wiki.  There are very few veins of certain resources.			"

												One of the few sandbox sci-fi games that I truly enjoy playing. The storyline is interesting enough to keep you entertained, while the voxel crafting system is really easy and enjoyable. It feels great to sculpt your own VTOL then fly it around completing quests. Aethestics are really pleasing as well, you do feel like you're in an exotic alien world (with actual things to do unlike NMS), and the music gives the whole experience a very soothing, pleasant feel.Definately worth your money.

												This is almost a very good game.  It took installing it again to remember why I quit playing it.  So, drawbacks first and then what's so great about it.  Drawbacks:If you're not playing in the equivalent of creative mode, so that you have content, then you have two modes: story and adventure.  In story, there are timesinks as you gradually gain access to scripts that allow you to produce better and better items.  But by the time you have a thriving colony, there's nothing left to work toward except the end of the story.  If you play adventure mode, then you bypass all of the grinding because you begin with all scripts.  However, this renders the majority of scripts useless because you'll skip straight to the best items.  This is the better option for exploring and building a colony.  However, the drawback there is that you only get four NPCs and there's no guarantee that any of them will join your colony.  There are reportedly more NPCs out on the map, in many cases, very far from your starting point.  But the map is not infinite, which means that your progress is still capped.  Once you've built up your colony and recruted all the accessible NPCs on the map, there's nothing to work toward.  How to correct these drawbacks:Literally all it needs is a tech tree for story mode and new NPCs that join the map to be recruited in adventure mode.  The tech tree would allow the player to choose what to access first, rather than wander until NPCs with the necessary scripts are discovered.  It would still be a bit of a timesink, but the player would have more control over how that timesink is progressed through, and could prioritize goals.  As it is, later scripts are often found at the same time as earlier scripts, rendering even the explore-to-advance angle pointless (ie, finding the script for a copper bow at the same time as iron bow and pistol).  Having new NPCs wander onto adventure maps would allow for expansion of colonies to encompass the map, providing a long term, ongoing goal of expansion.  What makes this game great:I hate to use the word ""potential"" when it's so close to realizing that potential.  Imagine Rimworld with a RPG built on top of it, where you control a single character directly.  Imagine first person play in that game, with the ability to design custom items and structures to use and share with others.   Imagine skill trees for your colonists, vehicles, and diverse challenges on the map.  I'm clicking ""Yes"" that I recommend this game, but I do so with the wish that we could click a ""Maybe"" option.  The fact is that this game is very close to being something awesome, and at least where adventure mode is concerned, it would be very simple for the developers to realize its potential.  But as of this review, they haven't.  The result is that a rich game leaves you feeling empty, like it could have been so much more, and the simplicity of what it is missing tacks frustration onto that sentiment.Addendum:It may be possible to put something together in the World Editor that would alleviate the adventure mode problem.  Perhaps, for example, a map with enough NPCs that can be recruited to make it worth playing.  The first problem is, the DPI scaling for the World Editor is so horrendous that on a modern 4k screen, it can't even be used.  The second problem is that even World Editor maps are randomly generated, and editing terrain (along with practically all other functionality in the editor) is non-intuitive, slow, and frustrating.  All the reasons you can think of to use a World Editor, are reasons not to use it in this case.  I still think that this game can realize its potential, but I'm disappointed that it hasn't gotten there yet.  In this case, it appears that the developers begin with the assumption that people want to play the game, when instead they should stop and think about what would motivate people to play in the first place and then build on that.

								I thought I had reviewed this already... huh. Anyway this game is in development so there are some UI tweaks and bugs to fix but the core thing itself - is a thing of wonder. You start off wondering what the hell just happened and why the blaze you just crashed a spaceship and don't have any weapons other than, quite literally, a small plastic knife. Pretty soon you're collecting plants, digging, chopping trees, running to or from alien animals, doing busy-body work for various NPCs for 'recipes' for new things to make like armour or weapons or circuit boards.Then you find yourself making a cute little house somewhere and you've built yourself a little aircraft in the shape of something not safe for work, realised that doesn't fly well enough to even get off the ground without flipping upside down, so you then attempt to build something that is both hilarious and practical. You can sculpt a bow out of gold while your companions use lasers because arrows are cheap and then you find yourself on the run from bears that shoot actual fireballs until you realise you can totally just build a little tower to stand on like a boss while you plunk at them with arrows.Then you're building up a small colony and assigning jobs because you've been unofficially made Mayor and thus you build yourself the nicest home while your poor colonists get open space living with as many beds as you can cram into one big room and they're doing your farming for you now and fighting various random animals and running into the ocean shooting alien seagulls and every time you think ""Okay this is everything now"" it keeps getting bigger. So you make another bow in the shape of [censored] that can one shot giant space beetles and realise you haven't even explored the other biomes yet so you make a flying shopping trolley that puts any followers into the baby seat and trolley off to parts unknown. 11/10 would humiliate Rol again.

Early Access Review
								This is a wonderful game and fulfilled all my expectations.  I highly recommend it, because as much fun as I've had with it now, it's only going to get better as the game comes closer and closer to exiting early access.  There are still some bugs to work out, but I wouldn't say they're a major hindrance to enjoying Planet Explorers.I played several hours of the campaign and a bit of the exploration mode.  The mining, crafting, gathering and cooking systems are very solid.  The 3D resource scanner system takes a lot of the guess work out of things, which is very welcome, and the inventory system isn't oppressive with encumberance or backpack limitations.  Upgrading gear between schematics and resource quality was very rewarding and interesting - eventually taking huge chunks of a mountain out at a time felt really good after plinking away at it with a low tier copper pickaxe.The combat has a lot of flexibility and is entirely gear dependent, and if you have the right minerals, you have the best gear.  The follower systems ensures very good balance for most situations.  Multiplayer was a blast, and buildin my own settement was very rewarding.  As was building my own vehicle from a blueprint starting with no template, only key parts.  The game's seeds are not impossibly large, and have a lot going on to the point where you'll never have to trudge for a long distance totally bored, unless you want to just to explore.  Very interesting wildlife designs and behaviors, lots of predator/prey ambient stuff going on that you can watch.  The giant antagonists are rightfully dangerous and intimidating, very challenging but not impossible to overcome with a solid team.I very much enjoy this game.  If I had to complain, I'd say that I wish there was more to the character customization, and some of the storyline quests have some annoying bugs, mostly relating to friendly AI behavior.  The game can be gorgeous in places, but only if you ignore some of the low res, constantly repeating ground textures.  Regardless, I still highly recommend Planet Explorers.			"

I didn't tried every aspect of Planet Explorers yet, but my first impression is a game worth having a closer look. The controls and the gui design is very well done. The complexity of the game is sufficient even for the advanced gamer. Several gamemodes add more fun and prevent you from getting bored. If you ever get bored that is, wich i doubt. A must buy !			"

								The game is already quite a lot of fun in alpha, so if you have cash to spare it's worth the high price tag. There are definitely some glaring issues, mostly combat and small map sizes, but the issues shouldn't be too hard to fix before the full release and when they are it will most likely be the greatest sandbox/exploration/crafting game ever made.I could spend hours just in the gun/sword/vehicle creation tool the game has as well, it's probably the best part of it so far despite having some rough edges.

								To start with I started playing this befor .55 alpha and it has come a long way and still has a way to go and remember this is STILL ALPHA at the time of this review. Where to start first the devs have added 3 zones from the time I started playing and still have more to add with ea area having a feel that makes them stand out. I will warn you stay away from the story as there are buggy spots and this isnt finished and having to restart to get them to work when added lated makes you play through it all again  Learn the ropes of the game and just use the quests to start your self out with that. I have restarted too much but alpha is all ways like that so this is just to warn you not to burn your self out.The build system or what can I fly/drive around or make today system gives this more than just I little jump on any game out there right now. The ISO's (look this up for player made creations and I hope steam workshop soon), has many built for you just to download and add to your game. It ranges from the flyer to ground tanks, fun for every one and new guns, swords, shields you name it, some one has thought up a way to add it in or if you ask they mite add what you want.  With the ISO's just a build file this can be shown or given to any one and you can say hey look what I made today, this = a comunity of builders that will keep this game alive for a long time.Have to say a tryed muti player when it wasnt working in older builds and havent tryed it on newer builds so I wont say anything I have been told it runs better and most problems have been solved.  Alpha build is where you fix problems and they are fixing it, you will have to try this your self.I keep coming back to this game and love its on steam now, so I know when a new build is up. I try new ideas explore and enjoy how this is as close to realism a vox game has come so far, well it still has lasers and cannons and space ships to new planets and .... yea not that real but still fun.

It so far runs real smooth on my system. You can save your game progress and play with friends, you start in a world similar to how you start in survival mode in minecraft, you explore, you collect build and kill big angry monsters before they kill you. Day and Night cycles, the shadows and lights and effects are really nice. It's by no means the best graphics out there but for a voxel based game, its definatly a fun experience!!!

While the story elements aren't very deep yet and a few of the voice overs are a little plain, the game does have some thought out lore which is decent.  Best of all is the wandering, the voxel tech for destroyable and creatable everything and the gathering and crafting systems.  The combat is pretty decent too, especially since I really see it as a side item to the exploring and building elements.  Even in this pre-completion stage I highly recommend this game.

You are often dwarfed by the mountains and lakes, the beasts and the plants that characterise the landscape and there's a lot more to gathering and crafting than just digging until you get lucky and throwing it all together.You can design your own weapons and vehicles, dig vast underground bunkers in a way I've not seen since Red Faction and create structures brick by brick, alone or as part of a team.The price may put some people off but this is as good as ""value for money"" gets.

								Even though it is in early access, it still has many more things in it than other builders do.  You can create vehicles to travel/battle creatures, manage colonies, setup automated defenses and attract monsters to them.  I have been playing this and EQNext.  Neither game is finished, but this game has many more features.  There are some stability issues and it has not been optimized for performance, yet.  So, if you have a low end PC, it may be wise to wait until it releases.Fast forward 2 years, and I'm still hopeful it all comes together.  The crowds are growing turgid with negativity by spewing comments about how much money they have pulled in.  People obviously do not know how much developers and designers cost.  A Jr. Dev, that will work at a much slower pace and produce bugs, starts around $60k/yr.  A Sr. Dev, that should work much quicker and more efficiently has no necessary cap on their costs, but it usually floats around the $100k/yr area.			"

								My first hour of playing the game and I'm impressed with the open world, NPC interaction and the quest system. I’m just starting on the crafting tree, once you learn to click on the scripts then you can replicate items – it’s a breeze. Easier than Minecraft in that you don’t have to select each resource, drag it to the crafting table then craft it. On the Con side the character movement controls – it’s not as immersive as minecraft. I might have missed some control configuration but I’m definitely do not like the way it’s done. I’ll keep playing around with to see if it’s a configuration.  Also chasing down NPC to talk to them and missing them and having to chasing them down again was a pain – funny – but a pain. ;) Overall I would recommend it (if the movement controls can be improved) the game has a lot of potential.

								Space RPG with voxel building minecraft style and the ability to produce weapons and vehicles with the help of modular subsystems like engines, wheels or flight surfaces etc. World feels massive, and is nicely stylised imo.Very enjoyable so far, worth a look			"

								Without a doubt the best game I have played of this genre! It manages to captures the essence of frontier planatery exploration while allows for a very playable game. When they say it's a sandbox game, they mean it. You are not restricted in playstyle and can easily play the game in so many different ways. You can play it like a basic action game, running around and hunting monsters. You can play it like minecraft, building elaborate structures. You can play it almost like spore, creating interesting designs. Or you can even play it like a management game. The wealth of possibilties was something that really took me back.What is most important however, is that it is still an early access game, but it doesn't play much like one. The game feels quite robust and has less bugs and problems than in some post-released games. This does not however, mean there is no work to be done, it is not finished and can only really get better. Would definately recommend this game, absolutely amazing.			"

								The sheer ambition this game has is enough to make it legendary.  Ive never been so entertained just digging holes for some resource.  You can literally terraform the planet with a shovel with the mechanics already in place.  The Devs give you a integrated 3d modeling tool (and a good one at that) to literally create anything you want that functions in game so far without  a hitch.  I can find no design fault with this monster, when the bugs are fixed, AI tweaked and polished this could really be something epic. Buy it, stick with it and pray the devs dont give upUpdate, year or so laterThe developement is at creep, a few changes to crafting system in terms of limitations I dont like, mini nerfs of sorts.  But still the best crafting system integrated into a game to date			"

								Had it for about a week now, and so far the impression is good!First off, the creation system is amazing and to be commended. Honestly it allows for nearly unparalleled design freedom, limited only by the resources available to your character, which to be honest aren't too difficult to obtain. Making vehicles and weapons that you can use in-game without having to mod them in is spectacular, and overall the system is fairly easy to use and understand.The mining is effective, if a bit on the clunky side, as the camera often jumps around or makes it hard to see what you're doing, but it ends up being more a minor annoyance than anything game breaking. If you find it unenjoyable enough you can always skip it by hunting and buying all the resources you need from NPC's with meat.Combat is fun but unfinished, the animations and hit detection aren't the best, especially with melee weapons. It can be hard to tell when you've landed a hit, as the sound effects are placeholder and creatures don't really react much to it. Guns I feel are a lot more effective and fun to use, and hunting is overall a fun part of the game. It just needs work, which apparently it will get in the alpha .8 versions.The controls for the game are all-in-all pretty good. They get the job done, they don't feel too counter-intuitive, and they aren't a big hindrance in most aspects of gameplay. The only negative for me personally when playing was I found it annoying to switch weapons, particularly if you're switching to a sword and shield, because there is no way to scroll through weapons currently you have to assign both to number keys, which means you have to equip both the sword AND shield. With guns it's less of an issue, but it would be nice to be able to scroll through weapons easier, and to be honest if you have a shield it should auto-equip the best one with a sword.The world is definitely one of the best parts of the game, with a HUGE variety in both the flora and fauna, in different parts of each biome, and different biomes. Creatures have basic behaviours, for instance herbivores will form a herd and fend off predators as a group, whereas some predators may hunt in packs. When a creature is wounded it may attempt to run away, and predators will actively hunt prey. They do not eat prey yet, which means you can get free resources if you chase a predator off a carcass, but that may be added in later as well.Each biome also offers different herbs you can collect which have different uses, adding extra incentive to explore (as if the beautiful world with interesting creatures isn't incentive enough), and the various NPC survivors you meet will fill you in on the backstory of the game, including events that happened on earth/mars, and what causes the divide between earthlings and martian settlers.The Quest system is pretty basic; go here, do this, do that, save this person, escort them, collect these resources, etc. Nothing revolutionary, but the rewards make them worth doing I guess, and the backstory is interesting.Build mode (what you use to construct buildings) is overall pretty intuitive and fun, with many different shapes to choose from and ways to place them, you are pretty much limited by your imagination. Want a Dark Tower of Doom? Build it. Want an underwater castle? Build it. Want to live on a mountain, or IN a mountain? Go ahead. The free build mode allows you to place things anywhere you want around your character, which is waaaaay better than the minecraft way of doing things, where you have to move your character everywhere to build things.Crafting is very, very complex and deep, with each component being craftable, and in turn being used to make something even bigger and more complex. You will need to craft the components and have all the resources on you if you are to import a vehicle/weapon from the creation system, which makes perfect sense to me.For an early access game, and especially an alpha, I think it's one of the most polished ones I've played. It's fun, and it has so much potential, I honestly would recommend it if you can see past the few small issues there are and you enjoy exploration, building, hunting, and driving things you design.

Early Access Review
								Who wouldn't recommend this game? o.o';Like for real..? Who wouldn't?.The game is great, and for a price of 22,99.. hell yeah.I've been playing the game for 44 hours so far, and I can't get enough.%Environment-The world itself, feels incredibly smooth. The leaves dancing around, as you walk through the forests.. just awesome.It sort of.. brings the place more to life. It's all about the little things :3And let's not forget the nature..They've done a really good job, since it's set on a different planet, many lightyears away; It'd only be logical to make a new type of nature, instead of the basic trees and flowers we see everywhere.Let's take one of the tree's as an example :D - The C which fell. <- apparently what I call it >:o.Like, it's literally a tree formed as a C, but with both ends in the ground; with a few branches sticking out here n there.I personally haven't seen that one before.And the awesome flowers which again doesn't seem like everyday flowers, but neither too fantasized..Some are quite huge and others are tiny; but they're all pretty well made.For an alpha release, this couldn't possibly get any better.%Characters & Customization-I'm all in for customization and eye candy.. I'm just that type of person.But in this case, it actually doesn't hit me as hard as in other games..The Character Creation System isn't too advanced(at the moment.)But you're still capable of giving your character a personality.Currently there is; -FEMALE-5 Female Face Types.15 Female Hairstyles.(+any colour) (not bad for an alpha, huh?)1 Female Voice.(no menu)1 Body Type. (Though you can colour your skin to almost any colour you want.)And an empty ""Other"" tab(wonder what'll be added here :D)-MALE-4 Male Face Types.11 Male Hairstyles.(+any colour)1 Male Voice.(no menu)1 Body Type. (colour applies here too of course.)And the ""Other"" Tab.-The characters aren't super HD looking in the Char Creator. But in the game itself, they're quite good looking.Plus with the visually shown armor types in-game, you won't need much more :).%Game Modes-For an alpha release, they sure have a lot for us to toy around with....The game currently has three -(+VS Mode online)- game modes in the alpha release;Story Mode (you follow the storyline + free roam..)Adventure(+ VS Mode online) Mode (open world free roaming, where you decide what to do)Build Mode (exactly what it sounds like..)I won't go indepth with the game modes themselves..Though I will say that my favorite mode, is Normal Adventure Mode(non-VS) online.%Creation System-This feature right here... FREAKISHLY AMAZING.It's like an in-game simple to use modelling program.So far it's possible to make:Swords.Pistols.Rifles.Small vehicles.Larger vehicles.Helicopters.VTOLs.Battleships(30x60x28 meters..'if i remember correctly..') (flying ones.. not a boat D:)And Tiny, Medium and Large Objects.And the best part of this feature? you can import your creations right into the game.Well, yes in singleplayer, you might say.. NOPE. The online multiplayer servers have an upload/import function, when you launch the creation system within them.All of the creations require their respective materials to be made though.Engines, metal, sword hilts.. fuel.... etc.All something you have to have in your inventory, before you're able to import your creations.Now, this feature is too big for me to indepth with.It's something you have to toy around with.%Minecraft Comparisons-Here we go.. another minecraft clone. Right? - Oh hell no!!#$@&^This epic piece of work deserves its own place in the spotlight.I don't get why every single game, where crafting and resource gathering is available -has to get compared to Minecraft.. It's truly sad to see the current generation of gamers and casuals..And for some reason, everyone seems to forget that roughly 65% of minecraft is community made.I know of nobody who play Minecraft Vanilla singleplayer/multiplayer anymore.. Nobody..Everyone plays on modified servers which were made by the community..Notch made the base game, we made the rest.%Review-This is only a lite-review.I will do a proper in-depth review of the game, once it has been released in it's 'final' state.Excluding updates of course. Well, perhaps a hotfix or two, after the release. (something always go wrong..)			"

								The voice acting in the campaign is terrible and as of this moment the multiplayer doesn't really work because it doesn't save your world. However, this game shows a lot of promise and I love all the customization. Building your own vehicles is kind of hard, but borrowing other people's designs and modifying them to suit your own taste is pretty enjoyable. Monster hunting, mining, and base building are all fun, too. Good game, can't wait to see it finished :)			"

You can save your game progress and play with friends, you start in a world similar to how you start in survival mode in minecraft, you explore, you collect build and kill big angry monsters before they kill you. Day and Night cycles, the shadows and lights and effects are really nice. It's by no means the best graphics out there but for a voxel based game, its definatly a fun experience!!!

								A sandbox single/multiplayer tailored-story-driven or randomly generated RPG action shooter trader vehicular colony-builder farming mining creating exploring game.Basically, it's the ""everygame"" at long last, and unlike many Early Access games it's not only living up to its promises but far surpassing them!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------But the reason I really love this game isn't its gameplay, it's the incredible story they're weaving with the single player, one of the greatest science fiction tales I've seen!You are one of many colonists heading to planet Maria, a seeminly perfect ""garden"" planet. When entering orbit a mysterious manmade looking object collides with the ship leading to you and many other colonists abandoning ship in escape craft and landing on Maria's southern continent, while the ship has crashed on the northern continent. You then spend the game rounding up survivors, unravelling the secrets of Maria, the possible secrets of the crew, the tensions between the colonists from Earth and Mars, and uncovering some INCREDIBLE vistas and revelations.*Update 29/12/15* The 0.9 build was just released and so much has been improved since I last played back at 0.8.- Movement is now fantastically fluid. A couple of animation issues on certain terrain but nothing you wouldn't expect in a sandbox game.- Melee combat is now actually fun.- MONORAILS!- MORE STORY!- Fantastic improvements to the UI. They've really been putting a lot of thought into it.- Probably a ton of other features, I'll let you know when I've played some more!			"

												This is a pretty good game from what I've heard and what I've seen. Although, if you are like me and use a controller, its not that great. I loved everything about this game when i first saw it in my queue, and when I saw it had partial controller support I was soooooooo happy. Although, its not like actual partial controller support where u can use the controller for combat and use a mouse and keyboard for navigation through the menus and everything else. The controller support is absolute garbage. You can't customize many buttons with key binds, when you move forward you trigger some stupid auto run that can't be disabled, there are only like 3 buttons bound, and no you can't bind the rest of them in the settings. Devs this is an absolute great game, but it does not have partial controller support, please optimize it and make it playable. I'm only talking about the controller support, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic.			"

								This game can be a lot of fun if you like open world crafting type games.  What is particularly unique about it is the cad-cam style crafting interface that theoretically allows you to build anything you want out of your own user-defined shapes and utilizing in-game mechanical and electrical components.  In addition to crafting, there is resource gathering, hunting, enemies to kill, and discovery of new areas on the map.  I would probably play this much more often but as building and harvesting take a lot of time, I have kind of shelved this game until it is a little more updated.  Its a bit of a pain to build something extensive and then have to start over because of patch incompatability.  If you are patient about patches and love these kind of open world survival games, I would recommend this, but I might also suggest waiting for a more complete build.			"

								First impression is pretty incredible. Glorious 3D environments with vibrant flora and fauna sprawling in all directions greet players first thing out of the gate, complete with a skybox full of planets and stars at night. The spirit of adventure takes center-stage, with a massive open world to explore and several modes of travel with more on the way. System to design custom swords and guns is implemented and looks versatile, but seems to require some getting used to, as with the UI for designing and erecting buildings. Running and jumping animations are somewhat clunky, and character customization is minimal for now, but these things are all minor problems surrounding what looks like a game with vast potential. Worth the price tag even during alpha release.In words closer to my typical format; it's the margarita produced if you shoved Phantasy Star Universe, Monster Hunter, and Starbound into a blender with tequila and a bunch of ice.

								If you're looking for a nice sandbox game, this one can be good fun to you. I actually bought it a few days ago and have a playtime of 30 hours, that's more than with some high budget games.Sure, it's an Prerelease but it already contains tons of fun and works very stable for a prerelease. I love building custom cars and flying battleships.I prefer the adventure mode, where you got all recipes but have to gather resources. It has a random world generator, so every game can be different. Story has no random map, but it's a nice world to explore.Building your own colony and inviting NSC to settle there is a great feature, hope this one's get extended further.For my opinion, it is worth the money I spent.

Definitely needs improvement on the soundtrack though. I left it on the title screen one day, and that was the beginning of a story that nearly ended with the phrase ""He then turned the gun on himself.""			"

												I have followed and played the game through many versions since it first came out. The game has always had some bugs in all versions even its current released state, at least the developers still give updates. Game breaking bugs can still happen such as a npc falling through the floor and being unreachable and unable to further the main quests. It is advised to have multiple save files in case something goes wrong. The game also has a lot of back and forth travel between locations at times which gets tedious I don't know why I can't just phone the npc at times. The map is quite large but the story doesn't use much of it and has the player travel sometimes long distances.A very big issue is that the game pages (kickstarter, their website, steam) didn't tell me at any point that this is not a complete game. When you get the end it plays a short cutscene then ""END"" pops up, then a ""To be continued"". That is very disappointing.			"

												So I see a lot of people complaining so I decided to write my own review.                PROS.1. THIS GAME HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY RELEASED!2. This game has fixed so many errors since these people last played.3. You can create your own colony, and even pick up quests from npcs! (Like starbound)4. It has a full length story mode which is really good btw.5. Seems like the creators are still optimizing the game after release for now.6. 60fps on a gtx 960 graphics card, 0 lag.7. I was to setup my own server in less than 5 min after portforwarding (they even tell you what to portforward in game)8. I have 1.4MB/s download (10mbps) and 0.7MB/s upload (5mbps) and my friend who lives 1000 miles away gets 0 lag on my server!9. The whole world can be edited.10. Story mode editor                             Cons1.Adventure Mode let's you skip all the progression unless you use the skill tree on MP2.When building houses you only have 8 blocks to choose from which to me is very limited compared to other games.3.Pulling out your tools to do something appears to be super slow.4.You have stand inside the tree to chop it down.5.If you skip story mode you will be lost on how to make a vehicle!6. Dungeons feel empty.7. Lack of machinery compared to other games like this.8.Super Long Nights on MP            Remember this game is still being updated after release for now and all the crashes and stuff or bad perfomance have been fixed many times over!

												So far I'm overall enjoying this game, but it does have problems. I'm unfinished with the storyline, but other reviewers have covered that, so I won't get too into it. I may change this review after I beat the storyline. I apologize for the fact my review seems more negative than positive, but I am enjoying it more than I'm annoyed with the issues.Pros:- The building system could be refined but is overall easy to work with and building nice structures isn't particularly difficult. I also really dig the custom creation, save for the armor--I would have highly preferred there was a base we could paint over, as the creation method is far too blocky to look normal as clothes. I wanted to make some skimpy armor for my guy that matched the female version, but it sure seems impossible with the tools you're given.- Fighting is a strong point--I really like the combat system, shooting bows and guns is fun, and the difficulty is good. Hunting is enjoyable. The turrets are also nice. The swords are not as enjoyable, and I haven't used them much.- Crafting system is solid and pretty damn expansive. No complaint at all here. Very easy to use.- Resource gathering is painless.- The fast travel system is pretty well done, also, but it does make the motorbikes feel pretty useless.-  I looooove the character creation. Probably a minor detail to most people, though.- The world is gigantic and easy to get lost in. I've spent a lot of time so far just wandering and finding different areas.----Cons:- The armor creation system (mentioned above!)- Enemy animations don't line up well sometimes. I do really enjoy fighting, don't get me wrong, but it does tend to hit you when it looks like it shouldn't and not get hit when it should have. In multiplayer, the other character model is often not where it should be, even though you're playing LAN.- The AI is wonky, both for allies and enemies. It just acts really weird sometimes. I've sometimes fought baddies high up only for them to suddenly jump and kill themselves for no obvious reason, or had someone I was bringing somewhere just...run away, only for the quest to fail because they got attacked. This is somewhat unfrequent, but it happens.- The person who got this for me thought it was still in early access. I didn't know it wasn't until I came to review--it feels like it is. It's clearly a good game, and like I said I am overall enjoying it, but it doesn't feel finished. I'm nervous about the reviews that say the story mode ends abruptly. It looks like they are still developing this game, so hopefully it will still reach this stage.- The fact you have to manually close a server you're hosting with task manager is ridiculous. Not that it's hard, but it's annoying and feels very lazy.- Movement does have some issues. The random rolls and oversteps have killed or hurt me a couple times when I was too high. The ground vehicle movement is very weird, though I have yet to try the other vehicle types. (Will update when/if I do.) The camera controls are actually very easy to control, though.- No way to track other players, afaik :( It's really frustrating to open the map when someone is getting attacked and try to figure out how to get to them. I also really wish there were custom markers you could follow like you can with quests.			"

												I have only played 15 hours and haven't even tried multiplayer, but I wanted to still say what I think of it so far.It's great! It has a plethora of issues but all in all it's really fun to play.It's like Mine Craft or Landmark with actual gameplay. Don't get me wrong, I like both of those games too, but after building my sky castle in Minecraft I just always hit a brick wall. What to do with it? Well Planet Explorers tries to answer that question. It has huge enemies that can attack your settlement. It has quests, characters, weapons, vehicles and all sorts of stuff.I should mention the negative points too though. Well... Everything that I just listed there doesn't work all that great. The game looks like a 10 years old MMO (Star Wars Galaxies comes to mind) and the animations range from ok to horrible. There are many bugs and just weird design choices, can't move while mining? Why?It's really easy to beat pretty much any enemy if you just are patient enough to run in circles and hit them in the back. They are mostly slow and not very smart.Also I recommend you just skip all the parts where the game tries to hold your hand. In the very beginning there is a tutorial that I guess would have gone through everything in excruciating detail. Thankfully there was a door with the word ""EXIT"" just behind me. I ran straight though it and was eternally grateful I did. The game does a good job teaching you the ropes as you go on, the tutorial was really unnecessary.So there you have it. It feels like an unfinished game that has had a very limited budget made by people who had a huge vision. They had a ton of stuff they wanted to put in and not enough resources to actually succeed.Still, somehow they managed to make a game that is definitely worth your while. And just for making a Mine Craft-like game that actually feels like a complete game rather than a fun tech demo is a feat in and of itself.			"

												I'm coming up on 300 hours with Planet Explorers that goes back to mid-alpha.  Most of my time has been spent in Adventure mode where I can roam the open world and do what I want, when I want.  The open sandbox nature of the game melds well with my playstyle.  As a voxel based game, using the Unity 5 engine, you can change the landscape around you.  Dig down to mine for resources, tunnel out a mountain to lay a monorail or flatten the mountaintop.  Map sizes range from an 8x8km map up to a 40x40km map - which seems huge.  The land is populated by creatures that could be docile or hostile - up to you to find out which is which.  There are also NPC factions that may be friendly - or not!  :)To me, the biggest strength of the game is the creation modes.  There are two.  First is the Build mode that allows you to create buildings and bases in the open world.  Choice of blocks is a bit limited to square blocks or others based on a 45° angle.  This means you can, for instance, build a symmetrical octagon but not an equal sided hex.  Addition of 30/60° blocks would open up many more possibilities.  Also, blocks are 'fixed' in orientation.  One face of the block will always face north.  Even with these limitations, people have created some incredible things.The second mode is the Creation mode that allows you to build items from weapons and armor to vehicles that drive or fly.  Orientation of the blocks is somewhat limited here too, but you have more freedom than in the Build mode.  Using things like the mirror modes in the creator, you can build objects that are symmetrical and can then be painted and decaled to give your creation a finished look.  Creation of items can often start with a question of, ""I wonder if I can create..."".  Many hours can be spent finding the answer to that question.  If you look in the Steam workshop, you can see some awesome things that people have created.  For people who have spent some hours in the Creator, some of these objects can leave them shaking their heads wondering, ""How in the world did they do that?""In short, if you like games like Minecraft, but with a better resolution - of the blocks, at least, give this game a try.  There is a demo, so you can try it out and see if you like it.  I like it, obviously - with the hours I have put in it and will continue to do so.			"

								Nice balance of exploration and discovery. Decent variety of gorgeous creatures and environments. Crafting system is well balanced and varied. Creation system looks daunting but is very intuitive. Does need fleshing out a bit but devs are well on their way in the right directionProblem is the multiplayer. Netcode is atrocious. MP mechanics aren't where they need to be. Defenses are easily ""deleted"" by other players . Small environments. Creation buggy. The general asshattery you encounter in minecraft is here on a much smaller scale, but theres no tools or resources to manage it yet.

												Lots of people seem to complain about this game but I have nothing but praise so far.1. Performance was substandard until I made a few changes to graphics and perfomance prefrances then it orked great (I should also add my laptop is certianly not a good laptop.)2. People were complaining about vehicles but so far I have had no problems. (Tho I've only used one.)3. People were saying that the sounds and the graphics were bad But like I said before my laptop is hardly meant for gaming and with a few minor changes to settings the game is visualy and audibly stunning and has an amazing soundtrack.4. people were coplaining about some of th quests but now that I've done a few I realise they blew those way out of preportion and the quests are actually not all that bad (So far at least) 5. people complained about the combat but contrary to what they said it I actualy found it quite smooth and most definately enjoyable. (And I haven't even gotten a single skill yet)6. I can't really say much about crafting yet exept that it takes a little while to figure out but is easy to figure out and use once you do (at least with items, I haven't built athing else yet)7. it is surprisingly realistic with a variety of health factors including desiese, malnutrition and even mental health with different medicins for different things but this systm is well done and I don't see it becoming a chore. (Tho admitedly I havn't gotten all that far)8. character customistion is amazing, so simple a child could could do it yet it is still easy to make your character look the way you want it to (Keep in min tho there are only so many options as far as that goes)9. The game feels right, it feels magical and majestic yet also dangerous at times and is the only game in a long time that has time warped my mind and stolen my day. (Only 3 games capture this spark for me and they are not surprisingly all games that had alot of effort put into their creation, the other two are Fable 2 and The last of us.If there is a downside to this game I'd say it's that you probably need alot of time on your hands to really get into it so if you are an extremely busy person then if you buy it you will probably end upputting it aside until you holidays or something. (of course if you have too much time on your hands this is an upside.)From what I have experienced so far I rate it 10/10			"

												Time for the G.B.F. The good! The bad! And the fugly. (The full frontal review, no TL;DR here)So this holiday season, I finally got time to not-adult. You know, subsist on a steady diet of chimichangas and rum spiked egg nog... hellava combo coming back up for an encore. So like any green thing thats avoiding any and all contact with the outside world I decided to dive into indie-land and throw my hard won shiny coins at Steam, thus bringing us, to Planet Explorers. (This is an early release, so, some of the things may be fixed or unfuqed in the future, so I'm burping up salsa and crumbs on what the game is right at this moment. Like right now... at this moment... and stuff.)Okay First, the Good. And seriously folks, I thought about this stuff in the shower, it was that good. Wink wink.Graphically it is spot on great to look at. Well till someone wants to build a mega base of total badassery among the fields and flowers. But hey, progress requires alot of things to die for my needs. The colors are vibrant and stand out pulling you into the world and sharply contrasting the view so the little things stand out. Plus they fixed the blurry font so I didn't need to put on my spectacles to read and then blur the world. This game first off is a visual feast, alien critters (that must all die for my throne of meat) really look strange and for the most part unique. Except for the monkey things that throw poo and have audio like chittering monkeys... It looks and sounds like an alien world with the same ol biomes given a bit of a twist to make them stand out a bit from the norm... Best example would be the mushroom mountains in the grasslands.Character customization is in depth enough to make you look different from other people, although i'm willing to bet in multiplayer it comes down to recognizing someones hair and outfit. Speaking of outfits, BOOYAH! The late game outfits again look and feel futuristic, with glowing lights, weird angles and questionable monotone with flavor color overlay schemes... but still far future.People are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥+ Don't get attached. It's good to see a game with political undertones, because as a green ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I know humans are great at snubbing one another. Right off the bat (Drumroll) Martians and Earthlings (Ba-Dum-Tiss) don't like one another. See even in the future, humans gotta human. In the Story-mode of the game this plays out fairly well and has a good thread to keep RPGers asking questions, and if the option were available, sides would be picked. And some NPCs (Hailey! My blue haired Martian anime sweetheart!) die. Of course if your totally prepared a *few* can be prevented... But that was an alien invasion to fort Badass II that was not prepared for 250 laser turrets, a fully trained combat squad with top end everything... and me, sipping spiced cider watching a futile invasion. (Although some deaths are purely scripted and try as I may with overwhelming destruction, some deaths can't be prevented.)Now for the bad... The audio, omg the audio! 95% of the time it was immersive and really reeled me in. But there are moments... Looking at you monkey things. That rip you right out of it, or sent me into fits of throwing my headset across the room. The main music track is glorious... till it hits the high notes that make a beagle howl in pain. Some of the settlement items drown out spoken dialogue with their droning and some you wonder if they even work from being too quiet. Turrets will literally make you crap your pants! (I had to wear pull-ups about 20 hours in.) Especially the gatling turrets. Most people are willing to unzip and let a warm stream of truth leave a messy if slightly briney coating all over the spoken dialogue, myself, not really... It's bad... almost on unprofessional levels. You can read along the words in the text box don't match up, some people are faking accents, Some have residual background noise, or were recorded too quietly and had to have the volume cranked up post production, or just failed with getting and using a popper. Still I have heard and cringed at vastly worse... So I'll give Pathea a pass for just trying to coordinate audio, rather than using a central recording studio.(It's tough man.)Usefully useless NPCs. A major facet is colony / resource management. Thus you get people to lord over, and hooboy, do I like commanding weak humans into a pure force of fire wielding death monkeys! And some of them right out of the gate come skilled for such an endeavor. And others make for an exellent fall back crew to be trained up to fill roles highly needed by the legion of ""don't you even think of invading alien scum!"". The biggest detractor is in storyline mode whereas it's nearly non-existant in adventure mode. You get a guy like Chen who makes for a great first string soldier to train your defense force, but due to quests he's too busy (aka the scripting wont allow it.) Forcing you to train at least one duplicate (who hopefully does not die) to play both primary task and trainer. This happens quite a bit, and super late into the story mode you will have acess to some very skilled individuals who are sorely needed for maximum effect for the colony as a whole, but are nothing more than window dressing after becoming part of your team. Yeah Tank, F-you too buddy... Nice skill set you have there... The farmers could use you man, oh you can't be assigned... And I can't just up and shoot you in the face... crud. (But I'll totally give a pat on the back for adding the Korean girl-child. Having a young person of mid-teen years added immersion to the fact it was a COLONY SHIP and not everyone would be old farts, quite immersive.)Questing is not really rewarding... kinda. Okay again the RPG elements are spot on, I can't dish on that... not even force a slippery wet fart in the general direction of story questing, both Story and adventure modes do a fairly good job of rewarding the player in that aspect. Do mission = unlock more of the adventure to be told with some sugar sprinkles on top... the pretty colored sprinkles like on cup-cakes. But the side missions is where I can definately squidge out a wet fart with the power to break my thunder buckets gravitational pull. Whats the point? Okay in some cases, you may unlock a follower who will be your high maintainence combat buddy... That's cool. But for the most part, the basic filler fetch quests Do X, Craft X, Gift X, yield nothing... Like that chocolate factory guy (NAME COPYRIGHTED) The same one who angrilly exclaims you get nothing. Side missions are a filler for now that mostly give nothing in return. Grumpy Goblin.And to the Fugly... the things that make your toes curl up in terror like waking up next to you best friends dog naked.(Don't ask.)FIRST Whisky Tango Foxtrot Pathea? Adding theme music to Chen?!? (Latest update) Look if it was an April fools update, I would totally understand. But it drowns out dialogue during story missions. Actually drowns out everything. It is so loud and breaks the living hell out of the fun factor I got to the point of trying to lock him in a box filled with live grenades. Pull it out, pull it out now! This is one baby (the theme song) that needs smothered in the crib!The unskippable repeating wonder credits. Okay kudos on the ending and where it leaves us salivating for more... mmm freshly smothered baby meat... Fact is once you hit the credits your new old friend will be Ctrl + Alt + Del. Theres no other way to stop it, and it's on a loop... it just keeps going on and on, like this review.Random gen NPC mutants from planet X. Random generator needs tweeking so everyone doesn't look inbred. Nuff said.Seriously though, Despite my belching. This game is filled to the brim so far with many ""oooo neet!"" moments, excellent crafting, a intriguing story overall, and reminders that you always need to be prepared. So in closing, Like Survival / Exploration / RPG? Definately Get this game!			"

								Planet Explorers is a great game with amazing potential - much of which has already been realised in spite of the game only being in Alpha, with the ability to create all sorts of gizmos from cars, boats, planes, helicopters, buildings and even the kitchen sink - literally. You really are only confined by the limits of your own imagination.Having been playing the single player mode since Alpha 0.81, there are issues in multiplayer that really need addressing (A0.831 being the latest version at the time of writing). Also given that this is still in Alpha I cannot stress that these are issues that will eventually be resolved in due course.Undoubtedly the biggest issue thus far has been that hosted servers do not always save your progress. You can spend hours upon hours creating things (which luckily you can save as isos to use again at a later date), but if you're unfortunate enough not to be able to do this and your server fails to either save or to appear on the server list, then all your hard work will have been for nought.The game also has a tendency to spawn your character underneath blocks you've already placed, which is no better demonstrated than logging into the game and finding your character face-deep in the dirt under your house. This latter point is obviously an issue regarding optimisation that can easily be resolved, though servers not saving your hard work is a much more serious issue.While single player 'story mode' and multiplayer 'build mode' seem quite stable, multiplayer 'adventure mode' on the other hand seems very buggy by comparison.In spite of all this however, I'm very happy to say that the potential of this game is such that it warrants further and continued interest on my part*, though I may update this review as and when necessary. 4.5/5--------* The game has been so promising that I bought extra copies for my friends.

								Absolutely love this game - even at the lowest graphic settings the world is breathtaking.Once you get the hang of the controls they are fairly intuitive - the build function and ability to make your own custom objects and vehicles is a big plus too.The wide range of biomes and almost complete destructibility of the world increases the 'real feel' of the game, and the crafting system (replicator) is one of the best I've seen yet.Only downside possibly is that it is very graphic intensive - I have a fairly high spec mac and i have the graphics set to their lowest setting.  It is a bit buggy but I would consider a  must have  for anyone who likes a good sandbox adventure game and is looking for high customisability.			"

												Terrible experience.The combat engine is poorly coded and unresponsive.For example: You gotta smash your LMB to hit but if you die... a popup with two buttons appear right underneath the mouse cursor and you are still smashing the LMB so you choose (by clicking blindly) without reading or even seeing the choices.The ground is glitchy, I walked a little far from the crashed spaceship in the beggining and when I came back it was renderized as ugly stones and glitchy textures.The jumps are totally bugged and you can see thrugh the terrain if you move in some parts near walls and stuff.Inventory is a mass and not intuitive at all, well, not even the tutorial is clear.Don't get me started on the bow and arrows... OMG, I wil not even address to this.I could try more to see if it gets better after I master all the commands and the confuse inventory and that messy GUI, but it was so bad I will try to ask for my money back since I don't have more than an hour in game.... THIS is how bad it is... a collector trying to get rid of a game.			"

								I don't normally do reviews for games or anything else for that matter but after having played this game for over 400 hours as of posting this I have to say this game is becoming one of my favorites and it isn't even finished yet. The developers have put a lot of work into this game and that has come a long way since when I picked this game up a few years ago.The ability to create new weapons, armor, vehicles, and items to place around your colony is taken to new heights in this game. There is a built in modeling program to design things to make your gameplay one-of-a-kind for you.While there are still a few bugs in the programming each update they have released has greatly squashed this number as well as adding significantly more content to the game.I would recommend this game for anyone who likes voxel-based games or is just looking for a nice open world sandbox game.

								I played the Story mode twice and will again when there's another patch, or sooner if I can't wait. The Adventure mode is ok, but it lags out so bad it's unplayable if I walk too far away from the starting point. I have the graphics maxed in Story mode with no lag anywhere unless I have a large base or large garden (the lag only occurs when I'm near the base / garden). Adventure mode lags out with all the graphics turned down and no base and no garden. I believe it's just an Alfa issue. If you grab this game, play Story mode. It's extremely fun, has a good story and it's not too buggy at all.			"

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:When I first saw the trailer and images on the store page for ""Planet Explorers"" I thought to myself wow this game has lots of potential, and it looks like lots of fun to play, but to my dismay this is what I got:The game starts out with poor dialogue, its text based, the letters are tiny and the npcs feel dead (Villages feel dull/dead too), the npcs don't really move around or do much, they just sit there, vendors are pretty much useless they only sell stuff that are easy to come by, the only benefit of npcs is the ability to recruit, that being said you gotta get them a full set of gear, because they come into the world like you with completely garbage items.In short term let me make Pros & Cons,--Pros-----Good Concept & IdeaFun DiggingYou can climb any mountain by hugging the wallCreation ModeCons-------Friendly Npc's are completey useless & redundentVillages feel extremely dull and deadEnemy Npcs are too strong (Even at starting level, some enemies can even 1 shot you)Obtaining easy weapons/gear is quite frustratingThe Fatigue system is completely stupid, [when fatigued your rendered useless in every shape way or form]Weapons do to little of damage for enemies your levelMultiplayer Digging/Mining Glitches (Cant see other player tunnel)Swimming controls are awfulMelee Combat aiming is awfulLighting Glitches while in Mines/Digged holesThe time it takes to get places on footGeneral Glitches (Falling through world/underground)Interface is quite awful, the weapons 1-10 bar doesn't work properlyThe Character creation is not that great, & is nowhere near completeMultiplayer Search System is terribleetc........Overall this game is definatly not worth its Early Access price of $20, I bought it for $15 on sale, and its not even worth that. I would say at its current stage the game is worth no more than $5, because they still have alot to prove and bring to the table.			"

								Well the potencial is there for an absolutly great game HOWEVER, there are a few things that need to be said about this game1. the speed of updates is nowhere near fast enough! instead of trying for one huge patch, update the game every week that way people with slower connections can enjoy it as well. Doing a huge update and then finding your saved games are trashed is VERY irritating.2. Better communications from the dev's, we are people too that understand that life and especaily software developement does not follow a straight path as such if an issue hits the game a quick note to say ""hey we got an issue to sort out watch this space"" is much better than us ranting on the forums and the dev's getting back to us 3 days later.Now for the amazing bits of the game:1. the creation system once you have understood it is one of the best ideas in this game with total freedon to do what you want this is a huge plus 12. Total freedom to do what you want. This is another huge plus 1. In adddtion to the diversity of the terrian the options are there for some wonderful game playIn conclusion this is one game that has endlees potencial but I would councile the dev's to be careful as the sandbox genre of games is expanding fast and as such this game needs the updates comeing once a week instead of when the dev's think their ready. My point is that I bought space engineers and PE at the smae time I have 239 hrs on PE and over 1400 on SE.			"

								Played some of the Single Player mode.Like most negative reviews, game has potential.It is in Alpha and I bought it more to support the project.I'm hoping somewhere down the line it becomes a great sandbox butat the moment you really feel like a tester then a player.The environment is very 1D and the NPCs looking very generic.However some smart interactions with some creatures chasing othersbut nothing worth shouting about.Watch some online gameplay and make up your own mind, but don't expect any epic gameplay. More of a supporting/tester role.PS- Not sure if it's because the game is still in Alpha production,but it is deceptive and very graphics heavy. I run a mid-high gtx850m and I m ableto get almost all games on HIGH smooth and a few on ULTRA. I tried running thisgame between its HIGH-ULTRA settings and a 25-28 seemed to be the limit, whichwas strange since playing the actual game you can't really tell from the visualswhere the loss of frames is coming from.

								EDIT/UPDATE: Something new that really chafes me that I *HAD* to add to my review!  I've tried to wrap my head around it, and even though in some ways I can see the pros, ultimately I have to feel as though it's in direct violation of the Early Access Program rules of Steam.  Now, I'm not trying to go out of my way to make trouble for the developers of this game... I truly think it has tons of potential, tons of possibility to do well, and I just wish they'd get their heads out of the butts and iron out the core features like CONTROL INPUTS for the CORE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE GAME (and before anybody says that controller-support isn't a core function... it's LISTED in their INPUT section under the CONTROL menu, with some Joystick buttons even listed as defaults, while only half of an entire gamepad/joystick works, but also interferes with Xpadder/Pinnacle working properly -- there are quite a few people that have medical issues, myself included if you count aches/pains from old age, that can only comfotably game with a controller... most times I even use a controller to navigate through the OS and such... Unity HAS built-in controller support, so either iron it out, or turn it off so people can use XPadder or Pinnacle!!!  Buyers have been asking/begging for it for OVER A YEAR NOW!).  Anywho, here's what's chafing me... Steam's Early Access is about ANYBODY that pays for early access, gets to experience the game as it goes.  Planet Explorer's decided to make an Alpha-Beta team I guess.  And no, I'm not ""butt-hurt that I couldn't be on the team""... as far as I know you just have to opt into it, and anybody in EA can do that as far as I'm aware.  It just blows my mind though, that first you have to pay for EA, expecting to get all patches and updates as they happen, and then a SUB-GROUP is made within that EA for ""BETA-TESTING"" of an ALPHA!?  WTH!?  Every EA I've played to date, I haven't had to babysit ""how I get my patches and when""... when updates are made, you just get them auto-patched via steam.  Now, GRANTED... one of those pros... having a beta-team makes sure it's nothing that will outright break and destroy the game when a patch is pushed, but that's what internal Q/A is supposed to be for; (Or even... I dunno, early-access!?).  So now, of all people that pay for EA, hypothetically 50% that are in beta get the latest ""beta updates"" as they happen, while those that didn't know or couldn't be bothered to opt into beta, have to WAIT until the devs decide the ""alpha patch"" is up to ""alpha standards!?"" before they release it.  Perfect example... I haven't opted into the beta-testing, but I launch my PE game right now, and my currently running and available public version is 0.871... yet, on the steam page for PE, I even quote, the most recent patch is ""A0.886 Beta Build Released on Steam"" (this isn't flipping WoW with their PTR for crying out loud... this game isn't even in full freaking release yet!!!).  See what I mean!?  When has there ever been a BETA within an ALPHA/Early-Access!?  How long does time have to go on before we have so many silly sub-levels to early-access/beta-testing before it's just too absurd to make anymore sense of!?  ""Oh yeah, I'm an alpha-access beta-tester to the early-access beta-alpha which is in place to iron out all updates before they hit the closed-alpha-beta-alpha to ensure that everything is ironed out when the game goes beta-alpha-beta in a couple more months""... WTF!?Well, game seems decent, interesting, fun and procedurely-generated.  Lots of potential in this title.Biggest downside though is, been sitting on this title as it collects dust because of all the so-called ""upcoming improvements and fixes"".  Controller-support in this game is horribly broken, so much so that you can't even use Xpadder/Pinnacle to map out a custom-config... since the game semi-initiliazes control of the controller/joystick with no options to turn it off on the game-side of things.  Wouldn't be so big an issue, except for people like myself where playing constantly with a mouse and having to sit forward all the time start to kill my back and wrist after awhile.Wouldn't fault the game so much for having broken controller-support... but be nice if devs either got controller-support accurate, or just left it alone so people could again jury-rig their own support via Xpadder/Pinnacle... as it stands it's a giant speed-bump/road-block.Other than that, everything else about the game seems to run somewhat decently and looks really fun... just a shame that those that might require sitting back with a gamepad can't exactly dive right in... been really longing to play this game more.  And for that reason, I can't exactly recommend it... as others might find themselves in the same predicament as myself.  Not everybody has tons of money, and in this day and age several live on a tight budget... with so many broken/problematic games, people want to feel comfortable and confident that they can make a leap of faith in buying what looks and seems to be a half-decent game.  Problem is, gaming controls/functionality are a core-element that by now designers and developers should have figured out... it's not rocket-science, it's not like anybody's reinventing the wheel.  So for the sake that nobody drops the clams on this to find out, as I did, that they're simply unable to play it the way they want to and for a decent amount of time in one sitting, I can't exactly outright recommend this, at least, not without putting a huge WARNING out there.WARNING: If you're able to play for long hours with a keyboard/mouse this game may be okay for you... if you typically need to jury-rig up another input-interface/controller-setup either in a game or jury-rigged outside the game... WAIT and SAVE YOUR MONEY until they confirm there's some sort of fix or update to this. -_-			"

Early Access Review
								I've only tried the Story Mode so far, and after that, I don't know if I'll be up for trying the other modes.The game has potential but it's still very early to determine what the end result will be. Playing, it feels like the developers are still unclear on what they want to do with some features. From what I've played, quests have been simply going from point A to a very far point B then back, or gather X amount of resources A, B and C, or a combination of the two. They are long, tedious and do little to keep you wanting to play more.The crafting system is decent, but very early on, you'll get very complicated scripts that require you to create many different materials from many different resources in order to create a single Item. It wouldn't be so bad, if resource gathering was fast and entertaining, which it's not. early tools take ages to gather resources, and you're stuck with them until you figure you have to buy more scripts from an NPC.The combat system is barely worth speaking about. If you don't notice the little enemy health bar that appears in the upper left corner of the screen, you won't even know if you're landing any strikes or not, until either you or your enemy are down.You can put items for use in the 1-9 bar, a la Minecraft, and it works well, but the only way to know which Item you have equipped is by looking at the square left of button 1, which shows what you're currently using. I guess that's ok, but it'd be less confusing if it just highlighted the Item you've selected. Another problem is that if you're using a sword and Shield and you change to a pickaxe to do some mining, when you switch  back to the sword, the shield will stay unequipped, forcing you to go and equip it again, which can be annoying considering how you can be attacked at any time.One other problem I had is that throughout the time I spent playing, I felt like I was doing something (or rather everything) wrong. Following the questline brought me to face enemies against whom I had no chance. I constantly wondered if there was something I missed, something that should have prepared me for the challenge, but there seemed to be nothing there.Overall, the game has potential, but I cannot recommend it to anyone, simply because it's too unfinished. I wish I had waited a year or two more to play it in a much more polished state. I know I'll have to wait at least that long to come back to it.			"

I was waiting a few promises made by the devs, such as more of the neat stuff in story mode made available in adventure mode (with friends) before buying it for other people to play with me.But since then, I've just seen one deadline after another pass by. Frankly, the devs are starting to seem disorganized and incompetent. I don't know what's going on over there. I would not buy this game until at the very least, the devs managed to finally finish 0.9, and see where the game stands then. I wouldn't be surprised if even more features get pulled from 0.9 before they release it.			"

								A good game, a bit too grindy for me, but I have supported this since it was first added to steam. Each time I open this game I am delightfully surprised with the new content and interest creatures I find.The game is very complicated and feels a lot like an MMO, resources are usually quite rare, and bullets are even harder to come by, which makes melee combat the most used for me. However most of the aliens on this planet can kill you in 1 or 2 hits. So melee combat is usually a bad idea.To this day I still don't know how to actually make/import a vehicle into my game, I have looked up tutorials but there are so many buttons it is very overwhelming. Overall this game has always been an awesome idea when I look at it, but when I play it I find myself lost.			"

Planet Explorers can be fun, but it takes a little getting used to the world and controls. Took me a while to figure out the Builder also as the voxels tend to go all over the place if you're not careful. Also I said in the video you can make your own turrets? Untrue You can't make them as of yet so I don't know if you ever will, I just assumed.			"

								unfortunately due to its current state and price I cannot honestly recommend this. The storyline although there, isnt finnished. So only about a third of the map is explorable. Adventure mode offers little challenge. You are just given the plans to make ever item in the game, when you start. And if you dont want to make them there is an always available shop menu.Farming isnt worth doing as you buy a seed, plant it, wait, harvest and then just get 2 of the crop. Then you have to buy another seed. As the crop item can usualy be bought at half the price of the seed. You may as well buy that and not wait.Colony building consists of building 5 to 7 items and placing them, then getting a few people to ""live"" there. You then supply them with food, water, armour, weapons, assign them a job working the farm. Then thay stand around doing nothing all day.With All that said, this is one of the most promising games I have seen all year. Graphics are almost perfect for the game. Mining is even challenging. Combat is fun although needs tuning a little. Stability is almost perfect with one crash in 24 hours gameplay. Making your own designs of vehicles works fantastic. Using the rocket pack to gain height, then switching to hanglider and gliding around is almost a game in itself.And yes I understand this is an Early access game, but one of the keywords is Game, and currently there isnt enough game to play, and make this worth buying at this price. This is at present an alpha demo and should probabily be free. If you want to support the creators then buy it. Otherwise wait, and keep a close eye on it. If Its finnished, it will be good.			"

								I've been following this game for a couple years now, and it continues to get better and better. It takes a bit of time to warm up to it, but if you give it a chance, you'll find it a deeply satisfying blend of RPG, sandbox, base building, exploration, crafting, and open world survival. The AI NPC's are a fantastic addition, as well as the built-in object editor, where you can download patterns other people have created from within the game. You get to create your own avatar and customize gender, hair, eyes, skin, face, and clothing. That's a HUGE plus in my book.If you're looking for an alternative to Minecraft with better character and creature models, better environmental graphics, more streamlined crafting and building, vehicles, NPC followers, objectives, quests, and more diverse and interesting types of weapons, this is it. Truly an amazing game, even this early in development. I can't wait to see where it goes next.My friends and I have already had quite a bit of fun with this in multiplayer, although at this stage the features could use a bit of work. It would be nice to have a more fleshed out multiplayer story mode. But even as it stands, it's a ton of fun.Devs, if you read this, your idea of enhanced NPC interactions like marriage and procreation? Yes yes! Do it! Also, it appears difficult if not impossible to get NPC followers to heal themselves. Please fix that! Thank you for making such an excellent game.			"

								First off: This game is very alpha. There's a reason it's early access. It's improving, but don't expect a complete, polished game.On the surface this just looks like yet another ripoff of Minecraft, although in this case with gorgeous graphics. It's not. It takes a whole different angle on building things, giving the player a lot of freedom to shape things exactly how they want—if they're willing to take the time to learn the still-rather-clunky UI. You can build a nice house, but you can also build your own sword, gun, vehicle and various other things. It takes the concept of crafting beyond a preset list of things and almost brings CAD into a game. Extremely unique, and while I can't promise everyone will like it, if anything in my review sounded interesting, it might be worth a try.			"

												To whomever cares to read.Got this game more than a year ago, Before ARK and all these survival craziness games popped up. It had a brilliant idea and the gameplay was very good. To create and share ANY ISO (weapon, vehicle, etc) it’s astonishing. It’s a game with mods build into its heart.HOWEVER.... in my opinion. The devs made a big mistake trying to update the Unity (forgot witch number). Game was close to a finish date, and due to this new Coding, the setback was ...Huge...The updates were delayed, because they were working on the core of the game again and the momentum was lost.As it is, the game is very much playable. Not finished, but by far well more polished the ARK and some other survival games. (it’s not a ""survival game"" apologies for using ARK as example so much)Multi player it’s quite fun, even though some computer savvy might be needed. Simple player it’s very entertaining. If you have the patience to create this game has the tools to make some majestic creations.About the price drop... Inevitable. Like I mention, after years and development and all this new trend to build/survival games, this game needs an active community, creating, trading ISOs to be enjoyable. so better to drop the price and get more people to join then let the game die after finally ""finished"". Devs kept us updated all the way, and even though i disagree with some decisions made, they were very responding and reliable to finish a game that had great potential and could had been forgotten after their initial success on sales. I recommend this game, and I will keep an eye for future projects.			"

								I had mixed feelings about this game when i got it first. The building for one thing was not what i expected, and the random landscape generator can be a bit glitched out sometimes. I know this is to be expected for a game like this, when in early access, and there are so many of them that i really have no idea why this one came to mind first. The game is a good idea, but needs a lot of improvements to live up to its title and i supported it because i think in some time it might become something. Some improvements for the game could probably be better player customization, a pre-generated map system, and maybe, in some time, even workshop support for maps, creations, etc. Hopefully by purchasing this game i made a wise decision, and hopefully it will become something in time. (also the first person option broken) But i would recommend this game if you enjoy and like these types of RPG's so in your own time, if you have a spare £19 lying around, give it a try, and if you don'tlike it then, wait for improvements like me			"

												I have been with this game for around 2 or 3 years, best game I have played, so good that even with the bugs come and go as the devs fix them, to note the creation system is a big chunk of the game, I love how it works, still wish they would add plane parts and there ar still a few features that I want them to add,like being able to move the model and copy it after it has been placed,any one new wont understand that but still amazing game and its still being worked on and updated, with anything it needs more fans and people buying to keep the devs on the project past its being released and for them to add dlc or just plain free content, the game has gotten to a point where if those without a good creative mind can download iso files for guns or vehicles that others have made, even seen a xwing and the key blade from kindom hearts, I highly recommand this game even with the few bugs that will get fixed, anything that I have wanted in the game fixed or added has happened so they are on the ball with this game.

								Spawned in at a desert, where the starting shops were on an island in the sea. Ran up the ramp to the shops, glitched through the ramp and died of fall damage, first death.Next, a crazy dinosaur creature starts attacking me and friend, almost one hitting us, we run up the ramp to escape, and i glitch through it and die of fall damage again.This time i am careful to jump over the spot where I keep falling, and stand on the edge of the island, watching the beast. It then one hits me from the ground, and i die again.We get wood bows and start attacking it, but it is doing little damage, but it does appear to be dead, my friend thought it was drowned. I hopped down into the sea to investigate. It wasn't dead, just having a mid-fight nap, it one hit me again.10/10 so fun.Jokes aside, this game is genuinely fun. There is a lot of glitches and loopholes which need adressing and obviously that is ok, as it is alpha.Another thing the developers really need to do is to make it so you can really dumb down the graphics. My PC has a terrible graphic cards, and with the settings on fastest very little seemed to actually change and i still had fairly bad lag.Great game in the making though, should buy.			"

								With 20hrs under the belt I can safely say that this game is fantastic.  There is so much to do and so much life to the game.  I will break it down by features.Graphics:The graphics are great.  There isn't as much control over what features pertaining to graphics are used but enough to make sure your system can run it properly.  At full quality it looks stunning.  Light permeating through tree leaves, a nice not-over-done bloom effect, AA, it all works great and runs smooth.  Very pleasing to the eyes.  The voxel engine handles very well and even with an older video card, the game handles it all very well and even displays very far into the distance (im using a nvidia 560ti).    The weather is handled very nice and looks good.  Night time is actual night time.  You can hardly see at pitch black and need a torch or light.  Characters:It is great that they allow you to create your own custom character like sims or elderscrolls games.  The NPCs are active but not to the extent of say skyrim where they have jobs.  They sort of just stand around and walk here and there. You can talk to them and get a lot of story background which is great.  You can even enlist some of them to fight beside you and you can equip them with armor and weapons and whatnot.  The mercenaries have their own set of special skills too.  Some are great with swords and others with guns and so on.  Adds nicely to who you choose to follow you.  I like that the mercenaries reappear beside you when you get too far from them.Story:Great story line.  Makes you want to learn more and more about what is going on.  This coming from a guy that usually is not interested in story.  I found myself wanting to know what happened.  That doesn't happen often at all.  Sound/music: The sound was good.  The music adjusted appropriately depending on where you were and whether or not you were in the area of a hostile enemy. It was a little glitchy but I've read they are fixing that.  Sound effects fit weapons and whatnot.  It could use more attention to vehicles and sounds but overall still good.Quests:The quests are your run of the mill quests.  They are good and add to the the story.  They don't always feel quite at all like a grind.  Some can be, but that is normal it seems.  Other quests are more detailed.  I will say there are some bad bugs with some of the quests that require a npc to follow you.  That npc is prone to get stuck at a tree or rock and unlike the mercs that you hire, the quest npcs don't reappear at your side if you move too far away.  I have found that if you have a quest npc with you, if you bring out a vehicle and get in it, the npc will rellocate to your vehicle which is an unintended fix.  This leads to problems early game especially when you are travelling long distances.  When you have quest npcs with you, you can't fast travel.  If they get unexpectedly stuck in a tree you have to travel all the way back to retreive them.  This can be frustrating. There are some quests that you receive early in the game that won't be completed until later.  Many have had problems with this.  I imagine it will be fixed in later versions given this game is only early access.  SOme quests are a little buggy but that is mostly due to the fact that npcs end up getting stuck in random places.  There was one quest involving two npcs and I couldn't complete the quest because one of the npcs randomly got stuck in a mountain side and I couldn't get him down until I dug out the mountain side.Building:The game contains a lot of building which is great.  Kind of like minecraft.  You can make your own weapons and vehicles and whatnot.  You require schematics to build things and sometimes require to build one thing in order to build another.  It doesn't get overly complicated though.  The difficulty of the build is often representative of the usefulness of what you are building.  For instance, you can't just easily build a helicopter.  It requires you build a cockpick, rotors, engines, energy cells, etc.  It is a very intuitive building system that takes a little time to get use to but once you are it is very easy to use.  There is a lot of fun to be had.  A lot of creativity that can be used.  I will say the game could do better at helping you understand the proper needs of a vehicle.  I made a dune-buggy type car and I had all the pieces but in game I got this red text at the bottom that told me the car is overpowered or something.  It never really told me why it was overpowered or how to fix it.  The car still worked fine as it was.  Enemies: There are a lot of animals and enemies in the game.  Many of the animals are docile until you attack them which is nice.  Some of the animals are hostile from the start and it is fun and interesting to see which animals will attack on site and which animals will run right beside you.  The enemies are dangerous too.  Some prefer to sit back and snipe you.  Others will come slinging swords and whatnot.  Some will even mount turrets and will sling rockets and bullets at your face.  The animals and enemies come in all shapes and sizes and the size of the mob usually indicates how dangerous they are.  There are a few points where you fight some extremely large enemies and they can prove quite hard to defeat.  I will say the ranged mobs seem a lot more easy to conquer given they can be dodged easily.  Overall: Wonderful game with a ton of potential.  It already has a great deal built into and most of what will probably come from later versions is just more content.  I hope they fix some of the not-so-obvious bugs mentioned above (I am sure they will).  Creating your own camp and playing tower defense was really fun.  Being able to craft cars and helicopters and then drive them around was extremely fun.  The game does a great job easing you into the features and concepts of the game.  Very fun and leaves you wanting more (it is in alpha so that is to be expected).  I look forward to future updates and highly recommend you buying this game now if you enjoy rpg and open world sandbox games like terraria and minecraft.  There is a lot of replayability built into the game and right now about 20hrs worth of straight story line with some random quests thrown in.  It is a very balanced game.			"

								(Early Access Review) Already a really fun game, and will be even better upon release. Very similar UI/ feel of an old MMO like ""asherons call"" but huge, singleplayer (multi fully does exist, I have not tried), with mining, crafting, hunting, and a great building system for vehicles and equipment. It even has a colony building and management system! Visually not bad at all, not amazing, but it is always improving and sometimes when the light catches trees or a vista correctly I still catch myself amazed by the world and its beauty. All of this is the foundation on a fun and interesting world, with decent missions and NPC writing, and a very imaginative and diverse ecosystem of wacky alien flora and fauna.			"

								Note: Summary at the bottom of the review.Your colony ship just hit something in orbit, just as you arrived at your destination. Your lifeboat pod has crashed down, and the only other human occupant is injured and need medical attention. You have no weapons, barely any food, and your only tool is a simple knife. Welcome to Planet Explorers.Luckily, the above is not a huge problem, because this game lets you craft all of the above, and not just craft it, you can actually build your own guns and transport, chosing exactly how they should look by adding base parts (a gun has to have at least one muzzle and a grip) and then building the shape of your gun piece by piece from there. This is an Alpha game, and like all games still in early access, that means that things are not optimized. You will experience lag. You will find bugs (both the kind that tries to eat you, and the kind that just annoys you). And the grass...is awful. I recommend turning it off. Look beyond that though, and you find an exellent sandbox game that gives you a lot of freedom as to how you play and what you do. It is, even in its current ""rough"" state, a better game than many similar games that are considered a finished product. In short, it is a FUN game, that hopefully has a bright future!Pro:*A huge sandbox game with deformable terrain.*A very good (if a bit complex) crafting system.*An interesting setting.Con (these may be fixed before launch):*The grass is simply awful, but can be turned off.*Lag is not uncommon, especially if you've built a lot.*Still needs polish and optimization.Summary:If you are in the market for a 3D survival Sci-Fi Sandbox game, this is a solid choice that shows a lot of promise, even in its current unfinished state. If the developers sticks to it, this could easily become THE survival sandbox game to play. Even ""as is"" there is a lot to explore and do, and you'll likely have fun doing it! 6/10 -Recommended.For more recomendations and reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/strandedkerbonaut#curation "

								A building game currently under development. Storyline is nice.  Multiplayer needs some help, but it has great potential.I love the fact that you can build your own stuff and use it, i however wish you could take those items before you build them and ""try"" them for free in a training ground area, something like what Arma did. another thing is that you can build your own stuff but there are so many restrictions to doing so.  for instance, why can't i have a heavy armoured vehicle with 12 wheels? <which would be a tank, ""heavy armoured vehicle"">  more so why can't i build a gun with more that 3 barrels or one with 2 grips... the creations system leaves alot to be desired.  All that aside, if you love to explore, killing, gathering, and create with only what you have gathered this is your game. Multiplayer requires less of that, more of getting to a minable, profitable, ore quickly without dying with the trader being 'at will' you can sell everything you mine and get all the good gear in no time at all.  the biggest thing i have an issue with on multiplayer is that player to player interactives.  ie.  i can't use ladders from other players, i load under someone's builing after being fast traveled there,  and so on...  There is also no damn clock on the mutiplayer side.  and it seems you get more weather effects during the day time which makes lighting a must.All and all at this moment of the dev. of this game, it still is fun to play and challenging enough to want to keep playing.

								Pretty awesome so far.  I did kickstart this way back..but this only started to play it once it got on steam.  Playing the campaign and there is a huge story and I think I am only 1/3 way through.  Graphics are pretty good and crafting is fun.  Some thing need improvement like lighting and voices...but great job so far.			"

								Planet Explorers has a great deal of potential. The current state of the game allows you to partake in a very monotanous single player campaign which is dull and slow paced. The multiplayer mode lacks the creation elements that would make this game appealing. There is a lot of work to do in order for this game to be a decent title but from what I have seen and experienced it has potential to be a brilliant title. My advice is to save your money until a decent Beta or the finished game is available.			"

The pros: Excellent concept, Outstanding freedom. Cons: Sloppy controls, menu and Hud need massive tweaking but hey, its just in alpha! The important things that need to be good in this game are. So its a must buy people!			"

								In terms of open world, sandbox, voxel games and the sort, this game comes highly reccomended for me. The production team has listed their plans as well as their current features clearly, and they have followed through with them in game. They're alpha is already Very playable and enjoyable. The multiplayer is a breeze to set up. The atmosphere is amazing.After Starforge, I was really hesitant to buy any Early Access Game, no matter how awesome it looked. They oversold their game, and sorely underdelivered their product. Planet Explorers did not do that, and for that, I give this game, as well as it's creators, great respect and high reccomendation.

Early Access Review
								First off: This game is very alpha. There's a reason it's early access. It's improving, but don't expect a complete, polished game.On the surface this just looks like yet another ripoff of Minecraft, although in this case with gorgeous graphics. It's not. It takes a whole different angle on building things, giving the player a lot of freedom to shape things exactly how they want—if they're willing to take the time to learn the still-rather-clunky UI. You can build a nice house, but you can also build your own sword, gun, vehicle and various other things. It takes the concept of crafting beyond a preset list of things and almost brings CAD into a game. Extremely unique, and while I can't promise everyone will like it, if anything in my review sounded interesting, it might be worth a try.			"

								A good game, a bit too grindy for me, but I have supported this since it was first added to steam. Each time I open this game I am delightfully surprised with the new content and interest creatures I find.The game is very complicated and feels a lot like an MMO, resources are usually quite rare, and bullets are even harder to come by, which makes melee combat the most used for me. However most of the aliens on this planet can kill you in 1 or 2 hits. So melee combat is usually a bad idea.To this day I still don't know how to actually make/import a vehicle into my game, I have looked up tutorials but there are so many buttons it is very overwhelming. Overall this game has always been an awesome idea when I look at it, but when I play it I find myself lost.			"

								Spawned in at a desert, where the starting shops were on an island in the sea. Ran up the ramp to the shops, glitched through the ramp and died of fall damage, first death.Next, a crazy dinosaur creature starts attacking me and friend, almost one hitting us, we run up the ramp to escape, and i glitch through it and die of fall damage again.This time i am careful to jump over the spot where I keep falling, and stand on the edge of the island, watching the beast. It then one hits me from the ground, and i die again.We get wood bows and start attacking it, but it is doing little damage, but it does appear to be dead, my friend thought it was drowned. I hopped down into the sea to investigate. It wasn't dead, just having a mid-fight nap, it one hit me again.10/10 so fun.Jokes aside, this game is genuinely fun. There is a lot of glitches and loopholes which need adressing and obviously that is ok, as it is alpha.Another thing the developers really need to do is to make it so you can really dumb down the graphics. My PC has a terrible graphic cards, and with the settings on fastest very little seemed to actually change and i still had fairly bad lag.Great game in the making though, should buy.			"

								I had mixed feelings about this game when i got it first. The building for one thing was not what i expected, and the random landscape generator can be a bit glitched out sometimes. I know this is to be expected for a game like this, when in early access, and there are so many of them that i really have no idea why this one came to mind first. The game is a good idea, but needs a lot of improvements to live up to its title and i supported it because i think in some time it might become something. Some improvements for the game could probably be better player customization, a pre-generated map system, and maybe, in some time, even workshop support for maps, creations, etc. Hopefully by purchasing this game i made a wise decision, and hopefully it will become something in time. (also the first person option broken) But i would recommend this game if you enjoy and like these types of RPG's so in your own time, if you have a spare £19 lying around, give it a try, and if you don'tlike it then, wait for improvements like me			"

												I have been with this game for around 2 or 3 years, best game I have played, so good that even with the bugs come and go as the devs fix them, to note the creation system is a big chunk of the game, I love how it works, still wish they would add plane parts and there ar still a few features that I want them to add,like being able to move the model and copy it after it has been placed,any one new wont understand that but still amazing game and its still being worked on and updated, with anything it needs more fans and people buying to keep the devs on the project past its being released and for them to add dlc or just plain free content, the game has gotten to a point where if those without a good creative mind can download iso files for guns or vehicles that others have made, even seen a xwing and the key blade from kindom hearts, I highly recommand this game even with the few bugs that will get fixed, anything that I have wanted in the game fixed or added has happened so they are on the ball with this game.

												To whomever cares to read.Got this game more than a year ago, Before ARK and all these survival craziness games popped up. It had a brilliant idea and the gameplay was very good. To create and share ANY ISO (weapon, vehicle, etc) it’s astonishing. It’s a game with mods build into its heart.HOWEVER.... in my opinion. The devs made a big mistake trying to update the Unity (forgot witch number). Game was close to a finish date, and due to this new Coding, the setback was ...Huge...The updates were delayed, because they were working on the core of the game again and the momentum was lost.As it is, the game is very much playable. Not finished, but by far well more polished the ARK and some other survival games. (it’s not a ""survival game"" apologies for using ARK as example so much)Multi player it’s quite fun, even though some computer savvy might be needed. Simple player it’s very entertaining. If you have the patience to create this game has the tools to make some majestic creations.About the price drop... Inevitable. Like I mention, after years and development and all this new trend to build/survival games, this game needs an active community, creating, trading ISOs to be enjoyable. so better to drop the price and get more people to join then let the game die after finally ""finished"". Devs kept us updated all the way, and even though i disagree with some decisions made, they were very responding and reliable to finish a game that had great potential and could had been forgotten after their initial success on sales. I recommend this game, and I will keep an eye for future projects.			"

								Currently there are game breaking bugs and you need a pretty beastly machine to even run the game at medium settings.As of now I've played Planet Explorers since it was made available to play off and on. This is my review as of version a0.87.Earlier more stable versions allowed me to play with no problems while runing into rare bugs in story mode. I was also able to play with friends in multiplayer mode with little issues though lack of content made it boring at the time.This latest version seems to have implemented game-breaking story mod bugs as well as many performance decreasing issues that have been left unattended to. It seems Pathea takes a long time to release patches and fix issues. But the patches of content they release are amazing compared to other games, however spread very far apart making the patches not so great.I am currently NOT going to recommend the game at this time as Multiplayer can end up boring and Story Mode (Single Player) seems to have a fair share of issues and game-breaking bugs.

								Alright, so, I like a lot about this game. building is fun, the world is decently interesting, I had few bugs, and only one of them prevented me from ever completing the main story. (npcs I need to complete one quest involving a certain queen of certain crab monsters won't spawn, even after starting an all new game and playing through a second time)But here lie the problems: -that's the only place TO have fun. either you play an easily bugged, massive open world adventure mode where you get to experience everything or you play the survival mode.-survival mode spawns you in a rather small piece of land with only one biome. In the center of the map is a town, revealing that you are a SECOND generation colonist, taking away all sense of ""roughing it."" All you can do is walk out into the wasteland and get a little iron or copper, but never enough to really build anything good or give a sense of progression. You'll probably end up making a stone hut 10 meters from the town, cowering from enemies you lack the resources to face. this is especially disheartening because it shows that the only way to get to the fun colonies and giant robots part of the game is to play the hours-long adventure mode.-there's a creative mode, but you get the same little patch of land with nothing to do but build with no challenge. pretty standard.-although building is cool, creatures can just knock it down, which means building a home is pretty pointless, because it won't protect you from anything anyway. (unless you want to build a mess of turrets that run out of bullets)-a large portion of the main quest involves walking in straight lines for miles at a time, sometimes just to look at something, then fast travel back. (which costs money)-followers constantly get stuck.-the game has little cutscenes where the camera will pan in to show you something of interest, but these scenes are unnecessarily long.a few days of my life I'll never get back... out of ten.

								Edit: 1 year later: The tutorial is a pain, they've updated a bunch  of the graphics, sounds, etc. The theme song has words now (I liked it when it didn't :( ). I get a car really soon so I don't have to walk 500 miles earlly in the game. Yay! It stutters a lot now, but that might just be because of all the stuff I have running in the background. Apparently the story's grown since I last played, so I'll try to see what's new.Has a few bugs, but still an amazing game. It *is* still early access, but generally you won't know.8.5/10I bought this last year (I think), and the interface was a bit iffy. Collecting parts was near impossible and I thought I was just doing it wrong. The new version's UI works just as I'd expect it to (phew, I'm not crazy!). The game is one off the newfandangled voxel based games that are popping up everywhere. You mine, dig, shoot, stab and  cut (animals, plants and the ground) to get materials and use them to make inventory items like guns, healing potions, etc. All the dirt that you mined up? Well, it seems you can use that to build structures a la minecraft. There is also customization of things you build, so you can pretty much build whatever you want. I haven't really played with that yet, the screen scared me since it's too powerful, but I hear it's pretty cool.There is a main mission that you should really play to get the hang of things, and the devs seem to put out frequent updates.

								Many things to like: lots of freedom, digging, very open world, quests, an engaging plot, building with both prefab and various blocks.  Similarly crafting includes both classic recipe and freeform voxel-oriented forms, with more items being possible to craft freeform over time, as the devs find balanced rules for them.  As with other early access games performance can be a bit sketchy in certain poorly optimized cases, but the game is entirely playable on the reccomended hardware.   A few bugs, but this is not unexpected for early access.Because the game uses a bit more aggressive gpu computation, it will appreciate a flaky gpu less than some lucky games. This is likely to remain the case, and even become true of more other games as time passes anyway, though. :pPersonally, I'd prefer if the design editor felt more integrated with the game - right now it feels much more like a meta process which messes with one's feel of existing in the world a bit. not sure how much this can be improved, given that the editor needs to be usable from *outside* of play as well. I hope they find some sweet compromises, though. :)Overall I quite enjoyed the game in it's current state, and I look forward to playing it more as development progresses, and again whenever it releases.

I can see myself putting a lot of time in this game. its worth the price.			"

								A true Indie gem, I got on the Planet Explorer boat back when the game first showed on Kickstarter. Since then many updates have come to the game. They have delivered so far most of thier kickstarter promises and intend to furfill, in the future upcoming updates, more material that seperates PE from other sandbox games.+Frequent updates+Quick bug fixes+3D sandbox with unlimited potential+Amazing artistic creativity in NPC (wildlife) and a flowing envirement.+In game creation system ( A tool which will allow you to design your own weapons, vehicles, aircraft, and boats)+Inexpensive You cannot go wrong with the price for a sandbox - Sound (basically simple animal sounds and player noises.) In order to better encompass the player in the game a more diverse array of sounds would be great. - AI is almost aweful, with all the NPC's in this game upgrading the AI is peramount to having a fluid game. Too often are NPC followers  stuck in a ditch or animals frozen with utter stupidity.- Camara, this has been updated recently however it seems to still be an issue with me while I am mining/tunneling. Above all, PE is a well-rounded game that deserves more attention. It has a refreshing atmosphere that indeed implores you to explore. I would recommend!			"

								(First off I appologize for my poor grammer im not very smart)...(30+hours before steam release)..The key aspect of this is Early acess. We all know what it is. A game thats not quite finished but the devs are selling it at its current state to have more money to improve, and/or speed up the devolopment process. That being said planet explorers is completley playable, and enjoyable in its current state. The most appealing aspect is the sandbox gameplay, being able to mine resourses and dynamicly build almost anything you can imagine ( buildings, swords, guns, land and air vehicles. How well you build it will determine how well it works). the terrain deformation is incredibal, I always get a little giddy when digging a tunnel underground. the randomly generated worlds are beautifull, and almost every part of it can be gathered as resources. all in all it is an awsome game. yes a little buggy (early acess) but well worth playing.

								While still in Alpha this game has a lot to offer. Crafting is simple amazing with little limit to what you can make. Design and Build your own aircraft, land rover, house, guns, swords, shields and more keeps being added. By design your own I don't mean you piece it together with prebuilt pieces, like so many other games, I mean completely your own design voxel by voxel. If you want your assault jet to look like a dragon and shoot lasers out of its mouth then go for it. As far as exploring and survival the game thus far offers some interesting enviroments but not much challenge on the survival side. The combat is a bit chunky mimicing something like minecraft but combat improvement is in the works. Story mode is pretty good, it exists for one. Most sandbox games don't even bother but having a story isn't the biggest achievement. The story, thus far, is more engaging then any mmo and half the adventure games out there. It isn't Skyrim quality but its up to snuff. I look forward to additional chapters being added and to see where the story is going to take my character. Overall this is one of few green lite game that are worth buying. There is hours of content avaliable and while updates aren't often they are coming in and I have no doubt the game will be finished as soon as it's ready.			"

								So what to say about this game eh? Yes, yes. Currently. Early Access, but I've been watching this game for quite a while, and still all I can say is wow. Its ambitious; but on the right track,in the right order, at a good pace. Open world, great customizability (Literally, guns, vehicles, aircraft, all designed and created by YOU) It does have its rough patches, glitches, unrefined areas, but for early access, this is to be expected, But whats NOT expected is just how MUCH is in it's early access stage... This game is huge! Not some rough, open-world thrown-together. So is it worth it right now? Yes. Later? It's a steal.			"

								For any Minecraft fans this game is a must buy!!  Next gen crafting, mining, bulding, and some cool NPC's to play with.  They took what everyone was looking for in a next gen sandbox game and put into this game.  The game is very playable in its Early Access version to this date and its only going to get better.  The game has an in game creation system to make guns, swords, cars, flying machince, etc....  The mining looks very realistic and the addtion of a minreal scanner make for a futuristic feel.  Hope to see many great new things from this group and this game is bound to be a sucess.			"

Early Access Review
								This is my first ""serious"" (use that term rather loosely) review of a game that I've heavily started to get invested in....little back story.I've been following this game for awhile behind the scenes and since it was a good deal and I had a bunch of games I recently added to my wishlist within the last 2 days - I went ahead and bought it for something ""different."" Personally, most sandbox games are damn near zombie heavy and it just ridiculous how the market has been flooded since Walking Dead (nothing bad about the show)...Anyways...Here comes Planet Explorers - which I might add is a VERY interesting take on open sandbox games with a decent story mode.If you are thinking of getting this game, let me cut to the chase and give a good rundown of what I've seen so far:Note: I would HIGHLY advise doing the story mode first and then tinkering with the Multiplayer. Truthfully, the game is fleshing out rather nicely, but the story mode will take you a while to get through and teaches you alot about the limitations as a whole, so you can actually see what alpha is like right now.Ok, so here it goes:PROS------- Game runs superb on a high end system, and no doubt any moderate pc rig should be able to run this with no issues- Story mode is where you want to start at (although the ""tutorial"" of the story mode is a little odd to catch on and learn the basics.) If you've played any other sandbox MMO then you'll be able to pick up what you need to do pretty quickly. Also, it will take you HOURS, and yes HOURS to play through the story mode if you happen to go off the path and actually have fun exploring and tinkering with stuff as you gain more options throughout the missions.- Obviously, the game is still in alpha, so just be a bit patient as the game gets built up- Creating in the game is a BIG plus. I have yet to do it, but planning on, hopefully, making some fun items for the community. So far, most of the designs I've been seeing are awesome looking and can't wait to try them out after full release.- PE is a beautiful game where you can sit back and relax, watch the sun set on the beach :)- The interface, regardless of mode, is very easy to use-  Using sentry guns to shoot the hell out of rampaging beasts is a sweet :) Think of Aliens the Directors Cut with the senty gun scene, hehe.- You can make scuba diving items to explorer the water!- Found me a loot chest underground with some random items...who knows what you'll find in the most obscure placesCONS (here are some known issues)------- Multiplayer is a little lax since most are probably steering clear an alpha build- Save often in single player. I only had 1 crash from nearly 10 hours of playing. Logs are written for the crash which should be sent to the devs if you like, but for the most part, this game is very stable.- The music can get a little old and hopefully they'll add in different scores to keep it interesting. Aside from that, crank up your own music list and have at it!- There is no tab targetting in the game, so positioning your toon to chop a tree, loot a body takes a little bit to get used too. There is an option to turn on the HP mechanic, for fighting, so you know you are actually hitting the mob, but it would be good to see the name mobs if they choose to do so in an upcoming build. Although, it DOES make it so you have to ""explore"" and hunt properly in the game (you really never know what you'll come in contact with) - so maybe this isn't such a con, but it's what we all are most used too.- Finding Tin is a PITA! Just make sure you properly use your mobile scanner and it's updated properly. From there, you'll should be able to see a great 360 degree radar view in how close you are to a vein and how far you need to dig to start mining whatever it is you are searching for.Ok, so this is a somewhat look at my experience thus far. I have to honestly say though, that someone who gets bored with games easily - this one is actually pleasant to play. Since it is still in alpha, one can only imagine what else is going to come next with the updates in 2015. I have some high hopes with this game and hope it makes it to be everything everyone wants in an interesting sandbox/massively endless open world mmo.If you are still undecided on this game, definitely keep a watchful eye on it and with any luck, you'll buy it just for what you can do/and hopefully be able to do within the game :)			"

								I will make this review the most fair I can for people considering to buy this game: This game is very similiar in mechanics of other games such as Starbound and Minecraft but with it's own style. The game is still in early Alpha but with the new update I can see that this developer is providing good updates. What makes the game fun is the ability to create, fight and explore in a procedurally created enviroment. I really like the ability of allowing players to create their own custom weapons, allowing lots of creativity. Some of the ISO's (files that save the design of the custom gun or vehicle) people have created are absurdly cool (recreated vehicles of famous movies). I haven't tried multiplayer but I can see how much fun that will be by allowing games such as free for all or capture the fort, or survival (agaist other players or a creature siege). A lot is still a work in progress however. I can tell the developers are working more on the game engine mechanics. Other things such as more character custimization, more eyecandy,  is for later updates. I will try to list some notable qualities currently in the recent build:   - Has some buffers regarding Health and Stamina - Full open creation of guns and vehicles (cars, helicopters, and now includes making boats and a monorail) - Many recipes to create objects in game (materials to create items such as weapons, food, certain resources, etc) - You have to search your resources (esp ores). Don't expect to dig randomly to find ores. Use your scanner to locate ore deposits.- You can farm your own crops. - Fast travel is allowed (starting colony only at the moment though)- Very large maps (huge in my opinion) and you can also mark and label locations on map. - Animal AI is getting better (pack hunting and herding). It's like you are on Pandora (from Avatar) but you are poaching every living animal and you use their meat as currency (At the moment...it might change, I am speculating) to buy items and resources if you don't wish to create everything yourself. - You can have NPC followers and create your own base and assign them jobs. This is still a work in progress however, IDK how much progress  they made in version A.08 Remember that this is an EARLY ACCESS GAME! Saves can be compromised when updating the game, glitches still exist, the are many areas left to finish. The game itself at its current build is very enjoyable though. So far it hasn't crashed on me yet or have encountered any glitches or game breaking bugs.			"

								Brilliant game. Honestly, the whole colony thing isn't the best part. It's the exploration, challenges, and building. I haven't played multiplayer yet, though. The story isn't done yet, but what is in, is great. The only thing that sucks about it is waiting (Walking Dead Telltale game, anyone?) There are a couple bugs, but not game breaking, some useful in a non-cheaty way (Usually.)The graphics of the character are interesting, not my favorite, but I could care less. Bad stuff:Crashes once every 1-2 hour(s). Not the normal crash though, it freezes, and if you tab out you see a dialog box. The other one is an ingame message with an error. It usually saves often though, so you shouldn't lose much, if anything at all. The ingame error seems harmless, I just save and reload my game. If your game crashes in the launcher, try changing the drivers under options, I was using a nonexistent one for some reason.*EDIT: As of writing this, I have 20 hours played. 20 Hours in a story that doesn't appear to be even close to finished is great, and I can't wait for more.

								I put almost 100 hours on this game in the course of a few of weeks.  If you like 3D modeling and being able to make and immediately be able to play with your creations in game and share them with others then you will get hooked.You can host or play  persistant worlds where players can come and go exploring randomly generated terrain and unique wildlife.   The game is alpha still but VERY playable and few bugs.  I've played for hours at a time without a glitch or crash, though currently the game may run out of memory after some hours until the 64-bit version is ready.There is a little bit of story in single player, but I enjoy hopping on multiplayer servers and meeting others in game.UPDATE: over 650 hours in and it's still my favorite game despite whatever bugs come and go through its early development. Pathea is doing a great job listening to players and making things right for us!This game has excellent support for the Linux community.  There is a native linux client and a headless server that is very easy on resources, even when run on a small VPS.			"

								In it's current state this game is recommended with some caution,The game play itself is amazing you can design and build basically anything you've ever dreamed of, But doing it with friends is difficult because connectivity and available servers or working servers are next to non existent to play on.There is next to no multiplayer, a total of 50 people playing this game at one time, all in individual games playing aloneAnd if you manage to get into the same game as someone else, Anything you build any base object can simply be taken by other people while your offline or online, so you want to build a base? Get used to waking up with everything you build gone every morning so you can start over, redundant as ♥♥♥♥.You also cant make a server private it's unjoinable, if you open your ports properly, you still cant host servers.

Very interesting! Trade for blueprints and then replicate them using the basic elements.Love that the entire landscape can be remoddled with digging and building forts/houses/etc.Not bad for an alpha.Downside - Singleplayer mode has no way to pause - even when in menu mode.

								I've played this game for about 5 hours and the only thing keeping me from playing it more is writing this review. Adventure mode is fun as hell, and I can't wait to play this in multiplayer with my friends. There are some things needed to be improved on such as the ability to make a map in adventure mode and I feel the creator shouldn't rely on you putting them into your game, it should be put in there by default along with the ability to save it and input it into a new game if you desire. Haven't really gotten into The story mode as I've been only playing Adventure mode. The final question is, would I buy this game again? Not for 25 dollars. Early Access shouldn't really ever be more than 15 bucks especially if the game isn't entirely finished, but that's just me. I bought this game while it was on sale on 10/14/14 for 15 dollars and I don't regret it what so ever. I'll re-review this when it finishes, but for now I'll give it a 7/10			"

The multiplayer is a breeze to set up. The atmosphere is amazing.After Starforge, I was really hesitant to buy any Early Access Game, no matter how awesome it looked.

								This is the first review I've ever written and after playing more than 50 hours with Planet Explorers, I felt compelled to write this review.  First, the specs:  I'm playing the latest build, A0.831, on an i7-2600K, 16Gg RAM, and a GeForce 760 Ti.  I absolutely love playing Planet Explorers.  The combination of creativity, exploration, and surprises are what do it for me.  The huge world seems filled with so much potential and I'm constantly being pleased with the next ""big thing to do"".  The game is graphically beautiful, and I've only crashed maybe twice in the 50+ hours I've played it. The progression from simple tools and resources, to building a colony is smoothly done, such that I never feel overwhelmed.  I enjoy building structures, fortifying them, defending them, and expanding them.  I've only played in Story mode and I like how the story expands the gameplay for you.Even though the game is Alpha, I highly recommend it.  I got this game on sale for $15.00 and have had over 50 hours of enjoyment from it.  How can you beat that deal?When I'm away from the game I find myself coming up with ideas for what I'll try and do next in Planet Explorers.For instance:  I made a crude heliocopter and was flying back to my colony one fine day when I was attacked by some dragon-like, vulture, flying creature.  He destroyed my helicopter!  So later on while having lunch, I thought ""I'm going to build a much bigger, attack chopper, with a front-mounted cannon.  I'll show that flying freak who's the boss!""It's these kinds of experiences both unscripted, and scripted, that keep me coming back to PE!			"

The colony management is awesome. The mechanics are awesome. Everything is awesome! Worth every cent spent on it. Even in alpha, is ridiculously fun! FUN! FUN! FUUUUNNN!!!			"

								Game has been constantly improving with gameplay and bug fixes. There is a lot of potential in the open world gameplay provided and the developers seem to be taking the game in the right directions.There are a lot of improvements currently still needed, and I have been mostly playing the survival/adventure mode which already provides fun exploration gameplay. Few improvements still need to be made to the world generation and the world map in this gamemode currently.Item creation, building and resource gathering are solid, providing a stable progression, which although still needs tweaks, gives fun gameplay which blends in perfectly with the exploration providied by the game.Overall the game provides fun and interesting gameplay that will only get better as the developers continue to work on it.

								While still in Alpha this game has a lot to offer. Crafting is simple amazing with little limit to what you can make. Design and Build your own aircraft, land rover, house, guns, swords, shields and more keeps being added. By design your own I don't mean you piece it together with prebuilt pieces, like so many other games, I mean completely your own design voxel by voxel. If you want your assault jet to look like a dragon and shoot lasers out of its mouth then go for it. As far as exploring and survival the game thus far offers some interesting enviroments but not much challenge on the survival side. The combat is a bit chunky mimicing something like minecraft but combat improvement is in the works. Story mode is pretty good, it exists for one. Most sandbox games don't even bother but having a story isn't the biggest achievement. The story, thus far, is more engaging then any mmo and half the adventure games out there. It isn't Skyrim quality but its up to snuff. I look forward to additional chapters being added and to see where the story is going to take my character. Overall this is one of few green lite game that are worth buying. There is hours of content avaliable and while updates aren't often they are coming in and I have no doubt the game will be finished as soon as it's ready.			"

								This is my first ""serious"" (use that term rather loosely) review of a game that I've heavily started to get invested in....little back story.I've been following this game for awhile behind the scenes and since it was a good deal and I had a bunch of games I recently added to my wishlist within the last 2 days - I went ahead and bought it for something ""different."" Personally, most sandbox games are damn near zombie heavy and it just ridiculous how the market has been flooded since Walking Dead (nothing bad about the show)...Anyways...Here comes Planet Explorers - which I might add is a VERY interesting take on open sandbox games with a decent story mode.If you are thinking of getting this game, let me cut to the chase and give a good rundown of what I've seen so far:Note: I would HIGHLY advise doing the story mode first and then tinkering with the Multiplayer. Truthfully, the game is fleshing out rather nicely, but the story mode will take you a while to get through and teaches you alot about the limitations as a whole, so you can actually see what alpha is like right now.Ok, so here it goes:PROS------- Game runs superb on a high end system, and no doubt any moderate pc rig should be able to run this with no issues- Story mode is where you want to start at (although the ""tutorial"" of the story mode is a little odd to catch on and learn the basics.) If you've played any other sandbox MMO then you'll be able to pick up what you need to do pretty quickly. Also, it will take you HOURS, and yes HOURS to play through the story mode if you happen to go off the path and actually have fun exploring and tinkering with stuff as you gain more options throughout the missions.- Obviously, the game is still in alpha, so just be a bit patient as the game gets built up- Creating in the game is a BIG plus. I have yet to do it, but planning on, hopefully, making some fun items for the community. So far, most of the designs I've been seeing are awesome looking and can't wait to try them out after full release.- PE is a beautiful game where you can sit back and relax, watch the sun set on the beach :)- The interface, regardless of mode, is very easy to use-  Using sentry guns to shoot the hell out of rampaging beasts is a sweet :) Think of Aliens the Directors Cut with the senty gun scene, hehe.- You can make scuba diving items to explorer the water!- Found me a loot chest underground with some random items...who knows what you'll find in the most obscure placesCONS (here are some known issues)------- Multiplayer is a little lax since most are probably steering clear an alpha build- Save often in single player. I only had 1 crash from nearly 10 hours of playing. Logs are written for the crash which should be sent to the devs if you like, but for the most part, this game is very stable.- The music can get a little old and hopefully they'll add in different scores to keep it interesting. Aside from that, crank up your own music list and have at it!- There is no tab targetting in the game, so positioning your toon to chop a tree, loot a body takes a little bit to get used too. There is an option to turn on the HP mechanic, for fighting, so you know you are actually hitting the mob, but it would be good to see the name mobs if they choose to do so in an upcoming build. Although, it DOES make it so you have to ""explore"" and hunt properly in the game (you really never know what you'll come in contact with) - so maybe this isn't such a con, but it's what we all are most used too.- Finding Tin is a PITA! Just make sure you properly use your mobile scanner and it's updated properly. From there, you'll should be able to see a great 360 degree radar view in how close you are to a vein and how far you need to dig to start mining whatever it is you are searching for.Ok, so this is a somewhat look at my experience thus far. I have to honestly say though, that someone who gets bored with games easily - this one is actually pleasant to play. Since it is still in alpha, one can only imagine what else is going to come next with the updates in 2015. I have some high hopes with this game and hope it makes it to be everything everyone wants in an interesting sandbox/massively endless open world mmo.If you are still undecided on this game, definitely keep a watchful eye on it and with any luck, you'll buy it just for what you can do/and hopefully be able to do within the game :)			"

								I've played alot of Voxel based games. All of them are fun. But none (including Mine****t ) have the replay value that this game has, and I should know. For whatever reason I've not had everything in way of materials like I thought I would at certain points in this game... Soooo I would restart the whole game and try again. And everytime there was something different that I encountered. I LOVE THIS GAME. If your a fan of KOTOR 1 & 2. Please give this game a chance. I've never regretted paying this much for a game. Any game that allows you to put in yours or other peoples creations into the game for vehicles,weapons, and shields, is amazingly fun. BUY THIS GAME. Dont wait for a possible sale. (If you can LOL)			"

								""Planet Explorers"" is a voxel based game, often compared to Minecraft or Terarria. However, it is an entirely different game with a different focus and mood. It has an exstensive crafting system where YOU plan EVERY block to your liking, which is a real breath of fresh air and adds some creativity to the mix. Please note this game is early access, so it has flaws. A major flaw is the stiff combat. It is DEFINATELY a work in progress. However, it has the potential to turn in Monster Hunter combat, which if you haven't played is a game about hunting monsters(duh) with very fluid and energetic combat. Although I haven't personally played it much and it is early access, I can definitely reccomend it, at least for now.			"

								Has plenty of potential, it plays like your typical survival RPG with elements of MineCraft and other ""Craft Your World"" games. You can have companions run around with you that can either tank for you or focus on damaging enemies which REALLY help out with the more gigantic enemies. However with the current build, the longer you play the more and more the game gets choppy, to the point of crashing.			"

								The game is great. If you can manage to get it to run right at this early stage then it is great!. With each update optimization gets better. The game is great in it's current state. I played it before it was on steam and recently move it to steam. The single player is great but the multiplayer is confussing to get it to work. I have played it and it is pretty fun too. I could see some really interesting gameplay in the future. All in all it is worth the price and should improve and get easyier to run.			"

								(Early Access Review) Already a really fun game, and will be even better upon release. Very similar UI/ feel of an old MMO like ""asherons call"" but huge, singleplayer (multi fully does exist, I have not tried), with mining, crafting, hunting, and a great building system for vehicles and equipment. It even has a colony building and management system! Visually not bad at all, not amazing, but it is always improving and sometimes when the light catches trees or a vista correctly I still catch myself amazed by the world and its beauty. All of this is the foundation on a fun and interesting world, with decent missions and NPC writing, and a very imaginative and diverse ecosystem of wacky alien flora and fauna.			"

Not mention, a low price tag. This game has an amazingly bright future and I await for the next build! It even offers 3 modes with Builder, Adventure and the Story (i've quite enjoyed the story so far).			"

								Note: Summary at the bottom of the review.Your colony ship just hit something in orbit, just as you arrived at your destination. Your lifeboat pod has crashed down, and the only other human occupant is injured and need medical attention. You have no weapons, barely any food, and your only tool is a simple knife. Welcome to Planet Explorers.Luckily, the above is not a huge problem, because this game lets you craft all of the above, and not just craft it, you can actually build your own guns and transport, chosing exactly how they should look by adding base parts (a gun has to have at least one muzzle and a grip) and then building the shape of your gun piece by piece from there. This is an Alpha game, and like all games still in early access, that means that things are not optimized. You will experience lag. You will find bugs (both the kind that tries to eat you, and the kind that just annoys you). And the grass...is awful. I recommend turning it off. Look beyond that though, and you find an exellent sandbox game that gives you a lot of freedom as to how you play and what you do. It is, even in its current ""rough"" state, a better game than many similar games that are considered a finished product. In short, it is a FUN game, that hopefully has a bright future!Pro:*A huge sandbox game with deformable terrain.*A very good (if a bit complex) crafting system.*An interesting setting.Con (these may be fixed before launch):*The grass is simply awful, but can be turned off.*Lag is not uncommon, especially if you've built a lot.*Still needs polish and optimization.Summary:If you are in the market for a 3D survival Sci-Fi Sandbox game, this is a solid choice that shows a lot of promise, even in its current unfinished state. If the developers sticks to it, this could easily become THE survival sandbox game to play. Even ""as is"" there is a lot to explore and do, and you'll likely have fun doing it! 6/10 -Recommended.For more recomendations and reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/strandedkerbonaut#curation "

								A building game currently under development. Storyline is nice.  Multiplayer needs some help, but it has great potential.I love the fact that you can build your own stuff and use it, i however wish you could take those items before you build them and ""try"" them for free in a training ground area, something like what Arma did. another thing is that you can build your own stuff but there are so many restrictions to doing so.  for instance, why can't i have a heavy armoured vehicle with 12 wheels? <which would be a tank, ""heavy armoured vehicle"">  more so why can't i build a gun with more that 3 barrels or one with 2 grips... the creations system leaves alot to be desired.  All that aside, if you love to explore, killing, gathering, and create with only what you have gathered this is your game. Multiplayer requires less of that, more of getting to a minable, profitable, ore quickly without dying with the trader being 'at will' you can sell everything you mine and get all the good gear in no time at all.  the biggest thing i have an issue with on multiplayer is that player to player interactives.  ie.  i can't use ladders from other players, i load under someone's builing after being fast traveled there,  and so on...  There is also no damn clock on the mutiplayer side.  and it seems you get more weather effects during the day time which makes lighting a must.All and all at this moment of the dev. of this game, it still is fun to play and challenging enough to want to keep playing.

												I wish there was a ""neutral"" option but there isn't so I will attempt to remember to update my review If/When new updates come out that change the game.Overall Problems:      * The game plays like it was Very rushed with very little planning or attention to detail.  It has a very complex building system but no explanation as to how to use it, this could be tolerated in an Alpha game, but this should have been fixed before the game left Beta.      * The dialogue by followers is very cheesy and not vey well thought out as is most of the dialogue in the story.      * Folowers don't obey the settings like passive, stay ect. They also can't help you do anything but attack stuff and cut down trees. they do not mine resources or even collect water.      * There are no real directions or explanation of anything in game, you have to fumble through figuring out how building in every mode works and map settings if you are playing adventure mode.        * No tools to collect resources fast, everything is collected by hand, the colony ""processor"" will collect resources but much slower than you can collect with the lowest level tools.       * Everytime night comes around you get tons of notices that your colonists are too tired to work.        * Your colony Weapons can destroy your own base parts and your own vehicles.       * Colonists don't make their own food, you have to make the food and put it in the storage.       * You have to have all the resources for building in your personal inventory even if you are building with the colony replicator.        * There are still alot of Alpha level bugs.Story mode:      The story is okay, nothing that I would reinstall the game to play again. The conversation text is full of typo's and outright wrong words in places, and the story just ends.Adventure mode:     Adventure mode has several settings, but there is nothing explaining map setup, or tool level progression if you choose that option.  There are also not enough options in world genereation.    If you start with all items scripts already learned and there is no need to interact wil NPC's at all, if you choose to start without all the scrips already learned and you have to do alot of quests to learn to build what you need to start a colony.   Resources in this mode seem to be very deep in the gound with no settings that let you bring them closer to the surface that I was able to find.Multiplayer:        I Played on several servers, the major problem I found was that other players can simply enter build mode and take any materials you place, on one server players just picked up and took all my colony buildings without being part of my colony. ---------------------------------------------------------------------I will recommend this game if you can find the game on sale for $12 usb or less, don't get me wrong, it's an okay game once you figure out how to do everything but I don't think it's worth the $25 usd price they are asking for it.

								Currently there are game breaking bugs and you need a pretty beastly machine to even run the game at medium settings.As of now I've played Planet Explorers since it was made available to play off and on. This is my review as of version a0.87.Earlier more stable versions allowed me to play with no problems while runing into rare bugs in story mode. I was also able to play with friends in multiplayer mode with little issues though lack of content made it boring at the time.This latest version seems to have implemented game-breaking story mod bugs as well as many performance decreasing issues that have been left unattended to. It seems Pathea takes a long time to release patches and fix issues. But the patches of content they release are amazing compared to other games, however spread very far apart making the patches not so great.I am currently NOT going to recommend the game at this time as Multiplayer can end up boring and Story Mode (Single Player) seems to have a fair share of issues and game-breaking bugs.

								Spawned in at a desert, where the starting shops were on an island in the sea. Ran up the ramp to the shops, glitched through the ramp and died of fall damage, first death.Next, a crazy dinosaur creature starts attacking me and friend, almost one hitting us, we run up the ramp to escape, and i glitch through it and die of fall damage again.This time i am careful to jump over the spot where I keep falling, and stand on the edge of the island, watching the beast. It then one hits me from the ground, and i die again.We get wood bows and start attacking it, but it is doing little damage, but it does appear to be dead, my friend thought it was drowned. I hopped down into the sea to investigate. It wasn't dead, just having a mid-fight nap, it one hit me again.10/10 so fun.Jokes aside, this game is genuinely fun. There is a lot of glitches and loopholes which need adressing and obviously that is ok, as it is alpha.Another thing the developers really need to do is to make it so you can really dumb down the graphics. My PC has a terrible graphic cards, and with the settings on fastest very little seemed to actually change and i still had fairly bad lag.Great game in the making though, should buy.			"

												I have been with this game for around 2 or 3 years, best game I have played, so good that even with the bugs come and go as the devs fix them, to note the creation system is a big chunk of the game, I love how it works, still wish they would add plane parts and there ar still a few features that I want them to add,like being able to move the model and copy it after it has been placed,any one new wont understand that but still amazing game and its still being worked on and updated, with anything it needs more fans and people buying to keep the devs on the project past its being released and for them to add dlc or just plain free content, the game has gotten to a point where if those without a good creative mind can download iso files for guns or vehicles that others have made, even seen a xwing and the key blade from kindom hearts, I highly recommand this game even with the few bugs that will get fixed, anything that I have wanted in the game fixed or added has happened so they are on the ball with this game.

								This game (80% positive) is still underated, its truly such a good combination of RPG and open world creativity.I have not had a shot at the multiplayer yet, but I highly doubt that would ruien the game, it can only make it more epic.The trailers do it justice.			"

								This is just a unique game loved it, i will play it for life, for its early access nature i will demand more sound, sound can be added for effects like hit sounds, impact sounds etc... AND its enormous ambience can have more effects like rain, thunders, etc .. Espacially -- NEED MORE SOUNDS !! When im cuting alien flesh, i need the hear that impact sound really o_o			"

												To whomever cares to read.Got this game more than a year ago, Before ARK and all these survival craziness games popped up. It had a brilliant idea and the gameplay was very good. To create and share ANY ISO (weapon, vehicle, etc) it’s astonishing. It’s a game with mods build into its heart.HOWEVER.... in my opinion. The devs made a big mistake trying to update the Unity (forgot witch number). Game was close to a finish date, and due to this new Coding, the setback was ...Huge...The updates were delayed, because they were working on the core of the game again and the momentum was lost.As it is, the game is very much playable. Not finished, but by far well more polished the ARK and some other survival games. (it’s not a ""survival game"" apologies for using ARK as example so much)Multi player it’s quite fun, even though some computer savvy might be needed. Simple player it’s very entertaining. If you have the patience to create this game has the tools to make some majestic creations.About the price drop... Inevitable. Like I mention, after years and development and all this new trend to build/survival games, this game needs an active community, creating, trading ISOs to be enjoyable. so better to drop the price and get more people to join then let the game die after finally ""finished"". Devs kept us updated all the way, and even though i disagree with some decisions made, they were very responding and reliable to finish a game that had great potential and could had been forgotten after their initial success on sales. I recommend this game, and I will keep an eye for future projects.			"

Early Access Review
								To say this game is pretty incredible would be an understatement, but that comes with some major caveats. I am very happy that i paid to support this early access project and i cannot wait for the final product, but i am not sure i am going to allow myself to play further till they expand the content. What I mean by content is not how much the game has to offer but, the way in which the progression takes place. I basically do not want to ruin the experience of this title before it is ready to be enjoyed. While understanding that this game is in alpha right now, in story mode it took less than 3 hours to progress directly from wooden swords to handguns and auto turrets (including processor production for the turrets). This basically meant skipping stone, iron and copper swords/shields/bows varieties, not to mention the countless other recipes that i have completely never had to use. When this game's story mode is quest complete and balanced, i can imagine the necessity of a more balanced progression requiring the use of most recipes encountered. While the game runs pretty reliably, i have had a couple of crashes when switching out of game mode to look up what kind of creature i need to kill to complete a quest. Other bugs seem to be lack of indicating where to click to harvest certain things, text hidden behind mouse cursor, really dumb ai and animals floating in mid air. While the graphics and lighting are stellar the grass textures they are using are animated 2d sprites that rotate normal to the camera, ala trees in mario 64. Pro's: incredible graphicsbeautifully created alien worldfull featured terrain editing/buildinglots and lots and lots and lots of contentCon's:bugs with ai, graphics crashesnot completebalancing issues (too easy)Bottom line this game looks to be a major winner, but i am going to hold out a bit and catch up on some backlog so i can enjoy a more complete experience in a few months.

								I had mixed feelings about this game when i got it first. The building for one thing was not what i expected, and the random landscape generator can be a bit glitched out sometimes. I know this is to be expected for a game like this, when in early access, and there are so many of them that i really have no idea why this one came to mind first. The game is a good idea, but needs a lot of improvements to live up to its title and i supported it because i think in some time it might become something. Some improvements for the game could probably be better player customization, a pre-generated map system, and maybe, in some time, even workshop support for maps, creations, etc. Hopefully by purchasing this game i made a wise decision, and hopefully it will become something in time. (also the first person option broken) But i would recommend this game if you enjoy and like these types of RPG's so in your own time, if you have a spare £19 lying around, give it a try, and if you don'tlike it then, wait for improvements like me			"

								To start off, yes the game is really buggy and DID have slow development. I say DID because they have picked this game back up and sped up the devolopment for than a couple of years ago, but im not saying its fast. they still dwindle a little bit.   Either that or they are working on some huge things. I have really high hopes for this game in general. I believe it has great potentiel Some of the best pros in my opinion of this game is:The voxel creation/customization system.The diversity in the NPCS/Animals.The building and crafting systemVehicles are amazingThe story modeSome of the AI CombatAnimationsExplorationBoss fightingCo-op (kind of, i'll talk about it later)The sandbox. Almost everything is customizable.The open world. This game almost has no limets with that.The NPC trading system.The graphics are really nice to. Still needs a few tweaks but for what it is its good.And it's stability is much greater than what it use to be. The constant crashing made it almost unplayable.Or was it only me that got that? i don't know.Ok i'm to lazy to write out all the cons, because well theres alot. But im going to cover mulitplayer/coopCoop would be really good for this game and its a good game to play with friends, but the coop mode is still in a unstable state. It still works though dont get me wrong, but it can be confusing and i run into alot of problems. This game can be pretty hard going solo and it can go boring after a while to. If i wanted 3 things to be added to Planet Explorers, It would beBetter Coop/multiplayer optimizationMore types of animals/NPCS is always nice, not saying there isen't enough though. Maybe a increase in size for some to? :pAnd maybe better animations, there not the best.:D "

												Fun game overall. Server hosting is kinda wonky.  It would sure be nice if server data were accessible to admins, so various things can be promoted on community sites (active players, map, time of day, weather, etc).  Right now though, you can launch a server with a few customized config tweaks and that is it.  Are the Devs even still active? The most relevant info comes from 2014 forum threads, which indicates a certain staleness in development.			"

												I have been waiting a while to get this game because for a while it was getting many bad reviews. So when it was on sale for 14$ I jumped on the chance to get it. And I haven't been let down. For a matter of fact I haven't been able to play anything else. This game adds many qualities I enjoy from other games into one; Open world,RTS,FPS to name a few I won't lie and say there aren't a few glitchy things but as a early access it is playable. The colony building and the building in general took a bit to get used to but once I did it became crazy fun. Currently playing Story mode and the story, believe it or not, is really engaging. Totally thought it was going to go one way and was taken a different direction. I find myself doing quests more or less just to see what happens next. The crafting system also took a second to get used to. I am used to minecraft and ark type crafting. All in all I say if you enjoy space/futuristic,crafting,building games give this one a chance I don't think you will be disappointed either. Oh and as for the graphics I use a crappy lap top from wal mart on low graphics and it runs fine and the quality isnt bad on fast settings.			"

								Planet Explorers has a great deal of potential. The current state of the game allows you to partake in a very monotanous single player campaign which is dull and slow paced. The multiplayer mode lacks the creation elements that would make this game appealing. There is a lot of work to do in order for this game to be a decent title but from what I have seen and experienced it has potential to be a brilliant title. My advice is to save your money until a decent Beta or the finished game is available.			"

The multiplayer is a breeze to set up. The atmosphere is amazing.After Starforge, I was really hesitant to buy any Early Access Game, no matter how awesome it looked. They oversold their game, and sorely underdelivered their product. Planet Explorers did not do that, and for that, I give this game, as well as it's creators, great respect and high reccomendation.

								This game is a true open world with multiple different things to do sequentially or at the same time. I have over 100 hours logged and have enjoyed them all for the most part. It is an amazing game for building stuff. You can use the built in blocks and shapes to build amazing structures, or you can custom build all sorts of other things using the innovated custom create feature. After you have designed your whatever, you can spawn it into the world and drive it around or place it. For a game of this high level, 2-4 years development is normal. Big box games take just as long with the only difference being the betas are usually closed. Would get gored by angry bear-hippos again!			"

												I wish there was a ""neutral"" option but there isn't so I will attempt to remember to update my review If/When new updates come out that change the game.Overall Problems:      * The game plays like it was Very rushed with very little planning or attention to detail.  It has a very complex building system but no explanation as to how to use it, this could be tolerated in an Alpha game, but this should have been fixed before the game left Beta.      * The dialogue by followers is very cheesy and not vey well thought out as is most of the dialogue in the story.      * Folowers don't obey the settings like passive, stay ect. They also can't help you do anything but attack stuff and cut down trees. they do not mine resources or even collect water.      * There are no real directions or explanation of anything in game, you have to fumble through figuring out how building in every mode works and map settings if you are playing adventure mode.        * No tools to collect resources fast, everything is collected by hand, the colony ""processor"" will collect resources but much slower than you can collect with the lowest level tools.       * Everytime night comes around you get tons of notices that your colonists are too tired to work.        * Your colony Weapons can destroy your own base parts and your own vehicles.       * Colonists don't make their own food, you have to make the food and put it in the storage.       * You have to have all the resources for building in your personal inventory even if you are building with the colony replicator.        * There are still alot of Alpha level bugs.Story mode:      The story is okay, nothing that I would reinstall the game to play again. The conversation text is full of typo's and outright wrong words in places, and the story just ends.Adventure mode:     Adventure mode has several settings, but there is nothing explaining map setup, or tool level progression if you choose that option.  There are also not enough options in world genereation.    If you start with all items scripts already learned and there is no need to interact wil NPC's at all, if you choose to start without all the scrips already learned and you have to do alot of quests to learn to build what you need to start a colony.   Resources in this mode seem to be very deep in the gound with no settings that let you bring them closer to the surface that I was able to find.Multiplayer:        I Played on several servers, the major problem I found was that other players can simply enter build mode and take any materials you place, on one server players just picked up and took all my colony buildings without being part of my colony. ---------------------------------------------------------------------I will recommend this game if you can find the game on sale for $12 usb or less, don't get me wrong, it's an okay game once you figure out how to do everything but I don't think it's worth the $25 usd price they are asking for it.

								This game has a lot of playability and potential... However they are still alot of things left to make. We are bound to one planet so far, i would really like to make a ship to go to other ones for rarer ores perhaps. There could be Predator planets with rare ores and Herbivore/heard planets that would contain alot of herbs and food plants with enourmous resin trees. Now I have a message or proposotion for Dev/Devs of this wonderfull game, You should turn to your comunity to compleate the character creation process. I have seen some really good ISO'S already and there really are talented people here. Perhaps some one could organize a contest for player models and such. If that goes well perhaps the same could do for in game items.Finally, we need  some dedicated servers to host private games with friends. It will only grow the game.			"

But for a alpha game, im 7 hours in and when i was about to get off, i realised i only explored 2 of about 9 zones on the map. this game when done is going to be an amazing 50+ hour adventure. and if you have to justify not spending 15$ for 50 hours of fun, you REALLY must be tight on cash.

												Requested a refund because its not massive multiplayer like it says, this is one of the games where you pick a server that holds up to 32 players every time you play. If it were an MMO i would have kept playing. Other than that it seemed ok if you like singleplayer and or trying to get on the same server so you dont have to start over.			"

								First Impressions:A fairly in-depth open world builder that's easy to get into.  Crafting couldn't be easier (thankfully) as everything you need to craft an item is listed right in front of you.  There are still some bugs (sleeping doesn't seem to restore stamina, etc.) to contend with, but overall I'm having a blast exploring this new realm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YysS3fDKHtY "

								Planet Explorers is like a combination of Halo, Hunting games and Minecraft! It is a game where you can do anything and go just about anywhere you want. You can do just about anything except kill your own people. If you like freedom, survival, alien encounters, hunting, mystery and critical thinking this is your game.Note: The game does have a very sharp learning curve and is extremely complex. So if you are looking for something easy, simple and fast paced this is not it.			"

								This is a game I would LOVE to give a ""thumbs up"" to, but...:-THERE IS NO 1. PERSON VIEW! (I was wrong, se update below).-And that`s my only major problem with this game, and the ONLY reason wy I`m giving it a ""thumbs down"".If you don`t have a problem running around with an unrealistic ""hovering camera"" behind you and maybe a little less immersion (do to the fact that you can`t see trough the eyes of your character) Then I have no problem recommending this game!-There is a ton of stuff to do and explore and to build in this game. The developers seem responsive and the updates do come relatively consistent.-So, if you like 3. person view GET IT :-) It`s definitely worth it for you, just not for me :-(BTW, I will update this review when or if 1. person view is implemented.______________________________________________________________Update as of March 23, 2016:-The game has first person view and can be toggled by pressing the F5 button.So my reason for giving this a ""thumbs down"" was incorrect, and all that's left is the positive about this game...!-I DO recommend this game now :-)			"

								I played game again, because I recall it's potential. TLDR; wait another year or maybe two.Game has lots of problems. Many are solved over course of development, but there are still so many things are left before it's ready. I can't recommend it now. Wait year or two. I seen many dead early access games to recommend to buy this even with discount.Good things:- story mode is totally playable and enjoyable, quests are much easier to progress, storyline is intriguing, too many will die though;- adventure mode feels really good, rising skills, hunting, fighting, making money, exploring;- editor with templates and community made content is cool, it's easy to figure out things by looking at someone's creations;- game doesn't crash at all (could be subjective as I had my PC upgraded);Bad things:- it needs polishing;- it need bugfixes.I am really up to play adventure mode, probably in multiplayer with friends, but I have too strong beta-tester-feelings when playing it. It's simply not ready yet.Below is my old review, pros are still, cons are partially still true (which is very sad).---I must say it's very pretty and addictive game. But in current state I can't recommend it. It has huge potential, idea with building own colony and surviving is cool. But will it become a good game someday? I don't know.Pros:- huge world, different biomes, fauna and flora;- tier-progressing: wood, stone, etc.- many interesting concepts: items builder, monorail, colony-management;- vehicles!Cons:- nothing (!) in game is polished yet, anything you do will smell alpha-version: digging (animation, sound and what is happening is desync), chopping trees (and looking inside empty model of tree);- crappy UI: HD resolution will blow your eyes, ""moving"" windows (when you want to drag item), crapy inventory design (tabs in 3 categories);- poor perfomance and high demanding engine (it crashes every hour no matter which settings);- very steer learning curve without much assistance (save-load a lot or dig a lot, up to you);- balance is poor: lack of farming motivation (digging 1000 resources is basically enough until end of game and it take only few minutes to get so much), lack of exploring motivation (you will find nothing interesting);- quests: be ready to stumble or use reload when doing any quest, they are buggy as a hell;- vehicles.

								Game have a big potential. You can build whatever you want. Even your own weapons or cars etc. But its not ready. Its early access and still have more bugs than lets say Kerbal Space Program. Basically on every mission there is at least one bug you need to figure out how to avoid and thats anoying. Developers should focus on fixing current bugs rather than adding more features thus another stockpile of bugs. No offence to devs, they are doing good work but I think its time to do some fixing rather than adding more fancy stuff. If you are ok with bugs and like to help devs then you can buy this game but if you want game without big issues than you should wait for final release.			"

												The game is too slow moving and the difficulty ramps up to impossible as soon as you finish the tutorial.  It feels like it needed more time easing the game play loop's difficulty curve.  I baught this to play with a friend and didn't have fun after the first two hours.  I'd avoid this.  This is the type of game you won't know doesn't suit you till the refund timelimit passes.The game has good ideas, but the execution needs refinement.  I'll revisit this later if I hear of any updates that improve things.  There is a good game in here, it just needs to be polished a bit more.Update: 3/31As I said I would, I gave this another try for about another 2 hours.  The lack of instruction on what the options actually mean when creating a multiplayer game was very frustrating.  It was also very frustrating when you would play with the tech tree on and you have no option to filter out things you don't have the skill to craft.  Also, the crafting drop down to let you move to a section, like... armor to helmets, doesn't work.  Typing was also buggy, sometimes it didn't accept me hitting enter or sometimes glitched.We managed to have fun once we turned off the tech tree and figured out that we didn't need to find the nodes in the mineral scanner to find some materials needed for crafting, but it would have been nicer if this was better explained to us instead of us just having to find it out.Still, can't recommend this.  If this were in early access I could forgive a lot of the bugs I and my friend ran into, but you released it, so I can't just give you the ""Well... it's in EA"" excuse.  There can be fun in this, but the bugs will irritate you.If you can put up with it though, it can be fun, but I'm dissapointed by the number of bugs I had run into that ripped me out of the experience.If my opinion changes as I play it I will update the review once again with more details.

Early Access Review
								Ill start with what I liked about the game:The single player is fairly fun, it has quests and the like. Crafting system is very basic and the UI is easy to understand. Graphics are nothing to write home about but are okay and playable in my opinion. The custom content creator is VERY cool which you can make custom 3D vehicles and weapons after getting used to it for about 10 minutes. The content you made can be seen in-game right after you make it (after you purchase it and materials). Its also a voxel game which means the mining and everything is in 3D as opposed to minecraft where its all blocks. Combat can also be fun against certain mobs and large boss monsters. The vehicles and equipment can be fun to use like the jetpack + glider.Why I don't recommend it:First of all the game has been in development for about 3 years now and I still feel like its VERY unfinnished. Most of my complaint is the multiplayer. The lobby is REALLY buggy and attempting to connect to friends can be a pain. Me and my friends played it for about 25 or so hours (steam says only 10 because it disables after you close the launcher) and we pretty much did all that you can do in the game and quickly got bored. Building structures is very lame and unrewarding as there is practically no actual use for them other than aesthetics (they also look terrible). It also feels very awkward to build and you don't get much choice in materials and objects to use. The survival element is mostly just fighting off monsters. Which until you can afford to buy weapons, is almost impossible. You also have NO reason to craft items as you can BUY everything via in-game shop which after you just mine random ores and sell it you can buy anything you want fairly quickly, you get end-game content in under an hour if you wanted.I feel like the game is VERY lackluster in content and will only keep you entertained for 30 hours at most before you get bored of it. They say they will release the game sometime in 2014 and if they do at this state then that means this game is a ripoff. There was also plenty of bugs but because it is early access I won't have that as a reason for my unrecommendation.			"

								Backed this game on kickstarter, and backing it here.This game is not for every one. You've got to be patient. It's an alpha and by that I mean a real alpha. Not those comercial ones you can see every where. It's far from finished and has been in developement for a long time : the team is small. But they d'ont give up their game like so many and they push on, polishing it. I have more than a hundred hours of this game before the early access and it keeps getting better, slowly but surely.Trust me when I tell you that this game once finished will be great. For the moment there are lots of flaws, clunkyness and a few bugs. But they keep improving. This is one of those game where you should keep an eye on if you can't play alpha.My favorite part of this game ? The item creation system. I almost feel like I'm in 3Dsmax. Oh and you can destroy every thing. Well almost. Close enough for me hehe.			"

								I was really enthusiastic about this game at first. Now I'm not so sure. There are a lot more sandbox survival games coming out that have a lot of the same features that I'd like to try out. I feel like Planet Explorers has used a lot of their resources on the wrong things, maybe?I´ve also had problems with the game crashing on load on both my Macbook Pro and my brand new Digital Storm gaming PC running Windows 8. There are a lot of stability problems that have not been improved in the year since I first got the game.In any case, it's not worth $25, especially for early access. (Please get your voice actors back to finish their lines.) If it were only $15 I'd definitely say go for it. But check out a Let's Play on YouTube to decide for sure for yourself. Maybe you should try Subnautica instead.I´m going to hold out until the next UI update, but if some of the weird quirks don´t get fixed, I´m giving up.			"

								(version 0.86) So 6 hours of play time and then the game totally stuffs up and I cant load a single saved game.  Hours of fun searching forums for fixes that dont work, and Im forced to start again... FARK!!!!!So far the game looks great, seems like a lot of fun, has potential, but all of that is ruined when the game isnt properly playable.  I know its ""early access"" but I am SO SICK of that BS excuse devs generally pull out to explain any problems.  You release a game and charge people real money for it, then something basic like loading a saved game fails... leaves a pretty sour taste. (See Update below for possible fix)After 26 hours of play and having (apparently) completed Act 2 of the story, Im about to give up until the next update... I currently cant move anywhere north of the plains zone without the game crashing. Pros:+ Graphics are decent for a voxel game+ Engaging gameplay (think minecraft but more detailed and mature)+ Sounds arent too bad but need refining for distance / ambience effects+ Story campaign is interesting enough so far and a good way to learn the mechanics etc+ Intereting item / building mechancsCons:- Save game issues mentioned (ranted about) above- fairly sparse world - needs more living things- camera needs some work- AI pathfinding needs some improving- Creatures will chase you FOREVER until you kill them or die- Fighting is a little rudimentary- Quest / story bugs...losing track of NPCs etc- MANY random crashes seemingly for no reasonVerdict:Buy it on special and wait until its a bit more ironed out before playing it.  Once the problems are fixed Ill probably change this to a ""Yes"" reccomendation :)Update:  Turns out the work-around for the save / load issue is to *only* save very far away from where you dig (particularly around the crater), and *not* to dig below sea level... so basically go back to a camp and save there.  Seems to work so far.Note: I am updating this review as I play more...10 Months Later:  Not much has changed.  The game is still half finished and a little broken.  This is why I dont buy Early Access anymore.			"

								I bought this game in 2014 early in its development because I thought it had potential, played it a bit and decided to leave it on the shelf for later. Last week I started a new game to see how things where going and it got me hooked! As it is now the single player story (which is well conceived and interesting btw) and the ISO editor (you can design vehicles, submarines, helicopters, boats, guns, armor, etc) are worth dozens of hours of fun. Its a sort of modern futuristic minecraft with a more elegant and advanced crafting system and UI that I very much enjoy. Highly recommended, can't wait for the final version.			"

												I'm a little surprised that this is going to ""finished' status shortly............it's not really lived up to the hope I had for it. I played it for a little while a year or so back and there were so many bugs, still seems like there's a lot of issues. Also a lot of ""features"" that they ""hoped for"" that of course never made it in. I think there are better options out there for a better price. Not one of my favourites sadly.Update as of January 31st, 2017. Still awful. I agree with all the other comments made recently about how unpolished the game is. Not only that........but they dropped the price? Feel ripped off like a lot of other people and wish I could get my money back........If you like this style of game, get Empyrion, it goes on sale regularly at 50% off, so you can get it for 10 bucks and it's in EA, but already lightyears ahead of this game. Save yourself the time and money, get something else.			"

								As it stands right now, the game is what I'd call early proof-of-concept. It's playable to a degree, but gets old very quickly. The game's UI needs some serious flow tweaks - right now, even with the tutorial system in place, the UI doesn't provide enough information to get a player going. Luckily, you can skip over most of the broken bits. Once you're on the 'planet', there's an handful of quests that you can do, but the flow quickly rears its ugly head and the 'game' is more a set of chores.Perhaps in 5 years time, the game will be closer to what the developer envisioned. As for now, however, it will sit in my game library until it gets beyond a POC.			"

I get a ""fatal error"" upon launching the game, and none of the menus fit in my screen. I also can't connect to nor start a game if my life depended on it.I'll review this game for real upon release.			"

								This game is amazing. At first, it just seems like a nice solo survival game, but then it morphs into a game where you're creating your own equipment voxel-by-voxel (you can use others' creations if you don't want to design it yourself), building a colony, and managing a group of survivors. In single player, there's a campaign that is well written and interesting. Just with what's in the game now I can highly recommend it. I've played 80 hours up to this point, and I can easily say it's one of my best Early Access experiences. Development speed is on the slow end of the spectrum, but steady. Each release is sizeable, which makes for an interesting replay. Also, the music is fantastic. Seriously.			"

								I did not have high hopes for this game at first glance, but I was pleasantly surprised when I gave it a try.  Planet Explorers is a joy to play and you can pretty much build anything you want. I've only played the single player portion of the game and I will be enjoying it for a long time yet to come. Eventually, I will get to multi player and check it out but for now single player is keeping me satisfied.  I highly recommend this game and I hope the devs continue to follow through with its development as I believe this game has massive potential. My recommendation is if you like to build, dream, create and enjoy a good story line you won’t be disappointed if you buy this game.			"

								As it stands right now, the game is what I'd call early proof-of-concept. It's playable to a degree, but gets old very quickly. The game's UI needs some serious flow tweaks - right now, even with the tutorial system in place, the UI doesn't provide enough information to get a player going. Luckily, you can skip over most of the broken bits. Once you're on the 'planet', there's an handful of quests that you can do, but the flow quickly rears its ugly head and the 'game' is more a set of chores.Perhaps in 5 years time, the game will be closer to what the developer envisioned. As for now, however, it will sit in my game library until it gets beyond a POC.			"

-Updated Review-05/10/16EVERYTHING IM REVIEWING HERE IS MY PERSONAL OPINION.So please stay open minded!so as of recently gaining interest in the game once again, i decided to give it another shot!and while the game is fantastic in certian areas it has flaws. some extreme that need addressed and some minior that you can make do with on whatever mode you are playing. first let me just get straight to the point on a issue that needs to be resolved as of now, and il go into the pro's and cons of the game :)The game has moved from a 32bit version to 64bit only version (for now - 32bit will follow but with severly reduced features). the developers are extremely active on the discussions page on steam for the game, so if any questions or concerns with the game that need to be addressed you can post there knowing that a dev will reply in that very day you posted the thread.for anyone interested in the game that has a somewhat mid range PC, Please Be Aware the game is still in beta and optimzation is still a high priority for the devs (judging by comments left on discussions) however.. if you are just slightly above the ""Minimal System Requirements"" chances are you wont get that great of a gaming experience.the game is primarily GPU intesive and RAM instesive, IMHO the min specs need to be adjusted because a 460 wont even net you a stable 30FPS with the lowest settings (Fastest). im going to give a personal thought on what the min specs should be, just to serve as a guide line for for new purchasers and also to serve as what would be acceptable in terms of FPS!OS: Win 7/ 8 / 8.1/ 10 - 64bitProcessor: Quad Core - i5 2600k or better - 3.2GHz or better Memory: 8+ GB RAM Graphics: GTX 580 or better (dunno about AMD but look up the equivelent)DirectX: Version 10 / 11Network: Broadband Internet connection Storage: 10+ GB available space (SSD Recommend)Additional Notes: Must have OpenCL compatible CPU or GPU (DX10.1) 32bit can run, but will experience - Extremely bad frame rate / Slow load times for both 32/64bit (devs know about this issue and working on it) and the game has alot of crashes!i say these should be the new min specs because a dual core just simply wont cut it when you get to a certian stage in the game that requires you to make a colony. as soon as you start filling your colony, Your FPS will plummit... HARD! people have said they play fine at 50-60 or even 80-90FPS but when they start filling their colony and hit max population. they say their game hangs around the 18-26FPS / 24-33FPS range!now that the rambling is all done, onto the pro's and consPro's:- Fantastic Huge world to explore (in Single player)- Adventure offers unbound freedom (Randomly generated worlds)- Great World Editor- Amazing creation system (build miscellaneous objects / funriture / guns / cars / planes / heli's / boats / shields etc)- Great in world building - Decent colony managment - Good survival aspectsCons:- Story line is meh (not that appealing)- Voice acting could be better- Some aspects not really that well explained- Clunky camera positioning - very bad mouse options (using anything that requires aiming like bows and guns etc has a crap ton of mouse acceleration, not options displayed in settings)if your PC can handle the game, it serves as a very fun and entertaining game that allows people to build in some ways whatever they like.Total Score:7/10			"

								Wonky controls, obvious bugs, poor performance, and how it is marketed on steam completely killed this for me under 2 hours.  ""Its an early access,"" So bloody what? For $25.00 there are much better games out there with similar mechanics.  This game was released on steam in 2014 and the progess since (now August 2015) is woeful.   This ""new"" OpenCL voxel system fails to bring anything new to the table compared to other titles.			"

								Terrain destruction is nice, best part of the game. The mineral detector is useless and the UI is bad.Most of the UI is like Unity basic black UI. The dinosaur AI is like ""Bane of the 4 leggers"" ""reference from morrowind"" I'm not sure whats up with that but when a dinosaur hits me I can't see the effect. It gets worse when I actually got stuck inside a dinosaur and was doing amazing damage until the game crashed. The NPC missions are functional but often confusing.Final Attack	The dinosaurs attack at an epic ending which was so unrealistic and stupid. Dinosaurs don't attack turrets on sight they are not super AIThis game could be so awesome if the focus was on the terrain destruction which was good and not throwing cheap dinosaur models the the GPU.

								Aw yes, Planet Explorers. An excellent game in my most humblest of opinions (I'm probably the most humble guy there is, so I'd trust my judgement if I were you). Invariably fun, fully entertaining, and fully addicting. I've been playing non-stop for the last 127 hours. I haven't eaten, bathed, drank or even got up to use the restroom in all that time. And speaking of not using the restroom; I'm currently selling some quite stained socks if anyone is interested. They uhhh fell in some chocolate pudding... Believe me when I say that 'I definitely didn't defecate into those socks'. Don't ask me why I quoted that statement and I won't tell you how I invented a new type of poopsock, thus avoiding the possibility of breaking my immersion. All jokes aside though - Planet Explorers is a really really great game that is well worth the money. I hope the devs continue their awesome work. I suggest that any who read this should buy it immediately - before the price goes up (not that I know it will, but Early Access games commonly do when fully released). Buy it this very minute or you might be convinced to waste the rest of your holiday cash moneys on some guy's used poopsocks and totally regret it. You just KNOW he's gonna spend it all on new socks. I mean, he can't use the old ones, can he? Well, can he? I'm just asking for a uh friend because 127 hours seems about long enough for dooky squirts to dry. It could create what in scientific communities, is called: 'dooky shards', and they are both painful to be scratched by and will sometimes lead to Sepsis of the feet. Noone wants Septic feet right? Buy Planet Explorers.			"

								Boring game. Seems cool from the preview videos but nobody plays it. So if you're the kind of person who finds enjoyment by yourself with some Lego's and your imagination then you'll probably like this game... but the story mode is kind of empty and lacking... and multiplayer had 5 people on the busiest server... all spread out over the map not even interacting with eachother. There was only one PVP enabled server and it had 2 people on it. Games like this need an active world but instead of the game company running the servers and pushing players to populate one server they allow all kind of people to start their own server and if there is any one on it, its usually like one person. If I could get my money back on this game I would. Maybe in the future more people will play it and it will be worth spending money on... but if you're sick of wasting money on games through Steam that you hardly play... then keep moving. This will probably be one of those.			"

What I liked: Sanbox to build and craft whatever you want Nice progression of items and techWhat You Need to Know: This game is so unpolished it's like it's still in early access Ok first voice acting is so terrible, why have it if it's bad, just leave it with text only. Trust me it would make the game better Next you have the combat which is so lackluster it makes factorio's combat look amazing. The enemies,some look intersting at first but their animations are lame, attacks are lackluster and overall the combat is floaty and underwhelming. So if your looking for depth in the combat look elswhere.  The first 15 or so hours is fantastic, you get to know the planet, what kills you, new minerals, quest that reward you with new crafting items, and great progression that reminds me of Terraria. After that the quests don't give rewards anymore. This made me not care to progress any further because I seem to have experienced most the game So what is the draw of the game if combat, questing, voice acting and the world get old quick. Well you can design and make your own armor, weapons, and vehicles in their version of of 3D modeling program, (think Besiege but more time comsuming, and you make the whole item from scrath if you want it custom, or just use the templates and modify them) The other draw is building up a base with your own colony with buildings that help you in gathering resources, building complicated crafting items and a place to defend if you want to go all Tower Defense in this game The beginning of the game is so packed with stuff to do, but the late game is filled with so many boring quests it made me quit playing the game, with that said, I will have to not recommend it, even though I enjoyed it for a while I love the factorio style crafting, building your own planes, helicopters and weapons and colony aspect, even though I can't get my self to finish the game right now.My Score:DPrice: 25Main reason for dislike: It's a jack of trades kind of game, lots of mechanics but none are fully polishedGames that it relates to:  Factrio (crafting and colony production) Terraria (Progression early game) Besiege( buidling aspect) "

												I have been playing since the game was still barely going through kickstart, so i have way more that the 33 hours. I really enjoy everything it has, at first through all the bugs when i first started playing, there where things like the main story glitching out, but so far, none of that has happened, the game has a slow start, you can just rush through mission and expect to get them all done, you have to slow down a bit and build your first weapons, not the scripts given, like actually create your own weapon, that way they do more damage and makes harder mobs a little bit easier. if you are a creative person, you will love this game, you can design all your stuff that you want to wear, if you want to be a lego man, go crazy, if you want to look like you are from skyrim, sure, why not.If you aren't a creative person, well they have a way you can actually download  other peoples creations [planet-explorers-isos.com]  or  and use them yourself so that you aren't stuck with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ basic weapons and get stuck. The limit on the game is the limit of your imagination. Pros: Havn't found many bugs Always find new 'wow' factors Really cool concept Create everything from Helicopters, to boots you are wearing Multiplayer Always something new to findCons: Sound is buggy, it will sometimes overlay sounds or be very staticy  Gathering resorces is almost a painstaking process, quite slow *its decent if you have your followers helping, or playing  mulitplayer* Creating new things takes awhile if you are trying to be very detailed Sometimes you will be flying through valleys or cliffsides and you companions will try and fight some random mob and get themselves killed "

Character constantly feels like they are running on ice. Keeps moving forward even after you. Voice acting is just horrible. Music will drive you insane. and the sound affects......holy hell! this game has an amazing amount of promise. Though the sluggish wonkey controls, unintuitive combat system, all game sounds in general and poor execution hold this game back.visually it is stunning. concept is great. but a game needs far more than pretty graphics and neat concepts to be good.

								Game has gone backwards in development. I feel like I paid money to be a beta tester on a project that doesn't know where its going. Game has a lot of performance issues. More than it should at this stage. This game is one of the reasons I won't buy early access anymore. It's not even worth it on sale.			"

								If you have patience and don't mind waiting for something that will be special, get this game!  I might just buy it for some of my friends anyways!Random thoughts on the game:Game has tons of potential, the horrendously slow development time has been a pain in the butt, but at least they've not given up on it!Compared to the many other voxel games out there, I feel that this one allows you the most creativity and customization, just on a much smaller scale.  You can import your own textures and decals so that alone gives you nearly unlimited design possibilities.You want to make an exact replica of a WW2 Tommy Gun complete with serial numbers etched into the gun, you can!  You want to make an Apache Longbow on a 1:1 scale?  You can!  You want to make a wooden pirate ship?  You can!Trying to make a solid glass material, I accidentally made a block that changes color with the time of day, I call it a happy accident!Downside, no real flying vehicles, the airships may ""fly"", but they still handle like a car and can't even go over many trees.  Fortunately the hit boxes for the larger trees are ignored and you can go through them.Quests are a little buggy at times, but I am happy to notice that they are usually fixed as the community points them out and ones that aren't fixxable with a patch usually fix themselves after you save your game and reload it.

								Until this game is completly finished, I would not buy it, even if it is on sale. This game has been in Alpha for a solid year and a half and probably will still be early access for another 2 or 3 years based on how slow the devs are working on this game. There are still bugs from day 1 that are in this game, and while it is fun to play for a short amount of time, you will get borded of this game in about a week. This game does have a lot of potential, and I feel if the devs truly buckeled down and finished this game there could be a lot to offer. However right now this is just a shell of a game. There are lots of bugs and this game will crash/freeze alot. I personally feel like this game was a cash grab and it shouldn't have been released until far later. The devs have made many promises with the game but have failed to deliever them after almost 2 years since they opened the game.			"

												Man, I can clearly see how much thought and foresight went into this game.  I think what caused many of the problems is probably lack of budget or time.  I am not a surivival game fan, but I really do enjoy this one even with its horrible controls and annoying and restricting UI system (why can't I expand the number quick slot for example?)Avoid melee combat at all costs, you will hate the game.  Focus on getting a bow and always keep arrows available.  Guns are easy to make, but bullets are tough.  Use guns as a back up / emergency.  Just go with the bow.So yea .... i am enjoying the game; they REALLY need to change the controls and UI system.			"

								GREAT Prospects with this game!A friend and I just started playing this and in seeing the potential, I can't wait to see the finished product! It will be what a sandbox should be.The fact that YOU can create what YOU want and not what a Dev gives you is stupendous, you don't have to see the same vehicle on every player or the same airship or house.I hope they fully flush out the mmo portions so that we are able to play together, as of right now we are enjoying the Storymode(seperately) portion of the game as a learning tool. But would be excellent to play with friends without having to set up a private server which seems a bit complicated and resourse heavy. Definately worth the Alpha phase of testing and enduring some bugs			"

								Planet explorers is the best open world sand box game that I have everr played. The combat is excellent with many different types of weapons to use and a wide variety of animals and aliens to hunt and all of them give some type of resource upon killing them, usually meat or some item that can be sold to vendors for currency. The crafting system is excellent and has many armor pieces that can be crafted out of differnt level resources from wood to diamonds. The crafting system also allows you to design and build custom armor, weapons, and aircraft/vehicles/boats all with their own individual stats based on what material you used and how much of that material is in the design. You can also manage a colony and build many useful buildings in the colony such as replicator, training station, repair facilities and more. You can build a tram in the game world and then ride in that tram. There are many quests to do in the story mode. There is a good farming system once you have a colony set up. There is a lot of things to do in this game. I highly recommend it.			"

								Don't waste your money.I bought this about a year ago, it showed a lot of promise. Then there were no updates for a longtime. Excuse is port to unity5. It feels like they've gone completely backwards and are still porting what they had.I'm not a fan in general of early access, and this one hasn't helped. I tried the demo, thought there was enough there to buy, and feel like the second I handed over my money development stopped.New things they are adding I'm not a fan of. The skill system already looks like something that is going to ruin this game (just like 7DaystoDie). I don't understand why every game wants to try to do everything and do it badly. It's not enough to have arbitrary tiers, lets slap arbitrary skill requirements on them, oh and make you research the stuff as well. That is the sure sign of ""we've reached the point of we don't have anything left so let's turn it into a long boring grind so you don't realize what a lack of content there really is"".So many games right now with so much promise,especially of the ""Futuristic Minecraft-type clone with better graphics"" (which in and of itself is not a bad thing)  it would be nice to see 1 actually get finished.

								I have had the game for a pretty long time. I don't play often anymore since they hardly ever update the project. Overall its a fun game, probably one of the most important metrics for sure. However there are a plethora of bugs (game is in alpha after all so a certain number is expected), game performance has been terrible since release in the adventure mode for the game. Story mode while not complete gives you acceptable performance. Probably mainly due to the fact that its a static world and not randomly generated.May want to avoid the games forums (the official ones, not the steam ones) though they are kinda dead, and the few people who are there won't take any critique of their precious game. (thats fanboys for ya, right?)Overall the game showed ALOT of promise when I bought it over a year ago. However since then development has slowed to a crawl (though they did release an update today I see) and it is starting to be outpaced both graphically and innovation wise by newer EA titles like Empyrion: Galactic Survival, Ark: Survival Evolved (even though that one is more mmo) and several other EA survival titles. So in my opinion, skip it for now till they finish intigrating unity 5, and hopefully start putting the pieces back together from the switch over to the new engine. Play one of the other survival games for now. I strongly recommend Empyrion if you want to be able to get off world and have a good quality first person mode.			"

								This is an excelent game concept, beautiful art, beautiful crafting engine. It solves the long standing probem of purposlessness in open world sandbox games. I deeply love this game.The down side is it's wildly unstable to the point of largely spoiling the experience.			"

												This game has huge support from the devs. I have been playing this since early developement. I am so very impressed with this release version that I am playing it again from the start. If you turned away from this game during its early stages, I recommend taking another look. I believe you will not be disappointed. The amount of area that you can explore is absolutely huge. The AI for the monsters is continuously improving. The best part of the game is the custom vehicles, weapons and even robots. All of which you can use nearly anywhere. Great Game! Keep up the good work Devs.			"

												First purchased: AMAZING!! support this game! i cant belive its in alpha stage. i have seen ""finished"" games that were crap compared to this. if i had money to invest i would demand they take my money! im glad i bought this game and look forword to months of fun!After 78 hours of play..Open world, planet exploration, deep crafting system; make amazing things that really work, resource gathering, RPG, sandbox builder. This game is literally what you make of it. planet conqueror, emissary of peace and development, mad builder of gadgets and gizmos, explorer and resource specialist. you will start the story mode with a knife and hatchet. you will end story mode with high tech weapons, vehicles ,and impenetrable fortresses. all resourced designed and built by you! cons: budget priced video cards do not handle opengl as effectivly as directx. but even on medium settings the game is stunning!

								I have about 75 hours total on this game. Many of them were spent playing when i had no internet, so steam didnt record them. This game is, in a word, alright. While the speculated end result of this game is something very appealing, the game right now just isn't that. It has a clunky UI, weird movement mechanics, dumb AI, and lots of bugs. However, it has an interesting story, an awesome creation sharing system, and a truly destructible world, and an advanced vehicle creator, which make for a fun late game. Once you get used to the mechanics and get used to the weird and clunky UI you'll enjoy the time you spend in this game. It sucks that the map is limited right now, but im sure with time it will improve.			"

								First off this game is alpha in my opinion unfinished games being released on steam is ruining steam and the titles released on early access, that said this is probably the best early access game i've played, disappointing areas are hit confirmation in combat, easily fixed but for some reason isn't. The other is the lack of user friendly tools in the editor in particular copy and paste. Positive areas are the game is relatively stable, plenty of content in plants animals and user creation through the editor, I realise the editor has been listed as both one of the best things and worst things of this game, that's early access for you9/10			"

The clincher was that there was a 40% discount and I've been wanting to try a game like this. Its a ""start from nothing"" sort of game where you begin with minimal equipment and resources and gradually craft better things from gathered materials.In the storyline, you have crashlanded on an alien planets with a few friends to help you survive in a hostile environment. The landscape is fully destructable and there is a mode where you can design your own equipment and buildings.			"

								ok so after Playing a few hours in this game I LOVE this and Recomend to EVERYONE with an Nvidia 9800GT graphics Card or Higher (for the Open CL codeing) to get this My card is at the low end of this program But still runs well enough.as for the gameplay Customizer is great BUT quite Finnicy to use we should have and Eraser Brush tool not a 4 click WTF thing to cut bits away from our creations. Despite this I got the hang of it in 2 hours and made the Shreadder (copper blade with stone Teeth and holds cut threw it) which can four hit all starting creatures.my last ponit of contention is the Controls the Key Board Controls are great Just like D&D Neverwinter so easy to pick up if you played that one though there are alot of differences. BUT the PC controller section is lacking my only control is forwerd and back none of the buttions respond and theres no rebind option for them or there is and its not working Please fix.But the digging is what I love I spent 4 hours just digging and mining broke 4 wooden picks and 2 wooden shovels. also I love the wide variety of plants I can't wait to do some Gardening with the seeds (once I can Protect them that is) and as for the features yet to be implamented PLESE DEAR GOD give me Fishing, Herding, and Pet Tameing.Lastly for Vehicles Please encorperate all 3 types of Mech (from the over all genre) which are Powered EXO Suits (starcraft Marine or Aliens Loaders) the Virti-Tank (like Mechwarrior) and the Mecha (like Gundums, Power Ranger Zords, etc..) I hope to have all 3 and have certain roles for them like type 1 EXO suit can have Huge heavy infantry weapons and digging tools, same ast the type 3 Mecha's while the type 2's are just scout and combat types.Hurry up with my MECHS!ok going to go play more!

								I recommend this game because its fun to run around, dig, build, create.  One can experiment with architectural design.  That's enough for me to be satisfied but the game as a story has major problems:Be prepared to be frustrated with bugs in the story line.  I've played this game on and off for a while, seen it go through quite a few versions.  On an earlier version I was able to play through story mode pretty far, as far as the developers had written.  My saves were erased with an upgrade and given the amount of time I had spent crafting a delightful and luxurious base, I became discouraged.  I tried to restart, to plod through the storyline with its many fetch-type quests but with another upgrade those saves got erased too.  Recently I came back to the game and have been having fun with it again.  Strangely, though, I cannot get very far in the story quests.  They are extremely buggy.  The story quests appear to have actually become quite a bit MORE buggy since the last time I'd played it.  I can't get past the first quest (a critical character has irretrievably disappeared, and was just reading about the second quest having a high likelihood of a massive game ending type bug also.It is difficult to program games and I respect the hard work.  That being said, I recommend the developers focus on making the core gameplay stable instead of pursuing shiny, new, additional features with each update. I fear/suspect the game has been dropped as a serious development project and that core bugs will not be fixed.  It appears to be used as a template for experimentation instead.  That's cool but It would be nice to be able to actually play it.			"

								So far I am having a lot of fun with this game. The store page doesn't really do it justice. There are plenty of good reviews out there written far better than I could, but if the idea of a sci-fi version of Minecraft with a lot more depth, better base building, and an awesome system for making your own cars, helicopters, airplanes, swords, guns, base decorations and more I highly suggest looking at video reviews OR... downloading the game demo from the PE Pathea website. Not only that, the game is still being developed.However, the game is not without plenty of bugs being in alpha. Stuff does not always work as you expect. Vehicles may randomly shoot into the air. Framerates can randomly drop or stay very low. The game can crash randomly. You may or may not get an error message. Memory leaks exist. In short, it has issues but has a lot of potentional.			"

								I honestly want to recommend this game, but I just can't.      Environments become a bit bland after a few minutes, and often fail to load.If you even think about using a jetpack or hang glider for any distance you're doomed, as every time I used them I ended up clipping through the ground and getting trapped below the world.Animations are awkward and combat is just boring.        Now I will admit that the crafting system is fun, being able to dig tunnels and build bases, but the building system is so complecated that by the time you've mastered it you will probably be out of creative energy and just want to play something else.        Basically, if they would clean up the animations, simplify the menu's and building system, and put some serious time into fixing their landscapes, this could be a really fun game, but it is seriously shackled by these shortcomings.

								UPDATE:  Well after 1 year, I am eagerly awaiting full release of PE, and Grav, well, I stopped playing that last year.  Toxic community and not much depth.  PE is still amazing and even better now.I don't know about the other reviews, the game is being very actively developed, just check the log.  There is a new beta release about monthly.   It's also Early access, bugs are to be expected and then you give feedback.  I see so many early access reviews complaining about bugs.    Pretty awesome game and it's still in early access.  I also got Grav around the same time and both games are fun but each is different in big ways.  I had debated on which one to get for a while but in the end I got both thanks to my brother and his generosity. Both game are beautiful with  bright and varied environments.  This will not be a review of Grav, I'll just briefly touch on some of the main differences.Planet Explorers Story mode is the single player mode.  It has NPCs, missions and a story line.  I've only been playing Grav solo because the free weekend seems to have brought some griefers into the multiplayer servers and I wasn't about to deal with that, so I can't speak too much to the public multiplay, though I did set up a server for a friend and me to play.  Grav's single player is more just about exploration, but there are some tasks that you get some rewards for.The story in Planet Explorers is pretty in depth so far.  You'll meet a lot of NPCs, with a lot of missions and rewards.  The biggest difference is with the crafting systems.  Planet Explorers is insanely cool when it comes to this.  In Grav you're working with about 10 resources that you'll need to craft pre-designed items, such as a jetpack or monocycle.  You'll have different workbenches for creating different items.  Planet Explorers has a lot more resources for creating things.  And then you'll create a few things to create bigger things, and then there is a custom editor built into the game for designing weapons, cars, planes, etc...There is no pre-made car, you have to build the wheels, cockpit, engine, fuel cell and then build it and export it into your world.  For example when I had to build a car for a mission, I needed wood and rubber for the wheels, steel, iron and motherboard for the enginer, and to make that motherboard I needed plastic and copper wiring.  This may sound tedious, but it isn't because you can click on a component in the crafting window and it will then open that component so you can click on the ingredients and make them and traverse the heirarchy that way.  It's VERY easy to quickly make components and see which components will create which parts.  You then go into the ISO editor (the name for a custom creation is ISO), which is like a modeler if you're familiar with 3D Modeling.  You'll place the 4 wheels, cockpit, engine, fuelcell and then build your car however you want.  If you google Planet Explorer ISOs you'll find websites devoted to models that you can download and play with.  There are turrets and lots of guns, it's amazing what people have done with this.  Grav has been fun so far, it's a different game.. and Planet Explorers is amazing and fun too.TL;DR: Planet Explorers is amazing because you can create a lot of custom content very easily using many parts and resources.  The story mode is very indepth.			"

												amazing game worth the time and its still being update with more and more hoping for marrying and pets and much more also editor very easy to use when you know how to and its great you can make your own things Edit: A lot of reviews i am seeing of the game are of stupid people who think the finished game will run on their potatoes even though it use too i have looked over all the reviews and not once have a seen an actaully review that was not recommanded and talked about something other then it not running smoothly honestly they are all stupid it runs fine and perfect if you got a good computer, you know one to run other amazing games on, now to the other thing id like to say the devs i give them praise and say they have done a wonderful job already with the game and story in the game there is tons they have created for this game and hard work put into this, they even kept to all thier promises so far but instead you all want to bash them and say its terrible but it is not terrible i mean look what any other sand box game lets you make your own vechiles, items, armors, swords, guns, and much more and have huge land to explore and create colonies and have followers and much more this game has come a very long way and they still update it they still working on it to add more things for you people, you people dont deserve to even play a game all cause you felt wronged by them cause your computer cant handle the game the devs even respond to reviews and comments and listen to the people but some people are just calling the devs out and bashing on them the devs are to nice to say anything but what i say to those people ♥♥♥♥ off and never come back cause these devs have worked and worked and still working to make an amazing game for you all they have done better then other early access games that were abandond by the creators at first sighn of trouble or promises that werent kept yet these devs kept thier promises so where is your promise to support them no matter what i still recommand this amazing game and i will always cause this game is enjoyable and relaxing at times, and fun to drive around in a car you made with friends in it with you and i hope they continue expanding the game i support you devs and i thank you for a wonderful fun game i know my hours might not say it but i have played more of this at my friends house on his pc cause mine broke and i was on his account well a long story but i enjoy and love this game thank you			"

								I rate this game up on its creativity and the fact that you can affect the environment. (I dug up a large cave of spiders and they ate all the animals around it) also huge potential in the future howeverat the moment I don't recommend it because.:Single player mode if you're not careful you will end up in a quest loop which you can't progress any further:The gap in difficulty between the starting area and 100m outside it is insane. I literally had to build a monster in because I couldn't kill it. also if you don't like reading dialog from Quest giver's you'll be left in the dark.:19 of the twenty hours I put into this game only just let me understand most of the basics.:Multiplayer doesn't work at all.:Multiplayer is serverly limited if you do manage.:Highly frustrating when you have to go back and forth over the 1 hour long map on barefoot.

								This game feels unfinished even though they have been working on it for 2 years. This game is starting to feel like War Z in the beginning. The creation of any server has a 1/10000 chance of working, and also crafting, and building feels so repetitive. I hope they fix this game, because this game feels full in potential but lacks in what it presents.			"

								I bought this game 6 months ago (pre-steam) thinking it would be an amazing upgrade from minecraft. Graphically it is, but when you get down to it. The controls are so bad. I don't know why a traditional WASD control system couldn't be used. It makes combat agains basic monsters so difficult expect to die after any encoutner The custom design feature is pretty cool with one exception, there in no comprehensible tutorial included in the game. You basically have to know how to use auto-cat programs already or find a youtuber that explains the process well enough. While Minecraft resource gathering is tideous, but in this game you literally have no way of knowing if you are gathering the right plant until seeing it for the 20th time and i hope you find it again. Wanna dig a giant hole in the ground? COOL! Just make sure you have a way out, because the caves in this game give you no hope for survival.If you are trying to build a fort to protect from a monster onslaught good luck because those guys can pretty much fly. If a herd wants you dead, your chance of escape is like 20% tops.Overall this game tries to take a game like Minecraft and add elements of modern gaming, however it lacks in the simplicity that minecraft was able to hand out on a silver platter, and it was done with no instructions.

								I was mainly interested in the LAN coop modes, but was very disappointed when we discovered that the world is different for each player. We can see eachother, and the terrain is the same shape, but the plants, animals and resourses are not similar. The game generates a different world for each player in coop mode. This makes exploring together impossible since each person sees something different. Very bad design flaw.			"

								I love the way planet explorers works, never before have i seen anything as complex and amazing as this games mechanics.It is entirely possible for you to make your own unique items while on someone's multplayer server and use it or share it with others. Most games would require the host to have a mod enabled on the server for it to be useable but not this game, bring your own items with you! Or even your own veichles.I love the scanning system even if sometimes it's a little hard to understand, when i scan for certain minerals the scanner doesn't display any results, i don't know if there's just none around me or if i need to upgrade the scanner but meh.Best thing is this game is in alpha so imagine how much more is to come!

								Brilliant game.  If you like open world sandbox with plenty to do to make real progress then this is for you.  The world is fantastic with a variety of environments to explore and monsters to kill.  You can carry an enormous amount of material so you do not have to spend your time running back to base to unload, the crafting system is easy and once you have set up your own colony you can design and build anything from motor bikes, planes, helicopters, vehicles, ships and weapons.The only downside is that the game does crash occasionally and a few of the missions require a bit of help from others but the community is active and helpful.This is a terrific game and although I have only played story mode I am thoroughly impressed and give it a score of 99%.  Well done Devs :) "

								So far early alpha has been amazing I can't wait to see this game hit beta .. I built a completely underground compound where the only thing on the surface was a flat platform with multiple turrets for enemy attacks.. while my generators and everything else were under ground.  Can't wait to see what they do next .. I have created a few of the helicopters and things that players have made into iso's.  some of the helicopter ones are amazing. I'm not big on design so my own design was a floating platform with lots of fire power :) very square.  the freedom of this game is absolutely amazing and even in alpha before any polish.. it already looks better than minecraft.ADDED 4/21/2015:Also saw they are updating the UI and it looks amazing! This game is so much fun if you enjoy sandbox building / crafting games this is shaping up to be one of the best out there.  Having a hard time between this one or beasts of prey, though beasts say they are going another direction (and this one is much prettier) soon and that'll end my interest there. This one on the other hand has delivered everything they have promised so far and the build your own maps will be fun to play with (start me off with tons of resources and get building hehe :)			"

								Yeah I'll recommend the game, but it has many flaws that need to be worked out (like the fish, you can look at my screenshots and find one of a massive fish that is just out of the water stareing into my soul with eyes like headlights). It is loaded with cool and interesting things and even has some of my favorite things for a game to have. Like the giant monsters and the creation system, but the whole thing has such a steap learning curve it took me the best of 1 hour to make a crappy looking gun. The UI is weird and wonky at alot of points, but it works. The wildlife is extensive and is filled to the brim with wonderous creatures, but if they weren't as insanly hard to kill in story mode it would be better. EX: At one point for one of the objectives I had to investagate ruins of a past race, but massive bird creatures had taken a liking to the place and the would agro if I approched. So i took up archery and tried long range combat the started chasing me and they did massive damage so I died at least 20 times before I was able to cheese them to death. Also their are game breaking glitches like one I experianced I had to follow a character to a little pond area and their were enemys their and for some reason after I killed them he walked to his spot or close to it at least and he stopped moving. The quest never updated and he never did anything either. THIS HAPPENED EVERY TIME I TRYED TO REVERT TO A SAVE. So I had to restart but I mean the game is still in development I can't bash it to hard. The build mode is great but no ceatures spawn but you so its kind of boring. As far as I know you can't put a build world into an adventure mode so it spawns things but it would be awsome if you could this would be a great sandbox game. Kind of like minecraft but more my style of minecraft no creepers just giant murderous desert titans or robots or what ever they are I don't care the are cool as hell.I saw this game on green light years ago and downloaded the free version and oh my god so many glitches ranging from spawning in the sky and falling to your death to walking strait and then *Poof*AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH! right on down to the bottom of the universe it's self. So be thankfull that doesn't happen as much any more. So all its an ok game one to try out for a wile test out everything and see if you like it. Get the game on sale I bought it for full price, I dont really care but its not really worth $20 yet so wait for the full game and then make a full desision. Also please take liberties on the grammer I'm super tired.			"

								Its good game as i see throght development process with interesting plot (alien jurasic sci-fi) and visually game is nice too, also creative tools are coolBut we really has problem with genre (indie 3d sandbox openworld...), every game in genre in mid of development process, e-g on alpha stage.

								I am SO excited to see how this game turns out.  I pop in every once in a while to see what the new content is or see what new missions are built.  It's no where near where it needs to be play wise, but it has SO much potential.  I will definatly update my review once the Beta has been updated and there is more game content.  Fun game though.

												Planet Explorers is a fun survival, rpg, build, managment and fight game.PE got a lot of genres mixed in and gives the player the choice of how he wants to play. You can play the singeplayer story, what can take a lot of time, play the sandbox or build mode or try out the advanture mode even with friends (but be sure that your hard drive got enough free space).If you like to explore big worlds, build stuff (weapons, armors, vehicles, buldings and if you like even a WC) fight monsters like the teenage mutant ninj... no not ninja... but mutatet fur sure.... turtles... this game could be for you but expect that this game would need more ressources thant you would belive.Pros:you can dig holes.... almost everywhere!able to build your own stuff (design it in the creator, you could even make you a ""steve costum""!Abillity to have your very own colony and trains! (i love trains!)I mentitioned that you can build vehicles, but did i told ya that you can build helicopters, cars, ships and submarins!fighting creatures tha remind you of dinosaurs, godzilla and dragons (well i would say its a mix of a dragon and a chicken...)very big worldsSup. Team (and devs) respond quite fast and they care 'bout the gameCons:Big worlds need a lot of space! (and i mean a lot... like something around multiple 100 gigs)performance issues with big colonies AI companions that like to scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you (just spawning right in front of your face!)graphics aren't that good, so if you someone who needs perfect visuals i'm sad to inform you that this game can't do you right, don't get my wrong, its beautiful (this is only a - if you are fixated on high end graphics)The creator alows much freedome but sometimes just turns you crazy (the recoloring is a real hassle)All in all, i would recomand this game if the pros are your thing.PS: i'm sorry for every spelling and gramatical error in my review			"

												A lot of really great potential with this game. Very fun to play for a short while. But severely lacking where it counts in terms of content. Advanced item creation will keep the builders and artists happy for a while. But anyone looking for hearty adventure, in-depth base building, or a thriving community will have to look else where.

								I've bought and played many a sandbox game, this one is by far my favorite.  Crafting, check, world modding, check, the ability to craft as many varied vehicles, weapons, tools etc, check!  The amount of hours ive played isnt showing up because i was unplugged for a month, i must have clocked in over 200hrs to date on this, and its still in alpha phase!!!  I've never regretted buying alpha, but with Planet Explorers, it already feels like a complete game, and just keeps getting better!  Kudos to the creators of PE! es, its an ambitious project, but so far its all been well implemented.  I highly recommend this game to fans of Minecraft/sandbox type games, and just buy the game already, build a VTOL, motorcycle etc, and tinker away!!			"

								While still in Alpha, the building tools are VERY fun!  Holy crap :)  The story, as of 3/14/2015, is not bad; fun dynamic from a few sci-fi predictions with a Earth and Mars colonial falling out (Babylon 5 comes to mind).  Custom weapons is awesome... but custom vehicles and airships?  Damn!  Custom buildings... custom cities lol!  Fun times, for those of us who love sandbox creativity!Adventure mode offers a great bit of fun for people who want to sandbox it even harder, away from the story mode limitations.  Of course, being diced to pieces by a massive floating disc of death just a ways away from the starting colony was amusing.Really looking forward to seeing how the game develops!!			"

								This game has already been worth the purchase price for me.  I have logged many hours (though like all my steam games most is probably while afk at start screen) and plan on many more.   I love the freedom that sandbox offers and all the creative things that can be done in the build mode.  Creating and then driving various vehicles was also a major bonus.  There are some other features right now and more to come that are very enjoyable like the colony.  I always get lonely at some point in games where there is only 1 character (LOVE 7dtd but still waiting for friendlies in sp mode) but this game doesn't have that problem.  You can setup, recruit then go do whatever and stop by when wanting some company, or bring a couple along.  Or go it alone and leave the others to their fate as you attempt to survive the wilds using what you can find, or mooch off them.   The options are available which is great so you don't feel pigeonholed.  This is your new world essentially so do what you can/will.  There are some downsides as it is in ALPHA like mentioned in the store.  The game is a memory hog and needs to be optimized, there are some glitches with loading npc's and sometimes turrets but that will come with time.  All in all I would recommend for anyone that enjoys sandbox, building and space games.  This is from memory so not extremely detailed but something I found useful is to build with endless materials in creative mode without combat interruptions.  Then copy your building using the build toolbar, outline the area and click the toolbar save button.  Retrieve the building the building list and similar to how the ISO and craft system lists components needed and if you have them, you can 1 click the building from then on.  This is especially useful for setting up multi level turret platforms while hunting, or intricate buildings.   Even more so if you play different modes as it saves lots of time.			"

								In the story mode of this game you must find and bring a whole ship load of colonists together after crash-landing on an Bezier alien world filled with big stompy creatures and hostile natives. In your quest to establish a colony on this harsh, unforgiving and yet somehow still impossibly beautiful world you can build your own swords, guns, lazers, tanks, bikes helicopters boats and more to aid you in your quest. That should be enough to convince anyone to buy this game. The game is still in early access but I think the devs are going to pull it off and into a successful release as there are regular and good updates which bring new content and fix bugs.			"

								I went on a leg to buy this game. Steam was having a discount on it. I'm a sucker for sandbox games and this ticks many of my desires in a game. I love being able to build anything I want, how I want it. It's great. There is a minor learning curve, but still easily learned. Haven't stumbled upon many glitches, just a few small ones. The ability to fly and glide is great. Building is superb. You really can get into details. My problems currently are no door locks, anyone can destroy your building in build mode by removing, and the black floor while mining. This game has a lot of potential, I hope player base picks up and the Devs keep it up.AS is 8.5/10.			"

								This is a pretty cool game so far, but it still needs some polish.  I've played for a couple of hours and I'm enjoying the graphics, music and the art direction.  The controls take a bit to get used to, but I'm adapting to them.   My biggest joy so far is the exploration aspect of the game.  It's a gorgeous landscape and you really feel like you're on some alien world.  I've also been able to pick up the crafting features pretty quick and I haven't had any trouble finding resources.  It's very straight-forward if you've played any RPG or survival game in the past.  My biggest complaint is the night.  The flashlight is crappy and you don't have a good handle on how it's aimed.  My advice is to hunker down at night and craft for a while -- literally wait it out until morning.  I stumbled acrossed some nasty critters and could see what I was doing or what was attacking me.  And the combat is pretty meh.  I've just set up some turrets and I'm about to craft some guns.  I feel that these will serve me better than hand-to-hand combat.  Overall, it's a good game for the price and I look forward to building better equipment to protect me and my team from the locals.  I look forward to seeing the finished game, but a note to the developers:  MAKE THE FLASHLIGHT BETTER!  Thanks!			"

								The good:-Satisfying exploraton (especially in story mode)-Incredibly deep creation system (relatively simple too)-The world feels alive and there's plenty to do-Looks good and runs fairly well on my turdtop-Awesome devsThe bad: -Digging is downright clunkly-Adventure and multiplayer are buggy to the point of unplayability (Early Access though so this'll probably change)-Combat is a little simplistic (A0.9  is supposed to revamp it though, so there's that)-Learning curve is a bit steep with a barebones turorialThe probelms I have with this game are generally things that the devs have already said will change. I personally adore this game and I can't recommend it enough. As it stands the story is unfinished but loads of fun to play anyway and the feeling of venturing into the unknown and discovery is something that I so rarely get in games. Back that up with the complex item and building creation and this game already stands on its own two legs.			"

												A lot of really great potential with this game. Very fun to play for a short while. But severely lacking where it counts in terms of content. Advanced item creation will keep the builders and artists happy for a while. But anyone looking for hearty adventure, in-depth base building, or a thriving community will have to look else where.

								I've tested a few of these ""Minecraft 2.0 wannabes"" (as I call the genre) and by far Planet Explorers is the best, in my opinion.While it is true that the game has gone quite long without updates before (yes, a whole year) the devs have explained what happened (tl;dr version: they had to recover from outsource-induced damage), but they are now on top of things once more and updates are coming in regularly again.It is also still true that some glitches might need you to restart your game (usually in story mode) but that's mostly because the patches that fix those issues can't fix them retro-actively. Having a savegame from before you encountered the problem is usually sufficient to prevent this from happening.Multiplayer also leaves much to be desired but the devs are working on that.Remember: this game is still in pre-release, you're bound to run into some bugs.

								   If the amount of time i spent playing this game from the moment i  installed it is any indication, i'd give this game even in it's current alpha state 5 stars.   The combination of Minecraft style crafting system with an RPSesque story mode to give the rest of it some kind of point creates an experience that makes you actually CARE about delving into the depths for that last chunk of iron or coal. the addition of an integrated creation system that allows you to make anything from a stool to a house to a racetrack and a vehicle to race on it in multiplayer, as well as weapons and almost anything else you can imagine while still being constrained by the resources and items you've gathered in-game makes for an incredibly immersive world experience.   i got sucked in and played 33 hours the first two days i had this game. i am almost dreading the final release as the alphas scope only encompasses a small portion of the world so far an approximate 40km square area that i have as yet not found the end of.   support this game, get the alpha!

								this game is so far, very nice. graphics are pretty good and controls, though a little bit strange at first (switching between mouse and crosshair controls mid battle because you ran out of 1 type of heals and need to use another can sometimes be fatal), eventually become familiar and you get the hang of what it is you're supposed to do...some things which may or may not be to your taste:-build mode and adventure mode are at the point of goodness where it's almost better to start with one of those and learn how to play rather than learn in story mode-combat with swords seems a bit pointless in almost every situation after you obtain guns, which is fair enough considering they're guns but it'd be nice for there to be a point to these higher tiers of swords and if it is gun-orientated then guns need more tiers. so yeah, using guns is much easier on you and your med packs, just remember to have bullets...-speaking of combat, there's not really much to it, if you use swords you walk in and click like mad until stuff is dead and normally it's you who dies first. theres no blocking or evasion (yet??) so you take every hit, your only chance not to get hit is to hide behind a tree and use guns to kill them while they run into it-for a rpg, apart from quests it has very few traits that one would expect to find in a rpg-i, personally, have found almost no point in actually gathering resources to make things. you can mine and collect stuff yes, but not to make things, only to sell it to npcs so you can buy the thing you were supposed to and save yourself a huge amount of time. however, if mining and collecting is something you enjoy get yourself a nice shovel and dig til your hearts content-if you do choose to do the storyline quests then prepare to spend upwards of 10 minutes running between campsites when you get a quest where you cant fast travel (or you lose the quest)-jumping feels a little bit slow to start, you press the key to jump and it takes a second to actually commence jumping because of crouching. pffft realismlil' bit extra:-i know its completely unrealistic but i think the jetpack should be able to fly me around forever. to hell with realism.-if rpg is one of the ways this game is going, stats, skills and levels may be something to consider??theres a hell of a lot to this game so far and i definitely think it has potential, i haven't yet experienced everything (i played build mode, got a jetpack and just flew around a bit then played some story) but most of what i have has been enjoyable and completely recommendable.not much else to say really, it's pretty simple, if you like sandbox, open world, crafting and understand the phrase ""early access"" then this game is awesome, it does a very good job of being pretty much what its tags say it is. though if rpg is what you desire most, then lower your expectations a little bit.

								It's hard to give a single opionin I will say it's been worth the price and the more backing the better this game will get. I would recommend watching gameplay footage to get a light feeling of the game.In a nutshell this game is amazing and has amazing potienal. Playing singleplayer you can really see where they have strived to put their work in. I will say the multiplayer is a little lacking but they recently hired a team to develop that part of the game. For now you can do the basics but no building awesome fortresses.This game is amazingly easy to pickup and go. I haven't played the story yet because of the fun of building a world with my friends. It can be action packed survival exploration or a calming city builder.			"

								This game is really amazing, the depth is there but you are not required to get into it.  As fun as any survival game but without the repetitive zombie theme, instead you get a nice change with the sci-fi theme that brings crazy scenery, plants, bugs and even a somewhat scary enemy.  jEven at the early stage of alpha this game is currently in there is so much to do, once you figure out how to do something you will quickly be finding more and more to do and before you know it you have played for 6 hours.  You might think you would have gotten alot done in that time, well not likely the map in this game.....its enormous.  But for good reason, there is a creation system in the game that allows you to create; like actually ""create"" your own vehicles.  You get the basic guts and mechanical stuff, then you get to completely design the body, style, gun placement, how many wheels etc etc.  The creation doesnt just apply to vehicles and aircrafts but you also get the option to completely create your own sword, shield and gun designs.  Now you might think that leads to overpowered stupid looking junk that everyone will be using, wrong the creation system requires you to gather the materials you build with and it will take some trial and error before you really get what you want.  Its simple yet still very detailed when you want it to be, granted there is a short learning curve but those who would enjoy the game will have no problem with that.After watching some videos I recently came to realize there is a glider backpack and a grappling hook in the game that you can aquire somehow.  So far I have only played the story mode and that has taken quite a bit of time to learn and make a small amount of progress through.  So I have not had the thril of jumping off high mountain tops and gliding around this enormous map, or using the grappling hook to climb insane mountains.  I have only seen video of the aircrafts you can potentially design and I cannot wait to design my own.  The game is every bit worth the $24.99 price tag and to think its only in the alpha stages.  I cannot wait to see what else they add to this game, I unfortunately do not have the internet access to use the multiplayer feature but exploring this massive world with all the options they give you would be alot of fun with a friend or two.  I look forward to the future of this game and hopefully you will take the time to immerse yourself and enjoy the adventure that is available in Planet Explorers.			"

								Yeah I'll recommend the game, but it has many flaws that need to be worked out (like the fish, you can look at my screenshots and find one of a massive fish that is just out of the water stareing into my soul with eyes like headlights). It is loaded with cool and interesting things and even has some of my favorite things for a game to have. Like the giant monsters and the creation system, but the whole thing has such a steap learning curve it took me the best of 1 hour to make a crappy looking gun. The UI is weird and wonky at alot of points, but it works. The wildlife is extensive and is filled to the brim with wonderous creatures, but if they weren't as insanly hard to kill in story mode it would be better. EX: At one point for one of the objectives I had to investagate ruins of a past race, but massive bird creatures had taken a liking to the place and the would agro if I approched. So i took up archery and tried long range combat the started chasing me and they did massive damage so I died at least 20 times before I was able to cheese them to death. Also their are game breaking glitches like one I experianced I had to follow a character to a little pond area and their were enemys their and for some reason after I killed them he walked to his spot or close to it at least and he stopped moving. The quest never updated and he never did anything either. THIS HAPPENED EVERY TIME I TRYED TO REVERT TO A SAVE. So I had to restart but I mean the game is still in development I can't bash it to hard. The build mode is great but no ceatures spawn but you so its kind of boring. As far as I know you can't put a build world into an adventure mode so it spawns things but it would be awsome if you could this would be a great sandbox game. Kind of like minecraft but more my style of minecraft no creepers just giant murderous desert titans or robots or what ever they are I don't care the are cool as hell.I saw this game on green light years ago and downloaded the free version and oh my god so many glitches ranging from spawning in the sky and falling to your death to walking strait and then *Poof*AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH! right on down to the bottom of the universe it's self. So be thankfull that doesn't happen as much any more. So all its an ok game one to try out for a wile test out everything and see if you like it. Get the game on sale I bought it for full price, I dont really care but its not really worth $20 yet so wait for the full game and then make a full desision. Also please take liberties on the grammer I'm super tired.			"

								+++Developers seem genuinely interested in this game, despite some misfortune+++One of the sandbox with most freedom out there. Instead of downloading mods to get that decorative item you want, it's pretty straightforward to build it yourself with the in game creator. The complexity of the things you can build is pretty big.+++Brings something new to the table of the sandbox genre+++There is a story and a purpose!++The game is thought out and presents a meaningful and fair challenge.++Supports and encourages the modding community+Effort was put into graphics and animations and they look very good.-There are a few bugs-- game development is pretty slow (at least lately)---Some quests are boring and meaningless. The usual MMORPG quests, fedex quests, kill x enemies quests, escort quests.-A part of the community simply cannot hear any form of criticism. Make a suggestion at your own peril.-Needs a more explanatory tutorial. Took me a while to grasp the full potential of the crafting UI.-Combat needs more fluidity Worth the 23 Euros it's at. There's enough content to justify an non sale buy.			"

								I have played mostly the story mode, using the building functionality to weave in a little creativity, but I have yet to play this a la Minecraft. But I really, really like the game! The story is interesting, the world is immersive, and it's just plain cool. It's a very well done game. However, it's by all means still in Beta.My complaints:-Some of the missions require walking back and forth across the (very large) map, with fast traveling not an option when you have a follower. I dislike that, it's a waste of time. Enabling followers to fast travel with you would fix this, and I'm confident they'll do that before the final version.-The storyline gets implayable at a certain point. I hit a wall where a bug disallowed the game from recognizing one action as complete, and it couldn't progress the story. Obviously, these will be handled before a full release, so it's not fair to say the game is bad when it's simply (and admittedly) incomplete, but I thought it was nonetheless worth mentioning in my review.-Gathering resources to go through stuff you use in regular gameplay gets a little tedious. You can buy resources from certain NPCs, but the quantities available are small and the prices high. Building your own stuff is a nice part of the game, but gathering resources for an hour just to restock on bullets is annoying. Again, I expect they may improve this before the final release.My praises:-I really like the way combat is done, the way you can focus on it or not. There's a fair amount of combat to be done, but I just made automatic turrets, carry them in my inventory, and let them take care of whatever it is while I just keep clear. That way, combat for me is just making sure I've got enough turrets and ammo in my inventory for whatever I expect to fight.-The RPG and the sandbox elements work together really nicely.-The opening quests do a good job explaining how the game works. It did take me a minute to figure out what buttons to press, but once I got that down the explanations were helpful without being annoying.All in all, I think this game will be one of my favorites once it's done. The RPG gameplay seems to only be 60% done, whereas the builder gameplay seems to be 95% up and running. So depending on your gameplay preferences, you may prefer to wait it out until it's a little more complete. I personally chose to put it aside and plan to revisit it when it's complete, since I was more focused on the RPG gameplay, but I definitely recommend it either way.			"

								Now I've had the game for a while, I will write another review.Good:Infinite worldsLots of biomesLots of cool and different animalsGIANT ROBOTSA cool sense of explorationYou can make helicopters, cars, planes, boats, 100% customization of basically all items (even your own decals and stuff) Alien camps that you can invadeFriendly camps where you can buy materials and tools if you can't find themThe crafting system is pretty big and lots of parts to makeConstant updatesBad:Cutting down trees is annoying. You have to stand in the exact right place to be able to cut it, no matter how big it is it just dissapears into your inventory when your done and you keep on clipping inside of it like it's not even thereCombat is sloppy. You might as well be cutting onions.It is hard to see above the water when swimmingMining could be a bit betterGathering plants can be quite hard, you have to stand in the right place to get itQuite a few random glitches (crashes, flying for no reason etc.)Overall it is a really good game but could do with a bit of a polish, and the updates should be more focused on fixing bugs and improving things that are already there instead of adding more features into the game. I would definately recommend this game. 8/10 ( update from my previous 7/10)			"

								Surprisingly advanced for an Early Release. The story line is believable, voice acted, and complex. The world (I've only seen the first 2 areas of 7 I'm guessting), is massive, varied, and not without dangers. No, you won't get chewed up by any hostile mob, but when starting out you'll have to run. and mine, and do the quests. Later you'll be able to get on your self-built motorbike, and *try* to outrun a dangerous enemy you found deep in the forst. Will you be able to dodge the trees? Will he? After many many disappointments in its genre, I'm fully willing to say that this is a massive success in the in the Voxel / Survival / Crafting / Single player game, even well beyond anything else out there. My only negative is the ingame music, which sounds like children's lullabies to my ears... But it's easy enough to mute it through the settings (which are completely implemented), and run VLC in the background. Average performance usage of system while running Planet Explorers AND a 720P movie in VLC:CPU 38%RAM usage around 5 GB of 16GB. Nvidia GTX 760, no cooling (not even a fan). Resolution 1920x1080 on main screen running Planet ExplorersResolution 1280x720 on second monitor, playing the Terra Nova Series on 720p. --------------I recommend this game for children, especially those of all ages. This is absolutely playable for children in multiplayer with their parents, and it would be a great experience for them.You can build, and you can dig to find oreyou can do quests to find out more.Sneak around to see beautiful creaturesand learn what could become of own features. ----FANTASTIC GAME!

								TLDR; Recommended, glad I purchased it.It's really addictive. Check the other reviews and, even on the bad ones, notice how many HOURS people log playing this game! I'm ONLY at 13 hours.It reminds me a bit of Uninhabited Planet Survive[en.wikipedia.org] which was a fun show. If you liked the show you'll probably like the game, although I'm certain they have totally unrelated origins.I like exploring, building, and sometimes even following the story.The difficulty isn't very linear, which isn't a bad thing. In the real world you can walk into a forest and attack a rabbit or a bear side by side, but.. which one is more difficult? That's what happens here, too. And smaller isn't always less of a challenge either, likewise some big guys are pushovers. Could make it harder, actually.I haven't had much luck with Online play, though. It works sort-of, but my latency was measured in minutes so it wasn't really playable. Could be just me, but hey, it's a product in development.Solo play is rock solid, the graphics are awesome. There's tons to build and do already. While the game is solid and hasn't crashed on me, as other reviewers point out, it has some bugs. You may never experience them, but they're in there.			"

								This has got to be the best early access title I've ever seen... granted I haven't played a lot of them but I've certainly had my eye on quite a few ;). I'm VERY anxious to see what comes next. As for what we have now:PROYou can build anything in the *integrated* 3D modelling software and export it directly into your game. ANYTHING. Want a sword shaped like a hockey stick? Go for it. A motorcycle that looks like a giant taco? No problem. How about 50+ foot tall mech that seats three, flies, manuevers in three dimensions, and carries enough firepower to single-handedly liberate a small nation? Check out my screenshots... ;)Hundreds of building and crafting materials to use and mix together with a robust system that is phenomenally easy to use. Example: I burned through my gold pick and I'm a mile away from a repair machine and half as far underground. I open up my crafting window and select gold pick and the mats window tells me I need steel so I click on that right in the window.  Seems I have an abundance of mats for that so I make my steel and then I see up top that steel can be used for, among many things, gold picks. Click gold pick, click build, DONE. Easy.Story Mode. I've been mostly playing in Adventure Mode so I can't honestly speak to Story Mode a whole lot but I'll say  this about it: It doesn't suck! There are so many other games that wind up with devs scrapping most of the details on their story just to rush content... Not these guys and to me that shows integrity, something otherwise lacking in a lot of other titles.I have no cons, as it's still in developpment, so only positive criticism. I have a few suggestions, I know that a lot of devs read these reviews, and I despise digging through forums and creating more accounts everywhere just to post in a single thread somewhere so...Suggestions1st person. I know after reading around that you had it working at one point. This really needs a fix, mining in tight spaces with any kind of precision is impossible when your backside occupies the entire screen.Armor Dyes. I can paint anything I build any colour I want regardless of shape or size but not my armor? I like the models just fine and, quite frankly, custom armor is probably the one thing I have no interest in modding but there really should be an option to dye it. Maybe have a colour picker or something pop up in the crafting window when you click to build and if you choose to change the colour it tallies up the required pigments for you before finalizing?Weapon placement. I made a seriously bad♥♥♥♥♥gauntlet/katar with claws half as long as a man but to my horror the whole thing sticks straight up into the air behind my dude's head. Maybe if the creator had a new tab with a basic human shaped model we could specify wear a weapon should be worn (back, hip, etc.) and in what orientation, sort of like the same way we already can do with parts while building.Weapon pairing! I equip a sword and shield, no problem. I switch to my laser rifle, still no problem. Both are hotkeyed for ease but the moment I switch back to my sword I now have to go digging through my inventory to find my shield 'cause it missed the memo that it was business time. How about a pop-up menu for single handed gear that would allow the user to pair or un-pair the item with other one handed gear? Dual wield pistols, sword and axe, sword and board, etc, all with a single click once paired.More precise painting. The way paint bleeds from one surface inot another is actually pretty frustrating.Craftable solar power. Have I just not found it yet? I play in Adventure Mode mostly and I have yet to see it, yet there's a solar charger sitting outside a tent at the beginning of Story Mode. I wanna build one of those specifically!PAUSE in menu during single player. I don't think this one needs explanation but I'll throw this in here: It sucks if you have to leave your desk for a bit, or use the creator to tweak some stuff, and come back to find your toon starving.Like I said, no cons just suggestions. I could come up with more if I really put the time and thought into it but as it stands I have a craving for tacos now that must be appeased. This game is already well on it's way to being ace and I love it so far, keep up the great work, and for the potential buyer if you're into building games and the like then YES this is worth it :)			"

								I recently purchased this game when it was on sale for $15.  I feel it was worth that.  I have completed the story line for as far as it goes once, and logged most of the rest of my hours on the Adventure mode.  I tried the multi player for just a couple of hours.Pros:It's a beautiful game.  I really enjoy the look of the world.I like the basic crafting.  It's easy to find what you want in your recipes, and the resources are automatically selected if you have them, or indicated if you don't.I like the potential of the ISO creation tool. But as I will mention below it has drawbacks.I love the rope gun.I love the jet pack.I love the glider.I love being able to create a settlement.I like being able to recruit villagers to participate in my base.I like the farming.I like the resource gathering.Cons:The ISO creation tool was to difficult for me to figure out.  (the good news is there are sites available to download other peoples creations, and many of those are just beautiful)Weapons and monsters aren't well balanced.  Early weapons are nearly useless, ISO created weapons are too devastating.  Vehicles run out power/become damaged too quickly.  It's usually easier to just use your jet pack and glider than to bother pulling out a vehicle to get where you are going.Vehicle weapons are too weak.  It's quicker to just get out and kill the monster with your rifle, than to try blasting it with your vehicle cannons.There is a lack of sentient creature aggression.  Aliens attack if you run into them, but the never attack your base.  Animals will attack.  But they aren't a challenge.  The toughest thing is looting all the corpses that litter the field before they disappear.Settlement mechanics are still pretty sparce.  I am looking forward to those being fleshed out  in the future.There are a lack of building machines for tunneling, leveling, and raising land.  It's all done with a pick and a shovel.  I am looking forward to heavy equipment to speed up the beautification of my base.You can't replace natural earth that is removed.  So if you are trying to make a level spot for your garden and you accidentally hit the wrong spot, there is no way to fix it short of loading a previous save.			"

								Ignore my steam time, been playing this since kickstarter and loved it. Loved the sandbox world, ability to build what you want and more importantly import the creations of others (since my abilities to make things are very limited and never pretty). The developers stuck with the game and listened to what people wanted, building in multiplayer functions and a lot more. The development steps were also good, taking their time, not rushing to finish the game, but to ensure it works (meaning a few reworkings of the base engine and complete rebuilds), only opening up small parts of the map to start with, therefore giving early adopters new areas to explore as opposed to just new abilities (and boring replays). Great game, great development (the way kickstarter and greenlight should work).			"

								I never post reviews unless I find something special. This is the game I've been looking for over the last couple of years.  Best described: It's like Tereria / Darkout but only in 3 dimentions, with vehicles and weapons that you design and build yourself.  I love the mining mechanic and the user friendly crafting system.  I love that its not a badly rendered block world like Minecraft or Terarria. I love the free building and the creation system to create your own weapons, buildings & vehicles and turrets.  Even more shocking is that this game is still in alpha!  I've seen completed games that are far worse and bug ridden. I cant wait to try this out on multiplayer.			"

								simply love the game still needs a little work.. not sure about useing a pick thou perhaps a hand held gadet that has settings so you could ether do flat clearing of land or switch it to making tunnels and other dig modes with upgrades just like the apps for the minral scanner and it would out line its path so you dont make unwanted holes which i find a tad anioning when mining or clearing the land to put a building down other then what Ive said this is a great game with sooo much protenial.... I bought other games like this and this one has the right thing going on landmark is a total fail too much time wasited making things just so you can fine tune a building and there land mass is rubbish unlike this Planet explorers.. and Ive not found anything quite as good the mods for TEKKIT and FTB to be honist untill now love the build system on this game as well .... one little gripe is when you have built a building you come back to it some hours latter or you have logged off and it becomes hard to remove blocks you can delet them but they only diss appear when you log off to main menu ..other then THAT FLIPPING AWSOME GAME ....!!!!!!   :))) 5 star thums up			"

								I've now played more than 40 hours  in story mode, and I like it. A lot. I've just about came to the end of the missions, all that's left is some more monorail track building. That said, it has some problems, so this is mostly a list of things that need to be improved. MiningThis suffers from total confusion, because there is one rule: 3rd person perspective doesn't work with interiors. period. So what really needs to be done here is to implement a first-person view, this would fix that. Pathfinding AIThe NPCs are often jittering around, get stuck on trees or other obstacles, making mission where you have to lead somebody somewhere a chore. Scripted MissionsSometimes you've done something which you shouldn't have, like killed some monster before you get the mission, And then one of the ""kill 0/3"" monsters is missing. Or you killed the queen of the hive which you were only supposed to distract. What works in these cases is to save and reload, but then all three will reappear, and you need to kill all of them again. UIOn big screens, it's barely readable. There's need for a variable font-size.ColoniesThere are NPCs which can do mining or gathering, but it only works when they're your followers. It should really be possible to assign them this Job in the colonies. Also, it would be nice if it were possible to move around machines/beds in colonies, or remove and replace them without all the colonists loosing their status as colonists.VehiclesI've got difficulties steering them, probably due to some mouse/keyboard confusion on my part. A first-person view might fix this as well. Weight and ISOThere seems to be the problem that everything you create gets incredibly heavy; since everything is supposed to be ""full metal"" instead of being profiles and tubes. So you easily end up with 20 ton Jeeps. Not sure whether this can be fixed. On the other hand, I've never seen anything like it. I can create everything, from swords and guns to cars, boats and aeroplanes. Wow!CrashesIt does this often, mostly after fast-travel or loading a game (which both seem to use the same logic). But that's a known problem, related to memory consumption and apparently bugs in the Unity-Engine. So you can definitely expect improvements in the future. To sum up: This is around 40 hours of gameplay already, in story mode, and while some things feel weird or are unbalanced, it's definitely playable. Recommended.			"

								I recently purchased this game when it was on sale for $15.  I feel it was worth that.  I have completed the story line for as far as it goes once, and logged most of the rest of my hours on the Adventure mode.  I tried the multi player for just a couple of hours.Pros:It's a beautiful game.  I really enjoy the look of the world.I like the basic crafting.  It's easy to find what you want in your recipes, and the resources are automatically selected if you have them, or indicated if you don't.I like the potential of the ISO creation tool. But as I will mention below it has drawbacks.I love the rope gun.I love the jet pack.I love the glider.I love being able to create a settlement.I like being able to recruit villagers to participate in my base.I like the farming.I like the resource gathering.Cons:The ISO creation tool was to difficult for me to figure out.  (the good news is there are sites available to download other peoples creations, and many of those are just beautiful)Weapons and monsters aren't well balanced.  Early weapons are nearly useless, ISO created weapons are too devastating.  Vehicles run out power/become damaged too quickly.  It's usually easier to just use your jet pack and glider than to bother pulling out a vehicle to get where you are going.Vehicle weapons are too weak.  It's quicker to just get out and kill the monster with your rifle, than to try blasting it with your vehicle cannons.There is a lack of sentient creature aggression.  Aliens attack if you run into them, but the never attack your base.  Animals will attack.  But they aren't a challenge.  The toughest thing is looting all the corpses that litter the field before they disappear.Settlement mechanics are still pretty sparce.  I am looking forward to those being fleshed out  in the future.There are a lack of building machines for tunneling, leveling, and raising land.  It's all done with a pick and a shovel.  I am looking forward to heavy equipment to speed up the beautification of my base.You can't replace natural earth that is removed.  So if you are trying to make a level spot for your garden and you accidentally hit the wrong spot, there is no way to fix it short of loading a previous save.			"

								Ignore my steam time, been playing this since kickstarter and loved it. Loved the sandbox world, ability to build what you want and more importantly import the creations of others (since my abilities to make things are very limited and never pretty). The developers stuck with the game and listened to what people wanted, building in multiplayer functions and a lot more. The development steps were also good, taking their time, not rushing to finish the game, but to ensure it works (meaning a few reworkings of the base engine and complete rebuilds), only opening up small parts of the map to start with, therefore giving early adopters new areas to explore as opposed to just new abilities (and boring replays). Great game, great development (the way kickstarter and greenlight should work).			"

								I never post reviews unless I find something special. This is the game I've been looking for over the last couple of years.  Best described: It's like Tereria / Darkout but only in 3 dimentions, with vehicles and weapons that you design and build yourself.  I love the mining mechanic and the user friendly crafting system.  I love that its not a badly rendered block world like Minecraft or Terarria. I love the free building and the creation system to create your own weapons, buildings & vehicles and turrets.  Even more shocking is that this game is still in alpha!  I've seen completed games that are far worse and bug ridden. I cant wait to try this out on multiplayer.			"

								I've now played more than 40 hours  in story mode, and I like it. A lot. I've just about came to the end of the missions, all that's left is some more monorail track building.

								It took a minute to figure out what i was doing, but once i got the hang of it i couldnt stop playing.  Im a console kind of guy so I have been using an xbox 360 controller in conjunction with my laptop keyboard and track pad.  It needs a little more refinement and the controls will be very nice.  They are acceptable at the moment, very playable, and pretty much the only way to go for a laptop in my opinion.   Im managing to get 80fps consistently, with a small lag to about 50 randomly.  it doesnt effect the game play in the slightest, and if i lock in my fps at 60 its non-existent.  I have an i7-4800 and a gtx880m, i have played for an hour and a half straight and not a single problem.  The only thing the description of the game really needs to say is, ""In what other game can you walk past a large flying animal attacking a dinosaur?""  I love this game!!!			"

								Having problems chopping down trees and getting flowers? It's right click. Yup. Yarp's guide was to subtle for me and it took me a total of 20 minutes to figure how to chop down a tree so I'm gonna tell you all. RIGHT CLICK. Anyway, the trailer is good, but this game is pretty rough. It's not worth the 25$, more like 10. I'd wait a lot longer as its a really new game. Not even the character customization is completed yet! The way to save a world needs to be turned into a user friendly menu. The build mode is annoying, I think that should be removed and put the building into normal gameplay, not a mode. The ISO maker, which allows you to create your own items is amazing. But the waypoint thing for the map is glitchy, it doesn't put the waypoint where your mouse is. I'd say I'd recommend it, but only if you are going to wait a year, mostly because major updates are months apart.			"

								This game is very addicting, like world of warcraft addicting, single player story so far is amazing, there's a build mode with no creatures, or you can go online and play with friends.The designer to design whatever kind of vehicle, gun, sword, or pretty much anything else you can think of is awesome, and the fact you can save and export to iso is great for sharing and receiving new creations. It has a peaceful feel to it with the music and the scenery, and every hill you go over almost has something new, but it's full of enough suprises to keep you scanning around for threats.			"

								It's hard to give a single opionin I will say it's been worth the price and the more backing the better this game will get. I would recommend watching gameplay footage to get a light feeling of the game.In a nutshell this game is amazing and has amazing potienal. Playing singleplayer you can really see where they have strived to put their work in. I will say the multiplayer is a little lacking but they recently hired a team to develop that part of the game. For now you can do the basics but no building awesome fortresses.This game is amazingly easy to pickup and go. I haven't played the story yet because of the fun of building a world with my friends. It can be action packed survival exploration or a calming city builder.			"

								This game is really amazing, the depth is there but you are not required to get into it.  As fun as any survival game but without the repetitive zombie theme, instead you get a nice change with the sci-fi theme that brings crazy scenery, plants, bugs and even a somewhat scary enemy.  jEven at the early stage of alpha this game is currently in there is so much to do, once you figure out how to do something you will quickly be finding more and more to do and before you know it you have played for 6 hours.  You might think you would have gotten alot done in that time, well not likely the map in this game.....its enormous.  But for good reason, there is a creation system in the game that allows you to create; like actually ""create"" your own vehicles.  You get the basic guts and mechanical stuff, then you get to completely design the body, style, gun placement, how many wheels etc etc.  The creation doesnt just apply to vehicles and aircrafts but you also get the option to completely create your own sword, shield and gun designs.  Now you might think that leads to overpowered stupid looking junk that everyone will be using, wrong the creation system requires you to gather the materials you build with and it will take some trial and error before you really get what you want.  Its simple yet still very detailed when you want it to be, granted there is a short learning curve but those who would enjoy the game will have no problem with that.After watching some videos I recently came to realize there is a glider backpack and a grappling hook in the game that you can aquire somehow.  So far I have only played the story mode and that has taken quite a bit of time to learn and make a small amount of progress through.  So I have not had the thril of jumping off high mountain tops and gliding around this enormous map, or using the grappling hook to climb insane mountains.  I have only seen video of the aircrafts you can potentially design and I cannot wait to design my own.  The game is every bit worth the $24.99 price tag and to think its only in the alpha stages.  I cannot wait to see what else they add to this game, I unfortunately do not have the internet access to use the multiplayer feature but exploring this massive world with all the options they give you would be alot of fun with a friend or two.  I look forward to the future of this game and hopefully you will take the time to immerse yourself and enjoy the adventure that is available in Planet Explorers.			"

Like any game it has its problems.The balancing is a little off, after awhile the player pretty much just stomps on enemies left and right. The game, being in alpha, is also glitchy. Personally I have had to restart 2 now due to a small glitch with a mainline quest. But despite these problems, all and all, I have really enjoyed every play through of this game. This game is brimming with potential. If this company plays its cards right they could have a smash hit, that is if they fix the bugs in the game.			"

Early Access Review
								(40 hours into a0.82) I was very very surprised at how much I liked this game and I look forward to it reaching full release at some point. Compared to my 50 hours of time put into Starbound (100 hours into Terraria), I think PE has a lot more going for it. The only clear negatives right now would be an out-of-memory CTD every 40-80 minutes of playtime, and the obvious, sudden ""work in progress"" placeholders for the story mode missions about 30-40 hours into the game (but suggests maybe another 10-40 hours of story mode at least). Other rough spots include game balancing and some issues w/ colony (micro)management and crafting/block placement.Those kinda pale in comparison to the sense of awe inspired by exploring the (story mode) landscape though. The graphics tend to be a bit cartoony but not much more so than Starbound/Terraria (but in 3D), but the landscape and views can be pretty breathtaking, and (spoiler alert) you can eventually buy/craft a jetpack and a glider, and along w/ a rope gun which gets some use, it reminds me a lot of the awesome feels coming out of Just Cause 2's parachute and grappling hook. The first time I crafted a simple flyer sled put an easy grin on my face too, and I had the odd but welcome reminder of how I felt when I enchanted some uber gear back in Daggerfall and Morrowind to do silly awesome things in a game, or the rush I felt realizing I could fly the jumbo jets in San Andreas.The game has an MMO-inspired mission progression and exploration/open world feel to it, with action gameplay that feels like Minecraft or Terraria/Starbound, married to gathering/crafting partly inspired by Minecraft, with an object-modeling/crafting system that feels both relatively powerful for a game while also being a bit limited in terms of a 3D modeler (even a partly voxel-based modeler). Most of your time will probably be spent exploring the breadth of the oft-times breathtaking landscape in story mode, and some of your time digging out ores (after finding deposits using your trusty ground-penetrating scanner). Story mode also has pretty nicely-written NPC dialogue that fits the graphical style of the game, scifi-ey with just enough cartoon feel to make it feel kinda epic w/o being too serious.Other (good) comparisons I could think of: Spore's exploration gameplay. Mining/gathering in the game isn't too bad either, but I'm not that into that kind of play, and tunneling isn't too satisfying b/c of the slower animation (but you get multiple resource units per swing). There's also no need-based survival-type management, aside from keeping your inventory stocked w/ hp and stamina consumables and ammo/repair mats, but this is similar to Terraria and Starbound which are still nice games without having Wayward or Don't Starve's emphasis on survival.Enough tangents though, PE is a fun game, as long as you can forgive the CTDs and current balancing issues w/ some of the alien creatures you have to fight from time to time (oh yeah, minimal flashbacks to Monster Hunter, at least seeing the size of some of those beasts, but don't get me wrong, combat is fairly straightforward in PE). I'm still starting out in adventure mode, so I don't know if PE's story mode strengths carry over, but my initial impression is that landscape/map generation could probably use some work.BTW, the map is pretty big, as in it take a while to hoof it from place to place even in one biome. There's Fast Travel to landmarks, but you also eventually get the ability to build cars, boats, or flying vehicles if you like (even making them into gun platforms), or as I said up top, you could jetpack into the sky then switch to glider to take to the skies (plus rope gun if you want to scale mountains w/o burning (camp-rechargeable but also craftable) battery).

								Still playing, really enjoying. Highly recommend saving often, as being early access there is the occasional crash. Otherwhise, for an early release game it seems to function well enough - some silly things like quest text having mistakes and perhaps being a little vague don't get in the way of having fun. Seems like it will only get better as well.			"

								After playing about 30 minutes~ of this game, I can honestly say this:It has a lot of potential. There is a lot of stuff still missing from it, but it's extremely cool. Think MineCraft, just 3D, and set into the Future.Within the 30 minutes, I built a monorail (which is horribly buggy), a massive base fit with a super computer, a hanger, and was in the process of ATTEMPTING to build a vehicle, but that's extremely buggy as well. If you want to play the game, buy it. If you want a finished product, wait. It's by no means a useable game, but it's got promise.			"

								To sum it up, it feels like a 3D Terraria.The realtime voxel world editing gives an almost visceral feel to building and mining. Realtime shaders help with that too.Combat is very basic at the moment. The engine seems fast enough to do something better with the combat mechanics.Decent voice acting leads you through story/tutorial mode.  Missions start out nicely paced and spaced but can be a little ""grindy"" after a while.Plus half a star for facinating creatures.Early access 3.5/5*Plus half a star for fast communication and updates from Devs.Early access 4/5*			"

								Shows potential.Being an early alpha, certain elements are expectedly wonky, the UI and animations being chief among them. But they are not so underdeveloped as to make the game unenjoyable. What would improve the UI would be some streamlining and especially the ability to scale it up to a more readable size. As the game develops, it is possible that these will improve over time.			"

								I am so addicted to this game.  The graphics are wonderful, the sounds and music are amazing.  The gameplay is something totally new.  You crashland on a dinosaur inhabited planet in the story, single player version.  Slowly you gather resources like plants, wood recipes for the replicator and meat... meat is your first currency.  Slowly you find other crashed people who have quests and further recipes.  This is a totally new concept of a survival game, an rpg... a shooter and a sandbox game.  Oh, and I haven't made anything yet but there's a built in 3D program that will apparently allow you to build anything you want.  No more just square voxel based pieces, now there's anything you can imagine.  I am so stoked, I can't wait to see them finish this game and to see what's next.  Game on, you have me hooked :)			"

The game is perfect for those things.The down side is that the game is constantly changing.  That's what happens with an Alpha game that is being made as you play it.  None of the changes so far have made me want to quit playing though.  I do want to slap the developers from time to time, but the annoyance never lasts.  They are very good at fixing things that make players crazy.  If you are in the mood to gather and build, if you are able to handle random changes over time, this game is one you want to play.			"

								I love the opportunity and the diversity of the game. Sure, it has a lot of glitches and bugs but thats what you get for playing an alpha game. Every person that buys this game contributes to making this game a better game. One upsides would be that you have a great deal of freedom in how you tackle the game, especially the crafting/ISO portion gives way for really fun creations. On the down side, it's kinda slow going and a bit daunting sometimes. Plus combat is kinda wonky at times and your weapons don't get real good until much much much later in the game. But overall it's a pretty wonderful and beautiful game that I enjoy playing.			"

								The beginning of this game reminds me of Minecraft since you need to craft objects to be able to do more tasks. But once you continue playing for the next 20 minutes you´ll find out that is much more than Minecraft. Graphics are nice and controls are good too, its still in beta, but this has a lot of potential and at the moment is not very buggy at all.			"

								this game is buggy (hey, it's an alpha), but is totaly awesome. There is a lot of running from place to place, while avoiding monsters (or killing them meat is the main drop and currency of the game). it will take a bunch of time before you are able to drive the vehicles in story mode (one of the reasons I bought this), but still an awsome game.

								For an alpha, this game is surprisingly finished. It shows some serious promise and already is fun as is... well, minus the bugs and the choppy combat systems. The tutorials are a tad confusing, but nothing you can't learn on your own. With more content and maybe a more stable system of controls and combat, this game will be near everything I hoped it would be.On a side note: the rpg aspect/adventure aspect create a strong MMO feel. . . like it or leave it.

Early Access Review
								Planet Explorers is setting out to be a game that really brings the word ""sandbox"" to life.  That said, we've got to keep in mind that this game is still heavily embedded in Alpha.  This review will be based on the Alpha experience I've had, and may not be accurate as time passes.Starting out the game I realized very quickly that I was going to need help.  There was no sign of a tutorial anywhere.  I quickly figured out that if I wanted to get something out of this game I'd have to go do some research.  YouTube to the rescue!  After watching several really good tutorial videos on ""getting started"", I was quickly able to start moving forward in the world.  That said, I later figured out that the ""Campaign"" mode has a somewhat vague tutorial built into it.  Meaning, while it did guide me, there were still some things I had to figure out on my own.I'm going to start my actual review with the item editor, since that's a huge plus for this game.  Not watching any tutorials on this, I was able to make a rather nice looking stone sword and shield, but couldn't figure out where they were located in the crafting interface so I could actually craft them in-game.  This was done in ""Campaign"" mode, so I assume I needed to first learn how to make a ""stone hilt"" before the weapon would be available to me.  I have to say the item creator is very easy to use and I absolutely love the ""mirror"" modes while designing.  I also tried to design a stone & wood bike, but I had a few errors in the build (like having no drivable wheel) and couldn't figure out how to fix the problem.I found food to be a very big problem.  The easiest food I found to make required 1 torch to cook each meat.  To make a torch you needed wood (not a problem) and 1 animal fat per torch.  As most animals can easily kick my♥♥♥♥♥ the animal fat was hard to acquire.  Due to this, I kept running out of stamina and my character became rather sluggish.  Even sleeping 12 hours didn't fix my stamina level, although it brought it up a very minor amount.  It left me a little annoied.  I also couldn't figure out how to farm the seeds I had collected from several plants (used for medical supplies).  Perhaps watching more YouTube videos is in order...The worlds, I've got to say, are impressive.  For the most part.  There was a lot of flora and fauna in the world I started out in, but I quickly realized that most of it involved flat props, and not actual 3D plants.  It's kinda like how the creatures were in the original Duke 3D.  Flat, but seemed to always attempt to face your direction so they didn't look flat.  I'm hoping this will be changed as Alpha continues, because it almost ruins the beauty of the landscapes when up-close.  Then again, with the lack of instructions, I could have an option set that makes the flora appear in that manor instead of how it should look.Mining and digging is somewhat similar to other voxel games, like ""7 Days to Die"" and ""Space Engineers"", where the ground smoothly deforms instead of cubed removal like how they do in ""Minecraft"".  Object harvesting is very similar as well.  Trees, for example, must be fully cut down before you actually get resources from them.  That said, at present Trees simply vanish when cut down.  I'd personally like to see some kind of ""falling"" animation, and the tree vanishing instead as it lands on the ground.Creatures in the game were somewhat interesting.  I'm not exactly sure how creatures come into being, whether it's simply random generation or there is a massive database of them, but I found the ones I ran into to be somewhat strange in appearance.  One looked like the body of a brontosaurus, with the neck of a giraffe, the face of a clown (no word of a lie), and 6 legs.  I turned away from the creature because I deemed it too ugly to kill.  Another seemed to be a very low to the ground creature, hard to see in the flora.  It had 8 legs, a head kinda like an iguana, and a tail like a rat.  I tried to kill it, but my little dagger did virtually nothing.That brings me to combat!  I found it to be a bit unnerving, to say the least.  I couldn’t really tell what was damaging me when a creature attacked.  I couldn’t tell if I was getting clawed, if they were biting me, or if I was taking some kind of area damage.  I couldn’t even tell how much damage I was taking, without staring at my health bar.  There was no visual indicator of damage (No numbers/points appeared), which sometimes left me wondering if I was even hitting the creature.  As their health bars are so compact, unless you do serious (or a lot of) damage it’s hard to tell if the creature’s health is even dropping.Overall I have to say that I’d give the current state of this game a 7/10.  I can’t go any higher because I don’t know if the things that are missing (Tutorial/etc.) will eventually be added.  Right now it seems like a very user unfriendly game.  That said, it’s still early Alpha so I can’t give it too much negativity.  I purchased the game myself, and I’m not regretting that purchase.  We’ll see if that changes as Alpha moves to Beta, and Beta moves to final release…As it stands, if you want to take the risk, then I’d say this game is definitely recommended.  I find the price-point of $24.99 a little high for an Alpha-Version game, but if you consider most finished games sell for something like $60-80 it doesn’t seem too unreasonable.  This game has the formula to be a serious contender in the ""sandbox"" genre, assuming the dev team stays true to the promises they're making.			"

Early Access Review
								This is an excelent game, a progession of the minecraft genre combined with the RPG MMO genre.THe graphics, sound and music are well done, and there is plenty of attention to detail, plus as it is still in development, you can add your pennies worth both in the direction it should take and 'bug hunting'.There are 3 main ellements to this game. The explore, mine and craft mode. Build mode, and Create mode.The storyline game is reletivly complete and highly playable, though some of the character behaviour and object template distribution still needs work.You start near your crashed spaceship in a beautiful alien landscape with strange plants. A nearby character gives you a few basic object templates (called scripts in game) which allow you to craft some basic kit (the usual, shovel, axe, sword etc) and a quest.You are free to roam, cut down trees, dig holes and fight creatures for resource gathering. No special table is required for crafting, if you have the script and the raw mats required then you can make the item.As with all these games it is wise to remain relativly close to your starting point and to make some useful kit before ranging too far, and at the same time there is the pull of following the story line, meeting new characters and aquireing that pickaxe upgrade or new laser weapon.In build mode raw materials you have gathered can be used to build with blocks. THere are several shapes (blocks, ramps etc) and free view allowing you to make large and complex architectural structures.In crafting mode you are presented with a separate interface for what is an easy to use 3D object creator. It takes a little playing with to get but is by no means difficult. Here you create items, vehicles and weapons. For some things, like vehicles and weapons there are pre-designed parts (stocks, engines, seats, wheels etc) and already a host of vids and help blogs on the net with ideas and tips for making items.A highly enjoable game with a considerable amount of playability and heeps of potential for budding architects and item crafters, if the developers continue in the current direction, polishing and honing their product this stands to be in the ranks of a classic in due time.If it suffers from one flaw it is that its ambition is immense. Non the less a hightly absorbing enviromnent, playable story line, imaginative and exciting.Highly recommened.			"

								After playing through the first few missions here is my admittedly barebones initial impressions.  First, the graphics: stunningly beautiful.  Very well done and for the most part, they ran well on my machine.  Character creation: Good beginning.  I know that the developers plan to do more regarding that and look forward to seeing improvement in future updates.  For a game that is still in alpha and only recently released on Steam, pretty good--just don't sit on your laurels guys and gals--I'm looking forward to seeing more.  The early tutorial missions are pretty standard run of the mill--the wood chopping seemed to be a bit off though--some trees I could chop for wood, others very similar I couldn't.  I did like that you could avoid combat in the escort missions--I like the ability to not engage in battle as well as to engage.Had a crash when I first tried to launch the game, but that might have been my fault as I closed out the Steam overlay at the same time.  Tried it again and it launched just fine.  The voice acting was ok--I've heard better, but I've also heard much worse--and in AAA titles.  I do have to ask one thing: Is the developer a Space 1999 fan (The old 70s ITV show)? I ask because of the doctor's name--even though the character by that name in Space 1999 was a pilot and not a doctor.All in all, a promising beginning and I hope this game continues to live up to its promise.

								I simply cannot say enough good things about this game. I've had this game for a while now, and it's absolutely amazing. I'm hard pressed to find another sandbox title like this right now. If you like RPG's, building games, and exploration you'll love this game. You can even dig for resources like you would in minecraft. It's fully voice acted, and done well. The creation system in this is based on voxels and allows you to make custom guns, swords, shields, vehicles, and more.I'm barely even 10% into this game and I'm having a blast. Combat can be a challenge, but you learn its quirks quite quickly.Bottom line, get this game. It's worth every penny.			"

								This is a early stage review of only half an hour of game play.I've made a leap of faith and decided to take advantage of the game 40% of.The game looks okay in graphic terms.UI is nice, however the tool tip needs a lot of improvement. For instance, when I pass over a plant it should tell me the plant ID and what items I can get from it (in the case of had been collected previously).There's no indications of keyboard shortcut keys for each aspect of tools (I for inventory, but that's standard procedure).All fauna on my crash site was friendly, which is nice. Most wild species that had never seen a human are unafraid of us and are either curious or ignore us.Crafting system looks nice, but not linear yet, maybe it's a matter of practice.The minimap is, by default on the bottom right corner of the screen. In most game I've play, it's on the top right corner. But maybe I can change it.Overall, the game is over priced for it's state, but looks promising enough to worth it.			"

								Certainly worth the money if you are interested in this type of game.With 6,9 hours in it, I am perhaps not the most qualified to talk too much about it. The variety of enemies is refreshing, while the combat system can be a tad iffy once in a while.The creation system of weapons, vechicles and the lot is very refreshing and a nice addition to the game. Tons of items for you to gather and utilize and various ways. The mining in this game and the scanner comes together beautifuly, and is a joy to utilize.8/10, with some minour flaws here and there. The AI can be a tad daft once in a while, and there are some escort missions. Fortunately AI appears to be invincible, unless they are supposed to die.If you buy it, contact me for co-op. Yet to try it, but it's looking to be very interesting.			"

								I very rarely write reviews on anything. This game got my attention with the screenshots, and the ability to create your own weapons and vehicles, with an interface that is like a mix between the game Spore and also Terraria, with blocks. The game is very impressive for being in Alpha stage. The gameplay is pretty smooth, and sure, there are plenty of bugs, but they will fix that soon. This game has amazing potential, and I am anxious to see what it's future holds. I know someone has already said this, but Planet Explorers is truly what Starforge should have been, and starforge turned out to be very dissapointing, almost a joke, even. So do I recommend this game? Of course! Like I said there are many bugs, but they will be fixed, and surely more content will be added. Thanks for reading!			"

								This game is great! Other people have compared it to Starforge (mostly saying how much better this is) and I have to agree.I loved Starforge but it's now in Beta and doesn't feel anywhere near complete as Planet Explorers. -Tons of enemies (constantly thinking to myself ""damn I haven't seen that thing before...can I kill it?"")-Looks great. I'm not a huge fan of the foilage, it's flat 2d grass but it's done well and after a bit I stop seeing it.-More building than any other game of its type that I have played. Actual designing your own buggy, swords etc.I did have an issue after I made my first buggy the game decided to eat all my bandwidth, a reboot of the geme client fixed it but it was destorying my 50mb connection.

								This is like Farmville (I mean that in the best possible way), but with great graphics, very pretty world. A bit more dangerous than Farmville, you will probably die, but it's all good, that's what revival shots are for. If you are more familiar with Minecraft, I'm not, it's probably a bit like that. A ""Voxel"" system.You crash land on a planet and start to learn how to live on that planet. The way the textures are done is great, when you are digging a cave, the textures flow well. The minerals you have to collect are easy to spot when you know what you are looking at, the the handheld device helps you find them. I'm enjoying this game.Pros: Well, pretty much everything for a person like me. You have to find things to work with and then make things from that. With the use of the creation system, the trading of isos will flow well, which will release some creative designs, no doubt. Being that this is still an Alpha, I am very impressed. The potential in this game is interesting. Plants. Guns. Cars. Flying cars. Building. Well designed creatures. Nice graphics. A lot of good things to say.Cons: Alpha? A few minor things functionally I'd like to see, but that's how it is with anything, right? Seems well thought out ideas are still possible through suggestions to the developers. Though I can see how too many ideas, all at once, could be an issue for the developers. That's it.I'm liking this game, it's going to end up costing me too many real world hours. Some costs are worth it. Good game for creating cool things, only you will see, but that's half the fun. I think it's worth supporting. After getting the demo Alpha from the creators site, I was sold. Enjoy.			"

								It's alpha. you'll need to reference the wiki to find out what different items do, how to control the game, and what you ought to be doing.But even with that, it's fun. The item/vehicle/weapon creation system is pretty unique amongst this type of game, and is done reasonably well (a part of me ached to have more Blender-like controls, since modifying existing objects is a bit rough at the moment). Combat is decent, though most of the time I tended to lure monsters to a colony so the colonists killed them for me.After an hour or two of resource collection you won't need to do it again, which is good. It's got a great mining system that smoothly deforms the ground as you mine (it's actually the best implementation of that I've ever seen), but the animation is slow and controlling the camera underground is an exercise unto itself.Building a colony is fun, I appreciate that there's finally a minecrafty game that emphasizes that you're not alone, and allows you to recruit NPCs to work at your colony. There do seem to be some bugs with it, but nothing insurmountable. My biggest gripe is how *small* your colony has to be. It's not feasible to build dwellings and houses for your people, because if you put their beds too far away (read: like 50m away) from the colony center, it won't count towards your colony.Overall, it's definitely rough, but I like where it's going. I'd recommend that if you're uneasy about the ""early access"" pricetag, that you wait 6 months and give it another go - i expect it'll be more fully-featured at that point. If you want something cool to play *right now*, i'd still go for minecraft or starbound. But this is one to keep an eye on.			"

Everything you want in a video game and moreI've only been playing for a dozen hours but so far I'm immensely impressed by the quality and originality of the game. In recent years (due to the success of MineCraft) the game market has become saturated with sandbox survival games, with few titles delivering a compelling experience. Starting off in story mode, the game plays and functions very much like a normal 3d RPG, the fact that you can alter your surroundings in this world hardly ever registers as its quality is similar to that of any MMORPG of around 2008 (WoW, Guild Wars, etc.). Although the visuals don't (currently) feature HD graphics the world of Maria still manages to be brilliantly beautiful and captivating, relying more on ambiance, flora, lighting, and simplistic symmetry to carve out an idyllic image on various unique landscapes.From the moment you crash land on Maria you will be immersed in the whole world and evolving storyline. The game seamlessly blends sci-fi and medieval elements, making you feel as though you are struggling to survive when beginning with nothing. While you may start off running about with a knife, very soon you will upgrade yourself to a sword and shield, and later laser guns. The combat itself is rather simplistic, point and shoot or stand and stab, but there's enough large monsters to keep you on your toes as you frantically attempt to run between camp on the open plains. (Frankly I'm not sure if the dark forest with lurking wolves or the open tundra with giant warbirds is more terrifying).Of course at the stage of development there are some bugs, but the only game breaking one seems to be an issue with NPC ""following"" which may disrupt certain quests in the storyline, resulting in a little bit of frustration in trying to escort a glitchy zig-zaging NPC stuck in the ground. Most of the other bugs are pretty minor and I've seen a lot worse in games that put out on the market, so it seems like Pathea is dead set on making a high quality game. While it probably won't see as much success as Minecraft, it'll definetley make a great showing and is a fantastic first game for the publisher.			"

								So far this game is looking pretty impressive. Currently in alpha, it still requires a lot of tweaking to the UI, but if this is just the beginning I expect great things. My biggest gripes would be the lack of much of a true tutorial/instructions in missions, and that the ""builder"" feature's learning curve is pretty steep. The alien AI is pretty darn good for being unfinished, and the graphics are so far very nice. If you're unsure, maybe wait until this game hits beta or release.

It is like minecraft in the world is your playground aspect, but it has potential to be even more with decent visuals and custom model creation.  Being experienced in 3dMax and being an artist this game gives me the drive I haven't felt in a while.   You can customize weapons, vehicles, and make objects just to display your creative talent.

								Quite a lot of promise. Lots of tools to craft, materials to mine, and creatures to fight. The creation system is one of the best I've seen in a sandbox game, and the variety of gadgets to play with is outstanding. Just a few missions in, you can use a rope gun and a glider to grapple around like Batman in the Arkham games! And it's still in the Alpha phase!The only downside is that it is not yet optimized. This is a shame because the longer you play, the more fun toys there are to play with, but the slower the game runs, making it harder to enjoy said toys. And it only gets worse underground.I'd be Batmanning it up in the Giant Spider Caves right now if it didn't run at about 13 FPS in my current save file.Still, this is far and away better than your average indie alpha sandbox game. It puts Sir You are Being Hunted, Windforge, StarForge, and Edge of Space to shame. In my opinion, it's worth every penny full price as is, let alone when it's finished.			"

								This game takes Minecraft to an all new level.  Amazing, expansive worlds and creatures to see (and hunt).  The amount of things you can craft in this game is huge.  Everything from basic tools, swords, armor, and supplies, to guns, grenades, cars, and aircraft.  Customize and create your own weapons and vehicles in the creation system.  This is going to be the next big sandbox style game.			"

								This is a reallly great game, Im really enjoying it. Definitely recommend this to people who enjoy minecraft, this game is just a prettier version. It runs a bit slow though and building can be a pain cause the walls behind the character sometimes get in the way so you cant see. Hopefully this will get fixed in the next update!Get this game!

								Pros:fun with friends, scavenging and exploring the open world with them can be very fun for hours on end while on the way you can battle larger creatures with your dinky little starter knife, even if you die to the overpowered monsters its oddly funloads of creative features that are in and are to be added, the buidling system is very nice, and I like it, build a home anyway you want to and build the tools to build your home, even build the guns and swords you use to defend said home with the creative system that lets you make them however you wantA very nice looking game, specially when gliding in places like the desert when there are canyons and other natural formationsCons:buggy to hell sometimes (it is in its earlier stages of devolopment after all)can't move away from friends when they are doing tasks such as digging or else it wont appear for you, had a friend dig into the ground while I was away and on returning he was 100 feet under solid ground for me.bad starting placement, sometimes spawning you in the middle of the ocean or a canyon you can't get out ofsometimes enemies are just weirdly overpowered and do way too much damage at the stages you find them, making the little thing on the ground you think you can kill, one shot you, this is much more noticeable in co-op where it seems there is no barrier from letting you walk 10 feet to find a giant and get 2 shottedFinal thoughts:I think its a very good game and worth the money as its boasting a large selection of features even in the current state along with its wonderful looks and fun with friends, but if you don't like the bugs that are in a early access game I say wait for the full game to come out			"

								It's alpha. you'll need to reference the wiki to find out what different items do, how to control the game, and what you ought to be doing.But even with that, it's fun. The item/vehicle/weapon creation system is pretty unique amongst this type of game, and is done reasonably well (a part of me ached to have more Blender-like controls, since modifying existing objects is a bit rough at the moment). Combat is decent, though most of the time I tended to lure monsters to a colony so the colonists killed them for me.After an hour or two of resource collection you won't need to do it again, which is good. It's got a great mining system that smoothly deforms the ground as you mine (it's actually the best implementation of that I've ever seen), but the animation is slow and controlling the camera underground is an exercise unto itself.Building a colony is fun, I appreciate that there's finally a minecrafty game that emphasizes that you're not alone, and allows you to recruit NPCs to work at your colony. There do seem to be some bugs with it, but nothing insurmountable. My biggest gripe is how *small* your colony has to be. It's not feasible to build dwellings and houses for your people, because if you put their beds too far away (read: like 50m away) from the colony center, it won't count towards your colony.Overall, it's definitely rough, but I like where it's going. I'd recommend that if you're uneasy about the ""early access"" pricetag, that you wait 6 months and give it another go - i expect it'll be more fully-featured at that point. If you want something cool to play *right now*, i'd still go for minecraft or starbound. But this is one to keep an eye on.			"

Everything you want in a video game and moreI've only been playing for a dozen hours but so far I'm immensely impressed by the quality and originality of the game. In recent years (due to the success of MineCraft) the game market has become saturated with sandbox survival games, with few titles delivering a compelling experience. Starting off in story mode, the game plays and functions very much like a normal 3d RPG, the fact that you can alter your surroundings in this world hardly ever registers as its quality is similar to that of any MMORPG of around 2008 (WoW, Guild Wars, etc.). Although the visuals don't (currently) feature HD graphics the world of Maria still manages to be brilliantly beautiful and captivating, relying more on ambiance, flora, lighting, and simplistic symmetry to carve out an idyllic image on various unique landscapes.From the moment you crash land on Maria you will be immersed in the whole world and evolving storyline. The game seamlessly blends sci-fi and medieval elements, making you feel as though you are struggling to survive when beginning with nothing. While you may start off running about with a knife, very soon you will upgrade yourself to a sword and shield, and later laser guns. The combat itself is rather simplistic, point and shoot or stand and stab, but there's enough large monsters to keep you on your toes as you frantically attempt to run between camp on the open plains. (Frankly I'm not sure if the dark forest with lurking wolves or the open tundra with giant warbirds is more terrifying).Of course at the stage of development there are some bugs, but the only game breaking one seems to be an issue with NPC ""following"" which may disrupt certain quests in the storyline, resulting in a little bit of frustration in trying to escort a glitchy zig-zaging NPC stuck in the ground. Most of the other bugs are pretty minor and I've seen a lot worse in games that put out on the market, so it seems like Pathea is dead set on making a high quality game. While it probably won't see as much success as Minecraft, it'll definetley make a great showing and is a fantastic first game for the publisher.			"

								So far this game is looking pretty impressive. Currently in alpha, it still requires a lot of tweaking to the UI, but if this is just the beginning I expect great things. My biggest gripes would be the lack of much of a true tutorial/instructions in missions, and that the ""builder"" feature's learning curve is pretty steep. The alien AI is pretty darn good for being unfinished, and the graphics are so far very nice. If you're unsure, maybe wait until this game hits beta or release. If you enjoy minecraft-esc gathering and exploration, this game is for you.			"

								On first glance I didn't think much of this game, trailers looked awesome and then I was lost like a small child at toys ""r"" us.   Then I decided to try it more with a friend and the game is actually very addictive.  It is like minecraft in the world is your playground aspect, but it has potential to be even more with decent visuals and custom model creation.  Being experienced in 3dMax and being an artist this game gives me the drive I haven't felt in a while.   You can customize weapons, vehicles, and make objects just to display your creative talent.  I highly recomend this game and hope that it becomes more then the masterpiece it already is.			"

								Quite a lot of promise. Lots of tools to craft, materials to mine, and creatures to fight. The creation system is one of the best I've seen in a sandbox game, and the variety of gadgets to play with is outstanding. Just a few missions in, you can use a rope gun and a glider to grapple around like Batman in the Arkham games! And it's still in the Alpha phase!The only downside is that it is not yet optimized. This is a shame because the longer you play, the more fun toys there are to play with, but the slower the game runs, making it harder to enjoy said toys. And it only gets worse underground.I'd be Batmanning it up in the Giant Spider Caves right now if it didn't run at about 13 FPS in my current save file.Still, this is far and away better than your average indie alpha sandbox game. It puts Sir You are Being Hunted, Windforge, StarForge, and Edge of Space to shame. In my opinion, it's worth every penny full price as is, let alone when it's finished.			"

								After putting in a full solid day worth of playing I can say this game did not impress me at first.  I found it incomplete having some quests/ dialog voice acted (poorly I might add) and others not at all as well as sketchy UI and graphics issues.  My original intentions were to buy this game for my kids however I'm changing my mind on that due to the games inherent lack of any type of tutorial system.  Some very basic things are outlined for you but most of it is glossed over with little to no detail.  For example you'll have a quest to obtain certain plant types (or kill certain animals).  The most help you'll receive is an extremely tiny picture (literally maybe 50x50 pixels) of what you need to find.  I found myself having to search the online wiki a few times just to get an idea what the heck I was looking for.  Also from what I can gather there is no way to know what you're looking at - mousing over animals or plants doesn't give you the slightest idea what it is you're looking at.  So all you have to go off of is this tiny picture in the mission UI.After a few hours of play though the game did start to grow on me.  It felt like a mix of Minecraft and a RPG.  The graphics are adequate, the game runs fair at best on my i7 Crossfire rig under max settings.  I think this is in part the game does not run in true full screen mode.   I have a triple monitor setup (non eyefinity) and many times (during battle mostly) found myself clicking off the screen thus pushing the game to the background.  In other words in this alleged full screen mode you can still move the mouse beyond the frame of the game.  Also since this is not true full screen it probably plays a role in why crossfire / SLI can't be fully utilized.  Also let me add the game crashed after several hours of play due to a memory leak.If you are running high resolution (1920x1080 for myself) the UI does not scale proportionally making it difficult to see / read.  To my knowledge you can move the UI around which helps you customize and tailor to you needs but you cannot resize any of it.  This is especially true for the mini map.  Devs if you're listening please make the UI scalable / let us resize as we see fit.   I honestly feel the game has huge potential but in its current state needs work.  It definetely feels like an early access game.  If the developers keep an ear to the ground and resolve some of these basic issues this game will have serious legs.As it stands as of today I'd give this title a 76 out of 100.  If the full screen issue was resolved, the game was fully voice acted, and there were better UI and tutorials it would score in the mid to high 80s for me.I'll continue to play it as I feel I've only scratched the surface of what the game has to offer.  I will update this review in the future if need be.update 9/3/2014Ok I completely underestimated this game.  The amount of depth that has gone into the crafting system is impressive.  You go from wooden swords to laser rifles, gatling turrets for base defence - not to mention custom vehicles and aircraft even!  I'm hooked now.  Again because the dev's are doing some things I haven't seen before in a game (which is a good thing) and the lack luster in game help it was slightly frustrating at first.  I watched a few tutorials on YouTube and finally had that ""aha"" moment with crafting a vehicle.Even in its current Alpha state I'd now give this game a solid 84 out of 100.  I visited the dev website and checked out their forum.  I was very impressed with what appears to be ears to the ground regarding player feedback.  There are pinned posts with the most common suggestions they've looked at and are considering.  As well as status updates galore.  Keep up the good work Pathea!			"

Early Access Review
								At first, I was mildly excited for a voxel based Minecraft clone, with real combat and a few other advances. To say I have been pleasantly surprised is a gross understatement. I wildly underestimated both the technical expertise of the developers and the coherence and beauty of their vision. BUILDINGTo get a sense of their intent; take Minecraft construction and speed it up a bit, make it take significantly less gathering time, and shrink the scale of any project. In other words, the world of Planet Explorers lends itself to building more things faster, and toward those things feeling like part of a bigger world. (this is not meant as universal praise)TERRAINThe biomes in Planet Explorers (story mode) are gargantuan. You truly feel totally immersed in an alien world, hoofing it across grassy plains. Your character will witness the sun rise and set behind massive mountains that actually sometimes require planning to bypass them to reach your destination quicker or safer! In other words, the terrain achieves relevance AS TERRAIN while at the same time being fully terraformable. WILDLIFEAdding to this are the herds of fauna. In addition to the large number of different types of creatures, there is a huge number of types of AI. You will witness flyers ganging up on prey, troops of monkey creatures fighting off predators, those same predators catching lone monkeys, and many other realistic situations. CRAFTINGSo you take this mix; quick construction, living, breathing fauna, and a gorgeous natural environment, and to it add a heavy layer of crafting. Crafting is very well done, leaning toward recipe trees that make harvesting always fun and profitable, while reducing the actual act of crafting to a minimum (for good or ill). This causes occasional lulls in the frenzied bouts of construction, while allowing one to get back to it after a refreshing harvest period. COMBATCombat is odd. It fufills its function properly; requiring you to watch your back, but not too much, allowing some experimentation and failure without too heavy a penalty, and giving a sense of progress and empowerment over time. The combat itself is fairly clunky at the moment. One's character is required to completely stop moving to perform a combat action (swing, shoot, throw) so it isn't super fast paced action twitch combat. It is however often frenetic and thrilling. My only objection is that healing items are instantly applied and heal for huge amounts, often 70% of your HP. Personally I'd prefer they back off on instant huge heals and, like combat, go for slightly slower action, requiring planning and preparation. SUMMARYOverall, better than I ever imagined I'd get in a game featuring heavy terraforming and construction. To have so many and such varied systems layered atop an already well executed creation game is, frankly, dreamy. PROS & CONS- wildlife view distance is fairly low, leading to some pop-in and unrealistic situations- voxel technology has a ways to go; your creations have a far smaller draw distance than everything else. Again, pop-in.- players who enjoy this type of slower combat don't want to monitor their HP bars for sudden precipitous drops; they want to monitor the RATE of DECREASE of their HP. Conversely, allow movement during combat actions to move toward more action oriented combat.- runs pretty heavily on my SSD, 3+ghz multi-core, decent gfx card system. Not sure if it needs optimization or it's just a heavy game, but either way it wants a beefy system.- texture detail is varied. some are goregous and sharp, others are, hopefully, placeholders.- the humanoid characters look fantastic in terms of animation and graphics. really top notch.- bullets and lasers should really be far faster. - lighting is fantastic both indoors and out. doesn't hog up my FPS, either. (how the hell?!?)- water looks great, needs physics based waves. keeping my fingers crossed.SPECIAL MENTION- billboard grass done right! The view distance on the 3d grass is mind-blowing, and the way they animated it is perfection. Wow.- flowers that bloom at certain times of day! huge boost to immersion- the person behind the ""ambience"" features in this game is a genius. floating petals and flowery debris is such a subtle but effective addition to the plains biome.

Early Access Review
								played the game for roughly 2 hours straight in story mode, and it's pretty fun :D I love digging holes :D really really really BIG HOLES :D lol I aslo love the crafting system in this game, the only thing I hope gets implemented into the game, is Sneaking, crouching, cralling, hiding in the foilage, those sort of things, cause running from a fireball spitting giant creature that has a long range in the dead of night and only have a stone sword and wooden shield, means RUN RUN RUN XD Had to lose it in a rock formation but that thing followed me for a LONG way lol persistent creature xD lol There's a Lot i've yet to do in this game, but I'm Loving everything I've seen so far, the sheere awesomeness of the landscape, minus the grass that always faces me, is AMAZING, and even better is I can screw around with almost all of it :D Diggy Diggy Hole~~~ xD I say this game is well worth $25 it costs, It's fun once you know what your doing, hell it's fun even when your still figuring out what does what xD still trying to figure out how to place items like seeds and turrets, but thats my own problem to solve once i get back into the game lol :D Another thing I hope to see in the future, is a Single Player proceduraly generated worlds, not just multiplayer ones xD cause there will come a day, when I just tire of story modes large world, and wanna play in a world with custom presets and what not to make things even more interesting.My favorite thing about this game so far, in terms of laughing, was watching the docter guy carrying the lady on his back, and RUNING LIKE A MAD MAN XD serously! He took off like he had a rocket shoved up his♥♥♥♥♥despite the fact that he was carrying a person, and told me to Protect Him xD I couldn't even keep up with him xD but it was pretty funny.Another thign I'd love to see implemented in the game, is a way to design out own creatures, you know, go out, hunt some animals gather their meats and furs and bones and stuff, and then build some kind of cloning/splicing machine that lets you take features of already existing animals, like body types, agressiveness, health, abilities, strength ect and build the creature. A system like that would make the game even more interesting then it already is, since we can share buildings and what now and be able to download them from other players, why not implement a animal creation, to give the world a even more populated feeling, besides, we Are a Space Fairing race with advanced technology in game are we not? who says we don't have the tech to create our own creatures? I know I'd love to make a tiny little alien creature to have fun with.			"

								This is a FUN game. I'm just a player, so I can't really (nor do I want to) write a full length review of the game. My only regret with being the first of my friends with buying the game is that I have no one to play online with (Don't like playing with strangers). Another problem (Which no one can complain about knowing that the game is in alpha....I'm just bringing it to light) the story is not completed...This is driving me crazy. I really want to finish the story.			"

This game has ALL the potentials and i am definitely one to support this game*11/10 - will always play and down if anyone wants to play with me :)AFTER RELEASE - This game has become much much much much better. They've fixed issues with the GUI and other issues along the wa and generally made the game a better experience to play ^-^ 22/10			"

Early Access Review
								In a nutshell, and for those that are hesitant or confused on what Planet Explorers truly is, it's a concoction comprised of Starbound and Minecraft, and then what Star Forge was expected to be, but has since fallen short of. If two of the three titles I mentioned ring a bell and you enjoyed them (or in Star Forge's case, didn't and wanted more), you're more than likely going to enjoy this game. Continuing this with this thought, let me explain further, it takes its great exploration and sandbox-like feel from Minecraft, almost heavily with a lot of flare. Explore and you'll find many biomes, fantastic looking creatures that may or may not want to murder you, and land formations and villages and caves waiting to be explored, glided down from, or spelunked. The areas of land are huge, and are quite aesthetically pleasing. Adventure mode will be your friend if you want to explore with a challenge of mobs. From Starbound it takes the great space feel with many different creatures and customization. Even though it technically looks like it would be more similar to minecraft, the building style present in the game feels much more like Starbound, the buildings can be extremely detailed and massive and amazing (I suggest you go check it out on YouTube or just the Steam Community page), and dont worry, if you want to build without threats, theres a mode just for you, no monsters to ruin your time. And from the image of Star Forge, the look and feel of the game and combat (although not quite as… hectic). The generation, the funky mobs, the unexplained, it all fits in very well for the image I had constructed of Star Forge. And to kick it all off, there is a pretty decent (although sometimes grindy RPG style) story to it that explains the occurrences and sends you exploring and hunting and building and saving and protecting the many people of the storyline (which, for better or worse, features almost full voice-acting). I wont spoil anything, but to give an overview of the intro, you are placed in a futuristic setting in which Earth has been browned and polluted, many of the other solar system’s planets and moons colonized and populated, and to branch out further with new hope for the human race as a whole (especially that of Earth’s), you and many many other people were sent to a planet to colonize it and research further. It was scanned and checked before arrival and there shouldn’t be any surprises, however, upon descent, your ship hits something mid-air, evacuation procedures initiate, and off you go to this planet at extreme speeds. Good luck.tl;dr and overall: Pretty good game with a lot of content that is just magnified upon adding more than one person (although no multiplayer Story mode is very disappointing). Crazy builds available for download made by the community, which is more or less balanced in resource cost, makes it even better. Lots of exploration to be had. Good way into the story myself, and I am enjoying it, but sometimes the AI gets a little… wonky. In its current state 7/10 Would recommend, with forewarning of Early-Access. Definitely some bugs (but most can be solved by saving and reloading in Story). Worth every cent.			"

Early Access Review
								Updated Review:After the devs started undertaking an overhall of the game, I tabled it for a while.  I had already completed the story, had my save wiped, and completed it again, so I didn't feel I was missing much.  18 months later, with a0.9 out, i picked it up again... and it's boring.  NOTHING CHANGED!  The view is exactly the same and the graphics don't feel any different.  I looked up a screen shot of my last save, and they look nearly identical, with a few slight differences.  Before the view distances were synced properly, but now the grass can go on forever with no terrain beneath it, making it look like the grass can fly.  There's a weird haze over anything further than ten feet, and the close plants don't appear as vibrant either.  Loading times are longer, and lag spikes are more frequent, but watching my computer performance, not linked to high hardware demands.  So I take it back, it doesn't look the same as before 0.9, it actually looks a bit worse.Sounds now detract from immersion.  Ambient noises like the ocean waves cannot be turned down without turning down sound effects as well.  Voices are hard to hear, and the text font sometimes goes blurry.  The music used to be nice, but after hearing the same thing for hours, it gets monotonous.  The tracks are short and there's little diversity if you're staying in the same area for a long while.  Weapons are put away in the middle of combat because you changed your view angle.  Bows are so weak you might as well be throwing rocks, but you get guns and laser pistols soon enough.  Those also suck until you spend the time upgrading, which I highly recommend.  The turrets are more fond of shooting your own base than any enemy, and there's no quick way to refill them.  Axes won't start hacking at trees unless you have them drawn, not just equiped but drawn.  The interactions to harvest plants are choppy and irritating.  Monsters will despawn while you're still trying to empty their inventory.  Trees magically regain all of their durability if you stop hacking at them for more than a second.The creator tool is still awesome, but at the same time aggravating.  You can create many amazing things, like if you want to spend hours making a sword or carving out a shield, or possibly days on something bigger.  You can change your view angle, and camera locationg, but working intricate designs is extremely difficult.  Even curves are a pain, so most initial designs come out looking like boxes.  I'm not really into moschism, so I just use the scripts or workshop.  I did build my own helicopter though, and let me tell you that's a challenge.  The softest landings damage it, despite tires and iron struts.  That's fine, helicopters are delicate.  So delicate that if you ram into an invisible tree, your creation is dead.  There are also invisible walls marking the edge of the story zone.  No semi-transparent warning, nope, just flaming death.The camps have been changed since I last played though.  Before, the martian camp was decorated with everything they could want or need, which is in line with the story, and I happily stole it all.  Yeah, suck it martians.  I guess the devs didn't like that tactic because now the martians have the same camp, but with skeleton buildings.  No doors, no stairs, no pretty plants, nothing.  And the buildings themselves didn't change to accomodate, they just stripped them bare.The pathing has been improved slightly (very slightly).  Now my followers don't get stuck in a cave, but they do still walk off plateaus, get trapped in rivers ten feet from the beach, get stuck inside buildings, or inside trees, or rarely stuck in an empty field with nothing around.  If you have them assigned to a work station they'll sometimes teleport though, so yay I guess.  Okay, so I ragged on it a bit, but that's mostly due to the devs spending a year getting 0.9 out, and the transition being less than stellar.The price has gone up a bit since I first bought it, but for those that have never played it before, I still recommend the purchase (currently $25).  Yes, it's incomplete and the movements aren't fluid, and mining is slow and painful, but your first dive in will be to an incredible new world with a story that actually makes you curious about why the martians and earthlings hate eachother.  I don't think I ever really found out besides there was a war or something, but I hope there's more (otherwise the backstory sucks and needs some filling out).  Edit:Previous Review, Jun 23, 2014I currently recommend SINGLE PLAYER for this game. While there is a multiplayer function, the lag is terrible on servers of size >6. As for single player story mode.Great game, especially for being in alpha. No major bugs that I found, but at the same time not everything is working yet, which is to be expected. The scanner is the only real pain right now as minerals don't always show up. Combat is as expected, though a first person view would be great for those tighter areas. The story is engaging as I'm trying to solve the internal human problems as well as slowly imagining a history for the alien species. The graphics are amazing, even on low settings, and while there are very different regions, they transition smoothly.			"

The crafting system and mouse abilities, might need some tweaking for easier crafting and access to those options, but from the very start there is so much you can do that it is impossible to be bored and with all the content now and to come the game will be very very popular for multiplayer/co op with friends! A sure win and a sure buy!			"

								Craft/sandbox games are popping up everywhere since the success of Mincecraft.Many of them arn't bad, but are nothing more then ""meh"" MC clones (I have tried alot of them, and most couldn't keep me interested for very long.)Then there is this beauty.You can mine, chop, and dig, but the landscape isn't ""cubed"" but adapts dynamically.And ofcourseyou can craft a vast amount of items, build tools, houses, bases, vehicles, etc...But wait ! There is more ! you also have a spore-style editor in-game to craft blueprints for your own custom <any item>.When you are finished building your blueprint (in the game called an ""ISO"") the game calculates what parts and materials you need to build it, and you can create and use it in-game.Exploration is encouraged, and is much more fun then most MC-style games, because the landscape actually is pretty. You spot alien creatures are ripe for the hunting, but carefull, some might just hunt you. Or work in packs.It looks good, it plays good, and it even has story mode ! (also, adventure, build, ...)If you enjoy Crafting/sandbox/survival games, this one is a must-try.			"

Building, resource gathering, EQ upgrades, colony establishment and maintenance, INTELLIGENT Colonists, tons of building materials, tons of recipes and more. Add to that very modern, almost state-of-the-art, graphics and this is a game that I know I will play for a very long time. Oh, it has a built-in 3D modeler you can build your own objects, like guns, vehicles and dwellings, and export them to play in your games, or to share online! The creators of Planet Explorers have truly done great work, and like I said, it is in Alpha, so there is so much more to come!10/10			"

								Note: At the time of this writing, the game is on Alpha version 0.82.I like that you can download objects from other players from right in the game. I haven't been able to try out the multiplayer yet but I'm looking forward to it. The NPCs in the story do a great job of giving you the scripts you need to build almost everything as long as you do the side quests. It's also nice that I can sell my extra wood and marble to them before buying an item to 'trade' my wood/marble for newer tools.I am enjoying the story missions, when I don't run into a quest stopping bug (Up! Up! Up!). The game has its share of bugs like not locking the mouse into the game window during fullscreen. For dual monitor setups, this means your game will go into window mode every time you click outside of it. I change my setup to single monitor when playing. My game has not crashed at all since the 0.82 update.One of the tricks for a few of the bugs you'll encounter is to save your game often. IF you hit a bug, load up your last save and try again. If you get stuck on a quest ad don't have a save; save, quit, load. I got stuck on a quest to rescue some survivors from a stuck ship and almost gave up after reloading a few times and then it suddenly worked without explanation.tl;dr: It's a great game with a few bugs. The game has great potential. If you like sandbox builders and save often, you'll love this game.			"

Everything you want in a video game and moreI've only been playing for a dozen hours but so far I'm immensely impressed by the quality and originality of the game. In recent years (due to the success of MineCraft) the game market has become saturated with sandbox survival games, with few titles delivering a compelling experience. Starting off in story mode, the game plays and functions very much like a normal 3d RPG, the fact that you can alter your surroundings in this world hardly ever registers as its quality is similar to that of any MMORPG of around 2008 (WoW, Guild Wars, etc.). Although the visuals don't (currently) feature HD graphics the world of Maria still manages to be brilliantly beautiful and captivating, relying more on ambiance, flora, lighting, and simplistic symmetry to carve out an idyllic image on various unique landscapes.From the moment you crash land on Maria you will be immersed in the whole world and evolving storyline. The game seamlessly blends sci-fi and medieval elements, making you feel as though you are struggling to survive when beginning with nothing. While you may start off running about with a knife, very soon you will upgrade yourself to a sword and shield, and later laser guns. The combat itself is rather simplistic, point and shoot or stand and stab, but there's enough large monsters to keep you on your toes as you frantically attempt to run between camp on the open plains. (Frankly I'm not sure if the dark forest with lurking wolves or the open tundra with giant warbirds is more terrifying).Of course at the stage of development there are some bugs, but the only game breaking one seems to be an issue with NPC ""following"" which may disrupt certain quests in the storyline, resulting in a little bit of frustration in trying to escort a glitchy zig-zaging NPC stuck in the ground. Most of the other bugs are pretty minor and I've seen a lot worse in games that put out on the market, so it seems like Pathea is dead set on making a high quality game. While it probably won't see as much success as Minecraft, it'll definetley make a great showing and is a fantastic first game for the publisher.			"

My biggest gripes would be the lack of much of a true tutorial/instructions in missions, and that the ""builder"" feature's learning curve is pretty steep. The alien AI is pretty darn good for being unfinished, and the graphics are so far very nice. If you're unsure, maybe wait until this game hits beta or release.

It is like minecraft in the world is your playground aspect, but it has potential to be even more with decent visuals and custom model creation.  Being experienced in 3dMax and being an artist this game gives me the drive I haven't felt in a while.   You can customize weapons, vehicles, and make objects just to display your creative talent.  I highly recomend this game and hope that it becomes more then the masterpiece it already is.			"

								Quite a lot of promise. Lots of tools to craft, materials to mine, and creatures to fight. The creation system is one of the best I've seen in a sandbox game, and the variety of gadgets to play with is outstanding. Just a few missions in, you can use a rope gun and a glider to grapple around like Batman in the Arkham games! And it's still in the Alpha phase!The only downside is that it is not yet optimized. This is a shame because the longer you play, the more fun toys there are to play with, but the slower the game runs, making it harder to enjoy said toys. And it only gets worse underground.I'd be Batmanning it up in the Giant Spider Caves right now if it didn't run at about 13 FPS in my current save file.Still, this is far and away better than your average indie alpha sandbox game. It puts Sir You are Being Hunted, Windforge, StarForge, and Edge of Space to shame. In my opinion, it's worth every penny full price as is, let alone when it's finished.			"

								After putting in a full solid day worth of playing I can say this game did not impress me at first.  I found it incomplete having some quests/ dialog voice acted (poorly I might add) and others not at all as well as sketchy UI and graphics issues.  My original intentions were to buy this game for my kids however I'm changing my mind on that due to the games inherent lack of any type of tutorial system.  Some very basic things are outlined for you but most of it is glossed over with little to no detail.  For example you'll have a quest to obtain certain plant types (or kill certain animals).  The most help you'll receive is an extremely tiny picture (literally maybe 50x50 pixels) of what you need to find.  I found myself having to search the online wiki a few times just to get an idea what the heck I was looking for.  Also from what I can gather there is no way to know what you're looking at - mousing over animals or plants doesn't give you the slightest idea what it is you're looking at.  So all you have to go off of is this tiny picture in the mission UI.After a few hours of play though the game did start to grow on me.  It felt like a mix of Minecraft and a RPG.  The graphics are adequate, the game runs fair at best on my i7 Crossfire rig under max settings.  I think this is in part the game does not run in true full screen mode.   I have a triple monitor setup (non eyefinity) and many times (during battle mostly) found myself clicking off the screen thus pushing the game to the background.  In other words in this alleged full screen mode you can still move the mouse beyond the frame of the game.  Also since this is not true full screen it probably plays a role in why crossfire / SLI can't be fully utilized.  Also let me add the game crashed after several hours of play due to a memory leak.If you are running high resolution (1920x1080 for myself) the UI does not scale proportionally making it difficult to see / read.  To my knowledge you can move the UI around which helps you customize and tailor to you needs but you cannot resize any of it.  This is especially true for the mini map.  Devs if you're listening please make the UI scalable / let us resize as we see fit.   I honestly feel the game has huge potential but in its current state needs work.  It definetely feels like an early access game.  If the developers keep an ear to the ground and resolve some of these basic issues this game will have serious legs.As it stands as of today I'd give this title a 76 out of 100.  If the full screen issue was resolved, the game was fully voice acted, and there were better UI and tutorials it would score in the mid to high 80s for me.I'll continue to play it as I feel I've only scratched the surface of what the game has to offer.  I will update this review in the future if need be.update 9/3/2014Ok I completely underestimated this game.  The amount of depth that has gone into the crafting system is impressive.  You go from wooden swords to laser rifles, gatling turrets for base defence - not to mention custom vehicles and aircraft even!  I'm hooked now.  Again because the dev's are doing some things I haven't seen before in a game (which is a good thing) and the lack luster in game help it was slightly frustrating at first.  I watched a few tutorials on YouTube and finally had that ""aha"" moment with crafting a vehicle.Even in its current Alpha state I'd now give this game a solid 84 out of 100.  I visited the dev website and checked out their forum.  I was very impressed with what appears to be ears to the ground regarding player feedback.  There are pinned posts with the most common suggestions they've looked at and are considering.  As well as status updates galore.  Keep up the good work Pathea!			"

								At first, I was mildly excited for a voxel based Minecraft clone, with real combat and a few other advances. To say I have been pleasantly surprised is a gross understatement. I wildly underestimated both the technical expertise of the developers and the coherence and beauty of their vision. BUILDINGTo get a sense of their intent; take Minecraft construction and speed it up a bit, make it take significantly less gathering time, and shrink the scale of any project. In other words, the world of Planet Explorers lends itself to building more things faster, and toward those things feeling like part of a bigger world. (this is not meant as universal praise)TERRAINThe biomes in Planet Explorers (story mode) are gargantuan. You truly feel totally immersed in an alien world, hoofing it across grassy plains. Your character will witness the sun rise and set behind massive mountains that actually sometimes require planning to bypass them to reach your destination quicker or safer! In other words, the terrain achieves relevance AS TERRAIN while at the same time being fully terraformable. WILDLIFEAdding to this are the herds of fauna. In addition to the large number of different types of creatures, there is a huge number of types of AI. You will witness flyers ganging up on prey, troops of monkey creatures fighting off predators, those same predators catching lone monkeys, and many other realistic situations. CRAFTINGSo you take this mix; quick construction, living, breathing fauna, and a gorgeous natural environment, and to it add a heavy layer of crafting. Crafting is very well done, leaning toward recipe trees that make harvesting always fun and profitable, while reducing the actual act of crafting to a minimum (for good or ill). This causes occasional lulls in the frenzied bouts of construction, while allowing one to get back to it after a refreshing harvest period. COMBATCombat is odd. It fufills its function properly; requiring you to watch your back, but not too much, allowing some experimentation and failure without too heavy a penalty, and giving a sense of progress and empowerment over time. The combat itself is fairly clunky at the moment. One's character is required to completely stop moving to perform a combat action (swing, shoot, throw) so it isn't super fast paced action twitch combat. It is however often frenetic and thrilling. My only objection is that healing items are instantly applied and heal for huge amounts, often 70% of your HP. Personally I'd prefer they back off on instant huge heals and, like combat, go for slightly slower action, requiring planning and preparation. SUMMARYOverall, better than I ever imagined I'd get in a game featuring heavy terraforming and construction. To have so many and such varied systems layered atop an already well executed creation game is, frankly, dreamy. PROS & CONS- wildlife view distance is fairly low, leading to some pop-in and unrealistic situations- voxel technology has a ways to go; your creations have a far smaller draw distance than everything else. Again, pop-in.- players who enjoy this type of slower combat don't want to monitor their HP bars for sudden precipitous drops; they want to monitor the RATE of DECREASE of their HP. Conversely, allow movement during combat actions to move toward more action oriented combat.- runs pretty heavily on my SSD, 3+ghz multi-core, decent gfx card system. Not sure if it needs optimization or it's just a heavy game, but either way it wants a beefy system.- texture detail is varied. some are goregous and sharp, others are, hopefully, placeholders.- the humanoid characters look fantastic in terms of animation and graphics. really top notch.- bullets and lasers should really be far faster. - lighting is fantastic both indoors and out. doesn't hog up my FPS, either. (how the hell?!?)- water looks great, needs physics based waves. keeping my fingers crossed.SPECIAL MENTION- billboard grass done right! The view distance on the 3d grass is mind-blowing, and the way they animated it is perfection. Wow.- flowers that bloom at certain times of day! huge boost to immersion- the person behind the ""ambience"" features in this game is a genius. floating petals and flowery debris is such a subtle but effective addition to the plains biome.

								Open world, sandbox style RPG with great combination of brick style building. Voxels make tunneling into the environment seem more realistic. The detail of the mineral blocks is astounding. The environment overall is very impressive, ranging in huge moutains, open beaches, forests, and grasslands. The best part is the ""script"" system for crafting. Tons of fun with this one!			"

								Really well put together and fun game, it is a healthy mix of survival and adventure. the fact that you are not sure what creature is just over the hill gives you the feeling that you are not the biggest threat out there in the world. Some aspects such as mining are really tedious as there is no technologically advanced way to mass mine. However it is balanced with the use of the handheld PC that allows you to locate the ores you need. The voxel crafting system is really fun and puts an awesome twist on the game as you put your own twist on the weapons and vehicles that you use. Some things need to be worked out, but overall a beautiful fun game that has a lot of potential and is heading the right direction. The only thing I see this game is at fault at is lack of direction and purpose. Some more content and FIXING MULTIPLAYER SERVERS SO IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS would be nice. Worth the money if we are to compare this game against other ALPHA games in its league 8/10			"

								Okay I like the game. The crafting system + my horrible drawing created a masterpiece of brilliance and power. Also it killed me the first mountain I jumped (Go me :D)  Combat is Meh... the crafting is amazing. The farming... I won't go into details but, a tree 3 times the size of the town I was just in, chop it down and doesn't even fall and make a noise but, completely DISAPPEARS and materials magiacally pops into your napsack like a camel spider looking for a warm home to spend the night. Some minor but yet noticeable things still good game all in all. I would recommend this game 8/10 solo but 10/10 if you have people to play it with.			"

								Wierdly enough I never heard anybody talk about this game ever, so here you go. Whenever people talk about sandbox games with building mechanics they begin with ""it's like minecraft but [something that makes it totally different]"". This game falls into this category but has some similarities to Cubeworld, too. Mix those two together, add sci-fi, take away the cubes and that is Planet Explorers. 6.4/10 Good Game.			"

								Amazing game with a huge, fascinating alien world to explore. A nice break from zombies to focus on survival and crafting in more original circumstances. The editor is fantastic once you get the hang of it. So far you can craft swords, blasters, land vehicles, boats, aircraft, and shields in minute detail, using your own creativity to design whatever strikes your fancy. Finding new creatures and alien civilizations and artifacts is awesome. Adventure mode creates a randomly generated world for you to explore, and you can even bring friends! Just keep in mind, randomly generated worlds also feature randomly scattered creatures, so you can find yourself facing off against an enormous UFO while you're still wearing cloth armor and armed with a wooden sword and shield.I am extremely excited to see where the developers take this game in the future!

This game has ALL the potentials and i am definitely one to support this game*11/10 - will always play and down if anyone wants to play with me :)AFTER RELEASE - This game has become much much much much better. They've fixed issues with the GUI and other issues along the wa and generally made the game a better experience to play ^-^ 22/10			"

Early Access Review
								In a nutshell, and for those that are hesitant or confused on what Planet Explorers truly is, it's a concoction comprised of Starbound and Minecraft, and then what Star Forge was expected to be, but has since fallen short of. If two of the three titles I mentioned ring a bell and you enjoyed them (or in Star Forge's case, didn't and wanted more), you're more than likely going to enjoy this game. Continuing this with this thought, let me explain further, it takes its great exploration and sandbox-like feel from Minecraft, almost heavily with a lot of flare. Explore and you'll find many biomes, fantastic looking creatures that may or may not want to murder you, and land formations and villages and caves waiting to be explored, glided down from, or spelunked. The areas of land are huge, and are quite aesthetically pleasing. Adventure mode will be your friend if you want to explore with a challenge of mobs. From Starbound it takes the great space feel with many different creatures and customization. Even though it technically looks like it would be more similar to minecraft, the building style present in the game feels much more like Starbound, the buildings can be extremely detailed and massive and amazing (I suggest you go check it out on YouTube or just the Steam Community page), and dont worry, if you want to build without threats, theres a mode just for you, no monsters to ruin your time. And from the image of Star Forge, the look and feel of the game and combat (although not quite as… hectic). The generation, the funky mobs, the unexplained, it all fits in very well for the image I had constructed of Star Forge. And to kick it all off, there is a pretty decent (although sometimes grindy RPG style) story to it that explains the occurrences and sends you exploring and hunting and building and saving and protecting the many people of the storyline (which, for better or worse, features almost full voice-acting). I wont spoil anything, but to give an overview of the intro, you are placed in a futuristic setting in which Earth has been browned and polluted, many of the other solar system’s planets and moons colonized and populated, and to branch out further with new hope for the human race as a whole (especially that of Earth’s), you and many many other people were sent to a planet to colonize it and research further. It was scanned and checked before arrival and there shouldn’t be any surprises, however, upon descent, your ship hits something mid-air, evacuation procedures initiate, and off you go to this planet at extreme speeds. Good luck.tl;dr and overall: Pretty good game with a lot of content that is just magnified upon adding more than one person (although no multiplayer Story mode is very disappointing). Crazy builds available for download made by the community, which is more or less balanced in resource cost, makes it even better. Lots of exploration to be had. Good way into the story myself, and I am enjoying it, but sometimes the AI gets a little… wonky. In its current state 7/10 Would recommend, with forewarning of Early-Access. Definitely some bugs (but most can be solved by saving and reloading in Story). Worth every cent.			"

Early Access Review
								Updated Review:After the devs started undertaking an overhall of the game, I tabled it for a while.  I had already completed the story, had my save wiped, and completed it again, so I didn't feel I was missing much.  18 months later, with a0.9 out, i picked it up again... and it's boring.  NOTHING CHANGED!  The view is exactly the same and the graphics don't feel any different.  I looked up a screen shot of my last save, and they look nearly identical, with a few slight differences.  Before the view distances were synced properly, but now the grass can go on forever with no terrain beneath it, making it look like the grass can fly.  There's a weird haze over anything further than ten feet, and the close plants don't appear as vibrant either.  Loading times are longer, and lag spikes are more frequent, but watching my computer performance, not linked to high hardware demands.  So I take it back, it doesn't look the same as before 0.9, it actually looks a bit worse.Sounds now detract from immersion.  Ambient noises like the ocean waves cannot be turned down without turning down sound effects as well.  Voices are hard to hear, and the text font sometimes goes blurry.  The music used to be nice, but after hearing the same thing for hours, it gets monotonous.  The tracks are short and there's little diversity if you're staying in the same area for a long while.  Weapons are put away in the middle of combat because you changed your view angle.  Bows are so weak you might as well be throwing rocks, but you get guns and laser pistols soon enough.  Those also suck until you spend the time upgrading, which I highly recommend.  The turrets are more fond of shooting your own base than any enemy, and there's no quick way to refill them.  Axes won't start hacking at trees unless you have them drawn, not just equiped but drawn.  The interactions to harvest plants are choppy and irritating.  Monsters will despawn while you're still trying to empty their inventory.  Trees magically regain all of their durability if you stop hacking at them for more than a second.The creator tool is still awesome, but at the same time aggravating.  You can create many amazing things, like if you want to spend hours making a sword or carving out a shield, or possibly days on something bigger.  You can change your view angle, and camera locationg, but working intricate designs is extremely difficult.  Even curves are a pain, so most initial designs come out looking like boxes.  I'm not really into moschism, so I just use the scripts or workshop.  I did build my own helicopter though, and let me tell you that's a challenge.  The softest landings damage it, despite tires and iron struts.  That's fine, helicopters are delicate.  So delicate that if you ram into an invisible tree, your creation is dead.  There are also invisible walls marking the edge of the story zone.  No semi-transparent warning, nope, just flaming death.The camps have been changed since I last played though.  Before, the martian camp was decorated with everything they could want or need, which is in line with the story, and I happily stole it all.  Yeah, suck it martians.  I guess the devs didn't like that tactic because now the martians have the same camp, but with skeleton buildings.  No doors, no stairs, no pretty plants, nothing.  And the buildings themselves didn't change to accomodate, they just stripped them bare.The pathing has been improved slightly (very slightly).  Now my followers don't get stuck in a cave, but they do still walk off plateaus, get trapped in rivers ten feet from the beach, get stuck inside buildings, or inside trees, or rarely stuck in an empty field with nothing around.  If you have them assigned to a work station they'll sometimes teleport though, so yay I guess.  Okay, so I ragged on it a bit, but that's mostly due to the devs spending a year getting 0.9 out, and the transition being less than stellar.The price has gone up a bit since I first bought it, but for those that have never played it before, I still recommend the purchase (currently $25).  Yes, it's incomplete and the movements aren't fluid, and mining is slow and painful, but your first dive in will be to an incredible new world with a story that actually makes you curious about why the martians and earthlings hate eachother.  I don't think I ever really found out besides there was a war or something, but I hope there's more (otherwise the backstory sucks and needs some filling out).  Edit:Previous Review, Jun 23, 2014I currently recommend SINGLE PLAYER for this game. While there is a multiplayer function, the lag is terrible on servers of size >6. As for single player story mode.Great game, especially for being in alpha. No major bugs that I found, but at the same time not everything is working yet, which is to be expected. The scanner is the only real pain right now as minerals don't always show up. Combat is as expected, though a first person view would be great for those tighter areas. The story is engaging as I'm trying to solve the internal human problems as well as slowly imagining a history for the alien species. The graphics are amazing, even on low settings, and while there are very different regions, they transition smoothly.			"

One's character is required to completely stop moving to perform a combat action (swing, shoot, throw) so it isn't super fast paced action twitch combat. It is however often frenetic and thrilling. My only objection is that healing items are instantly applied and heal for huge amounts, often 70% of your HP. Personally I'd prefer they back off on instant huge heals and, like combat, go for slightly slower action, requiring planning and preparation. SUMMARYOverall, better than I ever imagined I'd get in a game featuring heavy terraforming and construction. To have so many and such varied systems layered atop an already well executed creation game is, frankly, dreamy. PROS & CONS- wildlife view distance is fairly low, leading to some pop-in and unrealistic situations- voxel technology has a ways to go; your creations have a far smaller draw distance than everything else. Again, pop-in.- players who enjoy this type of slower combat don't want to monitor their HP bars for sudden precipitous drops; they want to monitor the RATE of DECREASE of their HP. Conversely, allow movement during combat actions to move toward more action oriented combat.- runs pretty heavily on my SSD, 3+ghz multi-core, decent gfx card system. Not sure if it needs optimization or it's just a heavy game, but either way it wants a beefy system.- texture detail is varied. some are goregous and sharp, others are, hopefully, placeholders.- the humanoid characters look fantastic in terms of animation and graphics. really top notch.- bullets and lasers should really be far faster. - lighting is fantastic both indoors and out. doesn't hog up my FPS, either. (how the hell?!?)- water looks great, needs physics based waves. keeping my fingers crossed.SPECIAL MENTION- billboard grass done right! The view distance on the 3d grass is mind-blowing, and the way they animated it is perfection. Wow.- flowers that bloom at certain times of day! huge boost to immersion- the person behind the ""ambience"" features in this game is a genius. floating petals and flowery debris is such a subtle but effective addition to the plains biome.

								Open world, sandbox style RPG with great combination of brick style building. Voxels make tunneling into the environment seem more realistic. The detail of the mineral blocks is astounding. The environment overall is very impressive, ranging in huge moutains, open beaches, forests, and grasslands. The best part is the ""script"" system for crafting. Tons of fun with this one!			"

								Really well put together and fun game, it is a healthy mix of survival and adventure. the fact that you are not sure what creature is just over the hill gives you the feeling that you are not the biggest threat out there in the world. Some aspects such as mining are really tedious as there is no technologically advanced way to mass mine. However it is balanced with the use of the handheld PC that allows you to locate the ores you need. The voxel crafting system is really fun and puts an awesome twist on the game as you put your own twist on the weapons and vehicles that you use. Some things need to be worked out, but overall a beautiful fun game that has a lot of potential and is heading the right direction. The only thing I see this game is at fault at is lack of direction and purpose. Some more content and FIXING MULTIPLAYER SERVERS SO IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS would be nice. Worth the money if we are to compare this game against other ALPHA games in its league 8/10			"

								Okay I like the game. The crafting system + my horrible drawing created a masterpiece of brilliance and power. Also it killed me the first mountain I jumped (Go me :D)  Combat is Meh... the crafting is amazing. The farming... I won't go into details but, a tree 3 times the size of the town I was just in, chop it down and doesn't even fall and make a noise but, completely DISAPPEARS and materials magiacally pops into your napsack like a camel spider looking for a warm home to spend the night. Some minor but yet noticeable things still good game all in all. I would recommend this game 8/10 solo but 10/10 if you have people to play it with.			"

								Although only in the alpha and the fact that I've only played for around an hour, I'm already super excited to see how the game will be once finished. Concept is fun, looks incredible (albeit needing a few tweaks here and there), gameplay has worked fine so far, and once they sort out the multiplayer (or I learn how to use it properly) I'm sure to have a lot of fun with a couple of buds. With the idea of building tools and learning the recipes for new 'toys', a buddy of mine summed up a big portion of the game pretty well, ""it's like minecraft... only nicer looking""			"

								BUY THIS GAME, if you like open-world sandboxes, you will not regret this purchase. There is so much to do... It's a bit overwhelming at first, but once you know what you're doing, this is a very enjoyable game. It's kind of like if minecraft was built in a realistic world... and in space. Or maybe a 3D starbound. Just as addictive, at least.I've had a few problems with broken missions and inventory items dissapearing, but it's rare and will likely be fixed very soon. With that said, for an alpha, this game is phenominal! This is one of those games that comes along and changes the tide of every game made after it.I've played about 10 hours logged and 5 offline, So far I've only built my first vehicle, encountered my first sentient aliens, and my first gigantic monster-bug. 15 hours and I've only scratched the surface of this game... I see a LOT of replay value here, especially with mods.... I'm very excited to see the finished product!			"

Early Access Review
								SPOILER: This review is small and pretty opinionated. It is  not  a comprehensive review on all features and I  have not  explored every feature availble to the game currently, just most of them. I likely will not explore too much more of the game and it's features but, as I support this game, I will closely monitor it's patches and development.PROS: For the most part, in it's current state, this game is very fun to play.-Multiplayer; being able to gather materials faster and more efficiently to be able to build helicopter gunships for decimating alien encampments is far too much fun. Honestly, after my experience playing the game with my friends, the fun we had was almost criminal.-Hunting; when it comes to hunting these large-scale dinosaur-like creatures, this game really shines. Especially when you have access to better gear so you don't have to rely on hit and run tactics to lure the beasts towards your substantially better equipped AI.-Crafting; holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ Being able to craft  real  technology is amazing. No more of that unnecessarily complicated, unreasonably restrictive redstone fluffy flutter from Minecraft.  Real Technology  with a  real impact  on gameplay and progression. The list of available recipes is gigantic and, at first, very overwhelming. But it makes the game really something to behold.-Vehicles; worth. Do you like strapping lazer canons and missile silos onto a poorly made car with thrusters and calling it a helicopter gunship? I do. Do you like using that very same vehicle to wreak mayhem and destruction on those god damned Aliens that endlessly spawn from their camps? I do.CONS: That's right, you knew we would get to this part as soon as you saw the word ""pros"". And to a great degree of sadness, this list is much larger than the other one. So much larger, it's hard to pick a good starting place.-Multiplayer; ♥♥♥♥ing port-forwarding. Everyone's least favorite chore. I  literally  have friends who would rather pay me their hard-earned, broke college student funds than do their own port-forwarding. Ironically, even I don't like doing it. It's bizarre; it's complicated and simple at the same time. Usually you just go to your router's browser page at 192.168.1.1 and follow some simple directions to get the port forwarded. Combine that with some firewall exceptions and you've got yourself an open port for some multiplayer madness. Assuming it actually works. Which, most of the time, is the problem. There's almost  never  a layman's solution to port-forwarding without buying a program to forward the ports for you. You can't just strap in and forward the ports without having to learn the arbitrary process first, it rapidly gets you very involved and educated on how to do it like a professional through a mind-numbing few hours of trial and error. And unless you do it the mythical  right way,  which is different per router, you'll find that before long your ports are closed again. tl;dr port forwarding for multiplayer is a bad solution, but a cheap one. Invest a little in better multiplayer and watch the crowds eat up your game.-Hunting; oh boy. Want to hunt something that can't  wreck  you like it's name was Ralph? Really boring and offers almost nothing you'll need to build decent survival gear or buy it. Want to hunt something that  actually  gives a worthwhile supply of necessary materials like animal skins and fat or isn't just plain boring to fight? Well be prepared to overly rely on your AI or multiplayer comrades because otherwise it will kill you and♥♥♥♥♥♥your corpse into the ocean. For most of the entire game, it's usually a far safer idea to simply avoid almost everything and mine for materials in vast quantities to be able to emerge from the earth as the most powerful entity on the planet. But then the game is boring because nothing provides a challenge anymore.-Crafting; bore chore. As excellent as the crafting system of this game is at delivering impacful technology that feels as good as it performs... Actually crafting it is obnoxiously boring. It's all about making excessively vast quantities of little materials to be able to make smaller and smaller quantities of larger and larger materials until you have everything you need. The only redeeming feature here is that you can produce things in bulk, which you'll quite often rely on because otherwise you'll have to make  all  of the necessary materials over and over again until you no longer need to make whatever oddity you're crafting to begin with. It takes such a long time to make anything worthwhile or important,  especially  the various vehicles in the game.-Vehicles; I didn't sign up for this. The vehicle creation menu/functionality is a very frustrating feature of the game. Especially for those like myself that aren't very creative-minded and  SWEAT  when presented that much crafting freedom. As much as I like the freedom offered in the feature, you need to at least present some guidelines or most players will just be lost in the age old question of ""Where the ♥♥♥♥ do I even start?"" Let's not even get that much into the controls of the vehicle crafting feature because all that needs to be said is prepare to rely on the undo function heavily as you constantly mutter ""I didn't want to do that"". Or the arbitrary fact that you have to go into a separate menu just to assign wheels for steering. Last, the fukitol cherry on top, multiplayer additional seating is present in the game but currently not functioning properly or even with any sense of purpose. But I imagine that last bit will be fixed soon.-Gathering; so many problems. Wood gathering? Takes too damn long if you want to get any worthwhile amount of wood that is determined seemingly  at ♥♥♥♥ing random  based on the size of the tree you're chopping down. Mineral gathering? Prepare to scour every inch of the planet trying to even  find  these materials. They're arbitrarily hard to locate; but I guess that's not so bad when you can mine them in the thousands if you're willing to spend the time doing it once you actually find a vein. Underwater/Oceanic gathering? Unfortunately necessary for the later parts of the game. To make matters worse, to build a boat for easy/safe underwater/oceanic gathering you need oil/petroleum. To get this, you need a boat to be able to safely traverse the waters without getting immediately killed by a dino-shark-demon. I'm sure you see the cycle here.-Voxels/Vertices/Whatever; the last, but greatest con.  NEVER IN THIS GAME IS IT WORTH TO MINE WITHOUT AT LEAST A COPPER PICKAXE  You'll mine voxels/vertices/whatever so finely that creating a mine to work in that isn't game breaking or safe to actually stand in is next to impossible unless you're really diligent and have the time on hand to actually do it. Copper pickaxes are one of the first pickaxes that actually mine larger voxels/vertices so you can make flat surfaces for mining much more easily. But again, this is mainly only achievable if you are willing to take the time necessary to actually do that. And based on the reactions of my friends in multiplayer, nobody wants  that  job.That would be about it. I really enjoy this game, but it just needs a few fixes and gameplay changes. But this should be expected as it is still in alpha. Would I recommend this game? Definitely. Would I recommend this game while it's still in alpha? Yeah, I still would. But there are definitely some fixes that need to happen for the dev team to maximize player enjoyment. If you're sitting on the fence with this game, allow me to say that it's well worth it if you're willing to look past some clear flaws and just have fun playing what works really well. Either way, keep a close eye on the game's development and patches for improvements and fixes; I know I will be.			"

Early Access Review
								I have played mostly the story mode, using the building functionality to weave in a little creativity, but I have yet to play this a la Minecraft. But I really, really like the game! The story is interesting, the world is immersive, and it's just plain cool. It's a very well done game. However, it's by all means still in Beta.My complaints:-Some of the missions require walking back and forth across the (very large) map, with fast traveling not an option when you have a follower. I dislike that, it's a waste of time. Enabling followers to fast travel with you would fix this, and I'm confident they'll do that before the final version.-The storyline gets implayable at a certain point. I hit a wall where a bug disallowed the game from recognizing one action as complete, and it couldn't progress the story. Obviously, these will be handled before a full release, so it's not fair to say the game is bad when it's simply (and admittedly) incomplete, but I thought it was nonetheless worth mentioning in my review.-Gathering resources to go through stuff you use in regular gameplay gets a little tedious. You can buy resources from certain NPCs, but the quantities available are small and the prices high. Building your own stuff is a nice part of the game, but gathering resources for an hour just to restock on bullets is annoying. Again, I expect they may improve this before the final release.My praises:-I really like the way combat is done, the way you can focus on it or not. There's a fair amount of combat to be done, but I just made automatic turrets, carry them in my inventory, and let them take care of whatever it is while I just keep clear. That way, combat for me is just making sure I've got enough turrets and ammo in my inventory for whatever I expect to fight.-The RPG and the sandbox elements work together really nicely.-The opening quests do a good job explaining how the game works. It did take me a minute to figure out what buttons to press, but once I got that down the explanations were helpful without being annoying.All in all, I think this game will be one of my favorites once it's done. The RPG gameplay seems to only be 60% done, whereas the builder gameplay seems to be 95% up and running. So depending on your gameplay preferences, you may prefer to wait it out until it's a little more complete. I personally chose to put it aside and plan to revisit it when it's complete, since I was more focused on the RPG gameplay, but I definitely recommend it either way.			"

								Now I've had the game for a while, I will write another review.Good:Infinite worldsLots of biomesLots of cool and different animalsGIANT ROBOTSA cool sense of explorationYou can make helicopters, cars, planes, boats, 100% customization of basically all items (even your own decals and stuff) Alien camps that you can invadeFriendly camps where you can buy materials and tools if you can't find themThe crafting system is pretty big and lots of parts to makeConstant updatesBad:Cutting down trees is annoying. You have to stand in the exact right place to be able to cut it, no matter how big it is it just dissapears into your inventory when your done and you keep on clipping inside of it like it's not even thereCombat is sloppy. You might as well be cutting onions.It is hard to see above the water when swimmingMining could be a bit betterGathering plants can be quite hard, you have to stand in the right place to get itQuite a few random glitches (crashes, flying for no reason etc.)Overall it is a really good game but could do with a bit of a polish, and the updates should be more focused on fixing bugs and improving things that are already there instead of adding more features into the game. I would definately recommend this game. 8/10 ( update from my previous 7/10)			"

								Surprisingly advanced for an Early Release. The story line is believable, voice acted, and complex. The world (I've only seen the first 2 areas of 7 I'm guessting), is massive, varied, and not without dangers. No, you won't get chewed up by any hostile mob, but when starting out you'll have to run. and mine, and do the quests. Later you'll be able to get on your self-built motorbike, and *try* to outrun a dangerous enemy you found deep in the forst. Will you be able to dodge the trees? Will he? After many many disappointments in its genre, I'm fully willing to say that this is a massive success in the in the Voxel / Survival / Crafting / Single player game, even well beyond anything else out there. My only negative is the ingame music, which sounds like children's lullabies to my ears... But it's easy enough to mute it through the settings (which are completely implemented), and run VLC in the background. Average performance usage of system while running Planet Explorers AND a 720P movie in VLC:CPU 38%RAM usage around 5 GB of 16GB. Nvidia GTX 760, no cooling (not even a fan). Resolution 1920x1080 on main screen running Planet ExplorersResolution 1280x720 on second monitor, playing the Terra Nova Series on 720p. --------------I recommend this game for children, especially those of all ages. This is absolutely playable for children in multiplayer with their parents, and it would be a great experience for them.You can build, and you can dig to find oreyou can do quests to find out more.Sneak around to see beautiful creaturesand learn what could become of own features. ----FANTASTIC GAME!

								TLDR; Recommended, glad I purchased it.It's really addictive. Check the other reviews and, even on the bad ones, notice how many HOURS people log playing this game! I'm ONLY at 13 hours.It reminds me a bit of Uninhabited Planet Survive[en.wikipedia.org] which was a fun show. If you liked the show you'll probably like the game, although I'm certain they have totally unrelated origins.I like exploring, building, and sometimes even following the story.The difficulty isn't very linear, which isn't a bad thing. In the real world you can walk into a forest and attack a rabbit or a bear side by side, but.. which one is more difficult? That's what happens here, too. And smaller isn't always less of a challenge either, likewise some big guys are pushovers. Could make it harder, actually.I haven't had much luck with Online play, though. It works sort-of, but my latency was measured in minutes so it wasn't really playable. Could be just me, but hey, it's a product in development.Solo play is rock solid, the graphics are awesome. There's tons to build and do already. While the game is solid and hasn't crashed on me, as other reviewers point out, it has some bugs. You may never experience them, but they're in there.			"

								I have been eyeing this game for quite some time. I finally pulled the trigger on it and it is now in a pretty enjoyable and playable state.It's turning out to be a very pretty game.If you like games where you craft and build stuff (like minecraft) but with a beautiful 3d engine and a story. . .  jump on in!

								Great solid early access game, that is well worth the price!! Having great fun exploring the plant, inventing new ships and cars and boats and discovering new creatures. Crafting is quite solid but still needs some functions added to it. The carfting system is however very solid already in its present state of development. I highly recommand if you enjoy crafting, building and exploring sandbox games!!!			"

								Fun and addicting. Gameplay can be as simple as you want, or as complicated. Not sure if it's a symptom of the Early access period or not, but it is quite easy to obtain enough resources to quickly craft anything you could want. Item design, exploration, quests and discovery are all very fun. There are a few obvious bugs still in the game, but that is to be expected. I highly recommend this game to anyone who even half-heartedly enjoys any sandbox crafting or survival game.			"

								This game is kinda confusing at the very beginning but all you have to remember is F2 locks and unlocks your cursor and you can harvest alot of the things in the game.  Mining goes below ground with what limit I have yet to try to reach.  The crafting in the game is simple enough and can be done anywhere and you can make multiples at one time in the same time as one which takes alot of the repetativeness of crafting in other games out.  There are a few flaws that I don't like such as the chat popping up when someone talks in a Multiplayer game but if you just move the window out of your way instead of closing it everytime it won't do it anymore.  This review is short for the fact that the game is still in Alpha and I have only played 5 hours so far but this game is definately going in the right track.			"

This game will put you right in the middle of an alien planet and let you explore with virtually no limits. Create amazing items and immediately play using them in-game. You can also export items and share with friends very easily as well! Hands down the best thing about this game is the true sandbox nature, backed up by amazing visuals and an extremely powerful creation system.

								Although only in the alpha and the fact that I've only played for around an hour, I'm already super excited to see how the game will be once finished. Concept is fun, looks incredible (albeit needing a few tweaks here and there), gameplay has worked fine so far, and once they sort out the multiplayer (or I learn how to use it properly) I'm sure to have a lot of fun with a couple of buds. With the idea of building tools and learning the recipes for new 'toys', a buddy of mine summed up a big portion of the game pretty well, ""it's like minecraft... only nicer looking""			"

								BUY THIS GAME, if you like open-world sandboxes, you will not regret this purchase. There is so much to do... It's a bit overwhelming at first, but once you know what you're doing, this is a very enjoyable game. It's kind of like if minecraft was built in a realistic world... and in space. Or maybe a 3D starbound. Just as addictive, at least.I've had a few problems with broken missions and inventory items dissapearing, but it's rare and will likely be fixed very soon. With that said, for an alpha, this game is phenominal! This is one of those games that comes along and changes the tide of every game made after it.I've played about 10 hours logged and 5 offline, So far I've only built my first vehicle, encountered my first sentient aliens, and my first gigantic monster-bug. 15 hours and I've only scratched the surface of this game... I see a LOT of replay value here, especially with mods.... I'm very excited to see the finished product!			"

								   If the amount of time i spent playing this game from the moment i  installed it is any indication, i'd give this game even in it's current alpha state 5 stars.   The combination of Minecraft style crafting system with an RPSesque story mode to give the rest of it some kind of point creates an experience that makes you actually CARE about delving into the depths for that last chunk of iron or coal. the addition of an integrated creation system that allows you to make anything from a stool to a house to a racetrack and a vehicle to race on it in multiplayer, as well as weapons and almost anything else you can imagine while still being constrained by the resources and items you've gathered in-game makes for an incredibly immersive world experience.   i got sucked in and played 33 hours the first two days i had this game. i am almost dreading the final release as the alphas scope only encompasses a small portion of the world so far an approximate 40km square area that i have as yet not found the end of.   support this game, get the alpha!

Early Access Review
								SPOILER: This review is small and pretty opinionated. It is  not  a comprehensive review on all features and I  have not  explored every feature availble to the game currently, just most of them. I likely will not explore too much more of the game and it's features but, as I support this game, I will closely monitor it's patches and development.PROS: For the most part, in it's current state, this game is very fun to play.-Multiplayer; being able to gather materials faster and more efficiently to be able to build helicopter gunships for decimating alien encampments is far too much fun. Honestly, after my experience playing the game with my friends, the fun we had was almost criminal.-Hunting; when it comes to hunting these large-scale dinosaur-like creatures, this game really shines. Especially when you have access to better gear so you don't have to rely on hit and run tactics to lure the beasts towards your substantially better equipped AI.-Crafting; holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ Being able to craft  real  technology is amazing. No more of that unnecessarily complicated, unreasonably restrictive redstone fluffy flutter from Minecraft.  Real Technology  with a  real impact  on gameplay and progression. The list of available recipes is gigantic and, at first, very overwhelming. But it makes the game really something to behold.-Vehicles; worth. Do you like strapping lazer canons and missile silos onto a poorly made car with thrusters and calling it a helicopter gunship? I do. Do you like using that very same vehicle to wreak mayhem and destruction on those god damned Aliens that endlessly spawn from their camps? I do.CONS: That's right, you knew we would get to this part as soon as you saw the word ""pros"". And to a great degree of sadness, this list is much larger than the other one. So much larger, it's hard to pick a good starting place.-Multiplayer; ♥♥♥♥ing port-forwarding. Everyone's least favorite chore. I  literally  have friends who would rather pay me their hard-earned, broke college student funds than do their own port-forwarding. Ironically, even I don't like doing it. It's bizarre; it's complicated and simple at the same time. Usually you just go to your router's browser page at 192.168.1.1 and follow some simple directions to get the port forwarded. Combine that with some firewall exceptions and you've got yourself an open port for some multiplayer madness. Assuming it actually works. Which, most of the time, is the problem. There's almost  never  a layman's solution to port-forwarding without buying a program to forward the ports for you. You can't just strap in and forward the ports without having to learn the arbitrary process first, it rapidly gets you very involved and educated on how to do it like a professional through a mind-numbing few hours of trial and error. And unless you do it the mythical  right way,  which is different per router, you'll find that before long your ports are closed again. tl;dr port forwarding for multiplayer is a bad solution, but a cheap one. Invest a little in better multiplayer and watch the crowds eat up your game.-Hunting; oh boy. Want to hunt something that can't  wreck  you like it's name was Ralph? Really boring and offers almost nothing you'll need to build decent survival gear or buy it. Want to hunt something that  actually  gives a worthwhile supply of necessary materials like animal skins and fat or isn't just plain boring to fight? Well be prepared to overly rely on your AI or multiplayer comrades because otherwise it will kill you and♥♥♥♥♥♥your corpse into the ocean. For most of the entire game, it's usually a far safer idea to simply avoid almost everything and mine for materials in vast quantities to be able to emerge from the earth as the most powerful entity on the planet. But then the game is boring because nothing provides a challenge anymore.-Crafting; bore chore. As excellent as the crafting system of this game is at delivering impacful technology that feels as good as it performs... Actually crafting it is obnoxiously boring. It's all about making excessively vast quantities of little materials to be able to make smaller and smaller quantities of larger and larger materials until you have everything you need. The only redeeming feature here is that you can produce things in bulk, which you'll quite often rely on because otherwise you'll have to make  all  of the necessary materials over and over again until you no longer need to make whatever oddity you're crafting to begin with. It takes such a long time to make anything worthwhile or important,  especially  the various vehicles in the game.-Vehicles; I didn't sign up for this. The vehicle creation menu/functionality is a very frustrating feature of the game. Especially for those like myself that aren't very creative-minded and  SWEAT  when presented that much crafting freedom. As much as I like the freedom offered in the feature, you need to at least present some guidelines or most players will just be lost in the age old question of ""Where the ♥♥♥♥ do I even start?"" Let's not even get that much into the controls of the vehicle crafting feature because all that needs to be said is prepare to rely on the undo function heavily as you constantly mutter ""I didn't want to do that"". Or the arbitrary fact that you have to go into a separate menu just to assign wheels for steering. Last, the fukitol cherry on top, multiplayer additional seating is present in the game but currently not functioning properly or even with any sense of purpose. But I imagine that last bit will be fixed soon.-Gathering; so many problems. Wood gathering? Takes too damn long if you want to get any worthwhile amount of wood that is determined seemingly  at ♥♥♥♥ing random  based on the size of the tree you're chopping down. Mineral gathering? Prepare to scour every inch of the planet trying to even  find  these materials. They're arbitrarily hard to locate; but I guess that's not so bad when you can mine them in the thousands if you're willing to spend the time doing it once you actually find a vein. Underwater/Oceanic gathering? Unfortunately necessary for the later parts of the game. To make matters worse, to build a boat for easy/safe underwater/oceanic gathering you need oil/petroleum. To get this, you need a boat to be able to safely traverse the waters without getting immediately killed by a dino-shark-demon. I'm sure you see the cycle here.-Voxels/Vertices/Whatever; the last, but greatest con.  NEVER IN THIS GAME IS IT WORTH TO MINE WITHOUT AT LEAST A COPPER PICKAXE  You'll mine voxels/vertices/whatever so finely that creating a mine to work in that isn't game breaking or safe to actually stand in is next to impossible unless you're really diligent and have the time on hand to actually do it. Copper pickaxes are one of the first pickaxes that actually mine larger voxels/vertices so you can make flat surfaces for mining much more easily. But again, this is mainly only achievable if you are willing to take the time necessary to actually do that. And based on the reactions of my friends in multiplayer, nobody wants  that  job.That would be about it. I really enjoy this game, but it just needs a few fixes and gameplay changes. But this should be expected as it is still in alpha. Would I recommend this game? Definitely. Would I recommend this game while it's still in alpha? Yeah, I still would. But there are definitely some fixes that need to happen for the dev team to maximize player enjoyment. If you're sitting on the fence with this game, allow me to say that it's well worth it if you're willing to look past some clear flaws and just have fun playing what works really well. Either way, keep a close eye on the game's development and patches for improvements and fixes; I know I will be.			"

								If you're looking at this game trying to decide if it's fun i can say for sure that to me this game is alot of fun. you can design and build ground vehicles, vtols and helicopters and even boats / ships. i can build buildings in the game and save them for faster town and colony building.  Currently there's not much of a goal in the game but the story is looking like it will be interesting and fresh when it's complete. back to building, you can design you're own weapons and shields. more character custimization is on it's way. if you like what you see and want to support the game then pick it up. if your leary of early access then either wait for a 1.0 release or pick it up cheap on sale. so far it's well worth the asking price.

								The early access game has been out and it has a good possible potential to be a good sand box game.Even 6 months on since i last played it some of the OLD bugs are still not fixed.Some of them are npc based, path finding for one through doors, npc money trade. the came thinks the npc does not have enough money for trade when they clearly have in the trade window then after you close the text box that appears the npc ends up with zero funds...When you do trade items the money the npc gains is still far less than the transaction is.NPC creatures still climb over walls and buildings through glitching.A lot of sounds are still missing.When you did a tunnel the light does get darker but too dark as if its the dead of night, even if your close to the entrance of a hole or tunnel.If your fighting with NPC's  you can easily hit them and they turn on you.Huge trees can be walked throughIf your chopping  tree down you have to hold the right mouse, now if you do this and you get attacked then you cant break away from the action and attack the npc thats attacking you.Npc's can see your through objects and earth and attack you or try to.No form of storage to place items in, no chests or crates or boxes. just a npc you give items to... For a sand box you need storage..The game needs a lot of work. But has the potential to be a good game if done well.			"

								simply love the game still needs a little work.. not sure about useing a pick thou perhaps a hand held gadet that has settings so you could ether do flat clearing of land or switch it to making tunnels and other dig modes with upgrades just like the apps for the minral scanner and it would out line its path so you dont make unwanted holes which i find a tad anioning when mining or clearing the land to put a building down other then what Ive said this is a great game with sooo much protenial.... I bought other games like this and this one has the right thing going on landmark is a total fail too much time wasited making things just so you can fine tune a building and there land mass is rubbish unlike this Planet explorers.. and Ive not found anything quite as good the mods for TEKKIT and FTB to be honist untill now love the build system on this game as well .... one little gripe is when you have built a building you come back to it some hours latter or you have logged off and it becomes hard to remove blocks you can delet them but they only diss appear when you log off to main menu ..other then THAT FLIPPING AWSOME GAME ....!!!!!!   :))) 5 star thums up			"

Early Access Review
								(Updated March 2016) No, Planet Explorers is NOT dead. It is still being updated with large substancial patches and currently aims to be released in 2016. Yes, it took a long time since PE reached Greenlight in 2013, but game development simply does take a lot of work and time, especially when we're talking about such a large and refined (optionally) quest-driven sandbox-game with so many - nearly endless - possibilities (change the beautiful world with it's different biomes to your liking, craft all kinds of stuff from tiny decorations over equipment and vehicles to large buildings with the creation-system, keep up your comfort-level to stay healthy, hunt the naturally behaving awesome-looking animals, defeat giant boss-mobs for quests, defend NPCs and your own fully powered-up SF-colony with turrets, discover weird alien structures, scan and dig for ore, play the mainquest or try free survival on procedurally generated worlds...Too many players being impatient and completely ignorant of all warnings about what Early Access means have created a bad reputation for the whole Early Access system. Sadly Planet Explorers is one of these games that have been slandered because of EA and some players even said that Panthea had ""abandoned"" this game, while in reality they have regularly kept on updating it. In my personal opinion, Planet Explorers - even in its current state - is already the best of all games I've ever played. * it features large, beautiful, variated and imaginative non-blocky 3D-game-worlds with different biomes and interesting flora. There's one predefined gameworld for the ""campaign""-mode, plus procedurally generated worlds that players can create with different settings to choose from* even better - these worlds are populated by fantastic creatures (six-leggers like in Martian Dreams!) endemic to each biome, behaving ""naturally"" - meaning herds sticking together while roaming the regions, carnivores hunting herbivores in packs, animals sleeping at night, flocks of birds flying off when getting close, etc. - plus giant boss-mobs too (you juast have to love the whale-like Ostrov Sharks)* on the ""campaign""-world you can discover awesomely weird looking alien ruins, dams, highways, great walls and camps with hand-made alien buildings* in the campaign you can interact with a decent number of unique NPCs, each with their own personality and background-story - and of course quests, ranging from subquests (fetch me x herbs) to really large main quests (defend a camp with turrets, defeat giant robots/mobs, learn to grow plants, establish a whole colony with different powered structures)* by now you can play PE both (or alternating) in first person and third person mode btw.* you can build extremely large structures like bridges, walls and buildings etremely quickly directly into the game-world with the smootest gameplay mechanics ever. You can save your structures and then copy more of them into the world too - however logically you will need to collect all the necessary materials beforehand* additional to that PE features an awesome creation-system that allows you to create, save, copy and share tons of stuff - all of the equipmant and vehicles you can build will even have certain stats and such will have a gameplay-impact within the game, depending on the materials it's been made of and it's shape. You can design every kind of object from tiny to large, from simple tableware and decoration items to furniture and streetlamps to large buildings.* with the usual ingame-crafting-menu (replicator) you can craft a wide range of pre-set equipment and other stuff too without having to design it specifically. Most of these have a really nice and unique SF-look* after prospecting/scanning for ores you can dig an infinite number of mineshafts and tunnels into the world. Well, you can even shovel away whole mountains if you're in the mood to do so* building defensive walls and different turrets will help you with battling larger enemies, and you will need this after setting up a colony, because there will be irregular invasions, during which native creatures will try to get to the power core of the colony to shut it down* you cannot only craft many different vehicles (also flying ones) in the creator-menu, but you can even build a refined monorail-system across your gameworld. You can dive into deep underwater caves with or without a wetsuit and you can fly by using a wingsuit or later on also jetpacks* the campaign-mode features an RPG-like story with quests and a down-to-earth background-story that is unveiled bit by bit. While it might not be to everyone's taste, I personally like it* there's a minecraft-like free creative/builder-mode with an infinite amount of all materials to freely build and craft with* the third game-mode is a survival-mode for adventurers, featuring an optional skill-unlock-system on randomly generated game-worlds sprinkled with NPC- and alien-settlements and optional small quests - set your own goals there without the RPG-story taking you by the hand* you can ask NPCs to live in your colony and defend the colony (together with your turrets) both in campaign-mode and also in adventure-mode* lately a comfort-level and illnesses have been added to the game, together with medicine to cure your character that you can brew or buy from NPCs. So now it is advised to sleep regularly and not to get soaked in the rain for too long. And digging for seeds (that you can plant) in animal dung might have an affect on your character's health as well...* there are multiplayer-options too now, so you can invite other players to your server or join them on theirs* the performance on my 64bit Windows 7 prof. is totally alright, no problems with the FPS here. I very, very rarely experienced freezes or quest-bugs. No problems with the sound and also nearly none with the graphics. However the game might not run as smoothly on every existing system, and I still experienced frequent crashes after playing for a longer while in early 2016.			"

								Amazing game! This one is definitely worth the money, despite being Alpha. The animals are fierce, but not OP, and i never felt like i was put in a situation that was unfair. Usually if i died, it was because i was a dumbass. The weapons are fun, and i had a blast killing everything i came across for fun, which is coincidentally also why i usually died. The story is really good, and kept me interested, which is rare for Open world games when it comes to me. My only complaint is that occasionally AI will forget the revive juice that you give them, and end up not using it when they get knocked out. I would also like them to add some system to differentiate predators and prey, and possibly a better way to find certain animals, as i haven't been able to find one animal for a sidequest.			"

								If you're looking at this game trying to decide if it's fun i can say for sure that to me this game is alot of fun. you can design and build ground vehicles, vtols and helicopters and even boats / ships. i can build buildings in the game and save them for faster town and colony building.  Currently there's not much of a goal in the game but the story is looking like it will be interesting and fresh when it's complete. back to building, you can design you're own weapons and shields. more character custimization is on it's way. if you like what you see and want to support the game then pick it up. if your leary of early access then either wait for a 1.0 release or pick it up cheap on sale. so far it's well worth the asking price.

								The early access game has been out and it has a good possible potential to be a good sand box game.Even 6 months on since i last played it some of the OLD bugs are still not fixed.Some of them are npc based, path finding for one through doors, npc money trade. the came thinks the npc does not have enough money for trade when they clearly have in the trade window then after you close the text box that appears the npc ends up with zero funds...When you do trade items the money the npc gains is still far less than the transaction is.NPC creatures still climb over walls and buildings through glitching.A lot of sounds are still missing.When you did a tunnel the light does get darker but too dark as if its the dead of night, even if your close to the entrance of a hole or tunnel.If your fighting with NPC's  you can easily hit them and they turn on you.Huge trees can be walked throughIf your chopping  tree down you have to hold the right mouse, now if you do this and you get attacked then you cant break away from the action and attack the npc thats attacking you.Npc's can see your through objects and earth and attack you or try to.No form of storage to place items in, no chests or crates or boxes. just a npc you give items to... For a sand box you need storage..The game needs a lot of work. But has the potential to be a good game if done well.			"

I like the direction it's taking and the dev team seems to be competent.  Of all the new generation of Minecraft-alikes, I think Planet Explorers has the best potential to be a satisfying game in the future.  In fact, there's already enough content in it to justify its current price, at least for me.			"

								Lot's of PotentialThis game has been on my wishlist for a while and I finally picked it up during the Summer Sale. I have been playing in Story mode, so that it was this review will focus on.The graphics are 50/50 for me on this game. On the one hand, you have beautiful ditant scenery that you can actually go to. On the other hand, you'll walk over plants that are flat and seem to follow the camera. The character graphics are fine, but nothing that wowed me.The gameplay is similar to Minecraft (a favorite game of mine) in that you will need to dig for ores and then craft items out of them. The mining aspect is interesteing in that sometimes you'll have to dig out an area. You can't just mine straight through. [Also, if you want to go spelunking, make sure you have a rope gun. Otherwise, if you don't dig a gently sloping tunnel down to the caves, you'll need to dig one to get out or fast travel.]The quest system is what you would expect. Go to an NPC. Talk. Get quest. Complete quest. Get reward. The one area that I would like to see improvement in is the Designing area. The item designer is not user friendly and can be difficult to figure out. The one thing that I think would vastly improve this area is the ability to select and move pieces that you have placed. Additionally, it would be nice for there to be some basic designs available to the player already. Not everyone wants to go in and design a car.If you get the chance, pick this game up. It's got a great foundation of gameplay and should only get better.			"

Early Access Review
								SPOILER: This review is small and pretty opinionated. It is  not  a comprehensive review on all features and I  have not  explored every feature availble to the game currently, just most of them. I likely will not explore too much more of the game and it's features but, as I support this game, I will closely monitor it's patches and development.PROS: For the most part, in it's current state, this game is very fun to play.-Multiplayer; being able to gather materials faster and more efficiently to be able to build helicopter gunships for decimating alien encampments is far too much fun. Honestly, after my experience playing the game with my friends, the fun we had was almost criminal.-Hunting; when it comes to hunting these large-scale dinosaur-like creatures, this game really shines. Especially when you have access to better gear so you don't have to rely on hit and run tactics to lure the beasts towards your substantially better equipped AI.-Crafting; holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ Being able to craft  real  technology is amazing. No more of that unnecessarily complicated, unreasonably restrictive redstone fluffy flutter from Minecraft.  Real Technology  with a  real impact  on gameplay and progression. The list of available recipes is gigantic and, at first, very overwhelming. But it makes the game really something to behold.-Vehicles; worth. Do you like strapping lazer canons and missile silos onto a poorly made car with thrusters and calling it a helicopter gunship? I do. Do you like using that very same vehicle to wreak mayhem and destruction on those god damned Aliens that endlessly spawn from their camps? I do.CONS: That's right, you knew we would get to this part as soon as you saw the word ""pros"". And to a great degree of sadness, this list is much larger than the other one. So much larger, it's hard to pick a good starting place.-Multiplayer; ♥♥♥♥ing port-forwarding. Everyone's least favorite chore. I  literally  have friends who would rather pay me their hard-earned, broke college student funds than do their own port-forwarding. Ironically, even I don't like doing it. It's bizarre; it's complicated and simple at the same time. Usually you just go to your router's browser page at 192.168.1.1 and follow some simple directions to get the port forwarded. Combine that with some firewall exceptions and you've got yourself an open port for some multiplayer madness. Assuming it actually works. Which, most of the time, is the problem. There's almost  never  a layman's solution to port-forwarding without buying a program to forward the ports for you. You can't just strap in and forward the ports without having to learn the arbitrary process first, it rapidly gets you very involved and educated on how to do it like a professional through a mind-numbing few hours of trial and error. And unless you do it the mythical  right way,  which is different per router, you'll find that before long your ports are closed again. tl;dr port forwarding for multiplayer is a bad solution, but a cheap one. Invest a little in better multiplayer and watch the crowds eat up your game.-Hunting; oh boy. Want to hunt something that can't  wreck  you like it's name was Ralph? Really boring and offers almost nothing you'll need to build decent survival gear or buy it. Want to hunt something that  actually  gives a worthwhile supply of necessary materials like animal skins and fat or isn't just plain boring to fight? Well be prepared to overly rely on your AI or multiplayer comrades because otherwise it will kill you and♥♥♥♥♥♥your corpse into the ocean. For most of the entire game, it's usually a far safer idea to simply avoid almost everything and mine for materials in vast quantities to be able to emerge from the earth as the most powerful entity on the planet. But then the game is boring because nothing provides a challenge anymore.-Crafting; bore chore. As excellent as the crafting system of this game is at delivering impacful technology that feels as good as it performs... Actually crafting it is obnoxiously boring. It's all about making excessively vast quantities of little materials to be able to make smaller and smaller quantities of larger and larger materials until you have everything you need. The only redeeming feature here is that you can produce things in bulk, which you'll quite often rely on because otherwise you'll have to make  all  of the necessary materials over and over again until you no longer need to make whatever oddity you're crafting to begin with. It takes such a long time to make anything worthwhile or important,  especially  the various vehicles in the game.-Vehicles; I didn't sign up for this. The vehicle creation menu/functionality is a very frustrating feature of the game. Especially for those like myself that aren't very creative-minded and  SWEAT  when presented that much crafting freedom. As much as I like the freedom offered in the feature, you need to at least present some guidelines or most players will just be lost in the age old question of ""Where the ♥♥♥♥ do I even start?"" Let's not even get that much into the controls of the vehicle crafting feature because all that needs to be said is prepare to rely on the undo function heavily as you constantly mutter ""I didn't want to do that"". Or the arbitrary fact that you have to go into a separate menu just to assign wheels for steering. Last, the fukitol cherry on top, multiplayer additional seating is present in the game but currently not functioning properly or even with any sense of purpose. But I imagine that last bit will be fixed soon.-Gathering; so many problems. Wood gathering? Takes too damn long if you want to get any worthwhile amount of wood that is determined seemingly  at ♥♥♥♥ing random  based on the size of the tree you're chopping down. Mineral gathering? Prepare to scour every inch of the planet trying to even  find  these materials. They're arbitrarily hard to locate; but I guess that's not so bad when you can mine them in the thousands if you're willing to spend the time doing it once you actually find a vein. Underwater/Oceanic gathering? Unfortunately necessary for the later parts of the game. To make matters worse, to build a boat for easy/safe underwater/oceanic gathering you need oil/petroleum. To get this, you need a boat to be able to safely traverse the waters without getting immediately killed by a dino-shark-demon. I'm sure you see the cycle here.-Voxels/Vertices/Whatever; the last, but greatest con.  NEVER IN THIS GAME IS IT WORTH TO MINE WITHOUT AT LEAST A COPPER PICKAXE  You'll mine voxels/vertices/whatever so finely that creating a mine to work in that isn't game breaking or safe to actually stand in is next to impossible unless you're really diligent and have the time on hand to actually do it. Copper pickaxes are one of the first pickaxes that actually mine larger voxels/vertices so you can make flat surfaces for mining much more easily. But again, this is mainly only achievable if you are willing to take the time necessary to actually do that. And based on the reactions of my friends in multiplayer, nobody wants  that  job.That would be about it. I really enjoy this game, but it just needs a few fixes and gameplay changes. But this should be expected as it is still in alpha. Would I recommend this game? Definitely. Would I recommend this game while it's still in alpha? Yeah, I still would. But there are definitely some fixes that need to happen for the dev team to maximize player enjoyment. If you're sitting on the fence with this game, allow me to say that it's well worth it if you're willing to look past some clear flaws and just have fun playing what works really well. Either way, keep a close eye on the game's development and patches for improvements and fixes; I know I will be.			"

								Overall a good game that I will recommend to my friends. In some parts of this game it's great, such as crafting, basebuilding and a decent story line, in some other part, such as close combat fighting system, it will take some time getting use to. I played few crafting games before and did not find any other game like this one. especially when I figured out how to design and craft a armor, it was one of those ""what! I can do that s**t?!"" moment, I really enjoyed it.			"

												This game has so many things going for it. Runs great, looks great, interesting life forms, story mode, adventure mode, collecting resources, build structures, vehicles, armor and weapons. Create your own colony, farm build hunt explore. Single player, optional multiplayer, pvp if you want or play co-op and start a community. Huge map of different biomes and Workshop, the people over at Pathea Games put heart and soul into this game and you really can't go wrong with this one.			"

								Great game with amazing features. They continue to update with new content and fixes that satisfy! This game will put you right in the middle of an alien planet and let you explore with virtually no limits. Create amazing items and immediately play using them in-game. You can also export items and share with friends very easily as well! Hands down the best thing about this game is the true sandbox nature, backed up by amazing visuals and an extremely powerful creation system. The don't just toss you into an sandbox, they give you the toys to truely enjoy the experience!			"

								Although only in the alpha and the fact that I've only played for around an hour, I'm already super excited to see how the game will be once finished. Concept is fun, looks incredible (albeit needing a few tweaks here and there), gameplay has worked fine so far, and once they sort out the multiplayer (or I learn how to use it properly) I'm sure to have a lot of fun with a couple of buds. With the idea of building tools and learning the recipes for new 'toys', a buddy of mine summed up a big portion of the game pretty well, ""it's like minecraft... only nicer looking""			"

Seeing some of the animals travelling in herds, and watching different species battle it out is amusing. Then you also have the huge scary alien tribes!This game really has some of the most in depth crafting for weapons, items and vehicles allowing you to make them your own and totally unique.I paid full price for this and have no regrets!

								BUY THIS GAME, if you like open-world sandboxes, you will not regret this purchase. There is so much to do... It's a bit overwhelming at first, but once you know what you're doing, this is a very enjoyable game. It's kind of like if minecraft was built in a realistic world... and in space. Or maybe a 3D starbound. Just as addictive, at least.I've had a few problems with broken missions and inventory items dissapearing, but it's rare and will likely be fixed very soon. With that said, for an alpha, this game is phenominal! This is one of those games that comes along and changes the tide of every game made after it.I've played about 10 hours logged and 5 offline, So far I've only built my first vehicle, encountered my first sentient aliens, and my first gigantic monster-bug. 15 hours and I've only scratched the surface of this game... I see a LOT of replay value here, especially with mods.... I'm very excited to see the finished product!			"

Early Access Review
								SPOILER: This review is small and pretty opinionated. It is  not  a comprehensive review on all features and I  have not  explored every feature availble to the game currently, just most of them. I likely will not explore too much more of the game and it's features but, as I support this game, I will closely monitor it's patches and development.PROS: For the most part, in it's current state, this game is very fun to play.-Multiplayer; being able to gather materials faster and more efficiently to be able to build helicopter gunships for decimating alien encampments is far too much fun. Honestly, after my experience playing the game with my friends, the fun we had was almost criminal.-Hunting; when it comes to hunting these large-scale dinosaur-like creatures, this game really shines. Especially when you have access to better gear so you don't have to rely on hit and run tactics to lure the beasts towards your substantially better equipped AI.-Crafting; holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ Being able to craft  real  technology is amazing. No more of that unnecessarily complicated, unreasonably restrictive redstone fluffy flutter from Minecraft.  Real Technology  with a  real impact  on gameplay and progression. The list of available recipes is gigantic and, at first, very overwhelming. But it makes the game really something to behold.-Vehicles; worth. Do you like strapping lazer canons and missile silos onto a poorly made car with thrusters and calling it a helicopter gunship? I do. Do you like using that very same vehicle to wreak mayhem and destruction on those god damned Aliens that endlessly spawn from their camps? I do.CONS: That's right, you knew we would get to this part as soon as you saw the word ""pros"". And to a great degree of sadness, this list is much larger than the other one. So much larger, it's hard to pick a good starting place.-Multiplayer; ♥♥♥♥ing port-forwarding. Everyone's least favorite chore. I  literally  have friends who would rather pay me their hard-earned, broke college student funds than do their own port-forwarding. Ironically, even I don't like doing it. It's bizarre; it's complicated and simple at the same time. Usually you just go to your router's browser page at 192.168.1.1 and follow some simple directions to get the port forwarded. Combine that with some firewall exceptions and you've got yourself an open port for some multiplayer madness. Assuming it actually works. Which, most of the time, is the problem. There's almost  never  a layman's solution to port-forwarding without buying a program to forward the ports for you. You can't just strap in and forward the ports without having to learn the arbitrary process first, it rapidly gets you very involved and educated on how to do it like a professional through a mind-numbing few hours of trial and error. And unless you do it the mythical  right way,  which is different per router, you'll find that before long your ports are closed again. tl;dr port forwarding for multiplayer is a bad solution, but a cheap one. Invest a little in better multiplayer and watch the crowds eat up your game.-Hunting; oh boy. Want to hunt something that can't  wreck  you like it's name was Ralph? Really boring and offers almost nothing you'll need to build decent survival gear or buy it. Want to hunt something that  actually  gives a worthwhile supply of necessary materials like animal skins and fat or isn't just plain boring to fight? Well be prepared to overly rely on your AI or multiplayer comrades because otherwise it will kill you and♥♥♥♥♥♥your corpse into the ocean. For most of the entire game, it's usually a far safer idea to simply avoid almost everything and mine for materials in vast quantities to be able to emerge from the earth as the most powerful entity on the planet. But then the game is boring because nothing provides a challenge anymore.-Crafting; bore chore. As excellent as the crafting system of this game is at delivering impacful technology that feels as good as it performs... Actually crafting it is obnoxiously boring. It's all about making excessively vast quantities of little materials to be able to make smaller and smaller quantities of larger and larger materials until you have everything you need. The only redeeming feature here is that you can produce things in bulk, which you'll quite often rely on because otherwise you'll have to make  all  of the necessary materials over and over again until you no longer need to make whatever oddity you're crafting to begin with.

								First of, this is a great game. Just the jetpack-glider combination alone, is almost worth the buying price (use the jetpack to gain altitude, then glide around the game world. lots of fun).Furthermore there's an interesting storyline, and it's a builder game, where you can build all kinds of things, even your own colony, and inhabit it with npcs, that you can recruit from the various story areas.Also, the game is still in development, so from time to time, new content become available, such as more main story, more gameworld, more build or npc options, and so on.But there lies the biggest issue, from my perspective: The updates.As each time a new update comes around, your savegame is no longer working.The devs usually give out a savegame, so you can continue the storyline, from where it stopped last, which is okey, but it's just not good enough.If you spend 40+ hours playing the game and building stuff, having to start all over each time there is an update, gets old REAL fast.And for me, that is the deal breaker. Until savegames can be used from update to update, I will not recommend this game.			"

After joining multiplayer I'm supposed to read a few dialogs, but all the text in the dialogs has such a nasty font that it is impossible to read it. The text is semi translucent and looks like a mess of dots. Performance was horrible considering how the game looks. The dialog texts tho... How hard can it be to get a decent font rendered in a game in 2016? Appearantly very. This game feels like a mish mash of assets have been dumped into a standard 3rd person game blueprint.EDIT: gave the game another shot apr 2017, now the game won't even start. It shows the launcher splash (which only renders on the top quarter of the entire window), click start game, wait 1 minute, see the logo and then crash.			"

								This was incredible fun for the first 39, or so, hours of play. I would like to see more gameplay and balance elements added.It's built to be a hybrid, something between minecraft and dungeon crawl. I LIKE THAT! It isn't minecraft, It isn't a dungeon crawl.I bet that the majority of the time I have spent is creating weapons..... voxel by voxel. Because I was more about creating, because there is TONS OF WAYS to create stuff.You can make structures in the world, you can literally CAD your own weapons in the creation suit, using materials that you have mined or bought. How you build them, and what materials you build them out of affects the stats of the weapon. SOOOOOO GOOOOD! But, being that is ..... I guess beta and alpha ... or ..... something like that, the gameplay is....... lame. I have seen that there is constant work and updates to this game.I would go for this if you like to create stuff and use it in-game.Don't expect a great story..... (yet????)			"

								I expected more. The creatures , although pretty, seem lifeless, and animated poorly. The jumping is pretty lame, not a big thing but it stands out, much like the grunting your player makes when atacking. I know its unfinished, but I'd wait on this one til its done, and alot of other people have reviewed it. The controls feel clunky and awkward.			"

								A few things that give this game alot of potential as a open world sandbox game is;ability to design your own weapons, items, and vehicles. This is what sets the game from all other games that allows for crafting and open world sandbox. You can choose to build the ingame items or upload/create items of your own. decent crafting treedevs are coming out with a world editor that allows you build your own world and populate it as you see fitthe storyline questing is decent enough to get you started into the game before you choose to go into adventure mode and strike it out on your own. But  what I dislike about the game;very awkward User interface. it takes more clicks than it needs to craft or perform certain functions such as scanning. The devs said they are working on this and hope to release a new UI in the next month or two so we'll seeLacks a true vibrant multiplayer environment. Most of the multiplayer servers are empty. And even if you do find a decent one, you can be subject to griefing because there is currently no way to protect your stuffThere's no sense of challenge or purpose. I get that it's open world sandbox and the only agenda is the one you set.However it feels boring just logging on and killing creatures and building stuff. The game needs more conflict.documentation needsdespite special effects such as damage dealing effects are non existent and needs to be improved upon. Other than a little green bar at the top, you don't know if you're doing damage. Positioning around the NPC can feel awkward as well.Aside from building stuff and killing creatures, there just isn't enough motivation or purpose to playing the game.  It needs more players on the multiplayer servers as well. I will review this game in another month or two and update my review.			"

												BEWARE - If you will potentially want a refund (which you likely will) If you attempt to play multiplayer, despitethe fact you more than likely wont get it working port forwarding or no, when you quit the game leaves a process running in the background and continues to count as being played by steam. So even though we only loaded it up and tried to get a multiplayer server going a couple times; it sais we have played for over 15 hours each making a refund more difficult. Make sure when you quit you lookin task manager for the process and end it manually.Now my experience from playing on my mates account (what drove me to misguidedly buy it in the first place)1. The item creation is really cool, played around making my friend items on his computer, however being able to make your own items is the only good part of this game and once you see the game itself, even this is lacking.1.1 the item creater looks extensive however it is missing core parts which effectively mean that items you will find in game will be better than what you can create anyway. eg, you can get 2H melee weapons in game, you cannot make 2H weapons in the creator. You can get many different 1H hilts in game, but can only use the first 3 low tier ones in creator.this put a massive dampening on the only good part of the game.2. Graphically it is uninspiring and extremely dated, which I can excuse if the gameplay was fun.3. The gameplay is not fun, starting out doing the very first quest in adventure mode and I got swamped by about 8 NPC humanaoid enemies which hit like trucks and you basically cannot damage. Sure, you can kite them around for half an hour shooting them with your rubberbands (bow) or hitting them with your wet tissue (sword), but it isnt fun.3.1 combat is woeful, despite being able to double tap to dodge, dodging does exactly nothing for you.4. Audio, The sound is quite calming and nice which is a good thing and likely designed to stop you raging at game mechanics.5. Multiplayer, the ""multiplayer"" basically does not work,we tried creating a private server with port forwarding set correctly and noone could see the servers, regardless of which one of us set it up. You can create it via a proxy server based god knows where and then 90% of the game mechanics are broken by the latency. eg die (because the first NPC you talk to in town spawns about 15 high level mobs with firearmswhile you haven't even made a wood bow) and then cannot respawn, BUT you can drive your nameplate around ....6. As mentioned, when attempting to make a server it created a background process which does not exit when you exit the game, racking up hours and preventing an easy refund.I have a suspiscion that this is intentional because there is no way in hell this game is in release standard.7. The environments are boring and extremely vast nothingnesses, games liek 7 days  to Die also have this but the environment still feels alive and dangerous somehow, not so here.8. The AI, should just be renamed A.I could go on, however in summary; I had quite a bit of enjoyment creating items to use in game which I could copy from my mates computer easily enough, however that is the end of the fun in this game, there are soooooo many bugs, features that down work and lack luster mechanics that it is obvious this game is still in alpha or EA.It is definately not in release. or worth ~$30 asking price, to expand - this is I tihnk the only comment I have made on steam in the many years and games (even ones I regret buying) that i have asked for a refund.

								Another one for the Perma-EA shelf it seems..Sad but true. A massive chunk of my steam library is these sort of games now..EA games that have been EA for a year..two years..some even more, with little sign of ever actually reaching release. Planet Explorers still, for the most part, looks like a concept demo you might show off at a convention or to potential backers- it has some basic gameplay, customisation, etc..but it's not a full game. And this hasn't really changed much since I first looked into the game in the early days.			"

They should have dropped the story mode and made a planet generator along with spaceships.A shining example of why not to buy Early Access games.			"

								You know, I don't understand the comments haters seem to possess for this game. I mean, because it is playable, you seem to think that it has to be finished on your own time. It is in ALPHA not BETA. When a game is in the ALPHA stage, it is still being designed and littered with bugs and glitches. Some games can take much longer than the designers plan to be completed, you know. Plus, the game designers have their own lives to deal with, along with this game's development. I mean, they could have family members dying, or their wives could be pregnant, etc. Considering that this game has sooooo much potential, you guys should be more patient. On a more positive note, I would give this game a 9.5/10. It has a ton of potential and, once all the bugs and glitches are fixed, I truly believe this game could become one of the best games of the year. I mean, it is games like this that make the video gaming industry so successful. So please, please guys, be more patient. I feel as though I can almost guarantee that the wait will be worth it. P.S. One of the few problems that I have with this game is the name of the planet. ""Maria"" is such a boring name and I feel that it could be better. And if the name was chosen because the designers couldn't come up with a better name, I bet I could think up some good names. Just a thought...			"

It is because of my laptop that I don't think this game was able to meet my expectations. It was definitely similar to minecraft, but with semi-gorgeous enviornment and interactive/craftable enviornment this game definitely had its own unique style. The blueprint system was slightly confusing, but youtube made it so much easier to understand. Sadly the game is very glitchy, but is still being worked on. It has a lot of potential, but needs to be smoothed out.			"

Most of the negative reviews I read are from people trying this game for like an hour or so, probably because they want to refund. That's so sad. Ofc it is not perfect. Its 23 Euros. Don't compare it to EA AAA titles (it is better than some lol).Try the demo. It's free.			"

								There is a lot of potential in this game.However at this point in development, it's just that, potential.The only reason why this game is getting a ""Not recommended"" is because the timing on everything is off. From the amount of time it takes to gather resources to the animations of the creatures and NPCs.I could see myself making some really cool creations in this game, but I can't bring myself to spend the hours to gather all the resources needed to do so. So I then tried the build mode that gives you infinite resources from the very begining and found myself getting bored of building because it took too long to do a simple flat diagonal bridge over a small crevasse (something like 20+ minutes).The way how the building works is really cool with the options to expand on the XYZ planes before placing the blocks you want. However, due to the constraints of the camera, I found I could only build outwards/upwards so far before I would have to reposition myself for a better view of what I was working on. The process than became: build a little then move a little and repeat until done.I'd like to see different sized blocks that I could place as the current size can be VERY small when working on anything larger than a small shack (and even then I found myself doubling up on the wall thickness because I felt a single block wide wall looked like a couple sheets of plywood stuck together).As far as the story section goes, my only comment would be to do away with the voice acting as sometimes it seems out of place, like the voice actors were distracted while reading their lines. Otherwise I found the missions/quests to be very entertaining and fun.Overall, I'd say pass on this for now and wait for the game to become more fleshed out. It's interesting and visually impressive AND the terra forming is superb. But, the amount of time you spend on creating anything will try your patience as it can feel like you're building because you HAVE to and not because you want to as well as you'll feel like you're fighting the camera to get anything done.

								I just spent two multiplayer games, both of them stopped rapidly by a bug causing every NPC not assigned to a player base to be shipped to the bottom left corner of the map, outside the accessible area. Game over, no fix, nothing.The fact that we are in beta, and there is a seeminly consistent bug of this size in the game, speaks very badly for the games QA process. If you don't own this, don't buy yet. Check back once it's released.________________________________________________________Edit:The bug where all NPCs are banished from the map got fixed rather quickly, only to reveal a new bug that breaks the main questline when you get to the desert.The verdict is still, that if you want this quest for multiplayer, wait a while. The questline is horribly bugged, and it is unlikely that you will be able to get though it at all.The game is in more of an alpha state. There are major parts of the game that are currently not accesible.			"

								First off, id like to note that this game has incredible potential, i can only imagine how amazing it would be at a complete stage(thats assuming it will ever get there). One of my main frustrations is the lack of attention the devs are putting into their own creation. Yes i payed to support development, and whether or not they continue is their choice. Im proud of my decision because i feel that im supporting a great idea. I was pitched a game that promises much and does deliver, however here are some things that i do find detremintal to gameplay.-Poor Mechanincs-Lack of Unique Enviroments-Terrible Ai programming(hopefully in the future i can interact with all intelligent npcs in several ways, creating a real feeling rpg. I want my actions to be reflected in game. It would be great if aliens did more than just walk a few steps and then unintelligently try to persue me(they usually just get stuck behind rocks)-MULTIPLAYER DEV. For the love of god, this game deserves more multiplayer development. I want to explore the world with friends and random players, i want a unique world that punishes you and rewards you because of your actions (such as players who become anarchists or those who follow colony rules) which brings me to another topic-Colonies: You place a few tents and one or two bungalows and call that a colony? Please make this feel like a sci-fiction game. Give me colony police, factions, trade markets, anything to make it feel like an ""RPG"". Create background stories for the multiplayer, smart AI that can use vehicles and scout the land. Add small cities, maybe even a nice military branch you could join in which you raise in rank and can possibly explore other worlds(Just and idea).Make it feel like a Sci-fi game-Lack of replayablity: The survival mode is really needs some work, it doesnt feel difficult, especially when i have to find other aliens to have some action. A few random search parties and attacks on my locations would be nice. Destroyable buildings would be nice as well, as once i hide i am pretty much safe for the rest of eternity.-fix the vehicles: Poor mechanics, easily damaged.Overall the game provided entertainment but not for long. I quickly realized that planet explorers was unfortunately boring and not worth the money i payed. I hoped that my money would atleast bring me great updates to enjoy, but the developers  are making slow and low quality updates that dont really make the game any different.So, i do not recommend you buy this game for any reason other than for a future version that gives more playable content. In other words, dont buy it in its current state.			"

The story's cool (even though the intro is painfully bad x) ), the gameplay is large and interesting, the graphics are good, not as much as the actual graphics you'd be used to, but still they're more than decent.

												Hours on record at the time of reviewing - 172.5Planet Explorers has been a ton of fun, and I have racked up 120 nerd hours since picking it up after full realease. Consistent, addictive, great map design with Maria (Main Story map). You can appreciate the detail and thought that went into making the VIP Colonists roles (Botanists, geologists, zoologists, bacteriologists, miners, security) Keeping in mind what sort of new or unknown viruses may be present in the that new planet. Seems to me pretty up to par when a real planetary colonization effort would take place in a distant future. Good variety of ISO's, the freedom to craft whenever and wherever you want and with a good and steady growing community uploading their creations if crafting is not your thing and rather spend more time playing, building and progressing.There is enough content, gameplay hours and sandboxing in Story Mode to make up for the flaws that that need some correcting in Adventure Mode, which are the following:• Adventure mode still feels bland, lacking content and not up to par with what is found in Story Mode, not really delivering those same dramatic landscapes and backdrops. Feels like it could be delivering a lot more, the randomly generated maps have a lot of imperfections (Terrain leveling, roads that go into the water, high-level monster spawnings where you're just starting out. • The Dungeons in Adventure Mode feel bland, linear, lacking some polishing, same layouts often found, the monsters in there are just the same wildlife found anywhere else on the map and not even following a theme of which biomes each are found, but rather mixed in together. On a more positive side, there are things found in adventure mode that would like to see in the other modes:• The unique building models that would save us some time when builing a colony and placing the already built structures to house colonists and shops for vendors. • The road network between colonies/towns.Overall I'm looking forward to the remaining gameplay I got, taking my sweet time with progressing the story, while building and exploring along the way. I feel like my initial investment back when the game was in early alpha was a good investment in the hopes of having a good finished product delivered in full-release and with updates/builds still coming in, and will most deffinitely support Pathea in further development and future DLC/Expansions for this game, I see it as a mint product that with the right new updates and content it has the potential to go far and have a long life and growing community.Thanks Pathea!

								Im gonna be as fair as I can with this seeing as there 2 sidesI understand there is problems going on with the game and some people dont have the paitence or the time to deal with them I get that.Heres what i think is good:The creation system is pretty fun i enjoyed time with my friends fighting with our custom weapons and vechile i understand some people dont have that creative edge which is why the workshop is greatWide variety of animals to fight and aliens my favorite being the giant spider thing during story mode got me invested in the creation system.Buildings are ok building forts and fighting with friends was great but I agree it needs a little work.Progress seems slow on development but if you look at the changelogs the devs are working really hard it took them a long to make A.09 but within the time they made that they did all these hotfixes that were really nice.The bad and ways to make up for them:Graphics can be rathering annoying i get that and most people dont wanna turn them down and if you do they tend to look horrible what I reccomend is first making sure you have a updated flash then if its still bad custom of it using custom graphics you can make it look nice and still work for your computer you just have to work at itOre mining is see alot of complaints about this one people having a pain finding ore and then getting to it I reccomend making a cheap speedy buggy wink wink creation system and just ride around scanning for ore youll find what you need and even then what you dont just mark it then when it comes to mining navigate with the scanner best you can to stand over it your gonna need a rope gun just dig straight down dont worry the lava wont get you then mine wherver you see a weird shaped rocks and your bound to rack up a lot of ore (I reccomend going for a gold pickaxe as quick as possible so your most efficient with the ore)Final problem and one I can really really understand people hating is the random save deletion devs updates I think are causing this cause theres so many changes to the world you cant work with that file no fix to this and i hope the devs do something about it in the future.Overall I beleive its a game well worth the time best to play with friends but well worth it I enjoyed it my Friends enjoyed it. I dont care if you dont like it please just dont write a negative review with .1 hrs on the game like some people			"

								I really liked this game in the beginning, played about 17 hrs worth.  Decided to reinstall recently and see how it is coming along,  but after recent patches the game has become frustrating to play for two reasons:Keybinds- Certain keys can no longer be changed, this is a big issue as I use EDSF instead of WSAD.  Unfortunately E is Interact and can't be changed.  Be aware you may not be able to change keybinds to what you want.Hitching- I can run the game in Fantastic setting with 60-100 fps but every minute or two I get this half a second hitch where the screen sorta freezes. My current suggestion is wait longer before getting this game.  If the dev team can correct the keybind and hitching issue I'd love to give the game a try again.  They have added a lot of really nice elements to the game, I just find it unplayable in the current state.			"

								Have you ever used heroin? It's like a trip into an alternate universe where you don't have to think about how badly you've ♥♥♥♥ed up your life, or how badly ♥♥♥♥ed up you are against your will. I've spent a lot of time doing a lot of drugs, and everyone I know always wonders why I'm not as outwardly happy or outgoing as I was back then. I don't have the heart to tell them that by quitting the drugs that were killing me, I no longer have any desire to talk to them or spend time with them. Sometimes I do genuinely enjoy the company of others, but it is generally while highly inebriated and then in the morning my anxiety comes back tenfold, and i struggle to make it home before the panic attacks start. Maybe one day a game like this could be fully fleshed or interesting enough to hold my interest for more than a few minutes. Maybe i'm describing Second Life, and that game was an absolute catastrophe. Maybe it's the other way around, and life would be better if i could stray too far from home and be devoured by a gigantic terrifying monster. I would feed this creature, and it would live longer, and I would have been given a form of purpose, for at least some time.			"

								2/9/15I'm kinda tired so stick with me. This game needs some time, like alot of time. Sure, the graphics and in game features are really cool, but if they're not properly setup the whole thing is nothing but a pretty turd. im running a quad core i7-3820 @3.60GHz with an AMD Radeon HD 7880 and totally updated drivers and this game is barely playable. Heres my problem.The map loads in chunks kinda like minecraft as you progress through the map but as they load i come to a screeching halt of like 5 fps. Lowering the settings to rock bottom seems to help but who wants to play a game like that? especially if your STILL having issues on the lowest settings. After spending some time on the forums it became pretty clear that certain graphics cards(like mine) struggle to render. I also saw alot of people having issues with the opencl compatability. Oh yeah, heres some pro's and con'sPro's-Gorgeus graphics.-Dense flora/fauna that actually feels like an alien planet.-Very cool crafting system.-Supportive community/devs.Con's-Lots of compatability issues for alot of people.-no sense of impact when in combat so you cant tell if you landed a hit.-UI is a ♥♥♥♥in nightmare.-balancing issues, like aggro distance.So bottom line is, research the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game to make sure you can run it. $25 man, $25.

												I know it says that I haven't played the game much, but I don't think I need to play it any longer than I have. I don't plan on it.I'm just going to start by saying that I knew that this game was in early access a while ago. I hadn't heard that it released back in November, Earlier today I was playing it, and I was thinking to myself, ""I wonder when they plan on releasing this."" I thought this because this game should never have been released. It's so clearly unfinished.PROS:A fairly nice atmosphere. The game looks pretty good, and the planet itself seems to be well thought out. The environments are consistent and look alright. The biomes are nice, too. Lots of variety.Many NPCs to talk to and trade with. There's a few quests in the 'story' mode, but they seem like placeholders that are still holding a place that will never be filled.The crafting/building system is pretty good, honestly. It's very creative and works well. The building system is also pretty good.There's plenty of exploration to do, as the map is fairly large. It's fun experiencing an alien planet for yourself and seeing how the developers interpreted a completely unfamiliar situation like that.Gonna be honest here, I can't think of anything else that's good. Moving on.CONS:The sound design in this game is horrendous. It seems like all of the voice acting was done in one take, and all of the music is either incredibly repetitive or just unoriginal. I ended up turning it off because it was mindless noise that was slowly driving me crazy.All of the textures look like the artists' first attempts at creating them. Most are low resolution placeholders still, and are just unappealing to look at.The animations for both your character, other NPCs, and the animals (except for the birds, weirdly enough) are incredibly ugly. They don't move naturally and are clearly either unfinished or placeholders, or they weren't cared enough about to finish.The voice acting for the NPCs that you can talk to is mostly atrocious. Sometimes it's missing entirely, sometimes it doesn't line up with what's on screen at all (the NPC will say something completely different or leave out lines entirely). The dialogue system is god awful. Your character is either as stupid as whoever decided to release this game early, or they're a sarcastic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There is no inbetween. You don't have an option, either; it's pretty common to get two choices when talking to an NPC: [sarcastic or stupid comment] or [""No, I'm busy now""]The quest system is completely broken. I can't get it to work half of the time. Most of the time, your questlog is empty entirely. You have to speak to NPCs for them, and while this isn't an issue, it's not immediately obvious who you have to talk to. At one point, the quest system stopped giving me story quests. I talked to the guy who was *supposed* to give me the next one and he didn't have any dialogue options. At that point, I gave up and decided to climb the tallest mountain I could find. It was here that I experienced the joys of the animal pathfinding in Planet Explorers.If a hostile animal sees you, they will NEVER give up trying to get to you unless they are physically incapable (like falling in a river, or dying). Flying enemy spots you? Give up hope for trying to lose it unless you can kill it, because the stupid thing will follow you to the ends of the earth (maria, i guess) trying to kill you. The same goes for land animals; they have a stupidly long detection range, and the moment you enter it, they beeline straight for you.I bought this game for $25, and it was not worth that amount, at all. If you can get this game for less than $10, or even $5, then I'd say it'd be worth a few hours if you're bored. Otherwise, don't bother. The developers are clearly done with it other than the occasional bug fix update or tiny addition.			"

								the devs are aciively working on it, and it is a fine game, with a singleplayer and everything, check out my screenshots. it has a great mechanical physics engine other games don't, you can literaly DESIGN moving machines. that fly , drive, boat etc.. it's fairly insane on the crafting department if you go in depth. That being said patch 81a broke the game for my rig, but i'm building a new rig this week, so i look forward to it. if you want to play ABOVE low graphics get 970/r9-290x + and a good i5, or a 8600+AMD because this is a MONSTER on voxels. it doesn't just map the viewed terrain it maps entire cave systems, under ground water ways, a world of actively tracked monsters. When you can play it on MAX it's gorgeous. the devs are active and they are dedicated, but instead of putting out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ patches every 2 days, they complete entire segments of the games function per alpha patch, this sometimes leads to patches being a month+ apart, but the changes are usualy MASSIVE fixes and content. I HATE minecraft, I hate ARK, i hate all those kinds of games, especialy when they shove MP down your throat. Planet Explorers is genuinely a masterpice being made, it's just rough right now, and still alpha. no other survival explorer world game has gone as in depth or included a REAL storyline with NPC deviations and freedom. it's literaly a planet sized planet to explore. When completed the growth for content in the SP campaign will be mammoth, as well as the servers and custom worlds people run now. I've owned this game nearly a year, don't expect it to be done soon. But when it is done, expect it to be awe inspiring			"

												The pricetag may seem a little steep but don't be surprised if you find yourself putting 100 hours into this.It feels a lot like Minecraft but it improves in a lot of areas where Minecraft falls short.Similarities: -Voxel based building-Crafting-Pre-generated monsters (not randomly generated)-Swords/Axes/Pickaxes on your 1-2-3~9 slots, like you'd expect-Healing items/food/drinkDifferences:-World is not randomly generated (I've only played Story so far) -Build a community and bring all of the humans together to help your cause (even in multiplayer)-Non-Voxel based digging -MEAT IS MONEY (for a good while anyways) -Aggressive NPC villages -VOXEL BASED ITEM/OBJECT BUILDING: Make your weapon look like whatever you build it to look like. -VOXEL BASED VEHICLE BUILDING: Build a Car/Helicopter/Submarine/Weird Jumping spinning orb thing/ chair on a propeller/ rocket seat/ anything you can make moveProblems:-Light does not get stopped by the dirt you dig, making it bright in the day, and dark in the night, underground, regardless of how far you go. Underground bases are very easy to make though.-Combat is really clunky, and shooting is not very user friendly. [TAP left click to enter aiming mode, then left click to fire, tap right click to put your gun down.] {Suggestion to change it to HOLD right click to aim please!}-Weapons have really deliberate animations that move your character in an unusual manner and the slash isn't quite the spot you'd expect it to go. But there are Daggers/2H/ and 1H/Shield styles now, so that fixes it a bit. -NPC pathing is non-existant and functions on a teleportation system-That damn poo quest lolMULTIPLAYER SPECIFIC:-Randomly generated-Contains randomly generated dungeons that are pretty funCons: You can delete voxels that other people placed, even within their own colony. You can also steal their Sentries and prefabs. It even gives you the materials. This is a Pro if you're a troll. :PSteam has a REFUND SYSTEM! Give this game an hour's worth of your time and if you don't like it, simply refund it. I encourage anybody who loves Minecraft (especially if you modded it a lot) to try this game.Nominated in the ""other"" category with the reason ""Hidden Gem""			"

												This game has unexpextedly been alot of fun. I originally did not have much hopes for this title after my first experience. (about 1 year ago) since the new updates the game has much more to offer. Likes:*Craft anything without haveing hours of farming due to the ingame currency system with the npc's IE if you dont want to go collect coal, kill monsters then trade the hide for currency! and buy what you need.*True terra form in a easy to use system that makes sense!*Great voice acting for all major npc quests!*A rather large world to explore*Build anywhere! *Easy to understand UI and hot bar*Really compelling story mode that keeps you going.Cons*Graphics are not the best*Development seems slow (however they are updating again!)*Random clipping issues (no as bad as Subnautica though!) LOLOverallGood game with tons of potential, have spent alot of my time recently enjoying this game. ps the riding system for the aliens makes sense, good work Devs, for a crew with a limited budjet its a great overall game.

								the devs are aciively working on it, and it is a fine game, with a singleplayer and everything, check out my screenshots. it has a great mechanical physics engine other games don't, you can literaly DESIGN moving machines. that fly , drive, boat etc.. it's fairly insane on the crafting department if you go in depth. That being said patch 81a broke the game for my rig, but i'm building a new rig this week, so i look forward to it. if you want to play ABOVE low graphics get 970/r9-290x + and a good i5, or a 8600+AMD because this is a MONSTER on voxels. it doesn't just map the viewed terrain it maps entire cave systems, under ground water ways, a world of actively tracked monsters. When you can play it on MAX it's gorgeous. the devs are active and they are dedicated, but instead of putting out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ patches every 2 days, they complete entire segments of the games function per alpha patch, this sometimes leads to patches being a month+ apart, but the changes are usualy MASSIVE fixes and content. I HATE minecraft, I hate ARK, i hate all those kinds of games, especialy when they shove MP down your throat. Planet Explorers is genuinely a masterpice being made, it's just rough right now, and still alpha. no other survival explorer world game has gone as in depth or included a REAL storyline with NPC deviations and freedom. it's literaly a planet sized planet to explore. When completed the growth for content in the SP campaign will be mammoth, as well as the servers and custom worlds people run now. I've owned this game nearly a year, don't expect it to be done soon. But when it is done, expect it to be awe inspiring			"

												To recommend this Game was not an easy decision for me. Like many others, i bought the Game long ago in alpha, looking forward to Release. To tell the truth, I'm still not sure, if recommending is right oder not. Sure, it made many prpgress since my first playthrough, Bugs were solved, Content was added, Graphics got better, Stability went up.On the other side, like many others said here, it's still not polished enough and it lacks still Content, Missions and Freedom. I think, for a Steam Sale it's worth the price, because there's still potential and devs work on it. Many here forget, that the devs are not a Big Studio, Minecraft, Empyrion are concurrent and other Sandbox Survival Games are popping up every day. I still trust the devs, because over the years, if you read their postings and threads, i have the impression, it's their baby and they will finish it some day. Only because of the history of the development i decided to recommend it, but BE WARNED!!! It's finished like a GAme with a Deadline!!! You can play it, you can have fun, but it still feels a little unfinished and unpolished sometimes.			"

It's so in credible, you also can transform your world, so many games with this level of design don't allow you to dig or build much but this game is a total sandbox experience.The combat makes it still not ready for me to enjoy for too long.  I hate that every time you swing a mele weapon you move forward this makes mele combat horrible, the npc doesnt care about facing but the player now has a keyboard n mouse wrestling match.  This game should be configured for controllers at least for the combat and weapon switching...it is not which is a shame.  Range combat is perfect.			"

								i found this game extremely dull. for one point, there is no ""exploring"" you walk in a plane for 30 minutes and see the same stuff over and over again. not only that but when you get killed by an aggressive creature, you have to wait about 2 minutes for it to walk away and leave you alone, otherwise you would be killed by the same thing six times in a row. i havent found any landmarks, or any special locations, and i walked for quite a while. i more recently started in a spawn location surrounded by unclimbable mountains. onto the price, i spent $15 on this game and i was disappointed, if i had played some sort of demo before i bought it, i would not have even thought of purchasing this game, even for $10.    either way, bad game or not, it is a pretty one. this game has a wide variety of creatures, many of which i havent seen. and the foliage is quite pretty too. there are many harvestable plants, which are used for crafting and trading.    the quests in the story are very annoying.in conclusion, i despise of this game, i think it is overpriced and repetetive, the quests compare to a free MMO, back and forth, kill ten of this collect four of these, craft a torch that takes you forever to find animals for. i think this game is bad. i understand it is in early access, but these are things that are at the core of the game, not things like glitches. i want my $15 back. and i would rather play everquest. i did not enjoy this game at all, i tried to like it, honestly, but all i saw was a mmo.

Also has a monster beacon if you want to really test out your base defense if they are adequate.Probably the most time consuming of the gameplay is creating your own items and vehicles to romp through the lands. Making your own flying vehicle loaded with guns and shooting anything and everything is highly entertaining, especially if you worked hard to balance the frame so it doesn't tilt.			"

								Super excited for this game. Been following it for a while now and finally decided to pick it up only to find the both story and adventure single player modes freeze at 100% loading and multiplayer isn't working. I never write reviews and never thought I would but this is horse sh!t.Hope they fix it soon because I really want this game to be good but at the moment I would rather digest bear $emen than recommend this game			"

								This is my first review and I thought I would give my input. This game has great potential, Big time I cannot wait to see what the future holds. As for now in its current state at the time of this review 2/21/15 the game is buggy like any alpha but the features in game that they have are brilliant. The PC Scanner ""Allows you to see where resources are"" in a 3D grid like I have never seen really cool, also the fully custom skins for your items you can make and when I say custom I mean it full range creativity. If you don't get this game now that is fine but at least watch to see what it becomes if they play their cards right it will be a show stopper			"

								This is a great game, for any who like minecraft, terraria or other games like that, this is a great pick. Multiplayer and adventure mode are pretty empty and bland but its only in an early stage of development so thats to be expected, the story mode, however, while nothing to special is still great but mostly consists of petty fetch quests but i doubt theyll stay like that.but were the game stands out the most is the deep building system. Teraforming is a bit buggy still and buildings are simple to make with the deep build mode system. its not that different from minecraft but instead just a retexture of different tools for different materials you can design your own. its a simple to learn but complex to master system that really works well right now with few bugs (that ive encountered). plus it has much content and more frequent updates than Starforge.

Some of the things that make this game unique and very cool are: The story is very fun and helps you learn the game as you go along, The vehicle building. I'm not very good at it but it adds a whole new deminsion to an open world game, Lots of different block shapes and sizes. You can make some really nice looking buildings. I would reccomend this game to anyone who loved minecraft or any other survival/building game.			"

Early Access Review
								So far, I'm quite pleased with the state this is in, in Alpha. I was an avid Minecraft player though less on the ""elaborate builds"" and more on the ""exploration and live in a hollowed out cave"" side, so initially this is pretty good for indulging your Exploratory side, and building looks customizable enough that it'll be a decent-sized learning curve vs simple blocks/pixel recreation; ergo, it'll be more in-depth and nice looking than Blocky builds would, but also harder to tweak just right than simply slapping one block/lego onto another in some cases.It is an Alpha though at the time of this review, so there's some minor bugs/issues; movement can be wonky sometimes(it was worse, but they actually made it better in a recent update), I had a quest to escort an npc to a place and had to kill 3 monsters at the location, but they spawned underground or something and, while still being marked on my map, weren't killable, breaking the quest. The NPC went ahead and acted like I'd beaten them, but since I hadn't, couldn't complete. This was in Story Mode, though, and will likely be fixed at the rate they work.Server-based Multiplayer is available, though still finicky in it's current iteration. I tried to create a game with a friend and it simply wasn't showing up in the list, and vice versa. I assume/hope that they'll be working on that and making hosting & joining a little easier for the average joe to do without having to learn to set up ""actual"" servers for small-numbers co-op play with a friend or two.TL;DR: If you like Survival/Exploration/Building games a la Minecraft, Terraria, or even similar to Everquest Landmark, with a solid single player experience as well as Multiplayer options, this is worth a shot for ya. I'm eager to see where it goes as it progresses into a more stable Beta and eventual Launch.			"

Early Access Review
								Pardon my grammar. I am writing this because i am sick of being ""early access pwnt"" where a game looks cool, but it is not worth it, and the devs post positive reviews to sell it. Best crafting  I have ever played. unlike a lot of crafting games which feels like ""farm farm farm farm...... FINALLY I MADE SOMETHING!!!.... Farm farm farm farm"" the crafting in planet explorers is extremely addictive. It is not (combine to make item) it's more like literally building a vehicle or weapon from scratch. Go look at the items in the workshop that people have made, then I want anyone who reads this to know that EVERYTHING was made in game. It is not programming, its created in game with a very user friendly system. There currently is enough for 50+ hours of fun, even more playing multiplayer.Pros.Devs update like no other early access I have played yet (this is not a starbound)crafting system is 10/10 I spent about half time in game creating. great feeling of adventuregood amount of enemies/materials/biom/random featuresstats are based on what materials are used on the item/vehical    -for example a sword made of diamond will be sharper than metal, but break easier. it will do more dmg but you will have to repair it sooner. Also you need to create a sharp edge in order to get max dmg. the crafting actually bases the stats based on literal qualites. lengthening/shortending gun barels changes how it shoots. vehicals made from aluminum will fly way faster than gold because it is lighter. multiple game modesPotential for one of the most monumental sandbox games ever when it is released.Consmultiplayer is difficult to get working and saved for someone that is not used to port fowardingmonsters seem too easy. the replayability currently is more about creating more than progressing/killing harder bosses no dungeons (personal con)fighting style is slightly clunky, however in the time I have owned the game it has gotten a ton better. still at times not smoothnot enough action as I would like in a sandbox. I realize that is asking a lot, but even tho they have a lot of different monsters in this world, it gets old running around killing everything. Later on in the game, you kill everything VERY easilly.For the crafting I recomend this game, if you absolutly love sandbox crafting games buy it, for everyone else wait until they impliment more. "

								Pardon my grammar. I am writing this because i am sick of being ""early access pwnt"" where a game looks cool, but it is not worth it, and the devs post positive reviews to sell it. Best crafting  I have ever played. unlike a lot of crafting games which feels like ""farm farm farm farm...... FINALLY I MADE SOMETHING!!!.... Farm farm farm farm"" the crafting in planet explorers is extremely addictive. It is not (combine to make item) it's more like literally building a vehicle or weapon from scratch. Go look at the items in the workshop that people have made, then I want anyone who reads this to know that EVERYTHING was made in game. It is not programming, its created in game with a very user friendly system. There currently is enough for 50+ hours of fun, even more playing multiplayer.Pros.Devs update like no other early access I have played yet (this is not a starbound)crafting system is 10/10 I spent about half time in game creating. great feeling of adventuregood amount of enemies/materials/biom/random featuresstats are based on what materials are used on the item/vehical    -for example a sword made of diamond will be sharper than metal, but break easier. it will do more dmg but you will have to repair it sooner. Also you need to create a sharp edge in order to get max dmg. the crafting actually bases the stats based on literal qualites. lengthening/shortending gun barels changes how it shoots. vehicals made from aluminum will fly way faster than gold because it is lighter. multiple game modesPotential for one of the most monumental sandbox games ever when it is released.Consmultiplayer is difficult to get working and saved for someone that is not used to port fowardingmonsters seem too easy. the replayability currently is more about creating more than progressing/killing harder bosses no dungeons (personal con)fighting style is slightly clunky, however in the time I have owned the game it has gotten a ton better. still at times not smoothnot enough action as I would like in a sandbox. I realize that is asking a lot, but even tho they have a lot of different monsters in this world, it gets old running around killing everything. Later on in the game, you kill everything VERY easilly.For the crafting I recomend this game, if you absolutly love sandbox crafting games buy it, for everyone else wait until they impliment more. "

								This is a great game, for any who like minecraft, terraria or other games like that, this is a great pick. Multiplayer and adventure mode are pretty empty and bland but its only in an early stage of development so thats to be expected, the story mode, however, while nothing to special is still great but mostly consists of petty fetch quests but i doubt theyll stay like that.but were the game stands out the most is the deep building system. Teraforming is a bit buggy still and buildings are simple to make with the deep build mode system. its not that different from minecraft but instead just a retexture of different tools for different materials you can design your own. its a simple to learn but complex to master system that really works well right now with few bugs (that ive encountered). plus it has much content and more frequent updates than Starforge.

								This is a neat game that reminds me of a more advanced minecraft (which i played extensivly). Some of the things that make this game unique and very cool are: The story is very fun and helps you learn the game as you go along, The vehicle building. I'm not very good at it but it adds a whole new deminsion to an open world game, Lots of different block shapes and sizes. You can make some really nice looking buildings. I would reccomend this game to anyone who loved minecraft or any other survival/building game.			"

								So far, I'm quite pleased with the state this is in, in Alpha. I was an avid Minecraft player though less on the ""elaborate builds"" and more on the ""exploration and live in a hollowed out cave"" side, so initially this is pretty good for indulging your Exploratory side, and building looks customizable enough that it'll be a decent-sized learning curve vs simple blocks/pixel recreation; ergo, it'll be more in-depth and nice looking than Blocky builds would, but also harder to tweak just right than simply slapping one block/lego onto another in some cases.It is an Alpha though at the time of this review, so there's some minor bugs/issues; movement can be wonky sometimes(it was worse, but they actually made it better in a recent update), I had a quest to escort an npc to a place and had to kill 3 monsters at the location, but they spawned underground or something and, while still being marked on my map, weren't killable, breaking the quest. The NPC went ahead and acted like I'd beaten them, but since I hadn't, couldn't complete. This was in Story Mode, though, and will likely be fixed at the rate they work.Server-based Multiplayer is available, though still finicky in it's current iteration.

												Planet Explorers is a great mix of RPG, Survival with Crafting comprehensive and complex.If you are looking for a Survival different from others with RPG elements is that with rewarding crafting, surely this is the game for you.The game features three interesting mode and in more you also have the chance to play in single player and/or multiplayer Versus or Co-Op servers.Definitely not a masterpiece and some games in Early Access perhaps offer the same content, but i can guarantee that at this Christmas price (or discount) definitely worth it.Advised and Recommended for fans of the genre, especially if you like complete and complex crafting.You can literally create weapons, vehicles, armors and more from scratch and how you want (in accordance with certain limits)			"

												It's a good game, and it has a good story and tons to do. I am a bit let down by the colony system however. I feel it was presented as an automated system- once you got it up and running, the people you gather for your colony kinda of automate. I expected them to start building furniture (not placing it) and wall materials and weapons and guns, but they build really odd things and only a little bit. The systems aren't very well designed from a UI interface point either, requiring you to choose to craft from your personal inventory or the colony, keeping a split inventory, which I dislike.It is still worth the cost and a good game. I just wish the colonies worked a touch different.			"

Early Access Review
								I honestly have no idea why this game gets such great reviews. It's an Early Access game, but the last time I saw it was a year ago. To say it's improved would be a gross overstatement.First off, optimization sucks. I have a rig that can run most AAA games with ease on full. I've tried all of the rendering options, and no matter what I do, the game absolutely slows to a 10 fps crawl even when I'm the only living thing on a small, barren island. It's not like the game looks good or anything, it's pretty basic.The world generation is terrible and very frequently I've seen trees and boulders sticking out of the sides of islands. Along with that I've fallen out of the game world twice in 20 minutes.The UI is clunky and the controls are terrible. It gives you the illusion of having two control schemes only for one to just flat out not work and you're forced to work with its default awful WoW-type interface that tries to be both an MMO and Minecraft, but is bad at both. The animations are buggy and I've frequently been moonwalking underwater. Chatting with other players is difficult and a huge pain. Some hotkeys, like holstering your item, just flat out don't work. Also, the HUD is useless in informing you if you've taken any damage or are undergoing any effects.Honestly, I haven't gotten far into the game, only an hour or so with half in SP and half in MP, but I feel like I've played all I need to know that this game's not worth it, at least not right now.Say all you want about how it's an Early Access game, but the truth of the matter is, at the time of this writing, from what I've played, this game barely passes as an alpha. It's riddled with bugs, is unpolished as hell, and has quality worse than most free games out there. I came in expecting a 3D Starbound sandbox and got just another stagnant, buggy as hell Early Access game. Don't buy it.			"

								In it's current Alpha state, I would not recommend this game... yet. It still needs a lot of work. My biggest peeve when playing was the length of time it took to do... anything. The day/night cycle is too long (one minute is about 5 seconds), the movement of the character is slow (even running), and the controls are clunky and poorly executed. I think this game has great potential, but it still needs a lot of work. The crafting of ISO's and buildings is an excellent idea, I just wish it was simpler to use. Also there is not much help from the game. No tips on what to do during a quest, no journal or log to keep track of plants/wildlife/materials/etc, definitely not much help when crafting. Another thing that really bothered me was knowing what I could and couldn't interact with and selecting those certain things. it took way too long for me to figure out what plants I could harvest and to even harvest them. It felt like no position or amount of clicking around said plant would help me harvest it. acquiring resources is a real drag. I'm stuck on a quest from an AI in the game that requires me to find 30 pieces of copper and 5 pieces of tin. It's freaking impossible to mine quickly and there's no distinction between minerals in the terrain. I've  acquired all kinds of minerals from terrain that looks the same. Which brings me to the world itself... it's pretty boring. The first mission in the story requires you to escort two companions to a camp, but nothing attacks you or delays you. you just run there.... talk about anti-climactic! Anyway, the world itself needs more life. The graphics are okay. The lighting and shadowing is well done, some of the plants look fine, but the grass.... it's literally everywhere and it looks bad. Well that's about it for the negative stuff. There are positives to this game though. It has potential to be great and I know once the delevopers consider our feedback as a community this game will be polished pretty nicely. Until then, I would say buy at your own risk.			"

								It's too choppy, unpolished at even the basic levels, and devs. seem to want to add more garbage to the game instead of fixing their existing (and bad) framework. Don't get me wrong this game has a great concept, but do you really want to pay for a concept? The movement of your character is that of a buffalo on ice, awkward, slidey, and just...unnatural. Getting the graphic settings to a tolerable state is incredibly difficult and pretty frustating. I would recommend 7 Days to Die over this game anyday.			"

								Aside from the expected Early Access wonkiness Planet Explorers unfortunately runs into the same trap a lot of similar 'Minecraft BUT MORE' games fall into, which is to ditch the intuitive Lego-ish building in favor of something more akin to a  3D modeling suite. I wish it all the best because it's so exciting on a conceptual level but unless the game part of the finished product ends up wildly compelling (right now it's like a wonky and lonely MMO) it's just really hard to recommend spending your time learning how to build stuff in this over doing the same in Blender or UDK (both of which are free to mess with) and picking up some useful skills along the way.

								this game is super super fun with beautiful graphics you could easily play this game for hours. if you plan on playing with friend you better be tech savvy because it is a pain to host the games me and my friends have spent a few hours trying to figure out how to get it to host and we just gave up this would be worth a buy if you only intended on single player games or joining a random lobby but if you plan on playing a game with friends you won't be able to. I managed to get lan to work but after a day our server and our progress was gone and never to be seen again.			"

								The game is still very glitchy and it is difficult to know what you are supposed to be doing without leaving the game and Googling how various things are achieved. There is a lot to do, but it is unintuitive and all feels quite shallow and grindy.  The controls are of the ""click here/push this button to perform task"" variety common in free MMOs, not at all immersive.The game has huge potential, but in its current state it is absolutely *not* worth almost twenty quid.

								This game gave me alot of enjoyment and was well worth buying, that was until they released a new graphic engine overhaul and it is optimised so badly that i get constant fps dips not to mention the AI behaves really badly, an entire village of people all rush towards some monster that is far away from them and then they all just stand there at the monsters corpse and dont go back to their previous location			"

								Quick Review as of 0.75 Alpha. If it's a game being sold, it's a game i'm going to review.--Pros:Large Open WorldSandbox gameCraftingAlien AnimalsNice water--Cons / needs to be improved:Clunky Controls.No first person view *** CORECTION** THERE IS FIRST PERSON. World has no atmosphere, as in no life, nothing happening.Poor textures. Poor graphics. (Too much bloom, strange grass that constantly waves, no FOV slider)Poor animationsPoor combatPoor UI, especially when building ISOs. Feels like I need a degree in graphic design to use it.No collision on certain objects, able to walk through them.No tutorial, or help guidePoor character customisation. Poor AILimited DialogueStarting from the top this game features an open world larger than 7 days to die if I judge at a glance. It has grass lands, deserts and forests. Crafting is also included in the game which uses a similar system to starbound if i recall correctly, similar UI as well, nothing much to say apart from it appears to work as expected if you have played starbound or terraria.The controls are poor in my opinion. As you first start the game it requires you to hold the right mouse button and drag to move the camera. Or you can press F2 and have it follow your character as you would expect from a game post year 2005. The problem with this is the UI becomes difficult and you can't interact with anything unless you press and hold tab. So for you to talk to a character I have to hold tab, then right click on the character. If I let go of tab I can't click the dialog options. As you are walking around the world, apart from alien animals wandering around aimlessly the world is empty. It's hard to explain however minecraft also suffered the same problem. No birds or atmospheric sound effects. Nothing really happening in the atmosphere. The textures are poor. They look like they have just stepped out of 2006. There is too much bloom, the grass is horrible and I know they are trying to go for an alien look but it really grinds against my gears. All of the grass waves in front of you for no apparent reason, there is no logic. Apart from the textures at least the colours are good!The animations are fairly bad. You jump 3 metres high, and there is no life in your character it's like moving a robot. This is especially apparent when in combat. I think the character only makes 2-3 animations in the whole combat. You also get a shield which I couldn't work out how to use as it's stuck inside his arm and is smaller than a compact disc.The UI is poor. The ISO designer which lets you build weapons or design vehicles appears at first view like you need a degree in graphic design software. After about 20 mins you start to get the hang of it but personally I gave up because I'm playing a game to have fun, not to make me feel like a designer at work. The UI on 1920x1080 appears very small. I had to put on my reading glasses to see anything. Also The whole layout feels clunky, when talking to people I don't like how you click on the words and how they are 3pt small.The character customisation needs work. Nothing to choose from and the pre-set faces are terrible. You need to add the option to design your own face like sims, as the pre-set faces are the most ugliest I’ve seen to date.The AI is Poor. They walk around turning on their back heel like Michael Jackson, or staring at walls. I was attacked in the starting camp and everyone let me get my♥♥♥♥♥kicked, thanks AI  !At this stage it's absolutely not worth £18.99. For some reason I see people talking it up like it's the best thing since slice bread and WHY?! I am not going to try and pretend it's good so I feel like I got my money’s worth. It's not very good unless you are new to gaming.It's worth £5 on a steam sale. It's an avoid from me. First game I switched off and deleted after an hour.			"

								Ultimate minecraft with normal shape people and animalsNobody needs to drink water, except the first person you met in story modeCan't even have a dog fight with enemies when flying an airplane, turns out the physics is weird as hellBugs here, bugs there, bugs everywhere, because f**k you, that's whyCan't even roll over an animal to death with a 60t heavy tank, but even the slightest scrach from a monkey can cause damage to itOh you want to know why we can build a flying battleship but not a real battleship on water? Just shut the f**k up and go build me a tank with only large rubber wheels and see if it can movesI have seen the weakest guns i've ever seen in this game. Maybe they're just shooting peanutsI'm totally fine with out the ability to build a giant robot, but can't see how two giant robots fight each other is really letting me downWhat do you mean you've been shot in the head and stabbed by a giant robot to death? Just give yourself a shot and everything is gonna be fineNo no no, build yourself a base and live here happily forever is not an option. Now move your a*se and p**s off some alien soldiers!Bollix! Protective colour can't protect you is only because you smells badDon't need to put windshields on any vehicles, because the force will be with youOkay, so here we are, crahsed on an alien planet, and still alive. Why didn't we just open the radar when we were on the landing ship? I mean, that's definately the captian's fault, but it doesn't mean non of those crews couldn't remind the captain and destroy the ship that crushed on us with torpidoesAnd one last thing, I really wonder how's Earth and Mars going on. Hope they were not destroyed in the four years when we were travelling. S**t some how I miss my home now⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5/5Don't f**k it up, Pathea, not like COD, PLEASE!!! I wish I have 10 billion dollars and yell ""shut up and take my money!"" to you, but I can't. And wish every single nerds can have a lonely Halloween.🎃			"

												I picked up this game early in the EA cycle and almost immeadiately put it down after playing a couple of hours since the initial release was a steaming pile of hot garbage.So I gave it a year or two to gather some steam and put some polish, enough time to pass from alpha to beta.And its still hot garbage.Okay for the usual breakdown:Visuals:Visually Planet Explorers is pretty nice, for what it is and what cycle of development its in it accomplishes a great deal. Character customization is fine, standard fare. Building things is equally detailed and can produce some very amazing things.Sound:Likewise, gets the job done, it's not perfect but its still beta so a few bugs here and there is to be expected.Gameplay:Here is where Planet Explorers still fails.In early alpha the 'fetch' quests had you traversing great distances for the most minor of things. At that time spawners didn't care if you were a veteran or a fresh spawn, you would likely stumble into alien creatures vastly out of your league all for pidly rewards.Beta... they've cleaned it up but they've added more game modes and no documentation. When you now start up the game you can adjust your visuals and get thrown into a starter screen where you pick Story, Adventurer etc etc. NONE OF WHICH are explained. I *imagine* story is the original alpha experience, the crashed ship, the fetch quests etc and so forth so I thought I'd try adventure.The first thing to fail is the fact that you can only take one quest at a time. There's half a dozen in your starter area but you can only take ONE main quest and one side quest. The main quest has you hoofing it a huge distance to a 'settlement', have fun running half an hour back and forth between HUBs to do the other STARTER quests. That's only a guess as the original beautiful world generation is utterly borked in adventure mode. Leaving the starter village required building a set of stairs to reach the floating mountain and the road onwards. Seriously... and its not the only floating mountain, I spawned on a grassy plateau surrounded by water at the bottom of a huge cliff and half a dozen floating mountains.There's no explination of game modes, there's no tutorial to (re)familiarize yourself with how the game works. You spawn and are pretty much up to yourself to figure out how the game works.Like alpha, I played the beta for an hour then uninstalled again.Seriously, I advise all perspective buyers to wait. There's tons of potential here assuming the devs stop taking five steps backwards every time they take one forward. It's great that its optimized and looks pretty but if the functionality is abyssmal it doesn't matter how nice it looks.			"

								After a day of playing heres my thoughts.Stay away from multiplayer, just is not there yet. Clipping and other bugs just mean stay away. Single player. This has some hope. the creation system kinda works, still missing a good interface. Kinda suck in the story line, a few key items are missing like wheter to get the petro from. dingging a hole streight down, and you'll be hours trying to get out of it. Wait till you have fast track before you pull this stunt. Cash flow in the game is meat. You can get a giant mob stuck behind rocks and trees to kill off fpr massive paydays. When min ing the pick axe is useless and difficult to use, use the shovel instead it easy and does a great job. Trade marble for meat, and meat for what you want. Over all its like mine craft meets skyrim, except the fun is stripped out. You can build things and yes the mobs can destoy what you build, so make it out of sturdy materials. All the good stuff is in the single user mode. It runs so task heavey my system offten lets me hear the buffer overflow of my key presses (AKA my system board beeps a lot!). Might be better on the xbox if they port it over.			"

								The game concept is nice and it's definitely a fun game to play with friends. There is one big problem though. It is poorly optimized making your average gaming pc perform poorly. With the Geforce 610M or equivalent, you will need to put it down to its lowest setting and even then you are only getting 10-20 frames per second. I really don't think this game should be this demanding on hardware. You wouldn't think this game has nearly the same minimum requirements as watchdogs, but it does.			"

								I am sure this game is very fun and innovative but unfortunately for me it is just way to difficult and overwhelming. To explain I tried story mode and had some fun with it for the first few quests...but then the game became WAYYY to difficult WAYYY too quickly. The sheer distance you had to travel from a doctors camp to another quest point was too long and during your travel to this point blood thirsty creatures who are way too tough kill you instantly, even with my gun they were still too difficult. Then another quest took me to some altar where 3 giant bird creatures hovered over it...I died numerous times here but thankfully the game gave you an invincible NPC to follow you with a rifle to help you...so I waited dead for the NPC to kill all 3 of them and the NPC even had trouble cause it took over 20 mins for him to kill 2 of the birds....finally I got up bought some bullets from the NPC and the bird took over 50 bullets to die!!! DXI stuck it out and played a little longer even though my frustration at this point was high from dieing so much, I came to point where a female NPC took me into the creation tool kit to make a vehicle...This creator is not user friendly at all, and the tutorial is skimpy at best. For me I could not figure out how to make a basic car without looking up a guide on youtube. To my knowledge there are no base vehicles either, so that means that you HAVE to build a vehicle otherwise your trapped on foot the entire game.This game is in development so I can't be too hard but it just seems to drop you off in this overwhelming massive world with little instruction to help you out... I am sure if I spent an hour mining materials I would have had a bit easier time since I could have probably made a better weapon, but the game should not be like that at least not so early. The game should not punish you and send you on a ""chore run"" to mine 100 iron just to kill 3 birds. I say if you are thinking about this game is wait til it is out of development and they address issues.			"

Like I said I have been on the forums to the devs about theseissues and its always ""It will be fixed in the next patch"".Which never ever happens.Final release....oops still bugs, bugs, bugs.Also as another post had said the graphics are hazed over to fixany graphical glitches.

								This game is starting to shape into a great game, the customization part is quite something unique and fun. But imho, the game needs lots and lots of polishing before it would be something to recommend. At this point, the game looks extremly beautiful, however everything feels very stale, the animations, enemies, diging/mining and building. What the game needs is time, at least 2 more years, imo. I have high hopes for this game and I think this will be a good recommendable game when it is in it's final form.Update!2 years later, game is now in beta but still feels like major alpha. It has been shaping into a better version compared to 2 years ago. But the polish isn't just there yet. Starts to seem like a abandonware product. Too fast transaction to beta and will probably go way to fast to ""final"" version. I would recommend looking into some other game or get this when it is on sale for a few bucks/euros. It may sound harsh, but I don't think the game is worth the current price with the current pace. But maybe I'm wrong, perhaps this will be a gem in the years to come.			"

												I only have a small amount of play time, but it was enough for me to see that this game is not for me. Its mostly because of massive amounts of glitches that make it NOT fun and get my Character permanently stuck. also the game didnt have much to it to do or explorer. and all the gameplay videos and researched i did on this game had it Hyped. simply put nothing like what i though it would be.

												I bought this game in early release about a year ago but was too busy to play it until recently (late February 2017).  But I kept up with the reviews, and saw a lot of thumbs down for it.  My experience has been the great with the game, and I'm guessing that a lot of players who gave bad reviews jumped right in to story mode.  I did the opposite, I went in to build mode first because I like exploration games, and also because I wanted to see what the game could actually do.  I have played build and adventure mode, but not story mode yet.  Keep in mind this game was billed from the start as an “open world sandbox adventure RPG game,” and I love sandbox games.Build mode:This is the sandbox aspect of the game, and it's fantastic.  The worlds and scenery are utterly gorgeous, and the adventures you can have are enormous.  I jumped in to this first to see what the developers achieved, and it's really nice.  You get all the weapons, some template air/land/water vehicles, turrets, jetpacks-- if it's in the game you get access to it.  Playing this mode first helped me figure out how to use the GUI, controls, and how things worked overall so it was definitely the right move.  Besides being beautiful, it had some nice touches like the music changing with the terrain type.  It was awesome to fly around a helicopter in the desert at night with search lights and then to return to my base by finding my campfires.  I built a quad and tore up the sand, so much fun.Cons of build mode:  As feedback for the developers I would say that while the fun level of build mode is top notch, what made this great experience feel sterile is the fact that you're completely alone.  Not even a single animal.  There were animal sounds by the beach, but no animals.  Bird sounds, but no birds.  It would be a great touch to add some passive animals just for scenery, or to practice one's hunting skills.  The ability to add an NPC follower or something might be nice too, but non-threatening animals I think are a requisite to complete the beautiful picture of nature they have painted.  This solitary player presence affected the replayability of this mode since it gets boring to play around as the only living creature in these huge worlds.Adventure mode:This mode is where you essentially jump in to a map and have choose-it-yourself adventures.  It's the same beautiful scenery, and the seed-generated map I got was the stock planet Maria.  I covered about half of the map and found at least four different kinds of environments so far.  But superimposed on to this grandeur that I saw in build mode was animals, NPCs, and quests (and even dungeons), a nice old school touch that I didn't expect.  In this mode you get the RPG features, like having to gather resources and work the tech trees to advance.  I'm glad I did build mode first so I understood what to do and how things work, which made entering adventure mode even more fun for me.Cons of adventure mode:  I didn't notice too many negatives about this mode, but one that I saw was glaring.  I think there were two difficulty level choices (easy and normal) for adventure mode, so I took easy just to be safe because I wanted to explore it.  Well, some hit-point related things definitely were not easy.  For example, my NPC follower and I were crossing terrain and these two huge birds started to attack us.  A single strike from a bird resulted in the lost of 75% health, not what I would expect on an “easy” setting for sure.  The same was true for entering one dungeon, we got wiped out pretty quick by the NPCs there, so making sure that the easy setting means “go have fun in all areas” should be considered.Miscellaneous:I didn't get the crashes a lot of people reported.  I ran version 1.6 of the game, and I was on a mac mini with 8GB of ram and Intel 4000 graphics.  The game ran very well, with slight lag in the finer special effects but not enough to ruin my enjoyment of the game overall.  I did have a problem with the game consistently loading though.  It would get stuck on the company logo screen and not move on, so I'd have to keep force quitting it and keep trying.  I found a similar “mac loader” problem in the forums so I hope the developers can smooth this out.Summary:Planet explorers is a great game, and top notch exploration game in my opinion.  I logged 35 hours on it in the first 3 days of playing it was so much fun.  While it's no longer in early access, it's still a version 1.x of a very large, intricate, and ambitious game.  I supported the developers in the EA phase because I wanted to see it work, and I have done that for other games like Kerbal Space Program.  So if you expect a finished product out of the box you should stay out of all EA and 1.x release games, but if you want a great game where you can build, explore, quest, and just have fun then Planet Explorers is well worth a look.

								The graphics of this game are like from 2003 in my opinion. Other than that, the game is pretty bland at the moment. I paid cheaper than the store price by quite a bit, at this time I don't even think it's worth it at the price I paid, never the less $20+Maybe that will change with another 6-12 months of development, but right now... Uh big no.			"

								At the current state that the game is in, I do NOT recommend purchasing it. For starters, there is no audio that plays when you do well...anything. You'll occasionally hear ambient noises that play on repeat but you'll hear no footsteps or anything whatsoever. The audio is horrible.Second of all, the game is very...je ne sais quois. You can't really customize your character as most of the options are invisible (a glitch of course). The graphics are a mix of the PS2 era and the PS3 era - they're highly outdated which isn't a problem as this is a voxel based building game. I don't mind it.Colonists don't do anything. They literally stand there all day doing absolutely nothing but sell you goods. It feels as if the world revolves around you (which is a very bad thing for a game like this). I truly hope this game becomes that game that it wants to be because after all this, I still support the game developers. I respect what they're trying to do and I just want you to understand that this is an early access game. There are plenty of bugs and you're pretty much paying to fund the development.The building is great fun and very detailed. Combat is horrible, though. If you have any further questions, you may direct them to me by sending me a message on Steam. I will gladly answer it for you as I truly do want to like this game. I will find something I like, I swear it.			"

								So, after a long period of not playing this game, I tried again to test the brand new ""beta"" version.I got an I5 4460 8Go RAM GTX970 Win8 64, game is still stuttering a lot, and the main difficulty of the game is to.... harvest a simple tree. I can't target a tree to harvest it, or I'm finally able to do it after some minutes of trying to get the good ""spot"". Really... Yeah, devs you really need to work hard on optimization.I then tried the Adventure mode, what a disappointment to see that I already have all blueprints in adventure mode?! I don't see the point, why playing when you got everything at the start ? So I stopped and maybe I'll give it another chance in some.. ahem.. years?The game is nearly unplayable right now, and I dont see real improvements over time			"

												At first, I didn't understand the game at all. I stopped playing and thought, what a waste (I got it as a gift). But after a while I gave it a second try and saw the possibilities of this game. I am quite happy with this game now and enjoy building and playing a lot.You really need to understand this game, they have a hard time explaining how to play. Hosting your own game has some issues too, but when it works, it is ok. Sometimes a bit lag or some bugs, and the fighting system isn't very good but acceptable for me. Don't expect a 'perfect' polished game! Be warned!I recommend it if you like: 1. Building, having your own base(s) and people which gives endless possibilities. 2. Designing your own vehicles/aircraft, or use other peoples designs and like to explore.Avoid if you: 1. Haven't played similar building games, because you have a hard time learning (ARK, Minecraft)2. Get frustrated easily			"

								I know its in early development!! It looked so promising and then... then the /strike  I mean the bugs... The bugs attacked. So after spawning in I go around the colony to mine and cut some trees down. All happy and fun right? Nope! Just after I start to have a good time a giant wind-dragon thing of destruction came and started to kill me, unequipt to fight a flying monster I run into one of the colony buildings and decide to let the ""gaurd"" NPCs take care of it. Nope! The little s***bird starts attacking me through the walls and the NPCs sit around with their thumb up their yaho watching me get torn apart through the walls! I die. Respawn. Decide to go fight this thing.... *20 lifes later* I finally kill it! Lets see what I get.... Congradulations an entire 10 meat! We know half your invintory dropped and despawned from being murdered by our glitchdragon so you get an entire 10 meat! 10 MEAT? WTF! I decide to keep playing reminding myself the game is in early acess. I continue to chop down trees then bam. A giant 6 legged lion cubone thing runs straight through three trees and starts to pounce on me. *15 lives later* 30 meat and 1 animal skin. Yay. . . . . So back to cutting wood. . . N O P E ! a pack of 3 lion cubones come and I just quit because I dont feel like wasting another 30 min. of my pitiful life playing this game.			"
