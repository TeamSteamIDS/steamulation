												Well, what do we have here, you may ask?What we have here is probably one of  the best indie titles I've played this past year. At the time this review is posted it may say that I have little to no hours in this game, but rest assured that Iâ€™ve had 40+ hours in this game before it came out on Steam. I got my 40+ hours using Desura, a game distribution platform not too dissimilar from Steam, where this game was published with constant updates. That being said, my 40+ hours came from playing different builds of this game, from the Alpha to the latest build, v1.0.10. And let me be frank here; every reiteration, as in every update, made this game more and more enjoyable in almost every aspect. The developer, Phroot, took the time to add new features along with many important bug fixes with every update. In other words, he knows what to do and how to take care of his game. Now on to what the game is about:Gameplay: The gameplay of 3089 is set in first-person, as  seen through the screenshots. Now you may be thinking, ""Oh another FPS??!?"" Rest assured  that even  though  the game is set in first person, the gameplay is far from your traditional FPS for many reasons: 1. Non-linear procedurally generated environment. No two playthroughs are the same. Everything about the environment is different from where enemy bases are spawned to randomly placed towers (in a good way). Bridges, roads, buildings, and bases are randomly placed in the huge sprawling world known as Xax. The only thing constant throughout every playthrough is that you, the player, is always spawned in a friendly base (and even then, the base has randomly placed buildings). Every building, bridge, road, etc is sprawling with life as there are always friendly and enemy robots roaming about, sometimes fighting each other to the death. It's a magnificent sight to see groups of robots fighting it out while you just sit watching. The world is alive; never have I felt that I'm completely alone in this single-player game.2. Variety of playstyles. 3089 has done a fantastic job of allowing multiple types of playstyles, such as a stealth run to a full run-and-gun experience. The game accomplishes this with skill points, and as you complete quests you can apply those skill points into a variety of different attributes, such as Stealth to avoid easier detection by enemies to Vehicles which allow you to pilot better vehicles. There's even a Leadership ability in which I can recruit a large amount of friendly robots to follow me wherever I go. It is so satisfying seeing my cadre of robots go after a group of enemies for a particular quest. In short, there are so many attributes that can be applied to your unit, and combination of each of these attributes can add to an entirely new playstyle.3. Combat. The combat of 3089 is familiar to other games, but still satisfying nonetheless. There are a variety of different weapons to choose from, ranging from simple pistols to swords. That's right, swords. Now I haven't used swords a lot since melee combat isn't my thing, but I can testify for the gunplay. The gunplay is solid as there are different weapons to choose from along with the extensive customization (which I'll go into detail soon). There are rifles, launchers, pistols, and energy rifles. Honestly my favorite type is rifles as they just feel so solid and powerful with the right customizations/attachments. The combat of 3089 can be challenging as you have to manage your ammo inventory and your 'Burst', which is how many shots you have before 'reloading.' You have to time your shots and make sure they hit their mark if you want to make it out unscathed. Like I said, the combat is challenging yet super rewarding. Along with the variety of weapons, there are also a large number of enemies, ranging from simple robots to giant spider bots. These spider bots are fudging huge and have powerful weapons!4. Loot and customization.  This has got to be one of my favorite aspects of this game. Loot is acquired from killing enemies along with 'uncrating' random crates you find along the way. The loot you find is proportional to the level of the environment, so if you kill an enemy in a level 10 environment, you get an item that is level 10 (the level of a certain area is seen when you open up  the map. The level is denoted by 'Difficulty', so a difficulty of 10 of an area would house level 10 enemies and level 10 loot. The area you start in is Difficulty 1, so the farther you stray from your starting area, the higher level and more difficult the game is). The loot you find can be anything from parts of weapons to armor pieces. In 3089, you can customize your weapons to a nice degree with these parts. For example, rifle parts include barrels, magazines, bodies, scopes, and silencers. Armor parts include leggings, helmets + visors, and lower torso and chest pieces. All parts of  a particular weapon are interchangeable, so you have the ability to make a powerful weapon catered to your liking.Graphics: I'll be honest here; when I saw this game for the first time, I was like, ""What is this???"" But as I went through the screenshots on Desura, it changed my mind. The vast hills in the distance with simple buildings in the foreground from a screenshot got to me. So I gave the game a chance by downloading the demo. In short, I was amazed at the beauty of the world. Vast landscapes on this alien world with large areas full of robotic life. The aesthetics are simple, but does extremely well to show off the world. With every update, the landscape look more 'alive' with more things added to the world, like bridges and ramps and helipads. Before you pass this game off because of the graphics, please reconsider. Download the demo and see how  gorgeous this game can be. The screenshots don't do it justice.Story:The story is quite simple and self-explanatory, so I won't spend much time explaining what it is. What I will explain is how to get the most out of it. To get the most out of what's going on, it is best to read every data text that you come across. You get snippets of the story through these data texts, which can be acquired from completing quests and following objectives. These data texts, which are just a few sentences, explain what the fudge is going on and what you can do to maximize impact on the world. Conclusion:Possibly one of the best indie games I've played in a while. I find it astounding how this game made by one person with the help of others can provide me with more enjoyment than some AAA games out there. It may sound like I'm exaggerating but it's the truth for me personally. If you love exploration games with lots of freedom with a gorgeous living world, then this is the game for you! "

For more reviews and gameplay videos by Morgoth, check out the profile or the Twitch channel at twitch.tv/morgoth0221While I do appreciate what the developer is attempting to do in this game, there's just not enough substance for me to actually recommend this game.  I love the leveling system and how you can get good at just about everything, but the entire game is just one big grind.  There is very little story or plot to the entire game, and at least to me, in a game like this, there needs to be a driving force to continue on or a reason to be doing what you are doing.  The quests that are given have no bearing whatsoever on anything besides the fact that they are fetch quests that give you skillpoints.  The graphical style, while interesting, turns stagnant very quickly, and the same goes for the weapons as a whole.  They all generally look the same.  Not a bad deal at the low price point I picked the game up for, but even then I wouldn't consider it worth it.EDIT:  After coming back to this game about 7 months later from my initial review, I have gone back and played through the entire game (and yes you can beat it).  It's not quite as bad as I originally thought, the weapons do get a little more interesting, and the enemies become a little more varied.  Overall though, there are just far too many flaws in this game to really be enjoyable.  The entirety of the game turns out to be one long grind.  And grinding is never fun.  Grinding was originally introduced in old-school RPGs like Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy, to give the impression that the games were longer than they really were.  But grinding wasn't even enjoyable then.  It's always been a pain, and the fact that this seriously antiquated idea has managed to still be around today in gaming is ridiculous.  And this entire game is a GRIND.  So expect very little story, and very little fun in the world of 3089.			"

												At first glance, the graphical presentation of gameplay video led me to believe this is another half-hearted indie game that hoped to make it on plastering code together beyond the technological understanding of the developer. Instead of judging it on that, the procedural generation took my curiosity and I headed to the forums. The developer was answering questions left and right and very calmly and non-defensively replying to those who expected graphics to triumph this title.This game has an essense I haven't felt since my first few nights of Minecraft Survival. There's so much out there, so much that is unknown, so many things to learn that are alien. The developer really has you immersed in the game by allowing you to figure certain tactics out on your own while being slightly guided through quests and game mechanics.This is quite a find in terms of up-front visuals and actual beneath-the-surface gaming. Don't that this title for the visuals, pick this title up to support a developer who's actually created some so deep and intimate to the gamer that wants to PLAY and not just SEE.			"

												An out-of-nowhere pleasant surprise from a super-small developer, this game is totally worth its asking price. Massive replayability in the vein of Minecraft or Delver, simple and intuitive controls making it easy to pick up and play, grappling hooks, teleportation, hoverboards, aircraft, stealth-robbery, stopping time, crafting, randomized l00tz, voxel-esque building and skill points. And the way the map works in-game is really freakin' awesome. I'm having a blast with the game and I haven't even made it out of the starting area yet. It is deserving of its cost and then some, because honestly, I've bought drinks that were more expensive, less memorable and nowhere near as satisfying as 3089.			"

Posted: February 8, 2014
												Hmmm...how to describe this game? It's like a sort of old school FPS game really where you have weapons and kill things, but you can also build, craft a little, recruit robots, fly ships, etc. Looking at it you see it is old school animation of course. This doesn't matter much. It fits and it allows for random generation of the worlds when you start a new game. So...if you don't like the look of your first world...just make another one. Really what makes this game unique is the depth of mechanics that you don't really see just at a glance. The beginning of the game seems a bit daunting at first because you are not really sure where to go, or what to do. You start with nothing basically as you, a robot, drop off a ship into a world filled with blue and red robots. Fortunately, the red robots are on your side! Red=Good, Blue=Bad. So...the first thing they tell you is to go to the Waypoint and start doing quests. Do this. You get to the waypoint and it is a building with several shops in it. You start with $1,500 and that is just enough to pretty much buy a weapon and maybe some armor to get going on with. Then you should immediatley go to the quest machine and start doing quests. This is basically how you learn how to play. Doing the quests and that forces you to venture out a little.An interesting point about the starting area, if you look on the map it will tell you that it is Level 1, but if you scroll in any direction further away the level of the area increases, and along with it the difficulty. So early on being a gung ho explorer with Level 1 garbage is a bad idea. You need to hang around the starter area a bit and beef up a little. It has RPG aspects where you do quests, earn skill points, and then assign them to the dozen or so skills that you have every time you complete a quest. No actual ""Level Up"", you just play for the skill points and money, and then can assign them. These skill points allow you to make better chips that give you bonuses when equipped, better stealth so you can creep up and kill with double damage, the ability to FLY SHIPS, the ability to recruit other Red Robots to fight along side with you, and several others. Eventually when you ae feeling brave you should go towards the Red ""X"" that is hovering out in the distance to fight a tough battle to progress the game a bit further. Not only does this allow you to move the ""Story"" along, but it unlocks the hatches, which also unlock, BUILDING. Yes, you can actually build your own bases, set up turrets, and many other things. IT is not necessary to do so, but adds a bit to the game. There are many building scattered throughout the world with shops and quests that you can see on the map. Almost all of the weapons can be broken into parts, or you can just buy parts, or find them in the world. Then you take them to a workbench and assemble them. This is nice when you have a couple really great parts and find another gun that has only one better part than you currently have on your weapon. You can disassemble both and put it back together with the best parts. You can actually get lost in this trying to make your weapon slightly better all the time. lol Armor has parts as well that can be mixed and matched. Microchips can be broken up and with a higher programming skill you can increase the value of them yourself. The weapons, armor, etc. are all random too. They start at LEvel 1 where you are and get better as you venture out. They have rarity percentage on them to give you a quick look at if they are better, but that percentage may not always mean better for you. Sometimes you want something with a higher +Guns boost on it rather than +Agility and the percentage doesn't matter to you. The weapons come in melee, pistols, rifles, etc. with all energy weapons being in the same classes.Oh yeah...I would be silly not to mention that this game has a shop listed as ""Special"" that sells hoverboards, grappling hooks, gravity guns, and decoy guns as well. They all do what you think they do!Basically, you just are in an open world where you can go out and kill stuff if you want, do some quests, collect. weapons and armor, and fulfill your dream of being a robot thief that steals from his other robot friends for no reason, save the Red Robot army with some fantasy of them being held down by the blue robots, or any other asinine fantasy you have...if you were a red robot. The graphics aren't the best, and if you don't venture out the game, but only keep doing easy Level 1 quests for too long it can become tedious, but overall it is a very interesting FPS game with a lot of mechanics that you discover while you play. The graphics seem to have some issues at times, but this can be overcome. Enemies from quests in rare instances can spawn in unreachable areas due to the randomness of it, BUT the game has a debug for quests that you can click on and it will respawn the destination to a place that is accessible. So no harm, no foul. The music in this game is quite awesome too I must say. It is very atomospheric and fits perfectly. It has a bit of a techno feel to it and is just a very calming and great soundtrack for the game. The developer is very active on the forum and takes suggestions and tries to make the game better as much as he can. So this game should have support for a good while. I would recommend checking out some videos of the gameplay to see if it is something you would like first, however. I think it is a very interesting game and worth a buy, but it is NOT a straight FPS action game of the new era. It is more old school so you should look into it a bit more than just reading a few reviews as they can't accurately show you the ""feel"" of the game like a video can. The game also has trading cards for you card addicts out there. 8 Total, with 4 drops. :P			"

												On paper, 3089 is an amazing game: An open world FPS/RPG with procedurally generated weapons, terrain, and quests. The implementation of it leaves much to be desired. It lacks good gunplay (you shoot like you're coming out of a Rainbow Six game, while the enemies shoot like Quake 3 aimbots, meaning you lack the time to get a good shot at them), good leveling mechanics (your skill in guns is completely irrelevant if you don't have a gun on the level of the enemies, your level of agility doesn't mean your grappling hook or teleporter gun can support that much weight), drops are pathetic (every enemy drops something, but it's usually an incomplete item, and items can only be completed at workstations back at base), shops aren't guaranteed to have, say, a level 5 grappling hook, so if your level 1 hook can't support your weight, you're just unable to use that mechanic, flat out, and the quests are completely and totally random. It's not even on the level of ""This one guy stole my book. Either talk him into handing over the book or kill him, then return it to me."" It's ""Get the disc from the person. Then, spy on this person for 1:32 without being seen. Then, kill 3 robots. Then, defuse a bomb without being seen or killing anyone. Then, remove some ghosts. Then, hand over the disc to this other person without being seen."" There's no attempt to make your actions seem worthwhile, to give them any context. Your only reward is a handful of skill points. There is no way to visually tell level 1 enemies from level 5 enemies, you simply have to infer it from how they're doing slightly under a third of your health with each of their perfectly accurate shots while you fumble around trying to shoot them at point-blank range with your wildly inaccurate weapon. If it's 3099 improves by the same amount that this did from 3079, then I could recommend that game, but ultimately, I can't 3089.			"

												The 4th game in the series, 3089 has the player take control of an experimental combat droid, placed amongst a perpetual war on the planet Xax that serves as a testing ground for your efforts.Gameplay involves traversing an open world, completing ""quests"" & challenges, getting into fights with enemy robots, collecting loot, and increasing skills. The world itself is procedurally generated, and the further from the starting point the player travels the higher in level enemies & items are. There are also no boundaries to the world map; as long as you can survive, you can keep travelling further out.Quests are randomly generated and are effectively infinite in number. Because your role is to test an experimental combat technology, the quests are very straight-forward and - occasionally - don't make sense. This isn't an issue as there aren't any real lives going on here. Completing set challenges will unlock new enemies; these challenges can be thought of as the main quest-line as they (usually) lead to an end-game scenario.The robots themselves (your character included) are assigned to either the red team or blue team. Your robot is assigned to the red team, and you'll start in a red base along with various other red robots and buildings. Other red robots can be befriended if the player's Prestige is high enough, with no limit on the number of followers you can have.Items are modular in design; all weapons & armours are built from segments that can be interchanged at a Workstation. This allows - for example - upgrading a ""favourite"" gun, building a better sword from 2 others that have good parts, or just simply replacing an existing rifle with a better one. There are also utility devices such as grappling hooks, telelocators (weapon-style teleporter), hoverboards, decoy generators, and building tools. Various things can be built, from a simple wall, to a teleporter.The player's character has various skills (including Agility, Energy, Stealth, Melee) which are increased by assigning points gained by completing quests, challenges, or clearing enemy towers. There is no limit to how high a skill may be, and if you so wish, every point can be added to a single skill. The skill-set is diverse enough to specialise as a sniper, commander, pilot, tank, sword-bot, etc., as well as developing a more balanced robot.Another ability the player has access to is ""time-ripping"". When this is turned on, the entire world stops except for you; even new projectiles you generate (from firing your gun) will remain stationary until time-ripping ceases. Grappling hooks will still function as normal though. The player's robot can store up to 15 seconds of time-rip; this can be replenished by collecting donut-shaped pick-ups scattered around the landscape.Pros:*Open world; virtually unlimited in size*No skill limits*Diverse abilities & items*AI is challenging*Game's source code can be altered for advanced modding*Playable on 8 year old laptopsCons:*Multi-play is limited to 2-player co-op*Main quest-line is very short			"

												If you're getting turned off by the graphics, you're going to miss out on a great game!Like most people, the first time I saw this game, my initial thoughts was - ""cute game... very retro, 1980s style but crap graphics by today's standards"". I doubted it was any good. I mean.. RPG? Sandbox free roam? With graphics like that? Gotta be kidding me! (yup, usual pre-conceived notions about a game just by ""first looks"").Beneath the ""blocky and pixellated graphics"" lies a free-roam world, where you can explore and try stuff on your own. You can follow the main quest, or not. You can take sidequests, or not. Beneath this simple blocky world lie a hidden world of depth and exploration. Crafting is very simple... you find stuff, put them together...You break apart stuff, you put other parts together and see what you get. The items are in very discrete units - body, handle, barrel etc etc... but the combinations you put together buffs or debuffs you. This is so unlike other usual more ""mainstream RPG"" where you have to find ""ingredients"" and ""materials"" to craft, for example. You waste a lot of time just getting 20 ores and 50 wood just to make that cool gun or armour, or 2 roses 3 leaves and 1 root to make that potion.The premise of the game is simple - you are a robot, dropped onto the planet Xax for a ""final evaluation"". Then, you are left on your own with only 1 suggestion - ""Do quests"". That's it. From here on it's up to you to follow the main quest or just do your own stuff.While this game might present itself as an ""FPS"", it is anything but. Imagine this as a blocky version of Borderlands, You can play it like an FPS but you'd get better mileage out of it if you play it as an RPG.And since this is a sandbox/free roam game... JUST EXPLORE! Try stuff! Go swimming! Jump off the tallest building you can find! See what happens! "

												3089 is an interesting concept and is fairly well executed with the exception that there could be more content. Basically, you're a robot thrown onto this alien world that is inhabited by only other robots. It's always Red vs Blue with you being on Red's side. You start with nothing and have to go buy your own guns and armor. You can also obtain parts by killing other robots or by stealing off of your teammates. This allows you to come up with different combinations that can increase your stats in different ways. One piece of armor might give you increased health, defense, and flying skills, while another can give you gun, melee, and agility. Another thing is the quest system. It allows you to pick your own quests from these stations in buildings. There are always 13 quests at one time, and they increase in level as you filter through them. The further out you go from the starting point also increases the level of the quest, but also the reward. You can earn credits and skill points through these. While the quests are pretty basic, e.g. go here and disarm this bomb, spy on this robot without being detected, and go kill these robots. The problem with this as thats about the extent of the quests.Aside from that there are the occasional bosses that show up on your map. They provide a substantial challenge and unless you have some other robots following you around, it can be almost impossible. There's also a building aspect to the game but it's pretty hard to understand. Sometimes you'll build a teleporter and it won't work. You can also build storage boxes to keep some of your things in.All in all though, I would say it's a fairly fun game to just play for a bit. It's nothing spectacular graphics wise, but it makes up for it by just being fun and interesting in general. I think the developer is working on a sequel, 4089 is what I believe it's called and I hope he'll expand on the already implemented ideas.			"

												First off, I want to make it clear that 3089 is NOTHING like Minecraft. Where 3089 lacks in visual esthetics, the game play is really captivating.3089 is a very unique RPG that can allow you to not only customize your character, but most (if not all) your gear and weapons as well. There are a bunch of cool abilities like teleportation, building, cloak, bullet time, vehicles, hover boards and grappling hooks. It makes the game extra fun to combine some of these abilities and tackle some missions or engage in a epic boss battle.The architecture and the planet of 3089 really reminds me of the classic Starsiege Tribes and that goes double for the construction system. As I started to toy around with the building tool, it felt like I was playing ""Construction Mod"" for Tribes 2. I don't want to keep comparing, but there are a lot of qualities of 3089 that reminds me of the Tribes Series. I'm an old Tribes vet so I absolutely love that familiarity. The planet XaX has a lot of different hazards such as lighting storms, rain and lakes that can cause corrosion, and an epic meteor shower that can kill almost anything. 3089 has a smooth transition of day and night thought the days don't seem to last long. I've put in 10 hours and from what I can tell, there is nothing significant of the day and night cycle unfortunately.3089 can be a little overwhelming at first but once you get familiar with the world, that's when the game blossoms.

												3089 is a fun game. If you like fps rpgs like borderlands and fallout 3/NV you should not have to much of a problem getting into 3089. In 3089 you are an android droped on to the mysterious and randomly generated planet Xax, You are one of the few androids with emotion codes giving you the ability to do quest and fight robot at your pleasure instead of taking commands from the Overlord.You start off in a friendly base where you can buy weapons, armor, consumables, and other forms of transportation, take quest, and recruit other androids for help and all of it is randomly generated. The weapons, armor and specials are all made on a parts system where you have say three parts to an energy pistol all with their own effect on you and your guns ability's. The amount of options this system gives you along with the normal rpg system of adding points to certain skills to better your self gives you a lot of flexibility in how you mold your android. If you want to be a pilot that fly's ships and shoots guns, go ahead. A stealth focused melee character that teleports and can turn invisible, fine. A commander that recruits androids to fight for you and steals all of his items, no problem. The gun play is serviceable and fun but does not have the most kick to it, but that does not mean the combat is lackluster because of all the ways to move in combat you have a lot of choice in how you fight a battle, you can use a grappling hook and hover bored in conjunction to get crazy height and speed and drop on an enemy with a sword. I have heard some criticism on the graphics and while they are not the best and even I someone that does not really care about graphics when looking at screen shots thought ""wow this does not look good"" am glad that I took the time to watch some videos on it first, but the graphics do grow on you and seeing as the game is made in java it should be very modible. Anyway a videoGAME is about game play, that is why they are not called videographics. Another complaint I have heard is that the character is slow and sluggish and this I find laughable either the person does not understand encumbrance and is carrying to much thus making them slow or they have not payed attention to the specials terminal where you can buy many items to increase your speed and maneuverability. So while there are a few problems like the graphics and the AI not being the brightest it is nowhere near enough to make this an un-enjoyable game. Seeing as it is made by only one person is pretty crazy, and the game is cheap being only 10 bucks at most, definitely recommend.			"

												The review by Multihawk explains it perfectly.This game looks and plays and is alot more challenging and fun than many other $20+ titles, ALOT MORE!!One of the top 3 game surprises. Unlike anything else but has best qualities of many others.Bang for buck its a no brainer... "

												I bought this game on a whim, and I'm pretty glad I did!This game is strange to say the least, but interesting! It's very unique and fun. Reminds me of a old school arcade game but with crafting, building, Quests, and bosses. Worth it's price for sure. With the few hours I have into it I can say I don't regret spending money on this particularly quirky game. If you don't care much about graphics and want to play a interesting new game, I would suggest this. Obviously not a AAA 10/10 game, but still fun for the avid or casual gamer.			"

												This is an amazing game, probably one of the best I've played. You can sit down for hours and enjoy leveling and questing and getting new gear but there are quite a few bugs, I've noticed that little to no workbenches are ever spawning and after about 20 minutes the game will seize up and I will go from getting 120 FPS to 24 and it freezes periodically. If these issues were fixed this would be an amazing title.I played 3079 and really enjoyed it and I feel like 3089 is a massive improvement, I personally love the new textures as compared to 3079's voxel style textures. Amazing game that you can easily dump 10 hours into			"

												This is actually quite fun. I've spent many enjoyable hours playing 3089 and 100% recommend it (even if it sounds like I don't!).Positives:The screen shots are far worse than the game graphics. I cranked it up to x16 AA and everything is crisp and clean on the edges. (Unlike the SS's) Quests keep you occupied. The ability to build stuff like a radar, skill buffer, and teleporter (more on the teleporter later). Your weight affects how well you can move. Hundreds of pounds over your max and you won't be sprinting but movement won't stop alltogether or even slow you down that much. BUT if you want to go fast with a hoverboard, the hoverboard will not move if you exceed it's weight limit.  Translocators shoot a sphere and warp to it's location grappling hooks shoot a line out and if it strikes an object you will be pulled up and gravity guns for moving stuff around like boxes all add to the game.It's fun building your weapon. Rifle has a stock.. barrel.. mag.. silencer.. scope. Stock determines number of shots. Single shot will be more accurate and powerful (per round typically) while increases in the number of rounds fired with each trigger pull (think shotgun) will decrease the damage of the individual rounds, as well as accuracy of the weapon. In addition there can be effects.. like a percentage of dmg translating into an explosion or rounds homing in on targets.Barrel determines base accuracy, range, damage and speed the round travels. Mag determines how often the weapon can fire, and how much ammo is consumed per shot. Silencer silences the weapon. You're less likely to be noticed. I haven't noticed a decrease in damage. As with any piece there can be additional stat buffs so less noise are more stats are always a good thing. The scope well.. duh.I play a sniper. I had a 220 range barrel but the accuracy and bullet speed were a bit low and swapped out for a 160 range with a 10% accuracy increase and almost double the speed. As you can see this single weapon had MANY options.The launcher's are just like they sound. Can be lob based, but also add additional effects like corosion (DoT) or Leech. Fire slower, fewer rounds before a reload and consume more ammo.Negatives:This is going to sound like I'm being picky.. and I am. These are things that just irritated me a bit.3 Types of guns. Period. Pistol, Rifle and Launcher. Each of those come in the normal ammo using version and the ""Energy"" version. I've never tried the pistols so won't be talking about them. The rifle vs launcher, i've tried them in both normal and energy versions. Energy seems to simply use your ""energy"" as a different kind of ammo. That will regenerate to 25% on it's own. You can recharge at a station or use items to boost it up to 100% (or higher if you equip an item with high energy, recharge, then remove it). Ex: I have over 1500% energy because I have a hoverboard that grants me ~360 energy. I've used items while on it to recharge it to 100% (while on the board). As soon as I get off the board I loose the 360 energy stat bonus but I keep the pool of energy. That said. I don't use energy weapons.Why not? I don't see a point. It seems to use a % of your energy per shot. So at 5 energy or 500 energy skill, each shot from that level 7 rifle will consume the percentage listed on the mag.  While there are many ways to build a weapon, there are really only 3 ranged. I'm trying to build a bit of a shotgun rifle for close quarters but the most i've found so far is 3 rounds. Keeping it non explosive so i don't damamge myself. These numbers may increase later but it just feels like i'm hammered into a specific type of weapon due to lack of variance in the earlier part of the game.Followers: Don't plan on doing any damage if you want an army following you. They will run around you, in front of you, and everywhere. They'll die to the daily meteor showers and screw up quests. It's a great concept and thats how I started out, till i realized i couldn't do anything at all as a ranged character with an Army. If a stray round hits one of your followers they'll ALL turn against you instantly.Building a base: You can construct walls. Cool! But when I tried to set up a base inside the blue base, it was a bit disappointing. I had my gear like boxes, teleporter, radar all setup way in the back. I had created a maze on the 3rd floor with low walls for fall back points if I had to retreat further in. Every other time I go on a quest though I return to a bunch of bots already set up shop all throughout the maze just wandering around. Turrets and all. The enemy has always ignored my structures.. and are more of a bother than anything significant.Quests:I can't stand the ""don't be detected"" type quests. I try to avoid them but every now and then one slips in. The ""kill"" without being detected by target isn't bad since i'm a sniper, but ""no additional detection"" and the ""spy"" ones where you have to sit there and watch or avoid all detection can be brutal.The World:Now, the fact that the world is generated each time is good.. and terrible. After my first ""leadership"" attempt the 2nd world I got was surrounded on all sides by an ocean. A good 300m straight down. I kept getting quests in the water. While you can go into the water.. it makes it far more difficult (at least in early stages) to deal with enemies that can come from any direction.. up.. down.. sides.. everywhere inbetween. Also, not a lot of cover in the middle of the ocean. Ever try protecting a bot? It's not easy. Now do that with zero cover and any direction of approach in a 3 dimensional plane. To get back again (this was before I had unlocked teleporters.. which.. charge money) was a 10 min swim to the nearest ledge that had a ramp.What i'm saying is, once you start a game, look at your map. You may be in for a really difficult challenge starting out.Other:Surveryors: Don't kill them unless you have a plan for dying a lot. They die EASY. At around level 6 area I decided to try my hand at them. I killed a few dozen and got some great gear, including a level 90 hoverboard. But for every one you kill, 2 more are sent to kill YOU. And they go up 10 levels every time they do. By the time they were up to level 110 I was dying WAY too much. They lock on at a long range and 1 shot me. So how do you get all those ones to stop coming after you? Each time you die to one, it despawns. You have to let each one kill you so that it despawns. Remember if you kill it, 2 more will spawn. (I'm pretty sure about the 2 spawning to kill you, I was kinda busy killing and looting to count each one. In the end I had to suffer around 12 deaths to make them stop attacking).Held items. They have stats yes. But they do not apply unless you have them selected. If you have a rilfe and dagger equipped but have the rifle out, the dagger's stats will not apply until you swap from the rifle to dagger. So don't load yourself down with a bunch of stat based weapons. I go with my primary weapon which uses ammo, and a backup that uses energy (in case I ever run out of ammo.. which.. hasn't happened yet).Wishes:I wish there were doors, or something to prevent things from simply spawning wherever they want. I wish turrets you placed were not temporary. What's the point of gathering all the materals to defend your base if the enemy can simply spawn inside  and your turrets just go ""poof"" over time? I wish there were some other options for rifles to make them more like a shotgun or sniper instead of a middle of the road rifle. I wish grapplers, translocators and hoverboards held WAY more than each level currently allows. I'm always over what they can handle in the level range i'm questing. I've accepted that fact since i'm a sniper/tank type with high agility. I can run crazy fast, carry a bunch etc.. but i'm not going to be able to translocate across a gap, or grapple my way up a cliff. Edit: Spelling :P			"

												I picked up this game yesterday, heading into the experience without any previous time playing Phr00t's other game(s), and this how I feel, concerning graphics:While I understand that people are entitled to their opinions, I'm getting fairly frustrated with the back-and-forth I've seen on the forums (just in the past few days, since finding this title). While I am not at all new to the steam forums, the level of aggression about the graphics really perked my interest in trying this 'Crappy-looking polygonal game', if only to see for myself. After all, it gets old hearing people who believe they are speaking for the entire gaming community, when they are really only repeating the same comments on many indie discussion boards-> graphics suck (which may simply be to the artistic vision of the game), too expensive (Less than a pack of cigarettes in many states), Lots of bugs (let us not think on how many brand new AAA release titles are patched heavily on the first few days, and they have massive teams of coders, devs, and so on), etc. Steeling myself against my own initial misgivings about the game, I hesitantly opened my wallet, and spent less than an hour's worth of minimum wage work, for a functional game. Think about that for a moment...Technically, you, as an individual, are paying the lone developer less than minimum wage for all his work- However many hours that was spent producing this game, and the individual pays seven whole smackers. Phr00t sure pulled one over on us, huh? ...Now then, moving on.Stop the presses. The gameplay is actually really well done! While the older-style graphics may be a distraction, I was mainly interested in the deeper aspects of the game itself, and soon found myself overlooking any graphical shortcomings without complaint. I will state this, rather flatly at that:If you are looking for Modern Warfare type games, you're barking up the wrong tree. Those games exist already, so you may find your time better spent there.Speaking only for myself, I find the retro graphics really endearing, reminding me of many games I played in the past as a kid (The original Starfox on the SNES, for example). They 'fit' the word well, and while I'd LOVE to see modern graphics on something like this, it is easily played and enjoyed as is. We'll see how things move along, and how the community develops.TL;DR- The graphics are basic, yet functional. There is room for improvement, either by the dev or by the individual (See: Minecraft texture packs / High-Res packs). If you feel that you cannot get past the graphics, move on to another title. If you can still use the innate human ability for minimal imagination and suspension of disbelief, you might really find that you enjoy it.			"

												This is the game I've been waiting to play, and I never even realized it until I started playing. Procedural generation... with constant renewal. Yeah, that's right, enemies keep respawning, as do boxes and missions and pretty much everything, which means there's always more stuff to do, even in the earlier portions of the game. You can craft weapons and gear. You can build the landscape (and not just in cubic meter blocks!). You can kill robots, run missions, fly ships. Do whatever. It's cool. Turning your character into a tank is as easy as going stealth assassin. My point is, if this game bores you, it's probably because of the way you're playing. Some have commented on the learning curve. Honestly, I'm not seeing it as that bad at all. Difficulty increases the further you leave the starting base, and every quest you complete gives you skill points. If ""out there"" seems too hard, just run some more lower-level quests until you're as strong as you need to be. It doesn't have the visual polish of games like Borderlands or Skyrim, but it's got a nice pre-N64 charm regardless. And besides, it's $10 for a game made by one guy. For everything you get here, complaining about the graphics is just kind of greedy.			"

												(NB: I've had this game since before it was on Steam)Let's get this over first, the graphics are appropriate and fitting to the game's purpose. Yes, they are not the best graphics in the world.. it's not a Crysis engine game etc etc etc..  I actually quite like the graphics to be perfectly honest.The game is a first person shooter with a story that runs throughout but does not force you to play a certain way to achieve storyline progression. Sure, there are bosses to beat in combat but how you defeat the bosses is completely up to you. It's a freeform game and you may choose to never actually play the storyline sections of the game at all. There are quests, there are skills that you choose to upgrade individually to suit your playstyle, there are multiple weapon and armor types with randomly generated stats that you can use to upgrade your character suit your playstyle, you can even break down the weapons and armors into components that you can combine with other components to suit your needs etcThe music is great too and very fitting. All in all, it's a great indie developed game that is well worth your time and attention. If you can look past the graphics, which again aren't all that terrible, and realise that some gameplay footage and screenshots can't ever do any game justice... look past them enough to try the demo.. you might find a great game, overflowing with old-school gameplay mechanics, hiding away within this game.

												Full post: http://www.cublikefoot.com/video/3089-first-impressions/3089, a futuristic, open-world action RPG. Everything in the game is randomly generated. This includes terrain, weapons, quests, enemies, items, etc.I had absolutely no idea what I was doing for a solid amount of time when I first tried the game, it was very, very confusing. I kind of figured out what to do after 30 or so minutes, after buying my first weapon. I then proceeded to pickpocket and kill all of the NPCs I could find and, for the most part, did a pretty good job at it. I could tell the terrain was randomly generated, as it was ridiculous how high some of the cliffs in the game could be, especially when there's a house hanging over the edge. The game has some rather low-res graphics, but it feels strangely fitting to the game's atmosphere. There's so many things to do in 3089. I spent most of my time looting and killing all of the robot NPCs around, dying a couple of times in the process, but ultimately having a good time whilst doing so. 3089 has plenty of replayability, and I give it my recommendation!

												After 6 hours of gameplay, I'm still finding new game features.  You can customize your character, your weapons, your strategy... your entire gaming experience.  That may sound cumbersome, but the customization is actually very fluid and intuitive.  The story is a bit weak in the beginning, but it's getting more interesting.  The story advances a little bit every time you track down and defeat a boss.  Boss battles aren't easy, so you need to train and level-up a bit beforehand.The quest system is pretty lame, though.  Quests are randomly generated; they have no story; they don't effect the larger game world in any meaningful way.  Quests just give you skill points to improve your character.  Some people will compare this game to Borderlands, which is fair up to a point.  However, Borderlands goes far beyond this game in terms of character customization, special abilities, cool features, etc.I bought this game for $7, and it was worth it. "

												Give this game a shot based on the gameplay it offers rather than the graphical presentation. Personally, I enjoy the simple graphics as it adds a somewhat nostalgic feel to the game's environment. Also, all graphical elements are moddable through the .jar file and the ease of modding the game is highly encouraged by the game's developer.Gameplay OverviewIt combines the addictiveness of Diablo/Borderlands' weapon and armor randomization with the procedurally generated terrain such as in Minecraft and achieves it very successfully. In addition, you can break and combine parts of armor and weapons. Yes, there are grappling hooks, gravity guns, and teleportation devices. As well as decoy guns, turrets, and other interesting devices. The limitless terrain is awesome and lets you take any path you wish for as long as you want. You can choose to just explore at your own will or take upon randomized quests with varying lengths and failure conditions. There are randomly generated battles between robots (NPCs), ""dungeons"", terrestrial anomalies, biomes, weather and it all flows really smoothly. You will find very quickly that enemies will shred you apart if you do not make good use of cover and later on, if you neglect defensive stats (stealth or armor/hp). The enemies provide the right amount of challenge while not being too ridiculously powerful or weak.Death penalty is currently losing one random item in your inventory, equipped or not. So don't yolo without keeping a storage of important items (requires a building tool, unlocked during the story quests).Make sure you find all the ""back-up"" nodes inside buildings and save at a location where you'll be spending alot of time at. You do not want to painstakingly go all the way back to where you were from the starting location.CustomizationYou might not see or think much any level of character customization until you open up your character stats then it hits you like a truck. There are plenty of ways to build your character in terms of gameplay style (of course you can mix and match all of these as you wish...or just master them all): recruiting masses of robotsguns (pistols, rifles, launchers) (Energy and ballistic)melee (sword and dagger)stealthpiloting aircraftpickpocketting (!)There are also improvable supplementary stats such as consumable efficiency, reprogramming chip equipment and the standard health, armor, energy.Weapons can come with a plethora of effects such as a corrosion effect (damage over time), homing, explosive radius, shot speed, shot distance, varying ammo consumpion, ammo per reload, stat boosts and more.Most of your additional stats will come from armor, as well as protection from radiation.Also, hoverboards. ReBoot ANYONE?StorySuper-short summary: You are a test subject robot dropped into a world to see if ""emotion"" is capable of overcoming regular robot odds.The story fits quite nicely with the theme of the game and serves as a great guiding tool for those less inclined to randomly stroll about the world with no direct feedback. You will need to advance a bit into the story to gain access to one of the more interesting features of this game: the building tool.Be careful about advancing through the story too quickly, you may find yourself in the middle of a big...surprise.MultiplayerCurrently the game supports two player co-op which I have yet to try. You may have to open port 3089 on your firewall and/or router. Games hosted will be announced on the dev's twitter if public is set to on.			"

												Interesting gameplay, lots of fun to be had. Once you grasp the basics of combat and stats its easy to get the upperhand on enemies. If you can get over the simple graphics and the looping soundtrack, there is a fun game here. Hope that they improve the graphics interface for inventory and gun parts management, its confusing sometimes when all the parts look the same.			"

												I was expecting a sci-fi minecraft but with more focus on quests and I wasn't too far off with that guess. Everything in the game is craftable, the combat is fun, and fast. The visuals while maybe not stunning in the classic sense are really rather fun and it creates a unique and interesting to world to explore. The skill system seems like a nice idea but so far I have only found a few skills that really seem to change gameplay. If you want an open ended sci-fi quest game with unique visuals, simple crafting and a great way of sucking away the hours, go for this!			"

												This game has some interesting sounds.   Some people complain about the graphics, but I think they are actually kind of fun.  It has a unique atmosphere.   It is being developed by a single person.   I would like to see more multiplayer.   Right now I think you can multiplay as a bigger robot, bit I look forward to running around in this with friends and family rather than just as Co-op.   Even so, it is pretty unique and interesting.			"

												This is a game that really surprised me. At first glance I didn't really think much of it, and to be fair it is not much to look at. However, the gameplay is actually quite entertaining. Some of the more pronounced strengths of the game to me, in no particualr order, is:1: The randomly generated world. It creates diversity, and the terrain generator is quite capable of creating interesting terrain.2: The loot comes in parts than can be picked apart and reassembled at workstations, making you at least somewhat interested in what you pick up. It could use a little bit more weapon type variety though, especially in the melee department.3: The Time Rip ability. When you wander the world, there are little clocks to collect that spawn all over the place. It fills up a meter you can use to stop time for at max 15 seconds. I don't think I have to say how useful this is if something goes wrong.4: As you advance in the main quest, more enemy variety is introduced, which helps keep up the interest. And you do indeed notice the difference...5: Unlimited skillpoints. The quests from quest stations are randomly generated and provide skillpoints, so you are allowed to waste points in stats that don't promote your ability to fight.6: And lastly, the special weapons category. Hoverboards, grappling hooks, blink tech, decoys. ect. It really makes it more fun to move about, which is a huge plus! Especially when a meteor shower starts and you have to rush to a place with a roof. Tip: If one player has a hoverboard, the other player can request to be a gunner, combining the two players so that both can make use of the hoverboard. It's hilarious.All in all, I was really surpised I liked it as much as I did, and even the graphics have really grown on me. I am looking forward to what other things this game has in store for me. Fingers crossed for more weapon variety and some more special items!			"

												This is a wonderful game. Where did this come from? This is one man's labour of love. There are so many great ideas in this game. Woefully underrated. Pick sides in a robot civil war. There is an interesting story with multiple endings but the fun of the game is in exploring the world. A world is generated at random at the start of the game, full of buildings, bases, shops, and populated with two sides in a huge conflict between robots. Red vs Blue. The further out from the center you go, the more difficult it gets, and the better loot you get. It plays kind of like Borderlands mixed with Minecraft mixed with a roguelike. There are lots of ways to get around, you can fly around in aircraft, you can surf on a hoverboard, there is a teleporter system as well, and a teleportation gun. The missions are all randomly generated, a lot of the time they don't make a lot of sense, like planting a bug on an enemy only to immediately murder him, but I found it fun. Maybe you're killing an enemy to get an item, fighting a leader, spying, planting bugs, talking to people. dropping stuff off, doing escort missions, and it's all randomly shuffled around, with the high level missions requring you to do 5 or 6 of these. You are rewarded with points to spend upgrading your character, there are a lot of different options depending on how you want to build your character. You can go melee, or put it into guns, or prestige to allow you to recruit a little army, or piloting for aircraft, hp, carrying capacity, etc. You can also build your own buildings, add storage boxes, make teleporters, build airships. And everything just comes together in this beautiful way. It's extremely addicting. The reviews turned me off this game, but they were very wrong. This game is charming and wonderful. One of the best open world games I've played in quite a while. There's also a lot of good support from the developer, almost too much support, he responds to almost everybody, and he even commented on one of the bad reviews, explaining the reasons behind his decisions. A lot of love went into this game and it shows. Stunning, truly amazing. I can't wait for 5089.Incidentally, I played a bit of 4089 but I didn't like it much, it was punishingly difficult, I just died and died over and over and each time I died my character got weaker. It looks interesting too, but it's a dungeon crawler rather than an open world game. Maybe I'll get into it later, but for now, I say go with 3089, it's great. You'll thank me later.			"

												I bought 3089 a couple of weeks ago from the developer's page. I've really liked it! Everything is procedurally-generated and there's plenty of variety to the terrain, quests, etc. The gunplay feels really responsive, intuitive, and exciting. It has a great atmosphere, with the music meshing really well with its particular retro-spacey graphics style. I like how you can mix-and-match the parts to your guns. You can keep progressing for a lonnng time and still have fun. I think it's a really well-made indie game!			"

												There is a lot of good gameplay in this game. Nevermind the retro graphics, they complement the gameplay well. Even if you don't like them much you'll get used to them pretty fast and you'll be having so much fun they won't matter anyway. Pros: Tons of furious actions, character growth, easy and interesting crafting, bunched of short quests that fit every playstyle. Pick your own pace and do what you please, no need to hurry. Fair and easy to recover death penalty, but you won't die much if you gear up, skill up before moving into a more difficult area. Buy it, buy it, buy it!!!!			"

												Love it! I played 3079 and this is so much better for various reasons. The guides are quite simple and easy to understand, the quests make sense and have different difficulty levels, and there are so many item drops (you can find them everywhere). Didn't look at the guide for the crafting section (probably should have), but soon figured it out once I looked through the shops items. Really like how you can seperate the parts and put different ones with different stats in there. Simplistic graphics but still has a good feel to it. Another plus....no fall damage! You can run around and jump off anything with no worries. Sucks when you die because you lose an item (or a part of an item). Leveling system is super easy and seems like you can get an unlimited number of stat points (even though I'm sure there's a cap). I advise having both a gun and a melee weapon becuase the enemies are a little fast. Well worth the money! After you advance through the game a bit, new things are added to make it much more difficult.			"

												Although it pains me to say this, I can't at this time recomend this game. It's over shadowed by many game breaking problems that bring me out of the good points. I'll say it simply:Cons:-The combat systems feels like it is over thinking itself. The game's floaty space mechanics allow for a fun fast shooter, but it encourages you to take cover by having overly accurate AI who sometimes have homing projectiles. Even when you do make it to cover you will often find yourself being bombarded by enemies in space ships.-the stealth system is an interesting attempt in a game like this, but the seemingly random AI of the mobs make it unsatisfying and unintuitive.-The quests are repetitive and not very rewarding. -Although it is teaming with robots, the world seems sparse, and it is easy to wander off into the distance to find nothing interesting and get instantly killed by a ton of robots. Pros:-combat related: The time manipulation and innacuracy of the guns makes combat very satisfying once mastered.-Recruiting mobs to fight for you is made taking out bosses incredibly satisfying, and really gave an advantage to every fight. -The stats system was fairly robust for an action rpg, and the integration of random drop items really gave it a borderlands feel.Overall I do not recommend this game unless you are simply looking for a fun way to kill time without much in return. I see a lot of possibility in future updates.			"

												I've had this game for one night and I must say, I am amazed. Kudos to the dev.When you play this game, you are entering a world of simple, yet easy on the eyes, graphics. This game is highly affordable and easy to run. I have almost 100 games and none are quite like this.The controls are simple, there is a tutorial, and it throws you into combat right away. With a custom item set, no 2 weapons are the same (unless you make them the same with crafting). There are boss fights, ariel dogfights, largescale gun fights, all kinds of action. The difficulty increases the farther you get from the center, so you can progress at your own pace. On top of that, there are swords and daggers and they have a lunge ability to balance out the firefights.I strongly recommend this game for a very unique and fun expirience.			"

												I only played the demo for 3079 (the prequel) and I must say, 3089 is stellar. It's addicting, fun, attractive, and the replay value is through the roof. The game itself looks pretty beautiful. I went into the game thinking it was randomly generated every time you play, which, is not the case. But this didn't take away from the fun at all, in my opinion. The story is lackluster, but this is one of those games where story doesn't really matter to have a great time. 8/10 is my final verdict.Edit: I have just found out that if you change your name, the game world generates differently. Final verdict: 8.5/10.Edit 2: I just beat the game, 10 hours in. Despite the fact that 10 hours is a pretty decent playtime, this games story is UNBELIEVABLY short. I kind of felt cheated, actually. Almost all of the 10 hours was me durping around and level grinding. The story however...maybe 3-4 hours? Hard to say since I wasn't really keeping track of the missions. Still recommended though.

												Has an initial learning curve with the combat difficulty being quite high. You will die alot if this is your first time playing 3089.  People will complain about the graphics but hey, its voxel...what are you expecting.  I found the game enjoyable if quite difficult. Melee is definately more fun than shooting as you can lock on your enemy and do a charing attack.  Gameplay comes down to completing quests to earn skill points and then later assigning those sp's to skills.  For 8 bucks you cant go wrong with a game that will play on any pc just fine and give hours of enjoyment. The developer is just one guy with some help from artists and such for publicity.  The music is very immersive for a futuristic setting with the female singer adding a lovely melody to the exploration track.			"

												I'm not going to bash the game in general, there's a lot there to enjoy. Going into the game, however, It is very slow paced. There's a lot of great slower paced games out there, but if you are the fast paced, insane action kind of guy who gets his fix being able to blast gigantic waves of enemies into beautiful smithereens, this may not be the game for you. If you can enjoy slowly working towards your goals, go for this. The best way to put things in perspective would be to say that I had an extremely hard time playing Fallout 3 as well, so if you liked Fallout 3 (which I also found slow) or games with a similar feel, this game definitely has the potential to be a lot of fun.

												What is this otherworldly, obscure and weird game about? What's up with that title anyway?This is something I asked myself at first when I took a glance at the storepage of 3089. At first I was pretty pessimistic but then it piqued my interest because the premise just seemed extremely compelling to me. But that is coming from a person who genuinely enjoys elusive and perhaps unconventional games.In 3089 you play the role as an android trapped on a planet which finds itself in a eternal war between two robot faction. You automatically ally with one of them and start doing quests for them. This game has an absolutely boring standard rpg formula to it. You fulfill generic and randomly generated quests in a procedurally generated world. Your character gains experience and loot over the course of the game which allows him to become stronger. What really sets this game apart for me is the visual aesthetics and audio, it has a very mysterious feeling to it. Furthermore you can find a lot of unique weapons and have to craft them. This game has a crafting system and also some special abilities for your character. The player can also control space crafts and delve into the eternal warfare while during quests.It's a pretty open sandbox game where you basically just fulfill quests on a random map where the AI dukes it out. The shooting is a bit unusual and needs some improvement but it's solid enough. There is not much variety in the gameplay itself but still it's nice to play the game from time to time and see what it has in store for you.I cannot fully recommend it but only for those who just like those oddball gems in the steam store. It's really interesting and quite enjoyable.			"

												I played more than 0.3 hours on the non-Steam version.It's not really finished. The dev seems to have gotten bored with it, called it a final release and moved onto something else. I was hoping it would improve but it never really did beyond a few tweaks. I foolishly assumed that the assests were placeholders and would eventually be replaced by something better. I'm not talking realistic as I can appreciate simple, attractive design. This looks like temporary dev art. It lacks the depth it promises. 3089 could have turned into something more interesting but the dev gave up.4089 looks better but I won't be putting any money towards it. I'm afraid the dev will get bored with that as well and leave it half finished.Pros: Had potential.Cons: That potential will never be realised.			"

												I found this to be a fun Sandbox game that you can go through at your own pace. Challange yourself as much or as little as you want. Quest, Explore, Follow the Story Line - it's up to you.Build skill points and equip yourself any way you want. Find weapon / armor / computer components and build them the way you want. Reprogram computer chip / board components.  Experiment with different playstyles as well. Change your mind and rebuild a different playstyle direction.Follow the story or ignore it completely if you prefer. Finish the story and keep playing if you wish. Eventually become ""uber"" in all playstyle builds then go to an area that is too ""uber"" for you.PRO's:Flexible game. Choose your playstyle(s) - play em all if you wish. Choose your quests based on your build / equipment strengths and weaknesses. Choose your level of challange by exploring harder or easier locations. CON's:Quest grinding can feel a little redundant after you have explored all the quest task ""playstyles"". You can always up the challenge level but what you are doing is still the same thing. NOTE: the developer has stated he plans to add more questing options.			"

												This game feels like its weapon customization feature: it took the things I most loved on a videogame (procedurally-generated open world; weapon and item customization; base-building; vehicles) and put them together, making something that may not look very pretty, but it doesn't need to, as it already serves it's purpose very well.After beating it's campaign, I must confess I expected it to be something that would make me explore (even) more the infinite world, but who needs more story when you can make your own? Even better: Why can't I make a story with a friend? What stops us from making an hoverboard race shooting some blue bots along the way? What stops us from scaling a mountain with a grappling hook? What stops us from racing to the top of the mountain, implusing ourselves up with grappling hooks (so awesome on singleplayer)? (Unfortunately its online component didn't work for me, so I was only able to do this on SP :P), but on all cases, I assure you as what you can call, someone who plays LOTS of videogames, that this is a very good game that should not be overlooked because of its graphical presentation.

												Quite the amazing sequel to the already amazing 3079. Some great improvements really make this game shine.With procedurally generated content like crazy you'll never get bored with this game. The quest system is really great, the combat has vastly imrpoved over 3079, and with the new features it brings it really can't be beat. The multiplayer is a blast and with the added co-op combination mechanic it's like driving a vehicle together. The new sword lunge is my personal new favorite mechanic as it makes swords a weapon to be feared. Best of all you can lunge up at flying units!It's not all improvements however. With the loss of the block based voxel terrain we've lost out on destructable terrain and a few other minor features. Over all it's more than worth it to lose out on some features for the whole slew of new features and improved systems.Honestly my biggest gripe with the game is how much worse it looks than the block based worlds. The blocks are much more timeless than the look of these crude polygons. It makes for much more interesting and varied gameplay though, so again it's worth it.			"

												Rather nice game, if you can handle the graphics. Gameplay is rather limited, but it probably can be changed upon in the next few updates. Looking forward to the next installment and what that would bring to the table.			"

												Not really a full recommendation, but I can't give it a negative review because it doesn't do anything wrong.  If one can get past the primitive graphics, the mechanics in this open-world RPG are pretty spot on.  If reckless, the world outside can easily get you killed, but if careful, you'll probably still be killed, so it's definitely challenging.  The weapon upgrade system feels rewarding and the progress of leveling is satisfying.For those that enjoy RPG's and quirky indie games, this is a solid game to definitely try out.			"

												- The RPG side is limited to acquiring random weapons of higher stats. Your character earns three points each level, however this is ridiculous compared to the dozen of points a gadget adds to your stats.- Weapons are composed of three elements, but same level elements have the same stats given or taken some points.- Combat is a drag. NPC movements are random and quick and bullets travel slowly, to compensate the impossibility to aim properly, you can slow down time. However flying NPC are always too far and move before the bullet reaches them.- Explosions hid enemy NPCs during combat, obviously enemy NPC can see and shoot you through the smoke.- Gathering followers to fight enemy NPCs is fun the first time. You lose all your followers loading a savegame.- Landscape is formed by flat surfaces connected at 30Â°, 45Â°, or 90Â°. You can climb any surface but the vertical ones. Landscape is terrible.- Weapons, armor, ammunition, energy, life, repair, they all have their own station. These stations are scattered all over the place. You'll spend half your time looking and running from a station to the other.- Ghosts appear and disappear, move on a zigzag pattern and a general nuisance. - Swawa3D improved the textures, and the UI now looks like something useful.- The story is forgettable.- Though missions are generated randomly, they become fairly repetitive quickly.The developer put many good ideas into this game to make it more interesting, I had fun while discovering how the game works, this game would have been a classic 20 years ago. However the simplistic game mechanics, the bare environment, the lack of a decent AI and the shallowness of the plot prevent me to play this game again.			"

												One of the best randomly generated games I've ever played. I had lowered my expectations to be honest and they would've been blown out of the water regardless. The gunplay is a bit tricky to get a grip on, but very fun. Has companions, quests, weapon/armor crafting, and piloting! got it 3 days ago, already clocked in 12 hours!			"

												This game isnt good for its amazing graphics or for the ememies that dont miss. Its a good game becasue it has a lot of great features. For one, you can design your weapons how you want them and also design a base to call home. When progressing through the story, new ememies are unlocked and become a common fight in your world that is unique to YOU. I definatly recommend this game expecially to those that dont have max settings and quad cores ect...The main downside is that multiplayer doenst seem to work... my brother and I tried about 30 times to try to get it to work but we had no luck. So if you want a game with a decent single player than this is the game for you.			"

												3089 Is a FPS with mixxed RPG elements in a randomly generated open world. You Collect Gear and weapons, manage your inventory, heath and energy. Your main objective is to impress the overlord into thinking your a model worthy of mass production. In your journey you are aided by underground Organic Brains that are plotting to retake the surface through manipulating you. The controlls are standard for many fps / rpg players, wasd left / right mouse. Graphics are colorful and well eneuph not to take from the experience. No notable errors or tears.Game is very stable in both single player and Co-op play. Gameplay is simple but fun. You have a indicator to let you know how close to or if you are discovered by the enemy. Once an enemy detects you they go strait for you and randomly strafe while firing on you. Enemy are on land in are and by sea. They can follow you for a very long time if they maintain sight, or they lose interest quickly if you duck behind cover. There is some vehicles like hover boards and planes. An rpg system that caters to the players skill level. Skill points as quest rewards with several different skills to choose from. Melee and Range weapon combat. If you're having a hard time progressing just do a few quests in a lower level area. It punishes you for dying and rewards you very well for your efforts. Dying removes a random item from your inventory. There is a plot that sets the game and gives you an idea of whats going on. The story quests lead you through the games progression which ended for me when i was gear level 25. I killed the story mobs in 2 hits at this point. The game claims to have multiple endings, the 2 endings i know of left me feeling like there was no arc, pinnacle or final boss to overcome. All things considered, The enjoyment and Value is definitly there.9 out of 10.			"

												I was really bored of all the modern games, so I decided to try this one. It is a really good game and it is worth its price. I really enjoy playing this game. It feels like a mixture of Duke Nukem 3D, Fallout and Halo: Combat Evolved. It works perfectly on every PC. There are some small bugs in the game but you probably won't even notice them. It is funny that all the npcs have really generic names like John, Tyler, Maria. I haven't played the previous games but I'm sure that I'll buy 3099 if it will come out. If you are really bored of all the Battlefields, Call of Duties or Halos then you should play this game.			"

												Remember that game that emerged into fame when some Lets players' started playing it? Yea I do too. 3079 was pretty great but I have to say, I don't think I could go back after playing this. It is seriously addictive, I have only been playing for a while but I am already immersed in it. I was a bit disapointed by the lack of  super OP grapple hook at first.. that is.. until I got the hover board. I figured the hover board was equivalent to the jetpack; nope! It is actually pretty awesome. You go really fast but bad but get bad handleing as if you are on ice, yet if you use it in conjuction with the grapple hook you can attain those awesome heights just in the 3079.  I have to say the gunplay and melee is also a lot better this time around and the crafting system works surprisingly well. For merely a cent shy of ten dollars (apparently temporary?) I'd say you should get it. Hell, even if it goes up a bit you should still get it if only at least to try it out.			"

												Absolutely love it. :) My main character is a melee fighter, heavily based around his teleporter, that has gone through quite alot, tho he hasn't gotten further than difficulty 10. He mostly stays where he is at, primarily cause the Xax Ghosts still scare theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥outta me. :) I love the game, especially the fact that it is procedurally generated, since proceduraally generated open world games are the stuff that I look for to play. It has an interesting story, if a tad vague, and a tad hard to figure out how to progress in, but it's cool anyway. I looked into 4089, but I prefer the open world RPG style. I'd like to see the dev make a story based OW game.Oh, yes, and if you're looking for assistance, Phroot, I can help you out with some things!			"

												Gave the demo a try and was intrigued by what I played. Snatched it up and was surprised with the potential of the game. After two hours I'm finally going to delve into the ""building"" gameplay but I'm very satisfied with the combat and variety of items. The parts system is genius and even more fun than buying better weapons; assemble your own!EDIT: Try out the demo here: http://3089game.wordpress.com/demo/EDIT 2: While this game has a lot of potential, it is essentially a grindfest with a story wrapping the experience. I also have a few ""dealbreakers"" to add (from my perspective).There are balance changes that are either pending or need to be considered such as the usefulness of vehicles (they don't really do damage, don't bother being a pilot at the moment) and the frustration induced by a gang of 3+ bots all with stun launchers that leave you crying helplessly as you watch your character inevitably die (you can't turn, attack, or use items from what I experienced, regardless of level since there is no ""stun resist"") and lose a piece of your equipment.I wanted to like this game, but with one developer it'll be a bit more time before it's balanced enough to make me want to play again. That stun-lock was really discouraging and is a huge turn-off (sorry, Phroot).Feel free to pick this game up, though! It still has its merits and is something I'm still proud to own. Quite a feat for an indie game that relies on procedural generation. Good luck in the future, Phroot. You've got the idea, keep running with it!			"

												If you like RPGs (such as Fallout 3 or New Vegas, also possibly The Elder Scrolls and Borderlands), buy this game. The graphics are a little on the ""meh"" side, but the gameplay and soundtrack are both phenominal. The story is interesting, revolving around an experimental algorithm that gives robots emotions and a never-ending war on the planet XaX. Combine that with a randomly generated world that never ends, a variety of side quests, a large amount of enemies to fight, a good crafting system, and LAZORLEGS, you have a fantastic game that shouldn't be missed by any fan of the genre.Like another review said, bonus points for friendly developer. Every update to this game has brought good changes so far, and I still recommend it to any RPG fan. Do NOT let the aforementioned ""meh""-ish graphics (though they have received some improvement) deter you from buying this game.9.5/10 from me, and I only took 0.5 off because I personally find XaX Spirits (enemy from the game) a bit annoying to fight at times.

												3089 is one of the best games I've seen developed by a single person. It puts you straight into a planet where there's a war going on between the red and the blues, you an android who has to escape the planet must assist the red where you'll get enough weapons to eventually kill all the bosses and escape the planet.PROS;- It's a fun, addictive but underrated game.- It's open world- It's randomly generated- It can run on low performence computers- It's fairly cheap- There's always a battle going on, meaing always action going on for you- There is a large variety of quests- There's a large amount of gadgets- There are something similar to bosses- You can capture land for the red team- Enemies get harder as your progress and harder enemies come into play- There's a skill system- You can fly a plane- You can even recruit red people to attack blue with you!- You can craft different pieces of armour, weapons together for different effects.CONS;-Tons of deaths- Bad graphicsGet the game, this game and the SERIES is amazing.

												Oh hell yeah!Don't let the dated graphics fool you, 3089 is an awesome game.It may seem shallow on the surface, but if you give it a little bit of your time to test it out, the next thing you know several hours will have passed.So run around for a bit, blow some stuff up, and get some of the crazy loot.Just be careful out there on Xax.The enemies might border on being stupid, but their aim is deadly as hell.Charge up your energy rifle and watch those little blue robots melt.Sword dash ***through the air*** and pummel flying gunships up close and personal.Take a mad dash across the country-side on a speedy little HOVERBOARD! (I've wanted one of those since the first time I saw Back to the Future 2!!!)Grappling hooks, grenade launchers, pistols, daggers, your own pet robots that follow you around, sniper rifles, armor, pilotable aircraft...This game has a ton of things to see and do to keep you entertained for hours.And nearly every last iota of it is procedurally generated.As far as I can tell the starting area's building layout is always the same, but everything inside of it, just like the rest of the world, is randomly generated as you go along.The world never ends, but the further you travel from the start point, the more difficult the enemies become.Quests will reward you with the currency used in the game, and while it's easy enough to save up those credits, you can burn through them real fast.Quests willl also give you the skill points you'll need to allocate to all your different stats.That is a big bonus.When you first land on Xax, the quests will offer you 3 to 5 points each for you stats, but the further out you go, the more dangerous the enemies and quests become, and the greater those stat point rewards get.Move out far enough, and eventually all those little guys that scared you silly at the start will seem as insignificant as gnats, making it a very safe place to head back to and relax for a bit.Weapons can be bought (or looted from the corpses of your enemies) preconstructed or in parts and each part has a range of stats and attributes that effect the weapon itself and/or buff your character.Those parts can be mixed and matched at any workbench to make your own ultimate weapons.On top of all that, if you find the parts and have enough resources you can even start constructing your own buildings, fortresses, and defenses.Want to build your own castle? Why not, go for it.How about constructing a bunch of turrets to make a defensive perimeter while you're at it too.Seriously, just stop reading this now.If you can afford it, buy the game, try it out.Unless you have a very strong disdain for stat and loot grinding or dated graphics, you'll probably have more fun with it than you expect.

												This game is one of the best examples that gameplay is more important than triple A graphics. While it may look odd and somewhat repulsive at first glance, you may grow attached to this weirdly colorful and trippy alien world. The look also gives nostalgia graphics fans a great vibe, the music is lovely, too.The special thing about this game and the new 5089 - its sequel - is, that huge parts of the game are randomly generated. It is an open world with tons of freedom in how to play, what to do, lots of possibilities and things to discover. The game mechanics are very well made and fun, I especially love the movement. It is agile, fluid, and things like the hoverboard or grappling hook make navigating the creative worlds a lot of fun!Lots of love and detail have been put into these games, and they are well supported.I definitely recommend them and consider myself a fan of phr00t's awesomely weird games.My favourites are 3089 and 5089 (which belong together, as 5089 continues the game's story).4089 was pretty cool, too, but without the open world aspect it didn't really get me for long.The oldest title on Steam, 3079 convinced me the least, but I may check it out again, now that I know what these games are about.If you want to get a feeling for phr00t's products, one of his older titles - Gentrieve 2 - is available for free:https://indiegamestand.com/free-games/211/gentrieve-2/ "

												I will list what I believe are the pros and cons of this game.Pros-stats for rpg fanatics like myself-a wide variety of weapon possibilities due to random weapon stats and interchangeable parts-well balanced weapon archetypes-a lot of gameplay due to randomly generated quests (they appear to be infinite, but I'm not quite sure)-the ability to build your own ""base""-possibly unlimited world-co-op multi-playerCons-poorly implemented steam compatibility-poorly implemented multiplayer (requires port-forwarding, which really limits acssessability)-bad graphics (not sure if its a Con, it adds a bit of charm to the game)-base building could use some improvements-can't timerip bosses (the only percievable use for timeripping other than abnormaly large hordes of enemies)-you can really screw yourself over in your first world if you're not carefulOverall I think the game is a good buy, and hopefully the problems that hamper it currently will be removed.

												I fell in love with this game within the first few minutes! Your experience is so open ended and unique, there's always something you can do, and the quests are fun (and pretty funny when you start to think about it).My favorite part about it is the customization of the items, it's super engaging. Every component to a weapon or armor has it's own stats so when you find a new piece you can create a better item, which I prefer over the mechanic to ""unlocking"" better equipment with either achievements or money.The environment is incredible, I just love that classic retroness to it. I also like that it's an active environment, changing from day to night, raining, foggy, and meteor showers! These environments can also help you to completing your quests, a very neat detail I appreciate. If you are a SciFi lover, RPG enthusiast, or retro nerd, no question this is the game for you!			"

Posted: May 18, 2016
												I've been a huge fan of this series for a long time and I decided it was time to review this entry. Not some kind of silly review (but of course there will be humor), but a full in depth look.So this game is set 10 years after the last game, 3079, but it has little to no connection with the plot of it. You're on the planet Xax and someone named the Overlord is controlling a bunch of robots all across the gigantic planet. You play as one of these robots but you're rather unique in that your model is vastly different and you're actually sentient. Go figure.A ship will drop you down to the planet in a secure area for the Red robots. The robots are divided into Red and Blue. You're on Red, so, as per usual, you have to kill Blue. The spawning area is only level 1, but as you keep exploring the difficulty will increase. Some levels might seem low but they can actually be quite difficult if you're undergeared, so be prepared. You can always head in for a brief loot trip, though.Quests are somewhat similar to 3079, but they consist of multiple objectives. You might have to disarm a bomb to get a cube or disk, or kill a robot squad, or, a little bit later into the game, vanquish a ghost from an area. You'll get credits for each objective you complete, and at the end of it, you get those delicious skill points.There's a bunch of skills, from stamina and armor, to guns and melee, to consumables and prestige. Stamina increases health, armor increases resistance, guns and melee are somewhat self explanatory, etc. You can do quests, convert areas from Blue to Red, clear out a tower (which takes a lot of time!), and kill ""X"" challenges, which are the game's form of bosses.The X challenges are located deep in high-level areas and are sometimes a higher level than the normal enemies in that area. As you kill more X challenges, different enemy types are thrown out into the wild, from rollertanks to UFOs. X challenges will usually drop a high level item or part, so if you get something like a hoverboard or grappling hook, you may have hit the jackpot.Guns are much different than 3079, instead having two main categories and three subcategories. You can get either an ammo or energy gun, and it'll be a pistol, rifle, or launcher. All guns come in three main parts that you must have to use the gun, but ammo pistols and rifles can get scopes and silencers. Gun barrels are going to have the most value of the three parts, and determine the damage, projectile speed, range, and accuracy. Magazines will determine the amount of times you can fire the gun before it needs to put ammo back in. Ammo guns draw ammo from ammo producers that you can buy from weapons stations, and don't reload. Energy guns will use your energy supply, so keep some energy consumables handy if you're mainly using an energy weapon. Gun bodies determine the shot count, any accuracy debuffs, the projectile's homing capabilities, if the rounds explode or not, and the explosion radius of the rounds.For melee, you have swords and daggers. Both can lunge with alt-fire, and have two parts; handle and blade.The handle might give you something like stun chance or corrosion, the game's form of damage over time. Swords have less of a chance for special effects but more damage, and vice versa for daggers. Daggers have lower damage but higher swing speed, swords having more power but a slower attack rate.Armor is about the same as 3079, but with something new called chips. Chips are things you can integrate into your system that boost various stats. You can reprogram chips at chip stations, rerolling their stat bonuses. They're a big help for tuning your playstyle, from a gunner with great piloting skills, to a sneaky melee fighter that has a bunch of followers.Ships are similar to 3079, but there aren't any capital ships to fight. You can get either a ship without a gun (good for getting from point A to point B quickly without any interruptions to attend to), or an armed craft. The unarmed ships require less pilot skill, but if you want to have a little firepower in the sky, you'll need a good pilot skill.There are three endings, two of which I've found. The third one has eluded me for some time. No, I won't spoil them. Figure it out yourself.Overall, it's a marvelous game for a great price. And with 5089 improving on this entry, you really can't go wrong.If you don't get it, that's okay. There's better games, but this one is still pretty good!			"

												I generally don't like FPSs, but this one is lovely. Atmospheric as anything, it reminds me of HardWar. The way it slowly unfolds, revealing new intricacies and possibilities is very nice. You can just jump in and start playing, but soon you're discovering more and more stuff. Different kinds of weapons, vehicles, tactical situations. Still a bit fasted-paced and ""gun focused"" for my sedate sensibilities, but still recommended.			"

												I'm hooked with this game and although it has an apparently simple design, it's quite complex and fun. I'll be playing it for a while. Who would want this game: * People who like retro, fps and rpg games. * People who like a complex skill system to control their gameplay style. * People who like a challenge. It's not an easy game, specially in its early stages.I think it's amazing that it was mainly developed by one person. It's kinda inspiring.			"

												3089 -- Futuristic Action RPG is the sequal to 3079 -- Block Action RPG.  It's the same procedurally generated content idea, but we've moved from giant pixel graphics (ala Minecraft) to a more triangular approach.  So a big graphics improvement from the previous title, and there were many other engine tweaks and fixes that went into this sequal that are new and improved.  There are a few kinks to iron out yet (the map is one of them, very finicky) but overall there is a lot of improvements to like here.  However, two things of note that I like more in the previous title are the music and the grappling hook.  While the music isn't bad in 3089, the music in 3079 was *really* good.  In addition, the grappling hook in 3089 has weight restrictions and is slowed down compared to its brother in 3079 - it's like the pistol in Halo 2 compared to Halo 1 - yeah it works, but it's not nearly as awesome as its younger brother was.With the above said what it really boils down to is this a good ""game"" and would I recommend playing it.  Unlike my ""unrecommended"" for 3079 I think 3089 is a perfectly playable, procedurally generated game, rather than a sandbox tech demo.  Even with that said, I still think the developer needs to implement a few more tweaks regarding general gameplay before I'd recommend it to the average gamer.  However, if you're into this sort of real sandboxy, do anything you like sort of title with procedurally generated content then 3089 is probably worth a look for you.  Otherwise the recycled quests and lack of real story-based content make me recommend passing on 3089 with another real cudos to the developer for their engine improvement.  I'm looking forward to the next iteration of this series and anticipate that (with a few more gameplay tweaks) this developer will drop gold.			"

												I recommend this game, but really only as a multiplayer SHMUP rather than a single-player adventure. The solo adventure really hinges on a lot of randomly-generated quests, followed by a drip-fed plot, where nothing really feels coherently tied-together. Complete random tasks, acquire stuff, kill boss, difficult ramps up, rinse and repeat ad infinitum. So I must say I didn't spend very long there before my patience grew a little thin.As a multiplayer game, this really shines. Crafted weapons and armour, great vehicles, a brilliant open-ended adventure, or just a slaughterfest. Up to you, really! So grab some chums and give this a try - just don't expect the single-player mode to do anything new or exciting.			"

												Amicabley described as a ""PC game from the early 90's"" in its graphical-style and spirit. In general, your only goal is to get stronger by means of earning skill points. Skill points are earned through questions, dungeons and bosses while getting/customizing equipment to improve your efficiency in combat. That being said, this game isn't recommend if this doesn't sound interesting since the game can be easily described as a ""grind"" for these reasons. While there is multiplayer, it is limited to 2 player co-op with no plans for more. Although having 1 other player is fun in getting to know people, I would have enjoyed the chaos of a larger number of players and factions duking it out.Outside of these standard activities, it is possible for players to have a minecraft-like experience in building structures. However, the speed at which building can occur is a bit limited due to the complexity of building a ""rectangle"" at a time at any angle. Overall there's a simple joy in completing quests, distributing skill points and obtaining progressively stronger equipment in a colorful and angled world.			"

												Don't let the visuals fool you from buying this great game. has a great mix of fps with a hint of customization and large focus around boss battles and doing quests. Currently while im writing this review I have played an hour and its great. Everything is cutomizable weapons, armor, hoverboards, and enchancements well not vehicles but if you pick it up youll get a hefty discount when the sequel comes out around feburuary 2016. It really reminds me of one of tthose dystopian novels like the maze runner mixed with fallout and some sci fi weaponry boom theres 3089. Also $6.99 thats a great deal and its got co op also you can host and join games without having to use the steamn invite system. This game will run on basically any computer and I use a brand new laptop not even meant for gaming handles this like me when no ones home. The A.I. is pretty good for this game and the vehicles are just wow great. I enjoy every second and you should check out phr00ts other titles I was astonished that he made the sperm dog fighting game Spermination(dont think I spelled it right). If you are bored and wanna play a nice fps rpg here ya go.			"

												Definitely wasn't what I expected. I got this game with the expectation that there'd be some pretty open spaces for me to explore, but what I got instead was a non-sensical plot that lead me on a bunch of missions that pulled all of my attention to the gun fights. I can see the appeal of this for some other players, but the heavy focus on combat gets tiring very quickly. The skateboard was pretty cool though.			"

Everything is so much smoother and makes more sense. I played for a little while and found everything fixed and then much, much more. Even on my computer, a not so impressive piece of work, it ran very smoothly. I recommend this game very much. The game is fun, the british robots are entertaining, and the dev is very committed and very helpful. Thumbs way up.			"

												This is 3079's sequel. However, ten years later after the demons, and a huge war... actually I don't even think its on the same planet let alone has anything to do with the first title, in fact combat, upgrades, and even building are far harder to do then the first game... Now I have to apploud the company for trying a new direction but I feel like they took a swing way to far to the left in this title. You play as a really hard to control robot that is fighting a rebel robot army... that isnt really explained why your fighting, what the difference is between the robots, and why the crap robots are fighting? Seriously? You'd think robots would tule out war and work together to create a more advanced civilization which is a way more logical scale of thinking then ""your blue Im red lets shoot each other..."" In lighter news I think the newer game 4089 is coming out but... I dont know if Id risk another huge curve ball.			"

												This is not your ordinary RPG. This game has it all, from guns armor and abilities, to a unique easy(ish) to use building thing. You can costomize what parts of what go into what you use, so you never have a disadvantage when it comes to reliability of weapons and armor. On top of that, you can get other robots to follow you, kill any enemies in the way, and get slaughtered once they run out of health :'( . There are plenty of quests to do, so you'll never run out of things to do. You can choose your playstyle; wether it be completely relying on other team mates to do the work for you then  coming in and stealing the kill, or going out there alone then realising the mistake you made. I have yet to try the multiplayer, but im sure it will be heaps of fun, being able to do everything i said above: With a teammate. Co-op is always great fun in games, wouldn't you agree? This game is well worth the money, and i suggest you buy it!			"

												This is a true indie game. You play a robot where you get to upgrade your system by doing missions, buying parts, building, and exploring the world. Story is simple. You've been placed in a combat world to see if an ultimate combat bot emerges. Along the way you find a native race that wants to fight back. You must make a choice in the end.The developer is teaching himself game design so he has a history of ""completing"" a game and begining a new one. Don't view this as a negative. He takes his games as far as they can go. From the experience, he usually learns how to do something new that wouldn't make any sense to redo an existing project so he finishes it and begins a new one.<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/atp6rqHoAec"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>			"

												After I saw this game for the first time, I knew I had to get it; it looked brilliant. Due to my limited resources, I managed to buy it one month later. Didn't mind the waiting time, I was happy I finally got it.I pressed the button and excitingly waited to get into the game, but then....BAM! Some kind of ""Java error"". The game recommends me to update Java. I update it, but the game keeps opening the Java fils with WinRar and not with Java application. I fix it. The game shows no errors anymore and the launcher throws me in, but then...BAM! The game crashes. I put some research into it and find out that it runs poorly on Intel HD Graphics. So I mess around with the settings and finally manage to get it working by disabling anti-aliasing. I also had to keep the ambient occlusion off because it caused crashes, too.I finally create my character and read the textual intro. I'm thrown into this weirdâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥city. The game only tells me I need to go to the house where various stations are placed (Quest station, Weapons station, etc.). I find the house and get some equipment. My adventures begin!To keep this review somewhat short, I'll skip the descriptive nature of it - the game feels incomplete. You virtually have no tutorials or ANYTHING that might give you a hint about some of the game's features (there aren't many). There are no main quests or goals, there are just some random bosses that you can kill to get some clue about the game's poor storyline. And then you get the location of a new boss. Rinse and repeat. ""Side quests"" are always the same, either you have to kill someone, protect someone, escort him to some other place, bring him a disk that you find in a defusable bomb crate, plant some ""bug"" behind their back or stalk them. There you go, I just listed most of the quests you'll face. You can only have one quest active at a time, so you need to go back and forth to get new ones all the time. The game doesn't explain the crafting system to you at all - basically, if you find an item that says ""incomplete"", it's actually an item part that you can use with other parts to create that kind of weapon. The first gun I bought looked like a whole gun in its icon, but it was actually a part, so I was unable to equip it. You also don't level up in a traditional way, every quest grants you a certain number of skill points which you can directly apply to improve your stats. And the art style is pretty bad even though it looked kinda cool in the screenshots. The camera is badly placed so you always feel like you're stuck to the ground.There are some redeeming qualities but there aren't many - hoverboards and ships are cool, there's a time-ripping ability which slows the time but you remain fast, and you can gather random robots as followers to help you on your quest. But the game falls short on delivering a satisfying experience, mostly you're just wondering why you're still playing. So, my suggestion is, skip this game completely. It isn't worth those 10 euros. If you really have to get it, at least buy it in a bundle.			"

												Additional info,If you use guns:You NEED a decent amount of FPS skill unless you use RipTime all the time.If you cannot lead targets and compensate for the way the guns shoot you will miss all the time.Don't let the simple graphics fool you, you need to be able to shoot well in 3089. ( or collect and use RipTime always)3089 is open ended, no skill caps, procedural terrain and enemy generation which means the farther you go from the starting point the tougher it gets and the terrain is endless so you can keep goinguntil your computer breaks. :)This is currently on sale for $5.00, I got $5.00 worth of entertainment before I left the starter area.I would recommend this if you like:Shooting at thingsMaking armor and weaponsBuilding The random questing system is simple but fairly rewarding once you learn how it behaves.At this price 3089 is a bargain for a fun little mess around game.Would not have regrets if I bought at full price.Recommended			"

												This game is alot like E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy: Both are broken, badly designed messes that are still somehow outstandingly fun. All of Phroot's games are like that, and i'd say for an extra dollar, you really can't go wrong with 5089, but you aren't missing much by choosing 3079 or 3089 (4089 is a completely different type of game). These games are kind of what I expected out of S.T.A.L.K.E.R; you take on randomly generated missions which have you going out into a warzone to spy, kill, etc. The missions you take give you money to upgrade your gear, and the farther you go from your home base, the better gear you can find. Everything is procedurally generated in this game, from the NPC's, to the world, to the weapons. This makes every game/area different and exciting. There's a territory control-type main story in the game, which has you taking over bases to gain traction in the war.This makes it sound like a pretty solid game, but the lack of structure and direction is what makes or breaks it for most players. It's entirely possible to make your way into an area where you'll get yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥kicked, and to loose stuff because of random and unexpected events. However, the lack of hand-holding in this sense can really make it feel like YOUR journey; it's your choice where to go, what to do, and how to survive. This kind of openness is rare in games, especially games as ambitious as 3089.So basically, 3089 is a complicated mess which expects the player to take care of themself, and this makes it one of the most open ended and fun games i've ever played. You make the fun in the game, which is something that more popular projects like Minecraft and Garry's Mod pride themselves on. This game is endearing enough to suck you in and, if you're willing to learn its quirks, it is a highly rewarding experience.			"

												This game is very similar to 3079 where the game is fairly cool until the designer's concept of fun hits you in the face. Every time you die, you lose a piece of equipment. Most equipment are sectioned in two pieces and have to be the same level. If it isn't complete, you don't get any of the bonus. Also, the scale of effectiveness for opponents is too random. The first 'boss' was a giant who practically sniped and the ghosts that show up after a few missions are annoying, not difficult to fight.The intro was great until I played a few hours and understood how everything worked. I expect the same will happen to you. Wait for a sale because there are games that do this better.			"

												So I finally beat the game today. It's a pretty good and fun game. Very addicting gameplay.The game doesn't really guide you that well. I spent my first 4 hours playing just doing random quests and figured there was only one enemy type in the entire game because until you beat the first boss no new types of enemies spawn. Then i continued on with the other bosses and new enemy types started to spawn. Wouldn't of otherwise known had I didn't feel like ""finishing"" the game.The main ""story"" if you want to call it that is very short. It's just a few boss battles and then it has an ending. I've only discovered 2 and they weren't that great. Now that I'm done with it I'm not sure it has any replayability in your same game file as there really isn't anything else to do aside from exploring deeper and deeper into the world as the levels get higher and completing random quests for skill points is all there is left to do.None the less the game is very fun and worth the money.

												Pretty interesting and It's working better than 3079. Maybe interesting but not so much ""Only one more mission/minut and I will end"" game that  have thought. But still, worth a try, yes? Why? Well, you are an android, everyone want a super powers. Speed run, high jump, and you can use flying machines, use swords and guns, be invisible, kill stealthy or be like Rambo, your choice.			"

												I guess this is the sequel to 3079. 3089 follows many of the same design choices as its predecessor, with a few exceptions.	For one, there's simply more. There are more skills, more item and weapon types, and more things to do. Weapons are handled differently, in a way that allows the player to custom-build and improve weapons without throwing them away entirely. Most sky fortresses are gone, so antigrav packs are a thing of the past, but they have been replaced by several other transportation tools, and since energy is not required to use them, the player has a great freedom of movement. Even dying and losing these items is not terribly inconvenient, as the backup stations allow the player a choice as to where to respawn, be it close to item stores or whatever.	However, the game is fairly short. I killed far more time just messing around with sidequests and exploring than I did with the main quest. While it's jolly good fun to spend hours on base takeovers and tower assaults and all that jazz, I would have preferred a main story that justifies the sheer quantity of activity available... but it is nice to be pointed in the right direction instead of mindlessly wandering.	It's also very difficult. While weapon accuracy is a bit more forgiving, the bad guys are just as annoying. The previous game had onslaughts of tough enemies who always attack in groups and always hit, even while moving. This has not changed here. In fact, it's gotten worse, as the enemy ships are smarter and the overpowered enemies (anything using a beam attack) show up whenever it's most inconvenient for the player, usually during quests.	The quests are also kind of a pain in theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Each sidequest is broken down into tasks, and each task may have a certain condition applied to it; For example, until the disk gets delivered, do not kill anyone. Sometimes, the conditions make no sense. If I get into a fight with a big group of enemies, where trying to run instead of fighting means certain death, and one of the enemies activates a task that does not allow me to kill, lest I fail the quest, then what am I supposed to do? I swear, I've failed so many quests because specific tasks required certain conditions that do not take the player's possible predicaments into account. I end up doing what I did in 3079, just looking for quests that give me fewer restrictions.	The most immediately noticeable problem, though, is the environment. While it's nice not to be navigating a shallow grid (at least, outside of bases), the contours of the land can present some problems; Frequently, things get stuck in objects and crevices. The lazy solution, of course, is to provide functions to allow the player to respawn either him or herself, or respawn a quest target.	It's still good tho.			"

												3089 is an FPS/RPG hybrid like Borderlands, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, or Dead Island. You play as a sentient robot with emotions that can learn, which is dropped onto the surface of a military testing planet (Xax) to be tested on other robots. Beyond that, the plot develops slowly, but tells the fate of Xax's inhabitants, and your role on Xax. The game includes a decent amount of customization. Your character levels through skill points, and you can freely attribute points as you see fit. Lots of actions will be level locked though, so anticipate either a much longer grind for a Jack-of-all-Trades, or ditching a few skills. Your weapons and armor's parts can be mixed and matched provided they are no more than one gear level apart. I like the way the game deals with loot generally. You can get gear in one of four ways: you can break open crates, you can kill enemies, you can steal (from friend and foe alike), and you can buy from shops. You never find complete pieces of armor, or guns or swords-just the components. The system isn't perfect though. It has two issues that I feel could be improved. First, I understand needing a workshop to edit gear, sort of. The issue stems from how rare workshops seem to be, in bases, or in the buildings scattered all over. Second, since loot drops are randomized, sometimes all that will be dropped is lower level gear, which I might like to apply, but am  unable because my gear will be two levels higher. I just feel like enemies should either drop gear that matches the difficulty of the area/my current gear better or that the system should accomadate pieces within 2/3 levels based off the body of the item. What else do I have to say about the game? The visual design was minimalistic, but workable. I thought the enemies looked cool, even though the overworld is pretty drab. The music score is okay; no real complaints, but no praises. I thought the energy vs ballistic weapons (draw from semi-recharging energy pool or carry around ammo and power vs accuracy) was a neat idea, but that weapons were otherwise pretty limited due to there only being melee, pistols, rifles, and grenade launchers. There's nothing automatic,beam,spray,rocket, etc. Stealth is suprisingly well done. Sound and sight equally important, and enemies have a varied behaviors depending on how detected/suspected you are.3089 was an interesting surprise. I chose it as a diversion/break between a couple other games I've been playing lately, and for a quick diversion it did well. I just find that currently I don't really feel like continuing. So why is it that I don't want to keep with it? Well, honestly it's because after a few hours I feel like there's few surprises left for this game to offer. My complaint is that three bosses, a couple dozen quests, and half a conquered base in, I feel like the rest of the game is just going to keep playing with skill levels and scaled content, rather than give more unique stuff. I feel this way because while I like that there's a few types of weapons, ships, and enemies, there aren't a lot of them. There's a dozen and a half or so quests, but once you've done them, you know what to expect out of each one, for better or worse. I appreciate that the game can be played infinitely, but I don't expect to get any new gear or ships that blow me away, if there are new types to find that don't just play with stats. tl;dr This is an ambitious indie game that is fun, but lacking. Ultimately, I respect the content the game has, but I wish it had more content and a handful of system tweaks. 6.5/10			"

												Overall this game is a ton of bang for your buck if you value gameplay and exploration over story. The game has a ton of diiferent progression elements, and I'm always finding new secrets. The quests get a little repetitive, but there is a lot of other content that outweighs the few odd minutes you spend grinding skills. One of the most fun aspects of this game is how little it actually tells you that you can do, and the amount of things that will actually ""evolve"" the world once you try them out, adding new enemies or challenges.

												So I finally beat the game today. It's a pretty good and fun game. Very addicting gameplay.The game doesn't really guide you that well. I spent my first 4 hours playing just doing random quests and figured there was only one enemy type in the entire game because until you beat the first boss no new types of enemies spawn. Then i continued on with the other bosses and new enemy types started to spawn. Wouldn't of otherwise known had I didn't feel like ""finishing"" the game.The main ""story"" if you want to call it that is very short. It's just a few boss battles and then it has an ending. I've only discovered 2 and they weren't that great. Now that I'm done with it I'm not sure it has any replayability in your same game file as there really isn't anything else to do aside from exploring deeper and deeper into the world as the levels get higher and completing random quests for skill points is all there is left to do.None the less the game is very fun and worth the money. Excited to try his other games as I have bought them all now.			"

												Well ...  I suppose it's all right.It took three or four restarts to get a decent beginning.  But it finally took.The quests worked fine.  The random dying stopped happening.  And everything I needed finally appeared in one easily defendable and reasonably accessible location.I was able to buy a pretty good gun, and to use that, in my usual style, to keep the place cleared out while slowly building some gear.  I even managed to compile a decent suit of armor.No piloting skill, and my reputation is crap so I can't get any followers to help out.  But I suppose that's okay, too, given my play style.I might try to give the game more time.  I can see why people like it, but having to start over a few times just so things come together right ...  It's just really really unexpected and sort of drains my enthusiasm.But if you like that sort of thing, the game would be great!			"

												I love 3089. It's described as a 3D Roguelike, and that does well enough to describe it. The story sounds like it comes out of an 80's B-liner; you're a robot dropped on a planet in an endless red vs. blue fight, as the 'Overlords' watch both sides, with the planet's natives hiding underground, a few of their vengeful spirits roaming the overworld.Each story mission is fighting a giant robot. Each time you destroy it, larger mobs spawn across the map.The creator, Phr00t, has moved onto 4089 and other works, though I don't think I'll ever get tired of 3089, just for the sake of using the sword to chase fighter jets across the sky. That's always a fun time.			"

												Great game, good fun especially at the start with a mate. There's a lot of things to explore in the game, as far as using all the various utility weapons and skill benefits. Has quiet a steep learning curve but doesn't really offer anything as far as progression, you move further away from the start position and the difficulty gradually goes up offering better loot and quests but the weapon stats seem to all stay the same with the exception of damage. Some of the stats for weapon parts appear to be inherently fixed aswell so you'll never see a weapon with more than 2-3 projectiles with good damage per shot no matter how long you play, it's not that they're rare it's just that the game wont generate them. The same goes for damage and range on weapon barrels so i think it takes away from the progression aspect that everything is so fixed in this way as there's no point trying to grind out rarer parts for weapons because it's just not rewarding enough to be worth your time. It's still fun but will eventually get old as nothing new is introduced the further you progress, everything the game has to offer is there for you to explore at the start which depending on your perspective could be both good or bad.

												3089 is a highly ambitious delightfully quirky game.     When I first bought this game I expected it to be a fun way to spend an evening and then to never play it again. This proved not to be the case as I was sucked in by the interesting world, free form character generation and the equipment customization. What expected to be a shallow RPG experience turned into a vast world of option surrounded by a procedurally generated landscape.      While itâ€™s lack of direction is daunting at first it soon revealed a degree of freedom seldom seen in videogames. Despite this freedom the game does not lack content, the procedurally generated quests, while sometimes strange and nonsensical create there own little stories. You could build your character as a mercenary and take the quests where you kill groups of bots, or you could make a spy, sneaking around planting bugs and eavesdropping on the robotic citizens of Xax. Perhaps you want to build a pilot and fly around the world. Or you could be a leader and get other bots to do your dirty work for you.     What Iâ€™m trying to say is that 3089 is an amazingly deep and enjoyable experience that anyone who enjoys action RPGâ€™s should give a shot. "

												A fun loot-based 3D action RPG with lots of customisation and options. I really, really appreciate what the game takes inspiration from, said inspiration being evidently Deus Ex, System Shock 2(?) and Diablo. What worries me about it, though, is that it lacks the atmosphere or mood that other RPGs have. While other RPGs can feel moody, calm or hectic, this one's world feels like a toybox much of the time. Granted, it is a toybox you can get completely wrecked in, but the whole aesthetic of the game, plus the fact that the main storyline is off the beaten path makes it all a bit goofy if you aren't willing to go through the main storyline (which is good, by the way). For the record, I have about 10 more hours on this game than is let on, because of how easy it is to not have Steam record your hours for this game.			"

Now, I can't speak for everyone, but in my opinion, if a game doesn't let you live the life of a robot that may have given Stalin a wet dream, then I simply refuse to play it. If the noises that the damn things make when the move or ""speak"" isn't enough to make understand why Kurt Cobain blew his head off, then I don't know what will. 9/10, great game to give to someone you hate.

This time the amount of grinding required is quite a bit higher, again giving it some artificial lengthening.The new skill system is a welcome change, allowing you to distribute skill points earned from bosses and quests on any skill you wish. Again, the price is quite demanding for such a short game, but most likely worth it if it ends up on sale for 50% off or more.Unfortunately, the grappling hook is less awesome now, -1 point for that.

												Fun game. Very easy to jump in and out of even after not touching it for a long time. There's a lot of procedural stuff going on making the game very random in a good way. It's not AAA but I like that about it.			"

												The feel of a 00's mmorpg world made of voxels, low-G physics, & rogue like elements make ""3089"" indy gold.  The sense of wonder during exploration is breathtaking.  The world is quite dangerous, even from the get go, with enemy invaisions and unstable planetary conditions.    Crafting is well done, easy, & cool as hell.  Movement through the world is awesome, streamlined, & augmentable in many ways.  One can become a ninja capable of taking out fighter jets.  The physics of the world start to bend to your will, all the while the game watches you and adjusts impossible feats just on the horizon.  The nostalgia is palpable.  Games I remember while playing ""3089"":  ""Everquest,"" ""Project Entropia,"" ""Unreal,"" ""Minecraft,"" ""Morrowind""...  Somehow, elements of all these AAA games are found in ""3089"" & oft improved upon.  Phr00t improves the fun factor with each game, really making this sequel well worth while.  The appreciation for what the oldschool misses is here:  this is a gamer's game.  Indy ftw.94/10  ""3089"" > ""skyrim""   (Why?  Because you can actually fly.  ""Morrowind"" tried & then they gave up.)			"

												3089 is an interesting little game with big ambitions.Sandbox gameplay with character customization, item crafting, action, questing, and even an attempt a story. Many, many facets makes 3089 its own game, blending mechanics and qualities from numerous predacessors. Numerous forms of combat (gunplay, melee, stealth, timewarp and more are all a part of it). Numerous types of quest (including killing enemies, deliveries, and escort). Many items, if not all, can also be crafted if the time and effort is made. Right from the start, a player can scavenge and build, fight enemies and loot them, or accept quests and fulfill them. The game itself is very open.The graphics are largely blocky, reminiscent of Minecraft, with nicer visual effects (e. g.: weather, lighting, electric and explosions). I would describe the aesthetics of Minecraft as boring, but the flair of non-block effects are welcome, making this title appealing to me - more minimalist than simplistic.The story, which is too early to fully critique, looks promising, as morality, emotion and even factions and their allegiances have all been touched upon. I haven't played much of the story, but the fact that these are present is a good sign.The building of your character allows multiple styles of play. One can loot or find parts and later build their own equipment. As far as combat, equipment and skillsets allow one to tweak a character into more specialized roles as opposed to simply ""melee"" and ""firearms,"" for example speedy, charging-melee/damage-soaking melee, to numerous firearms (with their own qualities and effects) and even employing NPCs to aid you.The only negative experience I have with the game itself seems not to be a bug, but a design choice - the use of firearms is extremely difficult in comparison to every other part of this game that I've tried. With a game that utilizes stealth, melee combat and more, I find it shocking that the gunplay was designed as such - the projectiles launched from rifles and pistols travel frustratingly slow - so slow, in fact, that 90% of the time, I find myself fighting point blank so that my bullets don't miss my opponent. This has been very problematic for me, as I built my character around the use of guns. The accuracy has been very poor thus far, unless standing completely still and allowing the crosshairs considerable time to shrink - not only does my aim need to be right, however, but an enemy can easily sidestep my bullet flying through the air at the speed of a turtle. In a game where a player can stop time, run up to point-blank range and hit an enemy with a melee weapon 5 times, in the span of time where they can only hit the same enemy once with their firearm from a distance (with time stop), I find this design choice ridiculous. I keep experimenting on trying to make gun combat work - but it doesn't seem viable - especially when enemies have auto-aim and automatically lead you, seemingly in every direction, so that their shots almost always connect and yours don't. I've been told that other weapons, such as plasma/energy weapons handle differently, but I haven't been able to afford them in the in-game store yet. Still, unless they actually travel at a realistic speed, they're near useless to me.There are also many features which I haven't even explored yet - in-depth item crafting, items such as ""decoys,"" teleporting, online co-op and more. I'll likely update this when I've played and experienced more, but, tl;dr, this is a good game for the money - I've had more fun playing games, but 3089 is very intriguing and fascinating - I enjoy it quite a bit and it'll keep me entertained for quite a while. Well worth the price of a few dollars.			"

												What he HELL can I say about this game. Woah. It's.... Kind of amazing? And really ugly. And yet at times can be very pretty. It's a rpg, with elements of deus ex, and it's open world and randomly generated. Sometimes it feels clunkly, yet the ambition of this contraption constantly makes you want to keep playing.Well now that I haver gotten that out of the way, let's take a few steps back here. Where does this game come from? Well it was based on a prequel that I did not know about, called 3079. Once I saw the ambition of this game, I immediately grabbed it at full price. No way was I missing a game by this developer. And unfortunately I found that the prequel was more an evolution of minecraft than the crazy discription I gave above. So this sequel, is what you should grab. I would almost go as far as to say 3079 is a bad game, and this is a great game. The reason? Well because 3079 lacks the ambition of this project, you can see it wholesale takes from minecraft. Not in the sense that it's a brick digging game, but rather the engine and look of the thing makes you feel like you are playing a cheap minecraft clone. 3089, is nothing like that. It's wholly original. --- It's amazing what improving something can do to it. Yes, technically 3079 has some ambitions, but they are lost in a messy execusion that is less than the sum of it's parts. Back to the game at hand. Once you grasp how the game works, it's systems, and wrap your head around a complex game running on a simple engine --- you discover that it's actually a very simple game. Objectives are too simple, the advantage is that they are randomly assigned and generated. Which is always a good thing and gives the game it's replayability. On one hand you have loot, character stats, and a rougelike death system. On the other hand you have a world that is nearly endless. Kind of like the random generation from 7 days to die. You can travel in one direction for a very long time. The difference between this and 7 days to die, is that this game is about simplistic rpg combat and objective taking, like a lite rpg. Whereas 7 days to die currently has very few rpg elements, and is more about survival --- although it intends to introduce rpg elements. So both of these games have something that the other should develop. This game needs more things to do, survival, etc. Whereas 7 days to die needs random objectives intricate rpg systems. Like this game has. Anyway, I wholly recommend this original beast of a game. The hardware level anti aliasing does not work, and it has some kind of temorary resolve filter, however if you have nividia DSR i suggest using that.			"

												3089 is definitely a fun game with a nostalgic feel. While the textures are outright terrable, the graphics(shaders, the ""toon"" look, anti-aliasing"" ) are good, and while the models may not be high-poly, they certainly all follow a theme. The gamplay and features are fun. It's a red VS blue capturing game with a building aspect to it, and I'm sure more to come. Doesn't have the biggest story, but this is definitely a fun game.			"

												Fun! Never gets boring for me, though I'd try and pick it up on sale. Worth it either way though.UPDATE (June 11, 2015): Still fun, but thought I should elaborate since my review is actually visible. Just a few things:1) Look at my time in this game, wow.2) This game makes you feel like a god damn ninja with all the movement options, as long as you aren't extremely overburdened/underleveled.3) The game does SEEM to have very little content, much of the content appears only as you progress the plot. With such an open game, it can be easy to avoid some things without realizing their importance, so if you feel like the plot has stalled, try doing something new and check the discussions tab. The game has MULTIPLE ENDINGS, so don't just give up on the story. Still, I'll admit there's still not a huge amount of content, and there's a reason that the plot isn't a selling point- it's kinda engaging but not very deep.4) I am a cheap â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ without a credit card, so ignore what I said about waiting for a sale, if the game sounds good it's worth the full price. That said, there's a good chance that the game will go on sale soon, because of the next point:5) A SEQUEL was just announced. Not just the next game in the series continuing the story, like 4089 was, but another open world game in the style of this one, called 5089. I'd say get this one on sale now and if you want it get 5089 when it gets put on steam, but it's going through early alpha/beta testing right now if you want to try and message Phroot (the developer) to get in on that. I know I'll be sending him an email soon!6) Last thing. This game is not for everyone, 4089 is from relatively early in Phroot's proffesional carreer, and it does show. The game is pretty polished (since he keeps updating it), but a few parts are still lacking. But if you can see past the graphics, or are someone who enjoys plenty of older games and/or lower budget indie games, you'll enjoy the hell out of this game.			"

												This was a very boring game... 3079 was fun because you had noteriety with the different races. kill a good guy, you are now a bad guy, kill a bad guy you are a good guy, etc. BUT in this game it doesn't matter. Kill a blue team member or pickpocket them, they kill you or you kill them and then all is forgiven after that one time. It doesn't matter, your choices make no difference. It would be like playing GTA and you shoot down a cop, they push you down and they all is forgiven. This game is a very bad sequel and a low point for this series (which is already iffy as is...)Skip to the sequels or go back to 3079, this one game in the series is not good at all.			"

												This game has a promising design, but I felt like I hadn`t a reason to be playing it. There isn`t a history line (there is something of a history, but it is not that much of a thing). Even more, the difficult is high. Adding these two points, the game will get boring.I know that some games also doesn`t have story line and are famous (Minecraft, ex), but I also didn`t fell like I was there to do my stuff, to build my place. Nor I felt like a challenge to develop a character. You just go around doing some random stuff and you can become strong in every thing.I know that there isn`t a famous studio behind this game, and that the work that has been made is a great deal already. I congratulate the developers for the result, and I really think that there are people who will find a lot of entertainment in this game. It`s just that I didn`t.Another thing is that the game lagged about every 1 minute of game time, completely stopping for around 10 seconds, and the coming back.4/10			"

												I bought this on a whim ages ago, and initially, I had lots of fun with it. The reason I'm writing this review is slightly different. While I would normally recommend that people buy this game, I can no longer feel good about it, because the multiplayer on this game is the most arcane and baffling process I've encountered in a long while. Phroot has done little to clear this up, all of his explanations that I've seen for how to get this stuff to work is, more or less, ""Just port-forward.""We did that. Or at least, made a great number of valiant attempts to get it to work, only to no avail. Even when I successfully forwarded the port, 3089 failed to recognize it. Do not buy this game if you expect to play it multiplayer. Steam is incorrect. This game doesn't really have multiplayer.			"

												The essentials are there. It's still two factions fighting endlessly but only one is playable now, instead of two. Not that it makes any difference...The visuals are more colorful but not necessarely better. The quest system got a nice overhaul and the option to freely skill your player with points granted from said quests remedies the desire for control that was missing in 3079. The grinding isn't gone but it's different and doesn't feel much as such. Classes are easier to graph and play out thanks to that.A more complex but annoying item system lets foes drop halves instead of the complete thing, they need to be assembled first. This clutters the tiny inventory with unusables that I ended up selling all of it and buy complete stuff from vendors instead. Here it does help yet again to walk far, go shopping and then come back for quests to raise your stats. The /home feature is gone though it seems (didn't find it) so doing that is tedious. Yes, it wouldn't be a big deal but unfortunately the grappling hook sucks now, it is slow, has a cooldown and doesn't reach as far. The ability to halt time for up to 15 seconds is very helpful as the enemies are even quicker and dodgier. The music reminds me a lot of the old Deus Ex which I dig. Overall a few ups here, a few downs there from the previous game, and it still is a looping game with no real plot other than ""keep at keeping"".			"

												The things that attracted me about this game were that time stop thing that you can only use on regular mobs anyway, and for a reduced time(it's pretty much useless) and the ability to tear apart and combine elements.I was disappointed with that too because you can only do that in specific areas and you lose parts when you die.You die quite alot and there's almost never one of those things that you can use near you.Other than that, the game is boring or rather frustrating.I wouldn't buy it againEdit:The bullets are slow as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, you can barely hit anything if you're not using that time stopâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and even if you are, you won't be able to fire many rounds.

												This is quite possibly my most valubale stam game, because I have truly always wondered just what it would be like to have a schizoid breakdown, and lo and behold, a game came along to show me. Play five minutes of this weird thing about being a robot assassin in a world of spring-legged cyborgs in block houses with human names for no reason and you, too, will gaze into the eyes of madness.

												I somehow played one hour of this game, when I was very bored. It's an open world RPG, in which you play a robot and fight other robots for some reason. The robots and crates you destroy sometimes drop weapon or armor part, which are used to craft weapons and armor. If you did that you can destroy even more robots and crates and build even more weapons and armor. And then again. And that is about everything I saw in this game. If you are into that, go ahead, buy this game. If not, do yourself a favor and don't buy it.			"

												3089 Review - Raymond KT3089 is a big concept bravely developed by a single person. The ambitions are impressive, but ultimately unreached in the final product. It feels like a game so full ideas that the developer was barely able to squeeze them all in, and didn't have anywhere near enough time to make any of the features any good. Aesthetically bland at the best of times, mechanically unoriginal, lacking any kind of interesting narrative, and ultimately boring in every aspect.I'm not going to bash the game in general, there's a lot there to enjoy. Going into the game, however, It is very slow paced. There's a lot of great slower paced games out there, but if you are the fast paced, insane action kind of guy who gets his fix being able to blast gigantic waves of enemies into beautiful smithereens, this may not be the game for you. If you can enjoy slowly working towards your goals, go for this. The best way to put things in perspective would be to say that I had an extremely hard time playing Fallout 3 as well, so if you liked Fallout 3 (which I also found slow) or games with a similar feel, this game definitely has the potential to be a lot of fun.

												3089 is a game that lacks the ability to keep you playing. It's basically 3079 with awful framerate, horrible world generation, and a terrible buy/sell system. Unlike 3079, this game does not use block to make the enviroment, but I thought blocks were just fine. The AI is something you don't want to be near to. They are hard to understand, they move awkwardly, and it is hard to keep track of them. One of the most irritating and horrendous systems this game has to offer is the crafting system. There are parts of guns, swords, armor, everything. When you die, your weapons are broken and credits are lost so there is no way to get back another weapon or part of one with no credits after you die. It keeps you from playing on in that save file. 3079 never had a part system, and it was an amazing game! I don't really see potential for this game, and get 3079 instead of this.			"

												I was optimistic about this game.  It's got a procedurally generated open world, it's got robots, it's got action RPG mechanics, it's got shooting, it's got equipment customization and aircraft piloting, it's got stealth, it's got procedurally generated missions, it's got time manipulation mechanics, it's got â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing everything.  That's just it, though.  It's spread so thin.  There are so many cool individual ideas and mechanics in this game, but not a single one of them is done well.  The ""action"" is slow, piloting an aircraft somehow manages to be just as uninteresting as walking, the rpg mechanics are boring and uninspired, the stealth is crap, the fps mechanics are crap, and the big world you're given to explore lacks anything worth exploring.  Obviously, having only played 1.3 hours, I can't tell you how the late game plays.  I can, however, tell you that the first 1.3 hours are astonishingly dull.  Even the base being bombarded with meteors was boring, all it means is you have to sit in a tastelessly coloured ""house"" for a while.  That's another thing, the visuals.  Obviously I wasn't expecting anything gorgeous, I saw the screenshots.  Keep in mind, however, that what you see in the screenshots is the best that the game has to offer in the visual department.  The environments are woefully underpopulated with any kind of visually interesting scenery.  Every other aspect of the fluff is equally lacking: missions have no flavour, enemies and allies alike lack even a slight amount of personality, etc.TL;DR:Describing the environment is, perhaps, one of the best ways of describing the game on a whole: an ambitiously vast expanse of nothing.

												3089 -- Futuristic Action RPG - yes, the 'futuristic action RPG' bit actually is in the title, is a game by phr00t's Software that found it's way on Steam by way of Greenlight.  I can hear the groan already, with the reputation for shovelware and drek that Greenlight has garnered for itself.  It's not entirely undeserved, both in the terms of Greenlight and in terms of this game specifically.  To sum up my thoughts, 3089 (yeah, I'm just going to call it 3089 from hereon out), is a game I feel delivers a lot of promise but not a lot of content.  Mechanically, it's sound - and yet, it feels like it doesn't really do anything particularly interesting with those mechanics.Let me just add as an aside before I get too much into the meatier bits of review that I looked at both 3079 and 3089 and 3089 is the one that seemed to offer anything at all, really, in terms of meaningful content, so that is the one I am reviewing now.  I may return to 3079 at a later date, perhaps after a content update, if it ever receives one.The game is obviously largely Minecraft-inspired in it's visual aesthetic.  It's .. fairly well implemented, and I feel it kind of gives it a bit of a unique bent.  However I feel it really doesn't add to the game in any meaningful way, and in fact makes it look very 'budget'.  The thing with the sort of 'voxel' look that Minecraft gives is that it is very difficult to pull off that visual style without looking like you're doing the style out of a lack of being able to do something better.  In this case, it's less that, and more an obvious attempt at aping something very Minecraft, which I'm very 'eh' about.  I'm not a fan of Minecraft's visual aesthetic to begin with, so something to improve upon that style wouldn't be looked down upon, but I feel that the ways in which the aesthetic varies actually adds a sort of visual inconguence.  The models for the androids, fighters, and usable objects are much higher poly-count than the world itself, and it makes it feel as if they do not belong in the same world.  It is rather inconsistent in that way.  Several textures in the game world become hugely distorted or over-sized by trying to stretch them over one large face rather than simply properly tiling them, as well.The gameworld itself is procedurally-generated, like many roguelike games, and it seems to have a decent variety to it.  It's .. fairly sparse however, and crossing from one area to another can be onerous.  Put yourself in mind of going cross-country in Skyrim, and then imagine all the flora and fauna on the way aren't there.  Some of the 'biomes' for lack of a better description are better than others, but they all seem kind of empty.  Most of what you'll encounter are .. crates and other androids.  And the occasional building or town with merchant stations, crafting stations, or quest stations.  It makes the gameplay seem padded and very dry, to end up spending so much of it just in transit.  Most importantly, it just isn't fun to have to spend that much time trekking, and the game doesn't offer any passing scenery that would capture your interest.The gameplay mechanics are similar to many games with roguelike elements.  You have a procedurally-generated quests system, a crafting system, and related things such as health stations and energy stations.  The mechanics of these are fairly well-implemented, just bland.  None of the items I came across seemed particularly inspired or interesting and many weapons are simply better versions of existing ones, rather than ones with unique mechanics.The gunplay itself is fairly unsatisfying, and that's what leaves me ultimately unsatisfied with the game, I think.  Guns ungratifyingly plink-plink-plink enemies and don't have any feeling of weight or power behind them.As a final note, I did want to add one solid positive and say that I really dug the soundtrack and general sound design.  I found it pretty context appropriate and that's a common stumbling block for many independent developers.Ultimately, the onerous exploration and the unsatisfying gameplay coupled with the long periods of essentially doing nothing interesting, and I can't really recommend 3089.  It has potential though, so I may revisit the game if it receives a content update.  I think that's the biggest disappointment here, it's a bunch of things really well-implemented that just don't seem to get realised to it's potential.  And I hate to say that, I really do, because it's quite obvious this developer cares about their game and they have put a lot of work into it.  Perhaps with some more work on the polish, it'll improve.Published: http://highlandarrow.com/index.php/reviews/33-review-3089-futuristic-action-rpg "

												3089 is the sequel to 3079. 3089 is a little bit better. But it still tries to much and doesn't know what it really wants to be. If you want to try one of the two then you are better of with 3089.			"

												While a step up from 3079 in how ""complete"" the game felt, it is still just a bit too minimal for me. Thought I was open-minded enough for the sandbox genre and to enjoy a freestyle game with minimal type graphics, but I suppose this teaches me I am not. Not my type of game.			"

												A little too roguelike to be fun.  Starting a new game is very brutal and controls and objectives aren't made very clear, even with the in-game manual.  Many seeds are completely unplayable, and a roll of the dice as to whether they'll be fun at all.  Interesting combat mechanics and a lot of diverse skill sets, but the RNG gear dependence really sucks a lot of the fun out of it, especially since gear is damaged upon death and you can easily find yourself completely empty handed after a handful of deaths.Obviously the graphics are terrible.  That wouldn't be a big deal if the game was also fun, but unfortunately, that just isn't the case.  I have yet to luck out and find a gun that shoots in a straight line, and some stats are useless.  It's like every drop is a Borderlands player's worst nightmare.This game is going the right direction for a compelling roguelike shooter, and with some tweaks and more effort, it could have been great.  As is, I can't recommend the game at all, and am really disappointed, so maybe stay away from this developer until 3099.			"

												Quite literally the worst experiance I've ever had on Steam.  This game has SO many problems with it it's not even funny.The weapon system is terrible.  In Borderlands at least you can expect to find some usable guns but no luck here.  9/10 guns are unusable due to bad accuracy or other badly rolled stats.  I once found an energy pistol that took up nearly all of my energy to shoot, but did little damage.The graphics... I know graphics aren't everything but these graphics wouldn't even be acceptable in 1999.  When the robots move they don't even move their legs.  A point with a particle moves looking like a string moving around.  I know they're robots, but it looks unnatural and very bad.The Gameplay consists of doing randomly generated quests and hunting bosses.  The quests are, again, 9/10 nearly impossible to complete.  There was a mission where I had to escort a bot, then spy on another.  The Escortee kept following me afterward and alerted the bot I was spying.  Instantly failing the mission.			"

The awful games usually have awful music, so I mute them while I am waiting for their cards to drop. 3089 is one of those awful games, but it does something special. 3089's volume control doesn't have normal sliders. No. It forces you to TYPE IN what percentage you want the audio volume at. I doubt that that was done to troll people like me who hate the game, but if so... wow.			"

												Oh boy....  I loved the first one (3079)... till I died and lost an item of mine...     So I bought this new one (3089) in hopes that horrible part of the game wasn't in this new one.  I had asked if you lose items when you die.  No response.  So I bought it anyways, because the changes sounded really cool and I figured they wouldn't be dumb enough to make the same mistake that totally ruined the game for me and my friends with the last game....  well I was wrong.  You lose a part, I died and I lost the magazine of my gun making my gun useless.  So scrounging around for another clip, found a worse one... and just lost the want to play this game.   Funny how lots of games always have something that either makes the lasting appeal of games go down the tubes or just some really annoying things with aspects of the game that kill it.This game is fun, I enjoyed playing it and getting a hover board and stuff like that, but again I went to venture out of the town after doing a whole slew of quests (like 10 or so) had like 6k money, and pretty good armor (still level one (of the armor))  and I just got killed by one guy out there that only took 4% damage, and just obliterated me, thus losing my gun part stated above.  I really want to like this game a lot, but that just killed it for me, because I just imagine being high ""level"" (you get skill points not really levels) and then dying and losing a really awesome part....   WHY!?   Why not just lose money!?  That's annoying enough as it is (didn't see if I lost money or not, was too frustrated with the lost part).Well that is my review of this game.  Please please let me know if they change that stupid aspect of this game, and I will go and tell my friends (don't have many on my steam list here, but outside of it yes) to pick this game up and have a blast..... although this game is only 2 players coop..Thank you for reading my review, I hope you have a lot more fun with the game than I did after I died, before I did it was fun.  I didn't know I was going to lose an item, because I can't seem to find that aspect of the game anywhere on a site.  Probably is in an obvious place saying that happens, but I didn't find it.  Even worse I boosted my armor to 25 or so, and had about 17 stamina, and I died in like 4 or so shots from a level 5 guy that was pretty close to the outside of town.   :PThe more time I put into this game the more fun I have, although randomly getting cheap deaths is annoying still, but will edit this review as I play it more.  Thanks for the patience.			"

Now imagine a game like Deus Ex or System Shock 2 minus everything that made those two games worth playing by making the game world inconsistent as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ (just because it is randomly generated doesn't mean it has to be completely inconsistent), boring gameplay, lame music and graphics that are worse than System Shock 2's (and I will have you know that I do enjoy System Shock 2 despite having less-than-average graphics, even for its time). Also, nice â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing name for a game. It totally sounds immaginative and original :P			"

You'll be funding the same guy, but for a better game in my opinion. This game has even less story and purpose than the other one, and neither a story driven at all. It also seems to have a much steeper difficulty curve if you try to explore further into thr world.			"

												I was a bit disappointed by this game. Promised to me was a procedurally generated shooter, with procedurally generated missions, weapons/equipment, NPCs, difficulty, and a world that is generated on the fly as you explore it. And, to be fair, all of these things were delivered. However, I was hoping for an exciting and dynamic experience high in variety, which is not quite what eventuated. The problem with so much procedural generation is that it makes the game a little bland.The missions are particularly so. The missions are made up of about 2-6 objectives to be completed in order, and are made up of a set list of about 8 different kinds of tasks, like ""Fight a gang of 4 robots"", ""Protect Sylvia Dee for 1:15"", or simply ""Talk to Derek"". All the missions are made up from these objectives, over and over again, just with different numbers, names, and times. These missions make little contribution to the minimal overarching story, and the content of their objectives is completely irrelevant; only whether you completed them or not.However, all of that said, despite my expectations being far higher than what was offered, I can still recommend 3089. Essentially, I was expecting 3089 to be a procedurally generated RPG, and it simply is not. It is, however, a challenging and reasonably fun shooter, with additional replay value because the world is never the same for any two characters. The missions, even there 's little incentive with respect to the story to complete them, are still fun from a gameplay perspective, and the large number of points you get to upgrade your character are a lovely bonus! Exploring the world into higher difficulty areas, to access more powerful items, is good fun too, and the world generation is actually pretty decent. I did enjoy the number of floating islands, chunky low polygon trees, impressive peaks and valleys, caverns and crags. While the missions, NPCs and weaponry all felt completely characterless, the worlds are somewhat interesting to explore.It took me a while, but eventually I started enjoying myself. If you approach it with a mind more open than mine was, I think you'll be in for a good time.			"

												A spectacular example of procedural generation done right. Everything is random-- weapons, quests, world, and all. It is roguelike, and that is good. The graphics are not the best, but they do not need to be. It is fairly fun in multiplayer, but questing together can be a bit of a pain.

												A nice mixture of RPG and action elements. Graphics aren't showy (aren't meant to be), but I have never lagged on this game (which is significant, because my laptop can't run anything well.). Lots of fun stuff to do, whether it be fighting, using the Hoverboard/Grapple combo to whizz around the map, successfully sneaking past a cluster of enemies, and far more. And all this was made by a, quote, ""one man team (and a busy one at that)"", who goes by phr00t. I highly recommend this game.Edit: Recently, I have found myself playing this alot less. Upon examination, I realized the game , unless all you do is mess around, boils down to a near endless search for loot with better stats. While I still recommend this game, I feel it might not be as good as what I posted above.			"

												This game is awesome, I love it, I haven't played much into it yet, however it's probably one of my more favored titles. One of the few issues I find with it is that the save points and the workbenches are spread out to much, it was difficult for me (a new player) to locate one and it was rather frustrating. I would recommend increasing the likelihood of locating one of these. Another huge issue I found, and I know that it's a bit too late to fix this one, but you made this in Java, just why? Java is not a very good language to program games in simply because it's not well optimized, I mean look at Minecraft and then compare it to Minetest (http://www.minetest.net/). Minetest is essentially minecraft but coded in C++ (I know Minetest isn't nearly as complete as minecraft but that's not the point), Minetest runs better and that's because C++ is a lot more efficient than Java. I'm not trying to berate the game here, I just want to understand your reasoning of using a less efficient language when you could have used C++ thus increasing the games overall performance. (Note, it doesn't have to be C++ it could be C# for example)			"

												Overall 3089 has a good story and excellent gameplay, but there are some lackings. The stealth mechanics are too costly and pretty slow, while more hotkeys for weapons could be welcome. The ""jobs for experience"" system is very simple, easy to do, but take a bit of care because of restrictions. They might be repetitive for some people, but they are incredibly simple and use the core game mechanics in effective ways.The game could be improved a bit and expanded heavily, but on its own it's pretty fun. I'd suggest to get it on sale, as the author intends to add more depth and complexity in the sequel.Almost forgot: The co-op is probably one of the best aspects of the game. Unfortunately it's only two-player, but it is easy to manage and having both players aids in exploration and you can contribute to the jobs of your partner (but you don't get any experience).			"

												I am amazed that this game is developed by primarily only one person!

												This game is awesome. It is simple, fun, and it is downright awesome to literally create your own weapons. You can literally take apart two guns of the same type,and interchange to the parts for your gun, and seel the rest for credits. Personally, I have a rifle that has a scope and silencer, and that makes me a sniper. The story, however, is actually like Portal. It is a higher being putting you in various scenarios (quests and challenges) to test your robot design. Overall, it is a 8/10. Oh, and also, freaky ghosts.			"

												It has been a long time since I felt this nostalgic with a game. 3089 made me remember the good old days of Quake and System Shock 2, and in a way that feels unique and incredibly satisfying. Although not everything is done right, and bugs can be encountered every once in a while, 3089 is a worthy experience every roguelite-RPG fan must have.			"

												A very nifty action/RPG game with graphics that give me a warm and fuzzy PS1 feeling. It's nice to be in a world of triangles vs. all of the procedural boxy voxel games out there. The procedural generation makes exploring your world interesting, and even when things don't line up -quite- right, I never ran in to very many situations where a mission couldn't be completed. Combat works well, and scrounging for gun parts adds to the fun. The soundtrack fits well and never felt repetitive. Other pluses are low system requirements, multi-player, and the ability to build your own bases (kinda). Now for critiques; the procedural side missions can become repetitive after a time, and the procedural world can make it difficult to remember land marks. Still, I think the positives outweigh in my opinion. If you like the cartoon Reboot, you will probably like this game.			"

												3089 is a weird FPSRPG set in a procedurally generated outside world. It has a lot of interesting and unique gameplay mechanics, but very little story. I enjoyed it for the 6 hours it took me to pass the main quest, but the ending was anticlimactic, and I'm so far finding the replay value to be quite low.This may sound negative so far, but 5 hours of enjoyable, novel gameplay is pretty good for $4. However, I recommend that people play the prequel, 3079, first, as it is cheaper and a bit more fun.			"

												3089 is an procedurally generated, open-world, action RPG where you play a robot. You are sent to the planet Xax and given various tasks.Iâ€™m not sure what the point is other than completing arbitrary tasks and exploring, but it is fun. The graphics are simple and angular and give the game a nice aesthetic. The soundtrack is amazing. Several times I would wonder what song I was listening to only to realize it was the soundtrack.There are two factions of robots on Xax: Red and Blue. You play as a red robot, and most of your missions and challenges will be played against the blue bots. So far, quests are simple and of limited variety. The biggest problem I had with this game was learning how to play. I didnâ€™t find most of the â€˜tipsâ€™ very helpful. I had to watch an LP to figure out what to do. After that initial bump, the game opened up, and I really started enjoying the game. One of the best moments I had was running across the terrain and finding myself at the top of a very tall mountain. I thought I was at ground level, but I was actually above the clouds. This is a game I will continue to play.Verdict: This game is worth getting. The graphics, music, and procedural nature of the game work together to provide a unique and interesting experience. "

												3089 - Futuristic Action RPG is sequel to 3079 - Block Action RPG. It's small improvement from the first game with new storyline, weapons, enemies ect. This game has multiple endings to keep you in game, so you could see different kind of ending next time you finish the game. If you like Minecraft, I'm sure you will enjoy this game aswell.			"

												While I think this game is pretty cool, it literally works at random. And the built in safe mode protocall makes it impossible to play the game in fullscreen when it crashes 3/4 launch tries. Luckily it's cheap and honestly I didn't expect much out of purchasing it. But don't get this game, get 5089, and hope this dude made it more stable			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a wtf game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are many resolution sizes.You are able to play this gamer in fullscreen or windowed mode.You are able to change the music volume between 1 and 100%You are able to change the sound volume between 1 and 100%About the game.This is a weird game to start off. You are in a red team fighting against blue things. I have no clue what the goal is from this game or the execution. But you fight and fight against them. Alone or with some other red team mates. You can find weapon or armor parts and once you have enough you are able to craft it into a big piece. You can combine items at a crafting place. The AI in the game never has to reload or wait for their ammo to refill. To make this even worse. They also have super accurate auto aim. 9/10 times you will get hit, no matter the range. There are some skills and quests but i dunno. It seem so dull.Graphics are N64ish to bad.soundtrack is meh.Tutorial/manual is bad explained.AI has Super accurate auto aim. No progress feelings.No end goal?No point of the game.. let alone playing it.Other things.I have no clue why there are so many positive reviews about the game. The game is boring. doesn't make any sense. Its just one of these flash games on newgrounds to be honest.You might enjoy the game if you are high on XTC, otherwise i wouldn't even know why this game is enjoyable. There is no fun.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10			"
