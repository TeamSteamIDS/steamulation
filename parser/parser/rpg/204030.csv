												When I was younger, my gramdma came over to my house to hang out. She was a ""OG gamer grill"", so we played a lot of the same games. When ever Fable TLC came out she fell in love with it, so she made a pirated copy for my 12 yr old self. I installed the game on my dinky little pc and started playing it immediately. When I started out in Oakvale, the graphics where so demanding (for my POS rig at the time) that the ground looked like snow and the water was ♥♥♥♥ yellow, but I still played it anyways. I, too, fell in love with Albion's quirky humour. A few weeks later my dad bought me a graphics card so there would be no more ♥♥♥♥ oceans. I learned a few things about PCs because of it. So I played Fable for months and when I finally beat it, I was so happy. The story is so great and the gameplay is amazing! I then played the game two more times, leveling up different skills along the way. I had a good guy knight, a neutral rogue, and an evil wizard. This game ment so much to me because my grandma gave it to me. She got upset when I told her I beat it before she did, so I teased her about it forever :)I bought this game for nostalgia reasons, and also because it reminds me of my awesome grandma. I miss her... <3			"

												I was stuck in Havana, Cuba for 2 weeks.  That city (and country) is a cesspool.  I was starving, sick, tired, and angry.  I was also cut off from electronic civilization.  No email.  No internet.  No phones.  No nothing.  It so happened that I had this game installed on my laptop and was able to play it in offline mode.  Accordingly, the hours I played this game were not clocked on my profile, but believe me...THIS GAME IS AMAZING.  It is older, but it maintains it's classic status.  For 2 weeks straight, the only pleasure I found in life was playing this game and roof drinking.  Do yourself a favor and buy this game.  Now.			"

												Fable TLC is an amazing game. I remember playing it for the first time years ago and I still play it on occasion. The gameplay is fun and basically everything about it is pretty awesome. I guess it would have been better if they had added different difficulties, but it's still a great game regardless.This is my first review, so I apoligize if it's not too well written. I strongly suggest trying out this game sometime.			"

												Fable TLC was my first RPG as a kid, graphics actually dated pretty well today because of the cartoony style of graphics so it doesn't look that bad. You have two options throughout the game to be the good or the bad guy depending on your decisions.			"

												Fable. Yo. The Lost Chapters.Alright where do I start?This game was my CHILDHOOD.I PULLED MY FIRST ALL NIGHTER BY MYSELF PLAYING FABLE THE LOST CHAPTERS ON THE ORIGINAL XBOX. If that isn't love, then I really don't know what is.Let's get down to it.Pros:-Fun combat. Sort of basic hack n' slash action rpg fare. Now I love to be rewarded for me kills. Typo was unintenional but I'll leave it there.      So you got SWORDS, BOWS & ARROWS, AND CROSSBOWS, and MAGIC! For each type of way you eradicate your enimies, you get experience for that category of killing. So, if you bash a hobbe's brains out with a hammer, you'll get melee experience, then stick in between the eyes with an arrow, you'll get ranged experience, and then finish him off by burning him to a crisp with a fireball, you'll get magic experience. And to put icing on the cake, whenever you finish off an enemie, or an innocent civillian, whatever, you'll get general experience. HOW EXCITING.        Melee combat comes down to left clicking, blocking, dodging, and doing cool overpowered attacks with the right click when your weapon lights up. Ranged is holding down the left click to draw and charge your weapon then popping heads from afar. Magic is self explanatory even more so than the other categories. Do your thing, Harry. You are the chosen one.-There are a lot of spells. Lightning, teleporting, reviving the undead, being a jedi and unleashing the wrath of hell.-Obvious character evolution! Not only do you feel your character getting stronger but you can also see it. Upgrade your strength and become The Hulk. Upgrade your skills and become Shaq, because you get tall when you kill enemies with a crossbow or scam someone out of their money, because hormones work like that. Use magic and you'll turn into a super saiyan. No lie.         Another example of that character evolution would be your morality. I think morality systems in video games are dope. If you're nice, you'll get a pretty little halo will float above your head, butterflies will hoard you, and you'll grow angelicly. If you're evil and kill your sister lol, you'll grow horns and people will cower in fear.-Chicken helmet. 'Nuff said.-Story's a little cliched, but only really the beginning. You play some as some kid who's village gets burnt to the ground by bandits but a wizard saves and takes you to meet a short Hulk Hogan, who raises you to be a hero. The story then turns out to be a lot bigger than story of just vengeance will the balance of Albion hanging in your hands.-The game doesn't take itself TOO seriously. There are serious moments but the overall tone and atmosphere of most of the zones is all laid back and chill.-Soundtrack's pretty dope too.Cons:-The game's ugly. ""Oh, Levi, the game is ten years old,"" well, I DON'T CARE. The game has not aged well. It didn't look good ten years ago. Deal with it. Anniversary edition looks beautimous though.-Its pretty short. I don't have an exact estimate of how quickly I got EVERYTHING DONE in the game, but I got all the sidequests done, max'd skills, fully geared, ect and started a second playthrough in less than 30 hours.-Your morality and story choices don't have a huge impact on the world. Yes, there are consequences for killing an important character at some point in the story, but it all really boils down to that the life you took was expendable anyway and their death would've decided whether people would talk smack to you or applaud you. Other than that though, the story is basically the same regardless of choices and the two endings are very slightly different.-The game is really linear, zones are small and there a little opprotunities to go off the beaten path. However, if you can find a place to explore, you will most likely be rewarded.In a nutshell, the game has a good but cliche story, fun combat, and you can get experience by eating meat. Buy it. Or the Anniversary edition for Xbox 360.			"

												I took a side quest from a random guy at the age of 18 when my skin was tender and smooth as a baby's bottom. I made him stand there and wait for me for 40 years before I actually did the quest. When I returned to him, he was still exactly the same and I was looking like Gandalf The Grey. 10/10 Would take on more side quests.			"

												Welcome to the very first Fable.This is the upgraded version from the original XBOX, and it's one hell of an adventure.Remember when Fable was good? This is that time.Remember when combat was something more than ""roll around and shoot things""? This is that timeRemember when bosses were actually BOSSES? When they were TOUGH and CHALLENGING? This is that time.This very first Fable is the embodiment of ""freedom"". You can choose almost everything. From your weapons, to your morality.Kick chickens, kill things, steal things, earn some money, go to the fight clu-OOOPS, FIRST RULE.Yep, you got the point. This is THE FABLE.Better than Fable Aniversary, and this game has, like, 9 years?Man, that IS something.Go buy it, kick a chicken, use lightning on some dudes. Go on, the choice is yours.Also, freaking Jack of Blades, dude, is almost like Handsome Jack, ALMOST.			"

												Fable The Lost Chapters is an old Xbox port with some extra bits.The game has you playing through the story of a boy turned man who becomes either a hero or a villian.Like many of Peter Molyneux's games you have the constant choices during quest to do good deeds or evil ones.The world around you reflects which side you choose and your characters appearance changes .The story itself is interesting enough but its the storytelling presentation that won me over.Weapons,skills & abilities in the game are your choice never being forced to pick any over another.They all have strengths and weaknesses but none outclass the others,other than in terms of damage.There are various outfits ,armors ,collectibles ,tropheys,and acclaim status to be gotten as you play.You can buy houses & rent them,barter for profit, get married,get divorced in the game as well.The game world is linear but the world itself is decently sized and you will revisit area's often enough.The game sports teleporting from anywhere to specific nodes to help keep the ending running down well enough.The game is littered with humor and sidequests many of which the rewards are worth doing but completely skippable. For an old game its a good buy if you have never played it and want a decent linear action rpg.With a sweetfx mod the game looks even better. Get it 75% off on the cheap or get Fable Anniversary with all its new shiney looks.Either way worth that linear playthrough if you like rpgs.			"

												Superior to all other Fable games in almost every way, sadly! On top of that, it's dated beautifully due to the cartoon-like visuals which in my opinion are a lot more attractive to those seen in Fable Anniversary. The only area that Fable really falls down, which Anniversary improved, is the combat controls, but bloody hell were they great at the time of release! :)15/10/2014 update: If you're wondering why my game time is lacking, it's because I own a PC (and Xbox) copy off-side the one I own on Steam. ^^			"

												Probably one of my favourite games of all time. I'm not a hardcore gamer though.First things first, don't judge this game based from experience from Fable 2, Fable 3 or the journey.The original Fable and the TLC edition are by far the best of the series and they started removing elements from the game such as the loss of a mana bar in Fable 2 and the health bar in Fable 3.Why is this game awesome?This game was one of the best of the Fable series thus far. It included the ability to slice your own destiny giving you the option to go full out evil with horns and flies buzzing around you or the choice of being good, being rewarded with a halo and popularity amongst the people of Albion. This game really emphasises the choice of your morality alignment, whether you wanted to have fun running around trying to take on guards or sacrificing people in order to receive a weapon; to just being able to stay clean and donating to the Temple.What is it like?This game is a sick Action Role-play game where the player gets to control a character and goes around bashing things with a sword swell as casting spells and spamming expressions to random villagers. While the environments aren't massive like the newer games they are sufficient and they are good enough for a basic casual gamer (like myself, they are pretty big to roam). The best thing about this game is being able to see character development. You start as a weak puny character that is a stick compared to the beast you become after you finish the storyline. It's a lot of fun mucking around with abilities.Apart from the main story line which has some really intense kicks and shakes the player can also buy out properties and steal stuff all the actions you make do change your morality which is probably the biggest aspect as I mentioned before. This game is worth more than it's price on steam and I really do highly commender it. Either TLC or the original edition, they are both beast :)			"

												My thoughts on Fable - The lost Chapters:I've played this game a lot when I was younger and didn't have Steam yet, that's why it says I've not played it at all and I'm still writing this recommendation. I got this game during a sale just because of the nostalgic feeling and so that I could tell you what an awesome game this is.Fable was released on PC back in 2005 and got a lot of attention back then because of the freedom it gives the player and the impacts those decisions can and will have on both your character and the environment, which was a pretty much unknown feature.You start the game as a young boy who's given several tasks, during which you're already forced to decide wther you want to finish them on the good or the bad way. Then, after some events, another tutorial and lots of talking, you're a grown up man who's (amongst other things) trying to figure out why those events happened and who's responsible for your parents death. You'll be given several quests, you may explore the world and fight numerous enemies, gain exp and gain access to bigger and better spells (which can be upgraded too), weapons (which can also be upgraded, giving them some awesome visual effects) and armor. Houses can be bought, women married (and f*cked, though the screen becomes black), chicked can be kicked around, and whole cities can be murdered.Cool thing about this game is, it always gives the player a choice. You can play it as a good guy, where you always help the innocent, never steal anything and never kill anyone who didn't deserve it. The more good things you do, the more saint-like your hero becomes, until you have your own halo and literally fart butterflies.If you do things the evil way, your character grows horns, becomes pale and scares the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone he encounters which makes getting a woman to marry you the most difficult task in the game (still a better love story than Twilight!). You can save a lot of money though by simply stealing the things that you need, and murdering an entire city is ♥♥♥♥ing funny! The hero also adapts to the weapons you use - if you fight with spells most of the time, your arms start glowing, but if you use swords, you'll become a big beefy warrior. Eat much, and you'll become fat, but eat nothing and you'll be thin as a branch.For a game that old the graphics and dialogues are still pretty good, the soundtrack is great and you'll be entertained for several hours. There may be lots of quests that are nothing special at all, but the freedom you enjoy in between is what makes this game one of the best I've played so far.There aren't many bad things I can remember because it's been a while since I've last played it, but be sure not to be playing a perfect game. It has its flaws like any other game, but I can't remember anything that makes me want to say ""♥♥♥♥ this game"".There seems to be a HD remake of this game on the way (no idea when though), but as someone commented below, only for the Xbox. Don't sue me if that's wrong.Buy it and enjoy!			"

												This is my favourite, and the best, RPG of all time. Period.Yes, I have no game time right now - but don't judge the review on that just yet.I remember back when I was younger, my brother had an Original Xbox, and Fable had just come out. He'd tell me how amazing it was and I always wanted to play it when he wasn't. After fighting to, I finally got to play and it was amazing. I'd spend all my free time on it when he wasn't using his xbox and it was just the best game I had ever played!As an earlier birthday present one year, I got to choose between an Xbox or a Nintendo DS - Yes I chose the correct choice - I bought an Xbox Original for the sole reason of spending my days on Fable. Fable is an amazing game, you make choices, buy and sell and collect items, weapons and armour. You have many expressions to make and learn, keys to find, chests to unlock and a lot of enemies to kill before killing the pfft...""Almighty"" End-Game boss. Fable as a whole was an amazing experience. Not so long after, Fable: The Lost Chapters was released, which I bought the day it came out. There weren't a lot of changes, flourishes were a different colour, Mini-map updates, some extra quests and optimisations, but of course, because it was Fable, it never stopped me spending countless hours playing it.Fable: The Lost Chapters, - or Fable TLC as some refer as - was a great experience, especially a small 'DLC - like' continuation of the game where the original Fable finished off. It's great and adds some extra lore and beef to the existing story, some new armour and Demon Doors as well as new expressions. The games in their entireties are amazing, and if you have never played either of them, then you should or we can't be friends.I have a lengthy review on Fable Anniversary, which in my opinion is also great. Especially since the Develiopers were kind enough to release a load of patches to improve on it where players were not happy.10/10. Best RPG of all time.			"

												Despite the tedious combat, this is a really good RPG game. It's somewhat short and quite linear, but there's enough interesting content in it to keep you busy for at least 20 hours. While a lot of the features are a tad superfluous. there is a good story, plenty of quests and a lot of interesting places to visit. The moral choices you have to make really add to the game. The only downside of the game is that the (melee) combat is just a lot of clicking. The training about blocking that you receive early in the game is rendered completely useless because you're (almost) always attacked by more than one enemy. Still it only lengthens the battles and doesn't really make them harder.Recommended for 10$ and a no-brainer for anybody who likes RPGs when it's on sale.			"

Maybe I just have nostalgia goggles on, but I think this game's charm is through the roof. It's just some damn good fun.However, it is nowhere near as ridiculously amazing as that professional hack Peter Molyneux hyped it up to be back in the day, so just try to play this like any other game and you'll have a good time.If you like RPGs, then you owe it to yourself to at least try playing this once.

												This is the first time I've played a Fable game andI enjoyed this game mostly, I liked the story and that you could do bad, or good things or both. I like having a choice and not have to be a goody goody hero all the time.Though I disliked and found it very frustrating that you could not save when doing a quest and should you fail, you have to start all the way from the beginning. That almost made me rage quit when trying to escort some spy and there was a massive amount of guards and no matter how much I tried he kept being killed as he dies in a few hits. So decided it was not worth the frustration to bother with that quest anymore.The game is rather linear and the world seems quite small. Hirelings are rather useless with bad AI.Despite the things I disliked I found the game fun and it kept me playing and wanting to see what is going to happen next. I recommend this game if you like RPG's and a interesting story and don't mind that it's linear.It's a bit too short for my liking. I completed the game in 30 hours and I did not rush and did all side quests but 1.I'd give it 7/10.			"

												When I thought about games that stand the test of time, the first game that came to my mind was Fable- The Lost Chapters. It was one of the first games I played and I spent hours upon hours playing it. So when I bought it on steam, I was somewhat sceptic. Would it live up to my childhood nostalgia or would it ruin a fond memory?You might have already guessed the answer from the intro, and you're right - it did live up to the nostalgia. The game have a certain charm I haven't found in another game. I personally love the skill/magic/combat system and how the leveling functions. The gameplay is very accepting, yet it's challenging in some parts of the story/game. You'll have a relaxing and fun experience with it.   There is a moral ""dilemma"" in the game, do you walk righteous path of a saint or do you walk the path of evil and slaughter? I very much enjoy this dilemma. Sure, it is very simple and there has since been countless games with similar and more ""advanced"" systems implemented. Yet, I still tend to like the one in Fable more. It affects your interaction with npc's, some game mechanics, clothing, your character and parts of the story. Throughout the game, you'll have some big and some smaller choices (e.g. in the beginning of the game, you can find a fellow cheating on his wife. You can decide to tell his wife - good, or you can keep a secret and get money - evil). As this was my first review, it might lack in certain areas but bear with me. All in all, I 100% recommend this pearl. Yes, it does fall short in some aspects due to its age and it might not have the same effect on you as it had on me, but give it a chance. You will not be disappointed.			"

												This game is a quirky classic. You run through the storyline choosing between good or evil. (Either way you're still a 'hero') Of course this is an older game. The first in the series, it is rather difficult to play an evil character. (Killing bandits, beetles and other enemies that will fight you regardless of alignment give you good alignment points.) It's a game I played when I was younger and despite the flaws it will always have a special place in my heart.			"

												Fable: The Lost Chapters is a 2005 re-release of the 2004 killer app Fable, brought to you by Lionhead studios - a studio famous for this, having Molyneux as a creative director, and having Molyneux as a creative director who lies.Luckily the 2005 release places it outside of recent memory, so we can ignore all promises of real-time tree growth, multiplayer and multiple guilds, and get on with the game proper. This is not a blind review. First played this game near release, and remembered it being incredibly mediocre. How's that for a first impression? As it turns out, it was just the memory that was mediocre. ""Your health is low. Do you have any potions, or food?""  - GuildmasterBy combining all three virtues/playstyles - Strength, Skill, Will - you'll end up with a character that forms many unfinished wholes into an Ultron of tolerability. Going for a specific ""build"" is not fun, limiting yourself is not fun, the only way to really squeeze some playability out of it is to throw it into a smoothie. Abandon all delusions of sticking to a single path, you're a spellswordbowman. With that out of the way, the game has more to it than you'd initially expect. Will gives you a dozen tools for every situation, Strength keeps you in the action with little touches like rolling having i-frames and the guard-breaking flourishes that I swear trigger at random, and Skill supplements the other two with speed and money.At times, especially during endgame when you've completely broken the game to become a regular munchkin, I was having legitimate fun with the gameplay alone. Something not expected from the half-remembered aeons of strafing/kiting at a distance, or continually bouncing off an enemy's impregnable defense.But it's sloppier than a pig's feeding trough. Movement isn't remotely 1-1, there's no combos beyond mash attack, no way to play gracefully or precise at all. Enemy attacks either telegraph from a mile away, have just enough startup to seemingly knock you out of wailing on them, or in some amazing circumstances are completely messy distance attacks with no way to predict them at all, just react.Accept that you will be spamming your go-to preferred glorified macro lategame and you'll be happier.  ""Try to get your combat multiplier even higher.""  - GuildmasterWhat's there is there, but Fable has largely sold itself on character morphing. Which is okay. A bit ridiculous, you'll end up twice the size of the average character and shrivelled to a prune while the tykes at the local school still take their first lessons. There's not nearly as much character customization as you'd think - maybe 25 outfits, 10 haircuts and a handful of supplementary aspects, you'll rest easy in the knowledge that your super special Hero is going to turn out about the same as everyone else's.The only real morphing here is of your expectations, and with no way to roll back level upgrades you're probably going to end up with a stature you're unhappy with regardless.It's fundementally a silly game, which is fine except that means that any attempt to appear serious falls flat on its face. All the lore ends in abrupt handwaves with no payoff (Did you know that Jack of Blades is a primordial horror-demon, despite just being a smug trickster ingame you trip over and OHKO?), all the character art angles more towards the era's World of Warcraft domineered sensibilities instead of more traditional aesthetics - fine if you like that - and all the music is consistently great there's no dissing these tunes. ""There's a Quest Card waiting for you at the Guildhall.""  - GuildmasterUltimately what Fable is, is a surprisingly mechanically fun but otherwise shallow and cliched RPG. Much like Molyneux's hopes and dreams, it aimed for the moon and landed amongst the dirt.  A final sidenote, it'll run on just about anything but you're going to have to do some moderate legwork. Deleting codecs, adjusting administrator privileges, the like.  "

												When I first played this game, I was only 8 years old. I had it on the original xbox console and I had to be forced to put down the controller and turn it off. I'm 19 now and I can still sit at my PC and play it for hours on end and never get bored. This is one of those games that will never make me think ""I'm too old for this''. I grew up with Fable, watching my parents play it, playing it myself and now to watching my own son play it. Fable - The Lost Chapters will always be one of the greatest games of all time			"

English Version: It was given to me about a year ago and I was pretty skeptic at first, but after playing it I had to change my mind; this game is amazing.The plot is simple but nice. It tells the story of a young hero after his village, Oakvale, is raided by bandits. He's rescued by a hero, Daedalus, who leads him to the Guild of Heroes, where he meets Whisper, his roommate. After years of training, he becomes a hero and goes out on his adventure.The gameplay is varied and is mainly based on two main aspects; ''Experience'' and ''Personality''.Regarding experience we can choose, after the tutorial training, to specialize in ""Strength"", ""Skill"" and ""Will"". The first is related to health, strength and physique; we receive ""Strength"" experience points whenever we fight hand to hand, thus allowing us to improve it. The second is related to agility, precision and cunning; we will be awarded ""Skill"" experience points whenever we practice ranged combat, and as a result we will be able to improve ranged capabilities. The last is related to three different types of spells; attack (targeting the opponent), environmental (targeting surroundings, such as being able to slow or stop time) and physical (targeting ourselves, with powers such as healing spells or shields).Regarding personality there are four different factors: morality, fame, charm and scariness. Morality is linked to the choices that we make during the game, usually either good or bad. Fame is linked to the missions that we have to do: if we taking challenges, we will acquire more fame if we succeed, but we will lose money if we were to fail the challenge. The charm and scariness are related to the physical aspect that we will have in our character (tattoos, clothing, haircut) and are mostly opposites.In addition, the gameplay is full of sidequests that improve immersion in the game's universe, and allow us to enjoy fantastic locations. Besides, the possibility of betting on the missions to acquire more fame and money makes it even more fun for me.Then let's talk about the possibility of getting married to an entire city. How's that? Overall it's a nice game and I recommend it fully!Italian Version: Mi è stato regalato circa lo scorso anno ed ero abbastanza scettica inizialmente, ma dopo averlo giocato mi son dovuta ricredere; è un gioco a dir poco stupendo.La trama è semplice ma carina. Racconta la storia di un giovane eroe rimasto solo dopo l'attacco al suo villaggio, Oakvale, da parte di banditi. Viene tratto in salvo da un eroe, Dedalo, e portato alla Gilda degli Eroi, dove conoscerà Sussurro, la sua compagna di stanza. Dopo anni di allenamento, diventa un eroe e parte per la sua avventura.Il gameplay è molto vario e si basa principalmente su due aspetti principali; ''Esperienza'' e ''Personalità''.Riguardo all'esperienza possiamo scegliere, dopo l'allenamento iniziale, di specializzarci tra ''Forza'', ''Abilità'' e ''Volontà''. La prima è mirata alla salute, alla resistenza ed al fisico; ci vengono dati punti esperienza ''forza'' ogni qualvolta utilizziamo un combattimento corpo a corpo, e quindi ci migliorerà sullo stesso. La seconda è formata da agilità, precisione ed astuzia; ci verranno assegnati punti 'abilità'' ogni qualvolta usiamo il combattimento a distanza, e di conseguenza ci aiuterà nello stesso. L'ultima invece è formata da tre tipi di incantesimo; d'attacco (ovvero mirato all'avversario), ambientale (mirato invece all'ambiente, come fermare il tempo) e fisici (che è mirato a noi stessi, come incantesimi di cura o di scudo).Riguardo alla personalità invece possiamo trovare quattro aspetti: personalità, fama, fascino e spavento. La personalità è legata alle azioni che compiano nel gioco, ovvero alla classica scelta ''buono'' o ''cattivo''. La fama è legata alle missioni che portiamo a termine, scommettendoci sopra ne acquisiremo di più, ma perderemo soldi nel caso dovessimo perdere la scommessa. Il fascino e lo spavento sono legate all'aspetto fisico che faremo avere al nostro personaggio (tatuaggi, vestiario, taglio di capelli) ed uno esclude l'altro, ovviamente!Inoltre, il gameplay, è pieno di sidequest che aiutano l'esplorazione del gioco, e ci permettono di godere di ambientazioni fiabesche. Inoltre la possibilità di scommettere sopra le missioni, che siano principali o secondarie, per acquisir fama e soldi, rende tutto molto più divertente, secondo me.E poi vogliamo parlare della possibilità di sposarci un'intera città? Nel complesso è un gran bel gioco e quindi lo consiglio pienamente!			"

You are playing in an RPG world that seems to be made for children 12+ and it is fun to see people react to the way you are playing the game.I played that game a long time ago and than bought it again without knowing about it's relaunch in HD, so it seems that i don't know this game by hours spend ingame, but I can assure you: I am an dragon-slayer!If you are searching for an not to hard game for RPG beginners, you might wanna take an closer look on this one.8/10 If Fable, then Lost Chapters			"

												This is not a proper review of the game, but in its place I will tell a story. This story will include a few spoilers, but let's be honest- the game is from 2004, the story will most likely have been spoiled for you at some point.Let us begin. There once was a boy, brought into the great Guild of Heroes at a very young age, who trained hard night and day, dedicating his life to becoming a great Hero, seeking fame and glory. Even as a child the Hero was very boastful- proud of his physical and mental prowess and always seeking recognition for his accomplishments. But then one day the Hero took a boast that would later prove to humble him; the day had come that he enter the Arena, and the prideful Hero raised himself upon the podium outside the Guild's walls, looked down into the cheering crowd below.This was, by this time, a familiar sight, for in his search for glory the Hero was not satisfied with merely completing a Quest. He would stand upon the platform and utter the most outrageous of boasts, at one time defeating an entire pack of Balverines stark naked without taking a single scratch as a personal test of his agility. His pride knew no bounds, and the Hero took upon himself the title of the divine Avatar, claiming that he would be the sword which the Gods wielded to drive back the darkness. However, this day the Hero saw an opportunity to forge a truly legendary tale within the Arena, one which could never possibly be surpassed: he would enter the Arena and slay all that came before him, be it man or beast, completely unprotected, and without a so much as a scratch to mar his rosy skin. The crowd cheering and his chest puffed with pride, the Hero set off to the Isle of Witchwood, and the Arena therein.The Hero entered the Arena to the roaring of a crowd that could only brought on by the anticipation of imminent bloodshed. A veteran of the bloodied sands had just fallen, adding yet another entry in the long list of those who had died in pursuit of glory through combat. The Hero made short work of an entire nest of Wasps, then of a clan of Hobbes, all singlehandedly. From the third round on he would be joined by a fellow Hero to defeat the beasts that were released upon him. The gate lowered and from beyond came his greatest rival, a Heroine by the name of Whisper who had looked upon him with disdain ever since they had begun their training together many years ago. However, the Hero was satisfied with this, as it would only add to his legend, and so together they set about cutting down a pack of Balverines to pieces. By this time he had set into the familiar groove of combat, and with spell and sword his foes fell before him.The Hero did not blink an eye as the remains of those who had died on the sands of the Arena tore themselves from the blood soaked earth and rose to reclaim their glory in death. After dispatching the Undead, a clan of Bandits, once feared throughout all of Albion and slated for execution within the Arena several years ago were next. Methodically he dodged their blows and cut them down one by one, Whisper his constant companion this a whirlwind of blood and blade. By this point it had become apparent that group tactics were no match for the Heroes' skill, and so the master of the Arena swiftly changed tactics and introduced a matched pair of trolls to the audience. The Heroes had already faced Trolls before, so as they saw the rumbling of the earth and the giant hands of stone emerge from the sod they knew what to expect. Cool and calm, they circled their prey, waiting for the opportune moment to strike and avoiding the attacks of the other troll. First a pair of Earth Trolls fell beneath their blades, then the even tougher Rock Trolls, chipped at repeatedly by their hit and run attacks.With the defeat of the Trolls the Heroes stood tall, knowing they could take on anything. With the end near, the question of who the gold would go to should they win, as the Arena can only have one Champion,  arose, but this thought was quickly purged from minds as a massive creature the likes of which they had never seen before clawed its way out of the sands, stinger raised and claws snapping. The beast, a gigantic scorpion, was called Arachanox, and many a Champion candidate had fallen before her, their aspirations crushed along with their bodies under its massive stinger. This threat was novel, something the Heroes had never faced before, and it took a great amount of teamwork to learn its strengths and weaknesses. Carefully, they paced around it, dodging out of the way and poking at is when they could. The Hero had managed to maintain his boast of being untouched up until this point, as familiar foes had patterns which he could exploit. But in the face of the unknown his abilities remained sharp, but even the most skilled warrior eventually makes a mistake. Learning the patterns of the great beast the Hero hacked at it with his greatsword when it was stunned, retreating from the slashing of its pincers when it freed itself. They repeated this, but the long hours of combat had begun to wear on them, and the inevitable happened: the Hero made a mistake. Thinking the beast dead after an especially powerful blow, he raised his sword to the sky in celebration, to the delight of the crowd. But Arachanox was not yet defeated, and in its death throes it struck the Hero from behind, putting an end to his long line of successful boasts. Angered by the ruin of the legend he was trying to forge, he turned and struck it down, making sure it was dead, then turned to the cheering crowd.Above them appeared none other than the legendary Jack of Blades to commend them for their valour. However, with his praise came a final, deadly, proposition: one final round. There could only be one Champion of the Arena, Unable to refuse this challenge or lose all they had just fought for, Whisper turned to the Hero and said that she could not kill him, not after all that they had been through in the Arena. The Hero then recalled his earlier boasting, declaring that he would cut down all he faced on the sands. He was a good man at heart, but he realized that his hubris had led him to this situation. Whisper's voice broke him from his thoughts, declaring that they should at the very least put on a good show. And so they crossed blades, once rivals, then allies, and now as reluctant foes on the field of battle. Whisper's skill proved to be no match for that of the Hero in the end, and as she kneeled in the sands, beaten, the Hero had a decision to make: would he sacrifice this woman who had caused him so much anger and betray the bond forged between them in battle to salvage at least some semblance of the legend he had hoped to create? As he looked down at her, he realized that he could not take the final blow and sheathed his blade, turning from the jeers of the disappointed crowd and the pleading eyes of Whisper to walk silently through the gates. With this he took an oath to never boast again, and became a true Champion of Righteousness, rather than a slave to the battlefield, going on to forge a legacy befitting the title of Avatar.			"

												This game is fun. It really is.When you play as an evil character, I found the constant screaming hilarious (for some reason it did not get old for me).The same goes for the cheering when good.Despite some of the things I list below the gameplay and story here are great.Some things I hated about the game included:-How stupid the AI is.-I hate the idea of having multiple spouses (and the system for this is so dumb).-Some bugs in the game that were annoying (particularly when a certain troll in front of a certain door doesn´t appear).-The hero save idea is horrible, especially early on.-Why does the guild let people choose good or evil? What kind of guild is that...-Some of the concepts in the game, namely what I just listed, are just incredibly illogical.Simply put, there is a lot to the game I found illogical and mind blowing in that respect, but the gameplay is just too good for me to really have cared. Really it is a good game.			"

												this game is a artpeice, you start off as a child, condemned to suffer at the hands of jack of blades. you Join a guild then train. youll find yourself gaining fame and so much applause that youll have to Run to avoid their cheers. your cautious fighting will be toned to bloodlustt rage at end game. youll also be faced with morality choices. this game works wonderful, i was surprised how well it ran. easy to play on pc with keyboard and mouse. I usually have difficulty playing 3d games due to fps being low. but this one worked great. Good overall download. No compliants in quality. i hope they releash fable 2 and 3 for steam.			"

												Compared to its sequels, this game is completely fantastic. Fable is such a great game with a great story. Adding to that, each quest you venture through comes with different outcomes, which adds a lot to the re-playability of the entire game. The game is a great RPG for its time and, like I stated before, beats out it's newer, (and more flawed) sequels. I recommend this game for anyone who can spend hours into a story and trying to make the best character.			"

												One of the greatest games ever made.Combat targeting is a bit annoying with mouse + keyboard (no controller support) but it gets easier to deal with the longer you play. The rest of the controls are good.Graphics are still good for their age (in my opinion), the comical art style helps it age well. The level design is memorable and the music is amazing. The characters are wonderfully styled, characters all have unique proportions like big hands and feet compared to the rest of their body. Guards have their caps pulled down over their eyes for a stern look, traders wear goofy tall hats, Thunder is a giant warrior.It's great fun watching your own character change as you progress through the game. You become older, more battle hardened, taller and more buff. You have full control over how good or evil your character is and your actions/appearance affect how the world views you. Later quests allow you to make some pretty major moral choices which is nice.The XP and levelling system is simple which is nice. It's quick and easy to level your character based on your playstyle, you don't have to dedicate yourself to one thing. You've got melee weapons, bows, and spells and you can use them all however you like.This is definitely a game everyone should play at least once. Doesn't matter how old it is, it's a classic now. There's plenty to do in the game for a long single playthrough but it also has replayability if you want to try being the opposite of good/bad or inbetween.The beginning of Fable where the Hero starts in Oakvale followed by training at the Guild before being released into Albion will always be one of my favorite gaming moments.

												First off, this was my first ever Fable game, I went into the series knowing next to nothing other than 'it looked fun'.I really don't want to rate this game based off graphics or anything along those lines since it is 11 years old as of time of writing, so instead I'm just going to list some of the memorable moments I've had so far (I'll most likely continue to update this review)+ apparently being bald with mutton chops makes me the most attractive man alive, over 20 women fell in love with me just for walking around town+ *guard in Shrek's voice* ""I'm keeping you under surveillance""+ Bought a house in a small woodland town, door was locked, tried to lockpick door, guard spotted me and fined me 200 gold.

												Fable - The Lost Chapters may lack the fancier graphics of the Anniversary Edition but is far more stable. The save system hasn't been updated in this classic so the silver key exploit is still possible. Has less options than the other two main entries in the series and yet this was the Fable game I fell in love with and keep coming back to. I felt like a kid with my first computer all over again, googling the best way to open Demon Doors and the best way to sacrifice followers for the most amount of evil alignment points etc. Only real complaint is that you can't change ur gender but whatevergood game, holds up pretty well. imo the best entry in the series (and the only one available on Steam)			"

												This is the real deal.  I chose Fable - The Lost Chapters over Fable Anniversary simply because this is the game I remember playing so many years ago on the original Xbox.  This has the classic look and gameplay that I crave, regardless of the polish on Anniversary.  I just bought this today for $9.99 on Steam and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  It's not a big deal but I do wish it was controller compatible (I play most of my pc games with a PS4 Dualshock controller) but the WASD control type is fine and it's nice to set hotkeys to say, additional buttons on your mouse.  If you loved the original Fable, adorably dated graphics & all, this game is for you!  If you are new to Fable and somewhat archaic visuals from 2 generations ago annoy you, or you absolutely must use a controller, you might feel more comfortable with Anniversary.  Either way it's a great story & a lot of fun...sooo excited to own it again.Runs on Windows 10, I didn't need to adjust compatibility.			"

												(Note: My opinion of this game may be biased, since I grew up with it. Nonetheless, I feel the need to represent this game as truthfully and realisticly as possible.)First of all, I played the original Fable on Xbox, so when I saw Lost Chapters on PC, my mind was blown. Lost Chapters is, in a sense, a ""DLC"" of the original Fable game, in that it adds more content, characters, events, and items. Unfortunately, most of these characters and items won't show up until you complete the first phase of the game.The graphics in this game are admittedly not the greatest. Textures are blurry, people look blocky and pasty, and the landscape turns into this odd, melty blob when you look past mountains and town edges. The characters in this game have a certain charm about them, every one is diverse and unique. From stubborn warriors like Thunder and mysterious people like Briar Rose around every corner, you'll never be short on enemies and friends to make-- by choice, of course. Voice acting quality isn't the best, but usually the actors know what they're doing and can get a point across to you.Combat is... alright, I suppose. If you don't mind taking out the time to redefine your keys in the menu, there's no real problem with it. Some weapons swing oddly, like heavy weapons that FEEL awkward when you use them for the first time, and crossbows that don't fire when you expect them to: zooming in is especially awkward. Boss fights aren't hard, if you just observe and manipulate their patterns, and most minor enemies will run at you, wait a second, and attack, giving you time to fight.And, finally, your character is what you make him into. The game uses the term ""Hero"" loosely; your character resembles your actions and personality, how you interact with and change the world around you. Those who help people in need and stop bandits and minions get halos and beams of light, while those who slay innocent people and side with thieves and criminals grow horns and walk with flames on their feet.In conclusion, this game is great. It's not short on plot, characters, or choices for you to make. If you have spare time, grab this game, and you won't want to put it down.9/10			"

												This game is The Hero's Journey: The Game.The quests can get repetitive but the main story is good pulpy stuff. If you grew up watching Hercules, Xena, and/or Highlander, Excalibur, Dragonheart, you'll love it. The gameplay isn't anything extraordinary but it can be fun thwacking hordes of bandits with your BFS spamming Enflame and Multi-Strike. The stealth is unnecessary. Fishing can be tedious, and escort quests suck but all you need is to make them wait, clear out enemies, follow. Magic is fun.What can you do? You can slaughter a village and buy up all the vacated buildings, or you can lead the inhabitants out to a different zone and buy their property if mass murder isn't your thing. You can collect silver keys, treasure clues, and goofy outfits. You can change your PC's hair, tattoos, and clothes. You can grow horns if you go full evil-and you get a halo for being fully good. You can sacrifice innocents for a sick bow, you can trade goods between shops for a limited profit, join Fight Club, show off trophies, shoplift, go fishing, figure out what the hell the demon doors want, and walk around in your Union Jack undies.It's ludicrously easy to gain EXP once you fully understand how the combat multiplier works in conjunction to Physical Shield and how much EXP carrots, red meat, fish, and combat-oriented actions pay out. Hint: eat 150 red meats (3xp) with a x20 multiplier to equal 9000 Physique XP. I wish they hadn't changed Jack of Blades' voice for The Lost Chapters, the original was more menacing. It was like changing Frieza's voice in DBZ Kai. Sure it makes more sense but it's not as cool. Five stars.			"

												In my opinion Fable TLC is the only Fable game worth playing. Fable TLC is a quirky humerous game that unlike its successors doesn't feel to streamlined. Fable TLC is possibly the only game were the morality system complements gameplay and doesn't feel so much like a tacky add on, plus seeing your characters appearance reflect these changes is pretty cool.However Fable isnt perfect the game isnt particularly challenging and there is no way to change the difficulty. Alot of the choices that make the game feel so open and free are completely nonsensical for example getting married.Good game but it couldn't live up to the hype that surrounded it pre-release.			"

Most quests also give you several choices during them which in turn make your status more evil or more good while twisting the means and/or the end result of quests.Character customization... is well done. You can add tatoos, change your hairstyle, wear different clothes, have battle scars, get older... and all these together decide how NPCs see you and react upon your arrival. You can also get married which usually requires your character to be more attractive and renown.Combat system... your combat skills don't advance along those lame ""skill trees"" you often see in RPG games. In Fable you can choose everything yourself. If you want to max out all possible skills, go on. If you want to specialize as a combat mage, archer or whatever, you can do it. Also your status will show your combat class depending on which skills you invested your experience into, and there are a lot of classes. Scout, rogue, spellwarrior, witch hunter, fighter, warrior. Just to name a few of them. It's even possible to choose never to train your skills and stay as an ""apprentice"" all the way to the end game, though this being an expert level challenge.As an action RPG, the game allows you to fully decide how you move, use skills and take on enemy attacks during combat. Changing from spell to another, or from bow to your sword is very simple and doesn't require you to memorize dozens of different buttons for different commands. On a personal note, I've never encountered a combat system anywhere near as fun, exciting yet not too complicated as this one.Well over 20 hours to reach end game unless you rush only the main storyline quests without completing a single side quest along the way, messing with marriages or looking for some of the several legendary weapons hidden throughout the lands of Albion.On a last note. I recommend this over the Anniversary version. Having played both, honestly all I see are a few tweaks to graphics which mainly just make your own character look ugly as hell.			"

												A very entertaining single player, guided story RPG. There isn't a lot to say for the choices you make having much of an effect on the world around you. People like you different, your hair and eyes look different, and you're restricted from one or two spells; the only decisions that really matters are at the very end of the base game, and the expansion; which basically dictate one or two cinematics; in the expansion, you have three pairs of people you can kill one person each from, that's about it. The narrative however is quite good, and it appeals to the nature of a story that could quite go down as legend. You become a great hero in the span of years, and work to resolve your fate. The legendary items and gear make it feel more like an RPG, and the atmosphere is quite good. The only issue is, while great music, the lack of diversity in the music tracks makes some of the scenes rather... anticlimactic. When you're approaching the gates to armageddon basically, and the happy town music is playing.End result, for $10, and those qualities ascribed?Definitely a passing experience. Not excellent, but it's rather good.			"

Fable: The Lost Chapters is an expansion, continuing where Fable left off. The expansion includes new land masses, new items, and new characters, as well as re-introducing characters from the earlier stages of the game. Fable: The Lost Chapters includes the original game, so there is no need to purchase Fable as a standalone.

												This is my favorite game and has been since I was 11 or so. This version is much much better than the Fable Anniversary, which I purchased for the bells and whistles... This one was by far a better choice, so I'd say save your money. Most people are saying don't buy II & III, I mean, they went really wide with both games and the ending of II frankly made me really angry. I am a die-hard fan of the series itself though and I don't want to play the same game over and over so I appreciate it. Lost Chapters is still the same old loveable Fable where you can decapitate traders and pelvic thrust at unsuspecting ladies, at a $20 difference in price.			"

												Game is incredible! This game is one of the funnest I have ever played. Got Fable 2 and Fable 3 on xbox and neither of them are anywhere near how well done this one is. And to top it all off they are actually making a third version of the game! Fable Anneversarry! <-(Thats spelled wrong get over it!)Other then that the gameplay is incredible. Graphics may not be as good as other games but if you are like me and play older games you will not even glance at that. Enemies are real tough to beat even if you are max level. Even after you beat the story line you still get to continue! Buying this comes with a DLC pack that continues the adventure even more!Overall it is the best game/series of games I have ever seen. Fbles 2 and 3 are what I filled my summer years with when I got really bored. I have clocked over 50 hours on each of those games but this one will recieve more!Buy it before it is to late!20/10			"

The story is good but not the best ever, what makes this game really shine is the cheery atmosphere and NPC interaction. It was also one of the first RPG's to include the good/evil scale which had influence on what you could do and what you looked like. The gaphics were also pretty good for their time.There's tonnes of hilarious moments that you won't forget.Overall experience 9/10			"

												Fable was definitely one of my favorite games on the original XBox.  The PC version looks great and has the same excellent gameplay but it is completely bogged down by the horrible mouse/keyboard layout.  The flow of action is often slowed down by the constant ""which key am I supposed to be hitting"" situation that often pops up.  It can be remedied a bit by downloading a decent gamepad program to map your keyboard but it is still a pain.  Sometimes you feel like you are going to have to hit a key with your nose or something since you are running out of fingers.  I still highly recommend this game however.  It is a classic.			"

												Nostalgia is the main reason I bought this game, but I would definitely recommend to an rpg lover. Although it has your simple choices of good or evil; they're seemingly endless weapons, armor, and misc items to collect. The side quests are somewhat fetch quests but the main story is what makes this game great. What gets me about this game is the small things. For example: the npc's, tattoos, hairstyles, aging, and just the way you look the more evil/good you do. It was a game I had to play more than once just because I wanted to see what happened. Overall it is a great rpg, adventure. The ""choice"" is yours to buy it or not...Ya see what I did there?			"

												The Fable franchise as a whole has pretty much been my entire life from seeing gameplay at a young age to owning my first copy on Xbox and now, after playing through the whole franchise I am able to go back to my roots and fall in love with Fable all over again. Fable - The Lost Chapters is by far the greatest Fable game there has ever been and it's just gone to show that it can EASILY stand the test of time. I HIGHLY reccomend you pick this up.

												One of the best action RPG's around. I recommend this over Anniversary, the only thing changed is the art style and controller support, which I prefer the old graphics and I use a M+K perfectly fine so I don't see the need for a gamepad.  Played it countless times on the Original XBOX as a young boy so my Steam hours are not indicative to my hours in the game. I've probably done hundreds of playthroughs that's totalled up to hundreds of hours since I discovered it. Even though it's a decade old it still holds up. Magic is fun, melee combat is alright, as is the ranged. Upside to those two is that you can decapitate your foes and kick their heads around like soccer balls, though, so there's that. Humor is hit or miss a lot of times, but if you like Monty Python you'll probably like this. Some of the funniest scenes in the game come from the Book Collection quest, from when you scream ""SH!T"" at a classroom of children, to when you make a little kid perform a play about a vengeful cuckhold inn keeper. The quests are fun, and you can add challenges to them by boasting if you feel they're too easy. Story is a tried and true fantasy, ""Only You Can Prevent Evil"" trope with a flavor of ""But Evil Can Be Cool Too"" thrown in. Some quests in the game are strictly good or evil so there's room to roleplay there. It's usually really obvious as to what's what, too. Some of my fondest memories of RPG's are from the Fable series, and this game will always manage to keep  me interested even after years and years of knowing every inch of it. A sold 8/10 at least.  Maybe one day Fable 2 will be ported to PC and I can relive that again as well. It's nearly as good as its predecessor.			"

												This game along with Fable 2 are old games for their time now, but classics.I'd highly reccomend both these games (however, Fable 2 can only be played on a xbox 360 and xbox one as they didnt release a pc port).Set aside the older looking graphics and youll find these games to be ver enjoyable.  Played them back when I was a kid and came back to playing both of them recently and forgot how much fun they were.Both these games are classic hack and slash rpgs where you play as heroes choosing either good or evil on your journey, which each decision you make deciding a different outcome to the storyline.All the citizens react to your repuation whether youre well known or barely known, and also react depending on how good or evil you are.You can also marry citizens in both games, but can buy out real estate and own many homes/properties as well.  (more so in fable 2 but can still own a few in fable).  You can also have kids and buy out all of albion in fable 2 as well (which i thought was pretty cool), but not it fable.			"

												Fable is one of those classically good games with very nice production value. It's primarily an action RPG where you play as an epic hero as you quest through the lands. The game is full of humor and riddled with sidequests. But bare no bones about it, Fable is not a smart game by any stretch of the imagination. It's an action game first and an RPG second, and if you're determined enough you can beat the game without buying any equipment or levelling up your character in any way, I know this first hand.So don't go into this expecting a game with the intelligence of Baldur's Gate, or any of Molyneux's other games, because it's not. Thankfully, the PC port is pretty solid and it features a completely extended part of the game after the original's ending.Overall it's worth the 10$ on Steam and keeps your attention, but it's not anything to break an appointment over.

												don't usually write reviews but fable is a game i go far back on. i haven't played tlc but i owned the original for the original xbox and i had so many hours of playing it when i was around 9 for years until i got a xbox 360 and even then i tried playing my old copy of fable but i always got errors randomly even though i had no problems running it on original xbox. But i loved this game so much and was one of the first video game releases i looked foward to along with halo 1. The only problem i had with the fable series is fable 1 was amazing then fable 2 got really simplified removing spells and the leveling system from the first game then fable 3 tried to make even less spells and gameplay but added the combination system and hero weapons it all just changed too much of what i loved from the original as a kid. But Fable 1 has stood the test of time and still has me coming back to it especially since tlc added a lot of new stuff ive never experienced growing up with the game.i would recommend playing this, but if you like fable you may be like me and not like 2 as much and hate 3 and give up on lionhead for any future fable titles.

												An xbox classic. In retrospect, Fable is not the great game I remember, but a solid game nevertheless. Fable is an action RPG surrounding what starts out appearing nothing but a simple boy who had lost his family and his village, but the plot thickens instensely throughout the game to become much more.Fable was based around the idea of ""for every choice, a consequence"", but don't let that motto fool you. There isn't a whole lot of choice besides ""what's your combat preference"" and ""good or evil"", but the quests, combat, and loot selection are unique enough to still feel fun. I've played enough of Fable to see through it (I have way more hours on xbox than here), but if you haven't picked it up yet and are considering it, $10 is more than fair for your time. I will say though, do purchase *this* version and *not* the anniversary edition; as much I would like to love the anniversary edition, the clunky GUI and un-updated animations make the game more of a crappy retelling than a welcomed overhaul. Fable TLC is still graphically fidelic to be appealing today as it was when it released.Overall, if you like action RPGs, visit the world of Albion is it's oldest (and arguably, best) incarnation of the series.

												I remember playing the original Fable on the XBOX and loved it. Back then, I was kind of disappointed that the game ended after beating Jack of Blades the first time and the game ended if you threw the sword in or not. Imagine my excitement when I heard XBOX was releasing Fable The Lost Chapters with new content? I was ecstatic. Played it and still loved it. Although I never could get all of the dolls.Now that the game is on the PC, it's still good. There's lots to do. You can rent out houses, you can slaughter (and own) most of the world, if you wish to be evil. Or you can be good and loved by the world. No matter which path you choose, I guarantee you'll love his game.			"

												The fable games have a truly unique feel to them, with a classic British Monty python esque sense of humour, and a generally laid back chill, cosy, warm, charming..atmosphere that I'm struggling to describe concisely. Fable: The lost chapters in my opinion is the best game of the series, a series which has sadly ended.The gameplay and controls are pleasingly simple, its not a game that will challenge your skill directly, but with things like the combat multiplier, quest boasting and mini-games allow you to test your skill and reap large rewards.You have various skills and abilities to unlock, and truly unique weapons, and armours to find in the world, each with a backstory. The world itself isn't open like Skyrim, its split into zones, all of which have their own feel and are well designed in that they feel just large enough to lose yourself in, and find new areas in places you thought you had explored.The story itself is like the gameplay simple, but in a good way. It is essentially a parody of your typical RPG tropes countering the typical ""your parents were killed by bandits, and you are now the chosen one"" origin story, with its distinct surreal humour, effectively delivered through amazing and memorable voice acting.The graphics are dated, but yet due to Fables art style still somehow seem just as relevant today as they did back when it came out. If however you do want a graphical improvement, you can get Fable: anniversary, however that is more expensive.Further info:-Combat multiplier is a combo that builds during combat, the less you're hit the higher it gets and the more XP you get.-Quest boasting is what it says on the tin, you pick up a quest and make a boast, for example you will do the quest naked etc, you gain extra gold and XP.

												I grew up playing this game in my early to mid-teens. Finally after 7 or so years I could actually sit down one week and take the time to beat the game and still do every single quest. Great on Xbox, Great on PC. I love the game, dramatic, creepy at times, but has its harmonious moments. Importantly its very enjoyable and fun and that is what really matters. It's an RPG, somewhat medieval with fantasy such as magic (Will) and demons/gods, powers, etc. You can be good, evil, or neutral, you always have a choice if almost every action taken in the game. I have much more to say, but I'd be sitting here typing for hours. GREAT GAME! RECOMMEND TO BUY BEFORE YOU DIE!			"

												Take this with review a grain of salt because the only other video game I ever finished was Orcarina of Time back when I was a kid but I really loved this game. I missed out on the whole Fable thing back when it first came out but I'd always heard really good things about it so when I was looking for something to play on steam and saw it, I decided to give it a shot.I really enjoyed it. It took me about 31hrs according to the statistics and I'm surprised it was only that long because I spent a lot of time just wandering around in the game, messing with charactersd, getting married, and things like that.  And I'm definitely going to play through it again and this time try to make different moral decisions. It's really a good game with a lot of possibilities and definitely worth more than they're charging for it.			"

												Possibly one of the best games ever even to this day. It is a definite classic. While you can get tthe supposedly refined Fable Anniversary for close to $40, why do that when you can play the original for only ten. The use of choices effecting the story and how you look/how people treat you is very creative. It's nice that you have more of a choice in the game, and that you are not just following a one way only formula. I've had many fun experiences in this game, like massacaring a town and buying and renting out all of the houses, and then the new inhabitants end up worshiping me in a few days. In the end, this game is awesome. 10/10			"

												Progression in the game is quite linear. In most instances, you will not be able to even leave the beaten patch, since fences, rocks, and invisible barriers won't allow it. Compared to more open-ended RPGs like the Elder Scrolls series, Fable seems restrictive and light weight in this regard. Overall, it's a decent story, but it is rather force-fed to you.			"

												Many of you know me as Sinclair on steam, but closer friends & others know me as ""That one kid that is crazy about writing dumb ♥♥♥ fictional stories"".Let me tell you why.The first time I ever played this game was when I was 8 years old, It was my birthday and I've gotten a xbox classic from my parents. With the Console I obtained two free games, one of them was halo and the other one was this one.I hated the idea of halo (I was 8 ok) So I started playing Fable. It was the main reason why I grew up as a writer and I thank my creativity from this game.This game means a lot to me, not only because it was the one that got me into writing and videogames, but also because I've basically been playing it since today. I take breaks, of course, I finish playing it then i take a 2 year break and focus on other things, but its a great game to come back to. I honestly never grow tired of it.The OST is beautiful and fits the entire theme. You can be whoever you want to be in the game and the best thing is that you can kick a ♥♥♥♥ing chicken.It's a typical old school rpg game, and one of the best back then if you ask me. The writing and lore are absolutely stunning, the npc's are great and have a lot of backstory and the enemies are cool.You get a lot of choice within this game, something i've been missing from other fable games. Beside that, exploring is so much fun in this game. There is always something to do, and you always have quests. The main quest NEVER gets boring for me.The graphics are OK for its time, really, Beside that, I've heard they made a HD version of it too.I may be speaking out of nostalgia and love, but i honestly want everyone who likes old school RPG's to try this out. It has a typical ""Epic"" Hero theme and its just loveable. You get this feeling that you've been sucked into the game because of the story and end up playing it at 3 AM.9/10 !			"

												Let me start by saying this review's seriously biased: I had this game on the XBox OG and it blew my mind all over my poor mom's upholstery. Nostalgia may factor in here, but I'll try to maintain some sense of objectivity.The good:The gameplay of the original Fable was very unlike a lot of the RPGs in 2004. The mechanic utilized every decision you made to influence the story in some way or another. As enemies land hits on you, scars appear on your body. Do good deeds, the town loves you and a little halo appears on your head. Lay waste to all who stand in your way, and the potato-scrubbing plebians run in fear as little horns sprout out of your head. Your choices seriously affect your weapon stats, skill set, appearence, plot- every nuance of the game begins at day 1. And remember, this is back in 2004. The DS was hot off the factory when this came out. Outkast's ""Hey Ya!"" was not yet overplayed and annoying. Bush was still in office. That's impressive.The music is also pretty impressive. Danny Elfman (yeah, THAT Danny Elfman) helped write the main score, while Russel Shaw, the compser for a majority of Molyneux's games, actually used a small orchestra to do the majority of the game. Not the first or the last time a group of live people was responsible for a VG score, but again, an impressive feat for an RPG of this scale considering we were still using Windows XP. It's atmospheric, and suits the naturally light-hearted nature of the game. The game itself has bits and pieces of humor around. It's a game that tries to not take itself too seriously. The dry, snarky sort of humor only a crazy Brit could come up with. The animation and graphics, as well, are bright with just a touch of cartoony. Still, the selling point here is that Fable set the standard for all the open-world RPGs that follow. Some of Fable's mechanics were borrowed, sure, and some it invented, but I have to argue that it's really the first single player RPG that put it all together to make something that feels this open and massive in scale, where your decisions and style of gameplay seriously affect the game. Really, the closest relative I can think of is Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in 2006, a full two years after. (Maybe there's a hidden gem I missed, but I'm sure someone will point it out if I'm wrong about this.)The ugly:Oh, sweet jesus, the graphics have aged. It takes some getting used to. Even in 2004, she wasn't winning any pagents, but now, even with my GPU's antialiasing cranked up as far as she goes, it's pretty bad. Low poly, pre-HD res, and cheap modeling. It's not a dealbreaker by any means, unless your idea of a good game rests solely on whether or not your dog's character model looks like a real dog. Like I said, it does take a bit getting used to, but the game is still so immersive, you'll ignore it after a few minutes of real gameplay. The contols are a bit awkward, as well. Maybe it's just me, or maybe it's from playing some more modern RPGs, but, it feels like the red-headed stepchild: the controls are still reasonably well-laid (at least it's still using WASD), but there's just some modern conventions that are missing. You can remap the controls, though, which helps somewhat, but it's still a little clunky.The bad:The avatar-to-enviroment ratio isn't linear. At all. You can get some pretty powerful magic and weapons early on in the game. There's a couple of spells that are just straight up unfair- notibly the spell that slows down time, and the ""Heavenly Whatever/Infernal Thing"" spells. Even late in the game, it's way too powerful. Together, all you need to do is slow down time for a bit, and whack all the enemies in a 40-block radius with your Heavenly Thingamabob before they can land a single hit. Mix that with the fact that enemy strength barely goes up after 10 hours, and an open-world, well-designed RPG turns into a hack-and-slash. The game does offer a chance to tack on challenges to your quests, like no damage, fists only, no armour, but it doesn't actually add challenge to a quest itself- it's just a bet. If you take damage during a no damage run, you just lose a few gold, and the quest continues as normal. Basically, after a while, it becomes waaaaay too easy to just blast your way though a quest if you have the right upgrades. It's really a major oversight. It certainly doesn't ruin the game, but it is a nasty blemish that's hard to overlook.Final verdict:Go for it. It's ten bucks, and it's, well, not the grandpa of RPGs, more like the weird-uncle-your-mom-doesn't-like-to-talk-about of RPGs. Okay, so it's got some flaws, and aged like hell, but it's still a pretty solid game. Like most Molyneux projects, it feels planned and thought-out. It's smart, clever, and a lot of fun, and still has a few surprises left in her sleeve. My rating:  7/10Cost:         9.99 USD			"

												It's a decent though albeit short RPG with a flexible leveling system, and a flexible alignment system to look good or evil. HOWEVER there are several downers that will prove annoying quickly.CONS1: The flexible leveling system causes your character to age quickly. This means that if you went and maxed out everything, your character turns from 18 to 65, which is not very fun for the gameplay perspective.2: The aging kills continuity, your character ages, but nobody else does. This means that your spouse(if you married) is suddenly younger than you because you went from 20 to 65.3: too many visual personal touches than are incorrectly modifying your alignment. Long hair should mean you become more attractive, and baldness a neutral or scary point.4: It's all too easy to skip something when it sets clicking to further the diologue.5: There's no controller setting, which is a downer since it could have been mapped or formatted to use a controller which is more ideal for RPGs than a keyboard and mouse.6: Certain story events force your character to change visuals suddenly(IE getting locked up in prison can get you shaved bald, and the one year passage on the ghost ship in the post game causes you to grow a beard and your hair is changed needlessly even if you have longer hair like the ponytail)7: difficulty decline. This issue is a pain for any RPG, and a killer of the fun factor. The endgame is supposed to have lengthy battles with insane damaging final bosses. Side quests tend to have an increasing difficulty that scales better than the final boss or bosses in game.PROs1: you can define your own sexuality freely. This means you can go around marrying or killing suitors as you please.2: the flexible leveling system lets you max out your offensive and defensive perks at your leisure, allowing you to max them all out to make the perfect character.3: Alignment is easy to adjust. If you focused on doing evil deeds and want to turn good, it's easy. If you went good and want to be evil, just kill a bunch of guards until you have had your fill of turning evil.4: Weapons are up to personal choice! As someone who loves swinging a sword, I like swinging a blade, it's more fun and more epic than lugging around a mace. 5: Customizable character visual. Tattoo vendors, barbers, armor and weapon vendors allow you to pick your ideal style(despite limitations).6: you're not obligated to level up to clear the game. This means you can stockpile experience in each of the 4 fields. You can max out your level, or you can go in with the bare essentials. The game world scales with your level to things don't remain impossible.7: FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE CONTROLS! This is a major PRO for this game! Mapping which keys or buttons the way you want to what functions(Though unfortunately you can't map controls to a USB controller), so a user cam simplify or complicate controls to their liking if certain functions are allowed to share buttons or keys.

												Fable and I go way back. Back to the days of the original XBox. When Fable originally came out, I remember not knowing what it was all about exept for the little bit of hype overheard at Gamestop. And while the game may not have lived up to the biblical proportions of hype this game apparently recieved, it certainly resonated with me. Fable was one of the first games I remember playing for long, multiple hour sessions. This game had transended the medium and reached out of the television and captivated my attention in such a way that my free time was forfeit to it's greatness. That being said, it doesn't hold up so well. A lot of what made this game unique has been incorporated into games that followed it and has since been improved upon. Not to say there's nothing here to enjoy. Fable is a great action RPG with a great story, fun character progression and fun combat.			"

												If you have never had the chance to pick up a copy of Fable - TLC, then you simply need to. Even today it offers plenty of fun with an excellent story line and combat which, while simple, doesnt seem to boring. Steam usually keeps this game a super low price, and given that it'll take you a fair amount of hours for full completion, it is certainly worth it. This game is to PCs as Zelda OOT is to N64.Originally: 9.5/10If released today: 7.5/10 for graphics and outdated combat system			"

												If you enjoy having a saying on what will happen and not just being the blind guy who receives orders and has to deal with the consequences without having a choice, this game is for you. To put it simply: this game is awesome.When I watched the trailer I was like ""Meh. Might aswell read the reviews."" and the reviews made me wonder ""If it's such a good game, why does the trailer suck?"". So I decided to watch some gameplay. The best advice I can give you is: Watch the gameplay of the first mission. By then you'll problably know wether you'll like it or not.As for me? I loved this game. I've spent too many months playing FPS games and this game made me remember why I love RPGs so much.At this current time I finished the game as a good guy, and I have 26 hours of playing it. I haven't even gotten into the assassin aspect of the game, the thieving and all those stuff which cause you to be evil. I've still got to play the evil side of the coin and see what kind of stuff will happen differently. Also, there is much I haven't done yet, side quests and things of the sort.Also, the combat is awesome. While you might choose to be the overpowered dude who beats everyone up, you also can choose to play not to your fullest power, but actually use one or two magics at a time. If you play the overpowered dude, combat gets boring too quickly, since no foe will stand up to your power. But if you decide to give your opponents a fair fight, the combat is really interesting. The enemies don't have much power by themselves, but they certainly beat you in numbers and I found myself dying a few times. But don't worry about it, the game is really fair and it gives you a nice ammount of revives with the ability of you being able to buy more revives really cheap once you get to the mid point of the game (before that they're there, but they aren't that cheap in comparison to the gold you have).To sum up: This is a must-have. If it is in sale, you should buy it ASAP. If it's not, you should take a look at the cost and see if it's worth it. But even at it's full price, in my opinion it's worth it.			"

Back then i really didnt get the whole feel of the game but now as i play it, i am flooded with memories and pure feeling as if i am part of the storyline. This game is a great buy even if you arent  familiar with the series. Itll keep you entertained for hours, it has a great storyline that gets you lost in it, epic music when walking around or killing bandits, and the graphics really arent that bad as i remember.btw this is my first review so sorry if its kinda everywhere.

To be honest it doesnt matter about graphics or just the name to be Anniversary, its about gameplay and the extention of the story... Please note if you are deciding between Fable Anniversary and Fable TLC then think again if you are looking more at gameplay and a cheaper price...

												I like the story line and how the villagers actually can make your blood boil with their expressions. The rage of weapons and spells come in a large range. If you like optimal game play you can't beat a good old fable . Flaws - Saving is a nightmare, you save your game and you end up loosing your quest progress nearly 80% of the time. You cannon;t change the sex of your character which sucks for females... Oh and expressions are not explained at all! google is your best bet with some part of the game!			"

												This game was amazing when it came out, and it's still amazing to this day.The story holds up, the combat holds up, the mechanics hold up. Hey, even the graphics hold up well enough.If you've never played this, I cannot recommend it enough. If you've played Fable III and not this one, boy, you're in for a treat.It really is a shame Fable II is never coming to PC, it's the only other game in the franchise that can compete with the first in my opinion, despite all the fuss about firearms being in it.Bottom line, if never played it before and want a great, fresh, medieval fantasy game experience, this is where you should look. If you've played it once or twice before, it's a game with enough choices to revisit once more. If you already played it thoroughly and like it, I'm sure I don't even have to tell you to play it all over again sometime.			"

												First off, this might sound a bit biased. That's because it absolutely is.I grew up playing this game on my old Xbox. My mom would tell me ""[redacted], you can play this game, but only if you're a good guy"". I would run around, only killing evil things, eventually becoming a shining beacon of happiness and hope throughout Albion.Then I turned 10. Things got a bit crazy. May or may not have ""accidently"" slaughtered a couple villages and grew a set of horns.Anyway.That was in the past.I hadn't played this game in at least 7 years (which is crazy to think about) and for some reason, never checked on Steam for it. When I saw it at the Summer Sale, I froze. Oh my god. It's my game. I picked it up without thinking about it, and am 100% happy with my decision.The game is great. The voice acting is horrible. The faces and lip movements are really bad. The Guildmaster is annoying as hell. But the game is a rare gem from the past that I don't think anyone should miss playing.This is the Lost Chapters. It adds much, much more to the base game. It no longer ends when you beat the main villain the first time. Instead, you find yourself with another HALF A GAME to go. More weapons, more enemies, more armor, more quests, and more fun.It also runs really, really well on my laptop. I still haven't felt it get hot, even after a 5-hour gaming session. Camera is a bit wonky, and I had to rebind a few keys (who would want to block with the middle mouse?). Once I got used to it, I've done very well with it.One thing I love about this game, is that it can give you a sense of being overpowered, but only if you play it well. If you mess up, you can easily be overwhelmed by enemies and lose half your health. Play it right, and the only damage you'll take is from a few stray crossbow bolts. If you like rpg games, this game is one of the best out there, even today. I highly, highly, highly recommend getting it and trying it out. After you endure the first hour or so of not-so-great ""gameplay"", you'll come to love this game as much as I do.Well, not as much.Not nearly. "

												Ok, It's Fable... We have mostly played it before. I picked this up simply to scratch a nostalgia itch. On the whole I found that it was good... still! Yes there are a couple of issues as it's an older game so the port hasn't aged particuly well, no controller support and as the magic system relied on three buttons on the xbox version it now relies on 2 (left and right mouse) which can make it a little difficult with all the scrolling to find the apropriate spell. you could of course get very wow style and have a million hotkeys buuut meh, its not really designed around it.Anyway back on track, the port is actually good, 1080 supported (which looks quite lovely!)  AA is supported as well as some basic visual sliders and such. The only thing i found didnt work properly was the refresh rate, is seem to stick at 60fps, not terrible at all but i have a 120hz monitor sooo, well it would have been nice.On to gameplay! Yes the game is flawed... it does feel a little like ""babby's first RPG""  but it has bags of character and you will remember your time with it. i found on my recent playthrough some more annoyances... such as indestructible barrels, having to run MILES to pick up rent and a slightly janky inventory. Seriously when you pick up a book you cant find it in your inventory.... its in your hero's logbook UNLESS it is a note/letter given by a non main story NPC and then it turns up in the ""other"" section of you inventory.  Yes the attack cycles will get repetative you will get bores of the 4 or 5 different unblockable ""flourish"" moves, ranged combat feels slow and you become super powerful very quickly. and then you feel like all the experience you have aquired is useless (it is) But with all that being said, Albion is a fantastic world to inhabit, a lot of thought went in to contextualising the world, everybody has a life that you can see being lead, they will react accordingly... if you raid Oakvale, and murder people (even as a good guy) you will find that for some time the inhabitants will cower and run away from you... even though you have a halo....THE BOTTOM LINE.....Flawed, but fun and a relatively well done and useable port    "

												Fable: The Lost Chapter was not only my first RPG, growing up it was the game I'd always go back to after dipping into games that just couldn't compare to the truly epic experiences I'd have with it. The world and lore of Albion flowed through my mind like the blood in my veins. It was like a second home to me. And after dipping into it for the first time in years, I found that it still is.     I always find that I keep critique to a minimum when it comes to Fable: The Lost Chapters. I do this intentionally. This game was my childhood. I therefore don't want to destroy the fond memories I have of it by locating negative aspects with it.      I'm really not sure if you'll have such a great experience I've had and still have with this game, but I really want to believe that you will.

The quests are very different from eachother and they're engaging, both gameplay and lore wise. The world has variety and it's well planned out. The soundtrack is good and soothing. The karma system lets you choose whether you're the good guy or if you can't resist and give in the devil's teasings and end up killing and sacrificing people for your own sake.

The soundtrack is incredible, and the voice acting is all quite enjoyable.

In Fable you get loads of moral choices which affect your character and the way other people in the world views you. Fable enjoys really enjoyable combat including a huge variety of spells. The variation of  weapons may be lacking, but there's a good variation of armour, clothes, tattoos and hairstyles. But the main part of the game is the amazing story and the great side-quests and the choices you have to make, there's load of things to do! (Unless you just rush the main quest which I don't suggest) Only problem I have is that the difficulty is really easy, and completing the game without ever dying isn't hard.

												As of having over 200+ Hours on the original released on the xbox, I have a deep love for this great rpg, set in one of the best fantasy worlds known as albion, which is widely known and loved my many. Because of certain circumstances I haven't had the chance to play lost chapters. But last chrismas I saw it on sale and being a fable nutcase I just had to get it. With the visuals overly improved due to more computing power from home pc's, I finally got to emerse myself in this amazing world once more, with new quests and other features that the original fable did not possess. Lost chapters how ever let me 1 or half a night to complete even though you could play it for hours on end, and not get bored with its charms. If you're one for this genre of game then I recommend it you, Because I know this game will ensnare and capture you're heart within minutes. For being released around 2005'ish it still competes with over titles as one of the best RPgs of its time. But the choice is yours. For will you become the hero and saviour of Albion? or  dark warrior whose live consists of un-heard of and merciless deads of  evil? that I leave to you, Farm boy.			"

												Ahhh, Fable. An amazing game, it has great RPG and action elements, great story telling and loads of interesting mechanics. If you've never heard of the Fable franchise then I advise you to get it as you will have hours of unguided fun. The game shapes around you, if you're evil, then your character will grow horns and turn more and more demonic with every evil action you commit. If you're good, then your character will glow with the essence of goodness. If you eat too much you become fat. This game is an awesome storytelling wonder, some may even consider it as the father of Action-RPG's. If you're still skeptical, look up some gameplay on Youtube, and decide then, you're missing out if you don't play this game.			"

												My favorite game of all time! Deep and involving story that goes beyond just the main quest that can be read about in the huge array of books scattered throughout Albion. The loading times on PC are only 3-4 seconds long, vs the Xbox's time (15-20 secs).The huge amount of weapons and armours are fantastically designed and each have a unique ability. The amount of choice is amazing! You can marry a man or a woman, you can be good or evil, be a powerful wizard or a brutal fighter. There are so many choices and paths to take! The open world environment allows you to roam free between towns and find ancient legendary weapons hidden long ago in chests and behind magic stone gates known as Demon Doors, which to open, you must solve a riddle or complete a challenge. The best game I've ever played, and a long time favorite! This game is a must-own for every roleplayer out there.EDIT: It's been a couple of years since I wrote this review and this game continues to be one of my favorites in my steam library. It's fair to say that I won't ever stop playing this game.			"

												I first played this game on Xbox when I was little. I have to say it's one of my most favorite games of all time. The whole idea of the game is that you get to choose how and who you want to be while going through a very fun storyline. You could be an evil mage, or a holy warrior. You could be a villianous warlord or a rightious wizard. You could be a 'Run into battle and crush your enemies' kind of person, or you could be a stealthy assassin/thief. Or you could be something in-between; there are no set classes, so you get to, instead, choose from a vast number of skills to increase your character's power. There are three skills trees in total: Strength, Skill, and Will. You could dedicate all of your well earned eperience into a single skill pool and become a master of a skill tree or you could spread your skills out through all three trees.Along with skills, as you play, you can find certain townsfolk in the towns that will allow customization. For example, in the first town you visit, Bowerstone, you can find a barbar and get a new hairdo and can even get some pretty awesome facial hair. In other towns you can find tattoo artists and tat yourself up. BUT WAITWhat makes Fable unique is that every action has a consequence and every action alters your character.For example: If you were to go on a murderous rampage and kill an entire village (Yes, you can do this.), your character's alignment would alter, in this case, for the bad. But if you did something good, like clear out a camp of dangerous bandits, your alignment would alter for the good.As your alignment increases or decreases, your character changes physically and mentally. For example: An extremely evil character would have large horns and a red aura around him as he walks. A good character might have a halo and maybe blonde hair, compared to black.Evil characters also have access to evil 'expressions', which you can use to communicate with villagers. An evil character, for example, can use the 'Insult' expression, which, when used, makes the character exclaim the word S***!A good character can use good expressions, which include, 'Apologize' (which has saved me from accidental fines put on me by town guards) and the 'Thanks' expression. Whatever you want to be is completely up to you. You can play the game hundreds of times, getting a different experience everytime.I rate this game a 10/10			"

												It's quite fitting that the first serious recommendation I do for a game would be Fable: The Lost Chapters.You know how some people tend to play Deus Ex whenever it's mentioned because of how much they love it? In this case, Fable is my Deus Ex. Ever since I played it on the Xbox in 2004. I was hooked.The game truly gives you a feeling of connection with your character, as you play as him from a small child to an elderly, war-torn man. Although some characters are rather dull, most are well-done and well-written for the context of the game. Even when I was an evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who slayed every villager in his sight, I still couldn't bring myself to killing certain characters.The story itself is excellent, dropping you in the mystical land of Albion where beasts of all sorts roam. The main villain is revealed rather late in the game, giving you a chance to explore and understand the environment you were put into without being forced to fight a singular individual. I, personally, enjoy the setting of the game, pitting you in a medieval-esque surrounding.The game gives you a nice sense of freedom when choosing your playstyle. You can be a stealthy archer, a brutish barbarian, a wise spellcaster, or a combination of them. I did a run using only fire spells, and another as a spell-archer. The possibilities aren't endless, but you have quite a bit of freedom in choosing how you want to play.And to top all that off, the music is absolutely brilliant. Have a listen:

On some bad notes, though, the morality system seems rather extreme. The game sets every quest for you to become either some sort of saint, or a completely evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. To put it into an analogy, you're either giving candy to an orphan, or you're kicking said orphan in the teeth.Almost all cutscenes use canned animations, which can be a bit of an eyesore later in the game, and of course there are graphical errors and glitches that might scare some people away; It's understandable, seeing as you can SEE UNDER THE CHARACTERS' EYELIDS.The game is also a bit too easy. As long as you have a steady supply of potions that you can buy with gold that's easy to obtain, you can't die. If you really wanted to have a feeling of difficulty, you would need to throw out all of your resurrection vials and try to limit your potions. That's pretty much the only way to make this game harder than it is.All bad points aside, I truly enjoy this game; even enough to call it my favourite game ever. I sincerely recommend this game to anyone reading this. It may not be the most immersive RPG in existence, nor could it stand up to the likes of Kingdoms of Amalur in gameplay, I still say you should give it a try by any means possible.That being said, though, stay away from the sequels to this game.

												First off, this might sound a bit biased. That's because it absolutely is.I grew up playing this game on my old Xbox. My mom would tell me ""[redacted], you can play this game, but only if you're a good guy"". I would run around, only killing evil things, eventually becoming a shining beacon of happiness and hope throughout Albion.Then I turned 10. Things got a bit crazy. May or may not have ""accidently"" slaughtered a couple villages and grew a set of horns.Anyway.That was in the past.I hadn't played this game in at least 7 years (which is crazy to think about) and for some reason, never checked on Steam for it. When I saw it at the Summer Sale, I froze. Oh my god. It's my game. I picked it up without thinking about it, and am 100% happy with my decision.The game is great. The voice acting is horrible. The faces and lip movements are really bad. The Guildmaster is annoying as hell. But the game is a rare gem from the past that I don't think anyone should miss playing.This is the Lost Chapters. It adds much, much more to the base game. It no longer ends when you beat the main villain the first time. Instead, you find yourself with another HALF A GAME to go. More weapons, more enemies, more armor, more quests, and more fun.It also runs really, really well on my laptop. I still haven't felt it get hot, even after a 5-hour gaming session. Camera is a bit wonky, and I had to rebind a few keys (who would want to block with the middle mouse?). Once I got used to it, I've done very well with it.One thing I love about this game, is that it can give you a sense of being overpowered, but only if you play it well. If you mess up, you can easily be overwhelmed by enemies and lose half your health. Play it right, and the only damage you'll take is from a few stray crossbow bolts. If you like rpg games, this game is one of the best out there, even today. I highly, highly, highly recommend getting it and trying it out. After you endure the first hour or so of not-so-great ""gameplay"", you'll come to love this game as much as I do.Well, not as much.Not nearly. "

												When it comes down to it, there are games from the past that are totally not worth. However, since this game, Fable, was the first and the best in the series, I would have to recommend those to play this game. Whether you enjoyed it years ago on the orginal xbox or computer or not, this game is a beautiful, addicting, single-player game. It wont take up too much of your time, you'll enjoy the story, and most of all, you can ♥♥♥♥ with people so hard. In my first play-through, I chose the path of light and justice. The game was amazing. Then I realized that being an evil mother ♥♥♥♥er makes this game about 10 times better. In most games, I have a hard time being evil; I just feel bad for these NPCs and ♥♥♥♥ing with their ""lives"". Then I grew some god damn balls and chose to ♥♥♥♥ with everything these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s hold dear. It's really easy to be evil if your real-life morals don't come into play. And one of the best parts is that in the beginning, when you're a child, you can't get in trouble for evil deeds. You can be a ♥♥♥♥ing bully and mess with everyone, beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of the random kid who wants his teddy bear back, and still be back in time to give your younger sister her present.Just ♥♥♥♥ing drink or get stoned, and play this game for a night or two. It's totally commander Warf.			"

												This is the game that takes the title as I favourite RPG ever. It may not have the size and content of Skyrim, but the impacts you make on the world really add to the immersion. People actually chanting your name and either cowering from you or praising you, and actually knowing when or when not to oppose you is something that even Skyrim fails to achieve. The combat may seem just like a button masher but if you know what your doing, you can turn it into a fun game of mind tricks with your opponents. The story is the cherry on top of this brilliant cake, and contrary to what many people say, the game can get pretty difficult.			"

												Fable: The Lost Chapters builds upon the original best-selling Fable with loads of new content including new regions, quests and enhanced story elements that further enhance the mystical world of Albion. Fable: The Lost Chapters gives players the chance to fight new monsters, use epic spells to obliterate huge numbers of enemies, don new armor, wield additional weapons and interact with friends and foes using amazing new expressions.In this role-playing adventure game from Lionhead Studios, every action determines a character’s skills, appearance and morality. A character’s life story is created from childhood through adulthood and on to old age. As additional story and side quests await, so too does the path of righteousness, as well as the life of evil. With every choice, a character transforms into a reflection of his actions and decisions.			"

												As of having over 200+ Hours on the original released on the xbox, I have a deep love for this great rpg, set in one of the best fantasy worlds known as albion, which is widely known and loved my many. Because of certain circumstances I haven't had the chance to play lost chapters. But last chrismas I saw it on sale and being a fable nutcase I just had to get it. With the visuals overly improved due to more computing power from home pc's, I finally got to emerse myself in this amazing world once more, with new quests and other features that the original fable did not possess. Lost chapters how ever let me 1 or half a night to complete even though you could play it for hours on end, and not get bored with its charms. If you're one for this genre of game then I recommend it you, Because I know this game will ensnare and capture you're heart within minutes. For being released around 2005'ish it still competes with over titles as one of the best RPgs of its time. But the choice is yours. For will you become the hero and saviour of Albion? or  dark warrior whose live consists of un-heard of and merciless deads of  evil? that I leave to you, Farm boy.			"

												I played this one many years ago and greatly enjoyed the storyline. However, the control system and game mechanics are quite dated now, and I found getting around, fighting and working through puzzles more than a little frustrating. If you're willing to work through the hassles of the controls, then its worth playing. Otherwise, it may be better to try something newer like Kingdoms of Amalur.			"

												Fable TLC is great for people who don't have an original copy of either Fable or Fable TLC for the original Xbox. The game is a direct port and I experienced no bugs or crashing when I played. One thing that players should keep in mind when purchasing this game is that there is no controller support for the game. Playing on the keyboard was incredibly difficult for me because I was so used to the Xbox controller format. To fix this I used Xpadder and made a specific profile that worked very well with the game. I've probably beaten this game about 6 or 7 times and it never gets old. It's a classic game and worth shelling out the cash to play it.			"

												This is one of my favourite games of all time. It might be the nostalgia talking (it was one of my childhood games), but I really do love this game. Sure there are things which were annoying such as the voice acting, it's graphics are outdated, and the moral choice system was laughably binary. But it had a real charm to it, a great story line, amusing side quests, a highly enjoyable battle and magic system, beautiful and magical environs and items (for the graphics level).You may want to get the Fable Anniversary remake of the game instead of this one (I haven't played that one so I dunno how it stands up), especially if older graphics are a problem for you. But this one is about $25 less so if you're strapped for cash this one is still an awesome game.			"

However, it oozes charm, and has a fun, action-packed combat system. While Fable II is the best in the series, this is a great game, too. And the best part is that this version has the true ending, extra quests and weapons, and a ton of stuff added to the base game. At this price, you can't lose. So check it out!			"

												Fable is one of my favourite games on the original XBOX. A solid 15-20 hours of pure fun gameplay. Fable to this day holds a spot as one of my favorite adventure RPG games. Everything about this game is right. For the time it was released it had so many innovative ideas. Your character actually got scarred up and caried your wounds from battle with you throughout the game. You could become good or evil with a noticeable difference to your characters appearance to show this. The world is beautiful, happy and great fun to adventure through. The only downfall with this game is it's short time. If you have never played Fable before I can't reccomend this enough as I feel everyone should play through this game at least once.			"

												Fable - The Lost Chapters, a classic game that originally released in October of 2005 on the original Xbox, September of the same year on PC, ported to Steam in December 2011 and recently had an HD re-release on Xbox 360. Fable is a RPG in which your decisions dictate where the story will go. You can be a Hero of purity and good or a Hero of deceit and evil. This was a groundbreaking feature when it first released because no other game on the market had that ""I really control this character's life"" feel to it. With a unique skill leveling system, you can make yourself a burly warrior, a gifted mage, a craft thief, or as I like to do, a ""Jack-of-All-Trades"" sort of build.When the game begins, you are still just a boy in the town of Oakvale. It's your sister's birthday and you need to find her a present. Your choices start at a young age, as you decide where you want to do good or bad deeds to make the few gold needed to get the gift. Shortly after you get the gift, bandits raid your little town and slaughter everyone. You're saved by a member of The Heroes Guild and taken there where you'll grow up and learn to be a Hero. Will you be The Hero of Avo or a Servant of Skorn. The choice is yours.			"

												Fable takes the old cliche boy turned Hero story and makes it a very thorough and engaging game story-- Fleshed out in such a way it goes beyond the cliche completely. It remains so unique you probably won't put this down even after you've beaten it a couple times. Replayability is insane. If you're like most of my friends and have only played the sequels, you're really missing out. The first in the series is the best, and definitely one of my favourite games.The RPG mechanics are easily exploitable, but if you play the game straight as it's intended, it's a Hell of a lot of fun.Your character changes based on your actions and your skills.If you decide to get buff and put points into strength, your character visibly gets more muscle definition.If you invest in learning magics, runes and symbols will start glowing on your body.The people around you react to your actions and appearance, running from you or following you around and singing your praise, possibly even falling in love with you.Maybe the game has really bad voice acting, maybe its character morphing system forgets a value sometimes and glitches out so you look funny (Also causes the AI to act conflicted sometimes -hilariously enough- screaming in fear but madly in love with you).Sure, it has a really bad, really long tutorial.There are some tone inconsistencies in the late game that don't really flow with the initial non-TLC ending, and small issues with age show.But that's all trying really hard to find issues with it.This is definitely the best RPG of its time.

The plot isn't that predictable, which one would assume it would be due to its age. The combat is very reminiscent of a hack-and-slash if you choose to play it so, but the magic gives you quite the variety. This is definately worth its price; I enjoyed every part of it, the original plot and the add-on quests included with this version.			"

												I came in to this game as a heavy Elder Scrolls/Open Environment RPG player.That said, the limited environment as long as it's expected. Didn't limit my experience.I actually enjoyed the more confined setting as a nice change of pace.The graphics may not hold up today to some, but to me they are above passable.The combat I would say is the weakest link in this game.I was put in to situations where NPCs would spam stun techniques which would lead me getting multi-hit and multi-stunned with out me even being able to give a simple movement command in response. Allowing a very frustrating experience.Aside from this, which seemed to only happen against the Rock Trolls or larger enemies that used AoE the coimbat though limited and repetitive managed to keep my interest.I am a huge fan of stories in games, and this story seemed a bit sterotypical and generic for a RPG.Yet it kept my interest with the townsfolk around me commenting on my recent quests I have achieved/completed.I would say this is for any RPG fan for a quick play through, or if you want another average to above average RPG to dive in to. I will say this is worth the 10$ price tag, but I would wait for a sale for a extra pick up, rather than a main purchase. If you were to do that, as I did. You may be pleasently surprised with this game. 7/10			"

I had constant fun on this and the music is so nostalgiac, it's one of my favourite games to this date. I would recommend this game to anyone in the hopes that they could find a new found love for this and other similar games. I would easily call this my favourite game of all time, it even tops Skyrim; even if the graphics are a bit low, they are SO nice and bring back a sense of childhood. Best. Game. Ever.			"

												This is the first game I ever finished when I was younger. Unfortunately my disc stopped working, sooo...I bought it on Steam. I bought it for Xbox.I bought Fable: Anniversary for Xbox.I bought Fable: Anniversary on Steam.I then played it again... and again... and again. The only reason I'm not playing Fable: Anniversary right now is because the laptop I'm currently using can't run it... but it can run this, so why haven't you played it yet? It is my favourite game, it's that simple. I only wish that they had kept the whole series feeling this good......well? What are you still reading this for? Buy the game and play it, 'cause I doubt you'll find another game where a giant stone door asks you what it's like to play ""hide the sausage"".			"

												This game is pure nostalgic for me. If grown up with it. I played this game for the aight time now, and it´s still outstanding.The game has a lot of humor and looks (for the time it was made ) beautiful. You have the options to do whatever you like, but it's not a such a free game as Skyrim, GTA, ect. The places you explore are linear. That doens't matter in my opinion, in this way you dont waste your time on random exploring. There's always somthing at the end of your journey. You can choose to be a hero, but you can also be a villain. But if you have played the game a couple of times, you know that the evil way is much more rewarding. Play this game and have Fun!!  English isn't my native language, so if there are any mistakes in it I'm sorry.			"

												Fable - The Lost Chapters is one of the best games I have ever had the pleasure to play, and I have played many many games I don't have many hours in the account but I've replayed it at least 3 times needless to say it's loads of fun and very addicting.The game has a great story with good plot twists. The player (You) follows the life story of a little boy who loses everything and is taken in as a student of a Hero school then you can choose to live his childhood or not and that's all i'm giving out! Not gonna spoil the fun :)The world itself is responsive to what you do and the Npc's react to what you have done, if you have been good they will be warm towards you, and you'l get a circle above your head like if you were an Angel, If you have been doing bad deeds ( like me) such as hiting people with sticks, kicking chickens etc XD, you'l grow horns and people will fear you and be cold towards you. But that can also be influenced by what type of armor you are wearing, some types of armor have an ""evil look"" to them  causing people to be repulsed by it. Another fact about the world is that it is not fully open world it's region locked, little areas where you can explore and that's a minus in the game, but considering it's age it's not something the developers could do about it. There is fast travel areas in the hero school where you will receive numerous quests and where you can upgrade your character.You can also buy titles such as ""The Chicken chaser!"", ""Sabre"" and many others that I can't remember right now hehe.You can customize your character by finding cards of tatoos, beards or haircuts in chests you find in the world. There are doors guarded by Old men faces that provide the player challenges some are to get a kill streak or getting fat, and as you complete the challenge you will be able to enter the big doors and a chest will be found with loot inside it. There are tons of things to do in this amazing world.The Ending is one that will stick with you, the way it ends is choosen by you, I found the Good ending more satisfying than the evil ending. It is a great game and if you don't have it yet or have money left over during steam sales give it a go. You won't regret it :)I give this game an 8/10 Very good game!!			"

Will is WAY too overpowered and  I beat the last part of the game without losing any health! After a while your character becomes so powerful you kill everything in 1-2 hits and you can just spam health and mana potions constantly. The game needs to be balanced a lot more to be in any way a challenge. Also the menu is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and frustrating. All in all 9/10			"

												This game is a classic for me. Back in the day most people got hyped up on all of the false promises surrounding the development. Not me. I had never heard a thing. I walked into Best Buy one day, asked about good PC games, and they dude told me to buy this. I think I was 14 or so. Long story short, I had so much fun. It was the perfect beginner RPG. For a while it was my favorite PC game, I think I played it for around 2-3 years. Great memories.			"

												So I've decided on making a review on this game in writing for now, but I plan on making a video review in the future. Fable The Lost Chapters has been my second favorite game since it was released as just ""fable"" back in 2004. Upon hearing about The Lost Chapters I got extremely excited. Hell, I played through the game again on the xbox just so I could play through the second part of the game. I feel that they could have included The Lost Chapters in the game itself and honestly it's stupid that they didn't. But nostalgia blinds me from being mad at that. So I feel that the game plays just as good if not better than the xbox version, but I still wish I could use a 360 controller on the pc port of the game. I prefer the comfort of a controller with games like this and other rpgs because I can relax and actually play the game.The story in this game is a bit lacking and I could kind of tell even as a 14 year old how things were going to play out. I won't be covering the story because I recommend you play it yourself. But basically who you think is dead isn't and who you think is good isn't as well.Fable wasn't exactly a well recieved series, Fable 2 never came to pc so I never really got the chance to play it through, and Fable 3... Well. I think it's trash to say the least.They really hyped up the good and evil system in this game, and for good reason! They were pretty much the pioneers of alignment choices with Knights of the old republic just a year or so before. We have games like this to thank for the big aligment based games such as Mass Effect and Fallout, so next time you say the fable series is awful, it may be bad to you, but they did certainly try to do something different. Games like Final Fantasy don't really have good or evil choices, you're the chosen hero. This game lets you be the bad guy. Wether it's you killing traders, or your own family, it doesn't matter. Also there's a brothel you can take over and  bang chicks for free. 19/10Rest in peace Lionhead.			"

												All time classic. Redefined gaming set a new bar for the rest of the game world. Spent more time on this than I did many other things I should of, and rightly so. If you never played it, but are a game enthusiast I would reccomend. If you played it a long time ago, open it up for a new campaign and let the nostalgia come flooding back.			"

												I don't appear to have alot of hours on this, but I used to boot up the original Xbox consule just to play this game. To start off with, this is by far on of my favorite games in the previous generation of games. And even now, playing it is still fun, there is always alot to do. And quite frankly its just Fantastic. Story driven, and well put together. I haven't run into any bugs since I was playing it 10 years ago and honestly the controls are easy to get around with.Well woth the 10$ usd honestly.			"

												This game, in my opinion, is beautiful.When you hear someone say a game is beautiful, they're usually talking about the graphics. I find this game beautiful because of the atmosphere. The Music, the World, and the Graphics together make this game beautiful to me. If you can get your hands on the OST, get it. Besides the atmosphere I also like every else. The story is good, the quests are alright, the characters are decent, and the combat is ok. Overall this game is very, very good. I would highly reccomend it.			"

												I have a lot of nostalgia for this game. It is a delightful little hack and slash, though it REALLY has not aged well. I give it a thumbs up, because it is a good game, but I would argue that the simplicity of it and teeth-grinding voice-acting can wear on even the biggest fans. I disliked its sequels, and I never feel the need to revisit it - but Fable will always hold a place in my heart as a rare Gem from Moleneux.			"

												My Fable franchise experience was a little bit weird. I started by playing the newest ones instead of the first game....I started by playing Fable 3 and loved it, every single aspect of the game. Then on the xbox i tried Fable 2 and guess what...I thought it was just simple amazing, I looked back at Fable 3 and saw it was just lacking some things comparing to Fable 2.This year my brother said: ""Try Fable The Lost Chapters and you will look back at Fable 2 and 3 and see how much they are lacking compared to this one"" and soo I ended up cracking it and later buying it on steam.....I ended up falling in love and now i think how much my brother was right, compared to the other two I just  felt like this one had much more too give.Long Store Short:Just buy the game!

												~It's just like skyrim, only its 95% cheaper... my god such cheap.~Welcome to the world of Fable, this classic game wich was first released on the xbox made its way to the pc.I played this game for a while and bought it for the cheap prive of 1,50 dollar.I'm not going into full detail but see this as skyrim, you go on  quests, buy weapons, cloths ect.And you try to rid the world of evil.HEY  you could even marry and have a quicky with the mayor of the town if you like (wich i would recoment cause she has dem big boobies and money in dem pocket.)For what this game costs i would hily recoment buying this, you will have lots of playtime on your hands with this game,and it gives away that nostaliga feeling that games used to have when you played it.Best part of all, this runs almost on any pc.During steam summer sale its really cheap so i would buy it the next sale, you wont be disapointed.

												Pros:+Uniqueness from a lot of other RPG's during it's time; naming Karma and Stats+Smooth handling and mechanics work well+Rewarding feeling throughout the game; the choices I made, made me feel goodCons:-Sometimes hard to understand: hidden meanings lie in between everything-Difficult ""forces"" in the game; killing bandits make me good, but I wanna be neutral-Underwhelming short; for a ""your own story"" game to last only a few sittings? BleghOverall: 7.0/10Fable is a hard beast to understand at some points, you'll be going through the game and always feeling like you're getting ♥♥♥♥ done, but whether you're getting ♥♥♥♥ done for yourself, or just for the game's sakes is up for debate. This doesn't mean that you feel empty during it, killing the big figurehead and not killing the big figurehead makes me reflect upon it, and the game will at some points too.The ""forces"" of the game suffer as well, much like an issue I had with Fallout, being that you killed bandits or Ceaser's Legion, the pure fact that all that I did was just coincidental to trying to survive, I now pay the price by having forced upon me good karma, in this game, good luck achieving neutral status anywhere in the game, it'll take some work. The game is short, way too short considering The Lost Chapters was an update of the old game to make it longer, you can beat it in a few sittings if you're determined, and that's with consideration of secondary quests and ♥♥♥♥. Personal pet peeves always ranging along with the Demon Door's as well, perhaps that was their point but trying to unlock all of them just makes you feel like a tool.Don't get me wrong, it's a super cool game, I'd expect nothing less from Lionhead - the gods of Karma Games. But it can certainly feel pushed onto you sometimes.			"

												Music 7/10- This game has a good soundtrack. Lots of memorable songs that help to describe the tension or calmness of a situation that the game places you in.Gameplay 7/10- I got this game on the original Xbox, I loved the game then and I still do now, BUT there isn't much of a challenge to some of the major fights in the game. It might be that certain character builds are just TOO strong for the game or mabey I just played the game too much to even remember if it ever was difficult. Story 9/10- The original game had a great story, one that starts off simple and slowly builds to the main character finding out about his family and it's secrets. This game also gives you the choice to either be a hero or a villian and decide the fate of Albion and its people. Overall - Great game, if you're a fan of adventure rpgs then this game is a must buy. The game isn't too long but it is a fun game. However be warned that this game does have some minor bugs, for example on the final boss there is a choice you can make and it doesnt display the options, or in some parts the subtitles are shown but no dialoge is heard from the voice actors.

												WHAT CAN I SAY...... This is by far the best of the series, this game is full of magic, revenge and compassion as you start as a young boy waiting to avenge the death of his family.... This game is full of decision making which affect your overall outcome.... will you be a feared hero or a loved one, will you have horns coming out your head or surrounded by butterflys?? It's all up to you.... the story telling is remarkable, the creatures and characters are fantastic, the combat system is very easy to master and not all over the place like League of legends and other magic power inspired games....Once you have finished the storyline, you are free to keep playing and unlocking the other secrets of Albion.... I would still pay $20 for this gem....Warning....be prepared to lose a few days in front of your computer.... If I was to say anything bad, I'd say that the graphics are getting a little old...but that's it!!!Overall I give this game a 10/10...it's a classic and it's just too good!!!			"

												This game is a unique and one of a kind RPG that they developers were never able to recreate in it's sequals. It is really fun however it is exetremely short so if your looking for a game with more then 12 hours of gameplay then this game isn't for you. Also, a lot of music is reused in later parts of the game, which despite Fable's amazing sound track, does get annoying. Also the game is pretty easy considering the fact I can complete it without dying once throughout the playthrough. I still recommend this game, however. This is one of the only games besides GTA where you can randomly kill villagers for no reason, and you do get more gameplay if you try to find all the secrets without looking them up on the internet.

So naturally I jumped for joy when I saw Fable: The Lost Chapters on steam so I could relive the adventure... I completed the game in around 10 hours including the lost chapters section, if you loved or enjoyed the original fable back on Xbox then Im sure you would enjoy this just as much if not more but dont be sad if you complete the game within 2 seconds.Graphics - Good (for its age)Story - Epic (Best one out of all the Fables)Gameplay - Does The Job (for its age)Mechanics - Does The Job (for its age)Memories - Brought BackOverall - For the games age I'd give it a solid 8/10			"

												Awesome game! I played a lot of this when it came out for the original Xbox and I can say that the overall story is still enjoyable to play after some time. You play as a newly trained hero who investigates about the whereabouts of his family after he is saved from his burning village. Thoughout adulthood, you learn magic and combat and have the choice to be good or evil. I would say the graphics are pretty good and orchestral soundtrack is great. However, I should mention that the game is pretty linear (there are sidequests though) and the game seemed a little easy since it was mostly hacking and slashing enemies.To sum it up: great game with a good story. Game may seem a little easy, but if you like the satisfaction of hacking and slashing enemies, I say go for it.			"

												Quote from my friend: ""You haven't played Fable correctly if you haven't slept with a man."" Well, I certainly haven't played it correctly then... But regardless, whether you're playing Fable correctly or not this game is a classic. Fable deserves all the recognition it was given. It aspired to be like the Elder Scrolls franchise but fell short only slightly. Thinking of it's some-what tragic downfall over the years I let loose a tear of sadness thinking of what could have been, and how I wish I could give merit of equal value to the sequels... If only this game could have lived to its full potential, but hey I still enjoyed it, and few games have a soundtrack so original and memorable. Not to mention to voice samples... Get someone drunk in game and see what I mean, lol. "

												I really enjoyed ""Fable - The Lost Chapters"".I did play ""Fable 2"" first, and then ""Fable 3"".Not really a good order for me to start with, but it's ok.The game runs really well, graphics are good for an old PC game.There's most likely something in the game to keep you playing until completion.The story is nicely done, too.""Fable - The Lost Chapters"" and most other RPG games in general have lots of replay value. So if you're evil one playthrough, you can be good in a second one.The game is pretty straight forward, so you shouldn't get too lost if you pay attention.Overall, I'd give this game a 8.7/10I really enjoyed it, but it does contain some bugs/errors/glitches here and there.

												Every time I play Fable I'm pleasantly reminded as to just how timeless it really is. It's so damn good in my opinion that at least every 2 years I find myself playing it again, just to re-experience it and all of its stellar contents. In my opinion it's way up there in what I'd consider one of the best RPG's - if not one of the best games - of all time. If you haven't played it before, buy it and find the time to. You won't regret it if you're interested in good video games. I'll preface in saying that I've played this game far more outside of Steam, on both PC & Xbox, so I've more hours played this than what my profile suggests.The amount of dynamic freedom Fable offers you is unprecedented anywhere else even now. 10 years on, I'm still surprised by how much I'm allowed to do. Infiltrating a bandit camp? You can either shoot the guards to pass, or sneak in-between them. Further in, you then need to retrieve a uniform; which then allows you access to the base camp. But how do you proceed to the Boss's location? You can choose to kill all the bandits in sight, drawing out the elites, opening your passageway. How about you release captive slaves as a diversion, hire a group of assassins to do the work for you, OR acquire a pass from a shady bandit hiding in a dark corner for 1000 gold pieces. Which you can then kill him to retrieve your money. Or just skip giving the part where you pay him. And it doesn't indicate to you these options - it leaves it for you to find them.You've got all of the game's tight mechanics, and then on top of that it shoves this titanic amount of meta-content. Visit bars to play games like Blackjack, Pairs and a table-top golf-esque game called Coin Flick. Assist traders with their passage through the woods, seek out silver keys to open locked chests or pursue a treasure trail. Go fishing. Dig up some loot. ♥♥♥♥ some ♥♥♥♥♥es that you pick up from your nearby Inn. Oh, and CHICKEN KICKING, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There's just so much to love. The sense of culture is hilarious; the attention to detail, consuming. The story, soundtrack and characters are memorable ones, too, and after finishing The Lost Chapters - the game's rather large and only expansion, from which this edition gets its namesake - for my first time this weekend, I can easily say Jack of Blades is certainly one of the most appealing antagonists I've seen in a video game.I could write about this game for ages. One of the highest recommendations I could give for any video game out.TL;DR: If you are one of the few that haven't played Fable, go out and buy it. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome game. Period.			"

												It's the best Fable game but that isn't really saying much considering how awful the rest of the games in the series are. This game is dated as hell since its an Xbox game so you're bound to have weird compatibility issues if your PC and operating system aren't ancient. It's pretty fun though for a single playthrough. Every once in a while I give this another playthrough but I enjoy it that much. It's a very simple game though. The skills you can unlock don't really do much other than look flashy and you're honestly better off just upgrading your stats until you can slash every enemy until it dies.If you haven't played a Fable game, don't go in expecting much because expectations are what killed this game.

												Fable: The Lost ChaptersFable is one of the first M games I had ever been allowed to play when I was younger, and I believe that even now, it has aged gracefully. In Fable, it is simply astounding to the amount of interactions you can have with people. Sneer at them, scare the crap out of them, and children will run in terror at your approach. Or, become the saint that all love and respect, and give everyone a gift or two. Or, give 'em the middle finger and tell 'em to ♥♥♥♥ off. Then say sorry. Then ask a gay man to marry you. Reputation is everything in this game, be you good or evil, a good reputation for being good or evil is still a necessity. Or, live between the lines, but there are times that playing around with your alignment is not the way to go, and only one choice can be made. That choice, however, is entirely up to you.While the game does not entirely match up to some of the graphics of today, this game looks very beautyful and full of life, or death, especialy for it's time. The gameplay is very simple as well, and combat against multiple enemies can be fun, easy, very action packed once you get used to it. The replay value is actualy suprisingly high for the kind of game it is, and I'll tell you, I played this game on the XBOX dozens of times, each time telling myself I would become a different person, and each time, I found out something new about the game.I will say that if there is anyone out there who wishes to test their fantasy of a Hero or Villian, come along and experience the game that changed the way games were made. 9.5/10			"

												NOT CONTROLLER READY! WTF MICROSOFT?! COULDN'T YOU PORT YOUR CONSOL GAME TO THE PC WITH GAMEPAD MAPPING?!?!?!?I have yet to play the pc version, but after finding this out, I am turned off to play Fable: The Lost Chapters for the pc.*EDIT 3/26/2014*So I decided to give Fable a chance and so far playing with a mouse and keyboard is not so bad. Keep in mind though that I just started playing so I have yet to have any combat. I just wanted to say that Key  and Mouse isn't as bad as I thought.*EDIT 3/29/2014So I have been playing Fable: The Lost Chapters for a while and I feel like I must note that the game is great ALTHOUGH I do run into some difficulties due to where the actions are mapped. You might have two actions mapped to the same key, so you end up doing things that would didn't want to do. I thought that it was just me not being used the Keyboard and Mouse, but I still notice that I am getting actions twisted. I just want to make one thing clear thought, this is not game breaking. The game is still as wonderful as i remember. With added content waiting for me to explore, I am anticipating what I am going to encounter next!*EDIT 4/4/2014This will be my final edit for Fable: The Lost Chapters.After playing Fable for like the millionth time (probably 5th time), I have to say that i did enjoy the new content. The Lost Chapters added more to the mythos behind the game and I did feel like I wanted to know more. Something else that The Lost Chapters (TLC in short) gives you is a somewhat better conclusion than the original. Although I feel like they could have done a lot more with this expansion. In a way, it feels like its what the original game SHOULD have been rather than purchasing TLC again in stores.I know than when people first played this game, one of the main complaints was that it was a really short game, but I dont know, I clocked in with my 5th play through at around 18 hours, and im typing this right after I finished the game, no back tracking. Fable has a world that has SO MUCH potential, but the way it presents itself in the game seems as if it was half ♥♥♥♥♥, almost as if it was a blast talking about it, but the effort wasn't put into it. The way I see Fable is just a greeting to the world of Albion.Game play on the computer was difficult at fist. I had a lot of trouble getting my character to do what I wanted since some keys are mapped along with other actions, but the issue was resolved when I mapped the magic activation and exp orb gathering to the mouse thumb keys. Remaping my keys made the gameplay a lot better.Fable is a game that is a must play, wether you are new to the series or played the sequels. I recommend when playing this that you take your time, listen to what everyone (with a green glow) has to say. and explore the world.			"

												Fable is a groundbreaking roleplaying-adventure game from Peter Molyneux, in which your every action determines your skills, appearance, and reputation. Create your life story from childhood to death. Grow from an inexperienced adolescent into the most powerful being in the world. Choose the path of righteousness or dedicate your life to evil. Muscles expand with each feat of strength. Force of will increases with each work of wit. Obesity follows gluttony, and skin tans with exposure to sunlight and bleaches bone-white by moonlight. Earn scars in battle and lines of experience with age. Each person you aid, each flower you crush, and each creature you slay will change this world forever. Fable: Who will you be?			"

												Very good game. You can choose between good and bad. This also changes your skin from godlike with nimbus on your head to devilface with 2 horns on your forehead.If you only follow the mainquests the game is a bit short but if you try all quests and if you play it 2 times (good/bad) it has a moderate playtime.You start the game as kid and you will grow up while playing. Also with skin changing and a growing beard and changing haircolor. Story is good, gameplay is good. Game has a nice moneytrick which seems very planned by the developer.I have played it 2 times for testing both sides and the story really changes a bit, every side has his pros and contras. Check it out yourself. ;D9/10			"

												I was never able to get it to work on my main computer, even after countless hours of forum searching and troubleshooting. I had played it at one point on another computer at homes -and it was good- but after seeing how many people online have had issues with it, I wouldn't suggest purchasing this edition from Steam.

												A classic. Your village gets attacked by a group of bandits. Your sister gets taken, your dad gets killed, and a stranger teleports you to the heroes guild to become stronger and avenge your father. This game is such a good RPG if you look at the dated it was created.But then they ruined the whole Fable title. If you,re going to buy a Fable game, buy this one. The others suck.			"

												Now, I'm not one of those people who had this game ruined by the hype that ensued around its release, nor does this game offend me, I'm just voicing what I feel is so problematic with this game. Fable is essentially an action RPG, so I'm going to hold it to my standards of an action RPG, I feel that is only fair. Since Fable is an action RPG I guess I'd be best to start with its RPG elements. My biggest complaint is how shallow they actually are, they make Pokemon (the single player aspect that is, so the fanboys stop ripping my head off) look super in depth and complex. No thought needs to be put into leveling your character to make sure he can face the challenges ahead. The fun of RPG elements is having to make a tough call on what needs to be leveled to keep your character ready for the fights ahead. The thing is you can essentially max out the levels in every skill tree in one playthrough, this lowers replay value significantly, and eliminates the decision making aspect that makes RPG elements so enjoyable. Other action RPGs like Fallout New Vegas have max levels, so you have to making a decision as to what you're actually going to level up, this ensures the player isn't mindlessly filling all the bars on the stats screen, keeps the game interesting. All of the RPG elements are basically tacked on, and have little to do with your success in combat in any way more than how much damage you do, and how much defense you haveSo if the RPG elements are rather shallow, the game must fall back on its action, or combat. The combat in Fable is rather uninteresting to be quite honest. It has little depth to it as well, as it ends up being constantly clicking to keep hitting the enemy in the face, shooting the enemy or blasting an enemy wth some spell. *Correction* Enemies do have weaknesses, but I went the whole game without noticing a real difficulty jump from ignoring these weaknesses, rendering them pointless, since they failed to add complexity to the way I played the game. Enemies don't have stats that effect the damage you do to them, like if they wear armor or are immune to certain spells or elements or weapons. So little thought is required from the player to be successful in combat. The combat is so simple that it grew quite repetitive and monotonous very quickly. An in depth RPG system and nuanced combat would give players something to dig into, invest time in and master, but this game plays more like a really uexciting beat 'em up than an RPG.Of course there is player choice and morality, which has become a near industry standard in action RPGs. Just like the combat and level system, the element of choice is just as simplistic. Most situations have very black and white morality involved, which holds back a players freedom to construct a character that is anything other than a saint or a demon. While you are given choices, you never face serious consequences for these choices, so why should they matter to the player? One choice bothers me in particular, where *SPOILERS* you can choose to put on the mask or not at the end of the game. Instead of using some kind of prompt or better yet presenting this choice to me through the gameplay, the choice happens during a cutscene, and the way they handle it baffles me to no end. Why would you click the mouse to NOT put on the mask? Wouldn't you NOT click the mouse to NOT put on the mask? How is a player supposed to know it isn't just a regular old cutscene, this isn't conveyed to the player on any level.Fable highlights my problem with morality systems in general. Fable tells the player what is right and what is wrong, so the player doesn't have to think about this morality for themselves. The morality system should have been a hidden aspect of the game, working behind the scenes, so the player doesn't know they are being judged on a moral scale. If the player was making morality choices throughout the game without being told which options are good or bad, their actual moral alignment would come to light, and the game would make people think about the decisions they made. But since this game tells you immediately the good and evil options, people will choose what the game tells them is good or bad rather than what they actually believe, this morality system reveals nothing about the player, and has little bearing on the direction the story actually goes. People's true moral standing comes most to light when morality isn't in their thoughts at all. Since the morality system doesn't make me question my moral alignment, or have any serious consequences story wise, why should I care about making these decisions? I make decisions in the real world because I am concerned with their consequences.This game gets a lot of recognition for its charm, I'd credit the game's tone. While the story, characters and setting are not exactly super compelling, especially on RPG standards, the tone is handled quite well. The tone of this game lends Fable a pretty memorable atmosphere. The most prominent example of the game's use of tone is right from the beginning when a light hearted intro is suddenly cast aside by a quite jarring, uncomfortable and expectation flipping tonal shift as tragedy strikes the main character. This intro is a nice kick-off to the game's plot, and gets the player ready to start the game. Unfortunately charm alone can't hold up a game.I feel Fable, while not as offensively simplistic as its sequels, is still too lacking in sophistication on a gameplay standpoint for me to consider it a solid action RPG, and I cannot recommend it to anyone.

												The game is good though short, but buy Fable Anniversary instead, its the same game with upgraded graphics, and built in controller support. I also think this game should be played with a controller rather than a keyboard.  Im not recommending this game, because I would rather recommend Fable Anniversary.			"

												I bought it because it supposedly had an amazing story. Other than a few good parts (escaping from prison was cool), it was mostly memorable only for the annoyances. The ""Chicken Chaser"" joke was funny for the first three hours, but the repetition of the same voice acting wherever I went slowly drove me insane. The fact that ALL guards EVERYWHERE look and sound EXACTLY the same also killed any immersion and sense of exploration. It's like the kingdom got its guards from Kamino.I ended up skipping most of the sidequests and unlockables, and I look back on the game as somewhat of a waste.It probably held up better at the time, but it's no Bioshock. It's not even Skyrim's little brother in terms of story (and Skyrim only had a decent main storyline). Gameplay is surprisingly good for a game this old though (lightning!) and it has a blend of action and tab-targeting combat, so there's that.  I still can't recommend it though. Go play something else if you want gameplay, and avoid this one if you want a good story.			"

												It's taken me about 8 years to get around to it, but I've finally mustered up the desire to beat Fable: The Lost Chapters - and it's taken me around 10 years to beat EITHER version of Fable. It was my first (quasi-)RPG on my first game console; so yes, I do have quite a few fond memories of this game in my youth. Does that mean that this game gets a rose-tinted reccomendation, free from the burden of actual critique? Far from it.In terms of tone and presentation, Fable: The Lost Chapters is unique. It's one of the few fantasy settings in a video game I can think of that doesn't take much influence from Tolken: while some of the more tropey fantasy creatures such as Trolls and Nymphs are present, there are quite a few original creations, too. The artstyle and general world design echoes more traditional fantasy, giving the impression that one is, yes, in a fable. Top that off with tounge-in-cheek writing, a fantastic soundtrack by Russel Shaw, and vocal talent that is evidently from creator company Lionhead Studio's home town of Guildford, England, and Fable feels extremely fresh more than 10 years later. However, the mirror-sheen production values can't hide a game that is, for lack of a better word, pretentious. Every mechanic, encounter, and story element is played up to be grandiose and epic in scale, but after the first few hours, the game clearly is clearly struggling to swim to the deep end of the pool. The game's most notable feature, the morality system, is represented by ""good boy"" and ""bad boy"" scale (note: may not actually be what they are called in-game), and the extent of how much the game changes boils down to horns or a halo on your characters head, and wether or not townsfolk run away screaming or endlessly clap their hands above their hands yelling ""AAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYY"" (no, seriously). Most good boy points are aquired by saving people from attackers; most bad boy points are acquired by killing every non-combatant in sight. Even during major, story-influencing events, the choices are presented to you in a yes-or-no question asked by the game; the only remnants of what you did afterwards are an entry in your character's journal and villagers straight up telling you exactly what you did a few quests ago. The system is so arbitrary and easily-manipulated that you can go from villian to hero in a couple binary choices' time. Worried about a hard choice? Don't worry, the game will compansate you equally either way, so even if you choose not to do something that would be rewarding, you'll still get an alternative item or money for participating.The combat and leveling don't leave much room for role-playing. You can level up your hero's abilities ad infinitum; sure, you'll specialize at first, but what will you do when you've leveled up your specialities' abilties nearly all the way and have spare expirience to spend on less-leveled abilites? As a result, the game's combat becomes all too easy and boring very quickly, and never compensates for your higher level. The game at least tracks how you play, so it gives you a nice illusion of having your own playstyle by giving you a title based on magic, bow, and sword use. By the game's end, your character will end up the same mary-sue every playthrough save for how many good or bad boy points you've earned and what clothing from the game's extremely limited wardrobe you've chosen to adorn your character with. And the rest of the game is just fluff. You can get married! Except there is very little reason to unless you want to get underpowered weapons gifted to you from time to time. Prices vary between shops, so you can be a buisnessman and buy low and sell high! Except that the price range doesn't change all that much, and by the time you're buying and selling really expensive items you'll be rolling in too much dough for it to matter. You can buy houses and shops and rent them out! Except you make tons more money for completing quests anyway, and you don't have to go out of you way to pick up your reward that way. Maybie my nostalgia goggles are broken, but even after understanding that Fable: The Lost Chapters didn't live up to the hype all those years ago, it still managed to dissapoint me. The whole game felt like it was one big lie that someone was trying desperately to show that it was true. Given the precendence of Lionhead Studios and it's rather hyperbole-prone founder, I guess I shouldn't be too suprised. Well played, Peter.			"

												It would be nice if there was an absolutely clear indication of whether you can use a controller with a game or not.  I HATE USING A KEYBOARD TO PLAY GAMES!!!!!  That is why they make game controllers.  Fable Anniversary lets you use a controller so one would figure that this game would let you use one as well.			"

												It's very short. If you want a good RPG where you can choose to be good or evil, you should prefer knight of the old republic.Thanks to Beagán comment, I explain why I'm saying ""It's very short"" :Yes, i played it 28h but in fact i tried to compare the good and evil side, so it's more like 2x 14h. And I was very disapointed. If I read again :""Each person you aid, each flower you crush, and each creature you slay will change this world forever"" [...] ""Create your life story from childhood to death""but it's not very like that, the side you choose is not very important. And there is a big ellipsis from child to adult. So it's not a bad game but since I buyed it for that I feeled like I was lied.			"

												I think this game may have been great in 2004, but I never played it back then. Nowadays I don't like it mostly because of it's combat system. You have to score as many consecutive hits as possible without getting hit yourself, to get the combat multiplier up. Unfortunately when I see anyone attack it's far too late to get a block up/dodge. You can kill things this way, but it feels like button smashing to me. The flying nymphs who constantly summon melee fighters to attack you are incredibly annoying, as you can only hit them with your bow with the target lock on system, which i could not get to lock on to the enemy i wanted to attack but instead the nearest enemy, which was not the nymph but all the summoned melees.The good/evil choice system is interesting, i just couldn't find a motivation to do anything evil. I thought the hero suffered enough evil in his youth and got rescued by good ones to feel that good is the only path for him and there are no great rewards for being evil. BUT it's still better than Fable III which i could only stand for 2 hours before deleting it.			"

												The only reason i bought this game was because i was looking for games to play with a controller, and i remembered playing this on xbox. Of course i assumed it supported controllers, which is my bad because i didn't actually check to make sure. I tried to play it with mouse and keyboard, and it is horrible. If you can deal with the lack of controller support, then you might enjoy this title.			"

												Doesn't work with windows 7, even in compatiablity mode. Disappointing basue the game is fun too play without prior knowlage of any of the Fable games. Kept crashing in loading screens, now can't load saves. I have restarting my computer after every crash. Extremely Frustating.... "

												I am not reviewing this game in the perspective of ""at the time it came out"" or comparing the editions in any way. I'm reviewing this game as it is, for what it was to me playing it in 2016.TL;DR: I wanted to like this game a lot but overrall I couldn't get over how clumsy it is. I personally cannot recommend it to anyone. I'm sure it was more worth playing at its time, but in 2016 you have so many better RPGs at hand and this is not one of those timeless classics, which I truly thought it would be.To start, the save system is an absolute disaster. You can manually save the game while you play, but when you're in a quest you can ""hero save"" which saves your items and stats but not your quest progress. In any case, both of them are extremely problematic. It's not actually consistent what saves and what doesn't, and the game is in no way smart about making sure it saves properly. For example, at some point the game forgot that I had completed a side quest, but it remembered that I had used the items required in the quest.... so basically, it made the quest impossible to complete. On a later save, a bunch of my money disappeared but it remembered the things I had bought during that same session. It just picks and chooses what it remembers and what it doesn't, occasionally breaking an entire storyline altogether. This alone is a game breaker.Now to combat. Fighting against one enemy, combat is sort of fun. You lock on to your target, you can hack and roll and block to be a formidable fighter. As soon as 2+ enemies come at you, it all falls apart. Blocking becomes useless (actually, blocking performs inconsistently to begin with). The target system is supposed to let you switch between targets but doesn't realistically let you do that in a helpful way. Most players invest in a physical shield that uses mana as a defense and doesn't allow you to use your block; this to me is a screaming flaw. So to get through a wave of baddies without being seriously hurt, you need to use an overpowered spell and consume 10 mana potions? That sounds like a cheap exploit, not like enjoyable combat. In many ways, this game rewards you for overpowering easy spells and punishes you for trying to take part in actual melee or ranged combat.The enemies seem to be very inconsistent. You will face an enemy and find it easy to mow down, then moments later you'll come across another one and it seems to have infinite health. I don't know what the basis is, exactly. When you run into some bandits on the way to a destination and it takes 5 minutes to get rid of them in the same repetitive chop chop chop get knocked over drink mana put up shield chop chop chop sequence, it just becomes tedius. You can recruit some expensive mercenaries to help you, but in my experience the auto target likes to aim at them during battle. So I'll have ten generic looking bandits, each with a totally random mystery amount of health, swarming me while my auto-target aims at my mercenary or the person I'm supposed to be escorting to safety. What? How does that help me in any way?There are two cosmetic mechanics in the game that are really cool to a point but become rather irritating. First of all, your character ages each time you level up skills. This is an interesting mechanic, except that nothing else ages in the same way and it is way too drastic. By time you finish leveling, you look old and withered (you are 65). Meanwhile, everone else looks EXACTLY THE SAME. The children in the game are still children. This makes aging utterly meaningless; it just ruins your toon if you care about how he looks. The other mechanic is scarring: As you get damaged in battle, you develop scars over time. This is actually really cool, until you realize that your face gets cut up like butter. Given the awful combat system I mentioned, you are GOING to get attacked and after only a few hits you will get a new cut or your old cuts will become more prominent. In the end, it's just scratching up your character for no reason. The only thing that can stop it is the afforementioned mana shield which basically strips combat of any actual skill and devolves it into hacking at your opponent as fast as you can so as to avoid being hit, and gulping down mana potions if you do get hit.The characters in this game are f***ing irritating. There were a few funny moments that genuinely made me laugh, but for each of those there are dozens of nerve grating lines of dialogue. For a game that's so cartoonish and silly, there isn't really any heart to it because the storyline is entirely cliché and there isn't a single likeable or relateable character in the game There are a lot of small features in the game like the chance to buy and sell for profit, marriage, owning a house, etc. Unfortunately, all of them are mere distractions and offer no real depth whatsoever. Since none of the characters are actually likeable, and marrying one just involves pressing ""laugh"" ""flirt"" ""show off muscles"" and giving gifts, it is entirely purposeless. You buy a house so that they can live in it, or so you can rent it out for gold. Let's talk about gold: There is a memory game you can play in the tavern that is extremely easy to win and on which you can bet thousands of gold pieces. You can win all the money you need from it, making everything to do with currency in the game entirely meaningless. Why should I do quests boasts (an interestnig feature where you bet money on accomplishing quests with special limitations) if I can just make all that money from a game of memory? Why wouldn't I just buy all the best armor there is if I can get all the money I need at any time? Any progression pertaining to the spending of money is undermined. I think the best example of how this game tacks in random features to make it seem better than it is is the experience orbs: When you defeat an enemy, it leaves experience orbs which you collect for experience. Well, why the hell are they little orbs which I can miss? Why wouldn't the game just allow me to have the experience? That exemplifies how the game sort of makes ""features"" out of non features. Why would I choose to be evil when it'll literally be like ""save this person or brutally murder them?"" Why would I buy and sell for money when I can gamble for it easily? Why would I choose to be a swordsman or archer when I can just acquire some overpowered spells?The sad thing is, for all the roleplaying features the game boasts, there is actually no real variety in how you play. Things are pretty much predetermined for you, and the choices are an illusion or a gimmick.I dare anyone who thinks I'm not being fair to this game to look up a strategy forum. Pretty much any serious player used loopholes, exploits, or overpowered spells in order to play the game and do well. If you want to actually play the game in the way it presents itself and that has meaning to it, you will probably find it isn't worth the trouble.Altogether, I'm glad I finally got around to playing a game from the Fable series just so I could check it out, but I don't plan to actually finish the game as there is no reason to do so.

												What a broken POS this port is. No controller support? Really? OK, fine, that's how you want to play, whatever. I can wait until something better comes along.Enter a Steam Controller, just purchased yesterday. OOoooo, maybe now I can play Fable again! Installed it back, and now it just crashes, every single time I try to play. It's a fun game, but it's not worth this bullsh*t. Uninstalling, and if I were able to, I would be getting a refund for this broken piece of crap.			"

												Clickorgy during fights. If you fail at a quest you cannot start directly at that quest again but start somewhere else in the map where you have to run a lot and kill the spawning enemies over and over...or you can just zip through by clicking the middle mouse button - since then no enemy can harm you at all. It´s ok - but gets old after a while. Nice soundtrack, nice art style. Seems open world, but isn´t. Quests don´t make sense - rescuing traders has no consequences to the further game. It gets very tedious after some funny skits (like expressions or different things to wear).			"

												The game has decent graphics and as a Fan of the console versions of Fable this would have been added to my collection of the Fable series, sadly It didn't make the cut. Thought my computer is portially to blame. Not having a controller function made it rather hard to play (compared to the other fable verisons) I would've been nice for controller support. I love the fable series. Hopefully they can update the game (having been 4 years since it's release).			"

												You've read enough reviews of this game, so I'll get to the point. Your so-called moral choices are 100% cosmetic, literally. Unfortunately, this game's core selling point is a mere gimmick. To top it off, Lost Chapters has zero controller support and even with all the side quests, it's very short for an rpg. My recommendation is that you play rpg's where choices actually matter, hence, anything but Fable series.			"

												Overall the game is pretty addictive and fun to play.The only thing that is extremely frustrating to the point that it pisses me off is theway the enemies attack later in the game. You have to be super on point when it comes to blocking and moving.Otherwise you will just get hit repeatedly and it will affect your multiplier quite often.In the part of the game with all of the skeletons, they pop up from under the ground right before you and attack you over and over and over and over right as they come up. You can't block it and you can't avoid it unless you slowly creep along the pathways and hallways. That is extremely stupid in my opinion and a total waste of healththat you can't avoid losing.Other than that, the game is pretty fun. I have played through as a good character, now I'm playing through as evil.Once I'm done, I won't be playing it ever again. It's sorely lacking on player experience.			"

												To start off this game is good, BUT may saving for me does not work, its story is ok but has some issues (I have not seen much of the story though). The world was pretty good but since saving didn't work I don't know about the whole map. As I’ve said this game is good but it has flaws, mainly that I can't save, maybe cause I have windows 8 I can't save but I will say the combat is great, probbly the best bit of the game.                                                                              4/10 Ok but has issues			"

												About the worst camera work I've ever seen being put into an action/rpg game. The moment you enter any sort of cave your entire field of view starts shooting everywhere. The friendly AI is trash, the enemy AI is trash, and the only way you might ever die by their hands is if you get swarmed by them like a bunch of ants. And that happens a lot, pretty much anytime when you're in a quest. I'm not going to comment on the voice over since everyone has different preference on that one, but it does get repetitive quickly. I'll say one thing though, for a PC port it runs rather smoothly, so I guess that's a plus.			"

												This is a game which could have been decent (even though it really shows its age). Unfortunately, the user interface is very poorly designed. To add insult to injury, the save system is probably the most idiotic that I have ever seen. You can save only very rarely in predetermined points (that you don't always know about). If any mission is a failure, the only option is to redo it until it succeeds. Ignoring failures is not even an option. The silliness of the ""moral"" system is not better either. There are no moral quandaries: just choices between ""saving the kitten"" and ""crushing the kitten with your boots"". Stupid. Poor design.			"

												Ran it on Windows 8.1 While it worked great the first time I ran it and even played for 3 hours, when I tried to run it the next day the game became unplayable because of contstant crashes right after the intro movies which prevented me from even getting into my game.Yes I tried all the possible fixes suggested, including all types of Windows compatibility mode, Data Execution Prevention, rerouting sound through motherboard. Every time it crashes you ""Verify integrity of game cache"" and there is always one file missing that redownloads. But it just doesn't work. Sometimes a combination of fixes works randomly but the very next moment if you quit and restart, the same problem comes again. I don't want to waste 2 hours everytime I want to play just to see what will randomly work today.Too bad. I was so excited to on a journey through Fable's world and all hope was shattered. From the little I experienced I found it to be delightful but alas! I wish I could get a refund seeing as how Valve stills puts the OS compatibility of this game as Windows XP or later in the store page.			"

												No controller support on a game that was made on a console with controller support. Use xpadder I guess. Nothing new has changed other than that on this game if you were one of the millions of people that bought this game more than a decade ago on the promise from its boneheaded creator that it was gonna be the most amazing thing out there with so many features (that sadly weren't in the game). You run around killing monsters, following a moderately good RPG story and do other stuff as well. Such as collecting, playing mini games and choosing wheter to be a good or bad guy. Most games do what it does better and just to name one around the time that this game out was Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. The Knights of the Old republic game also  was better on the rpg aspect and really letting you feel like you're making good choices or bad choices. The second fable to me personally was a better investment than this, but if it happens to go on sale you should buy it. After all we here at Steam believe in racking in as many games on our library and completely ignoring them when other games we will ignore as well go on sale.			"

												I wish there was a ""I liked it but I don't think it's worth getting"" option. I've played through this game three times, two to completion; and the third time is why I don't recommend getting this game. My first time I played a warrior, the game was a piece of cake. I had like two points in mage and so when I got to the point where you had to used ranged -- it was slow and I went through a ton of healing potions but doable. The same thing with playing a mage. If anything after a few levels it was beyond easy to run around and basically wipe the floor with anything that came close. There's lots of threads that talk about how OP mage is for good reason, the game is a cake walk with it.But the third playthough I wanted to do a pure archer. Only turns out you can't. There are certain quests where you will get mobbed even trying to be extremely sneaky and one shot people with max range -- certain quests essentially require close combat. I don't mind when a certain combat style or class, is overpowered and much easier to play through. In fact that's sometimes a plus; but to have a whole class be nearly impossible to win with does bother me. I don't actually think you can complete the final boss battle as an archer -- it's again structured to give an advantage to mages and warriors who can take damage close combat style. Maybe I'm missing something, because there's certainly gear and setups for all three combat styles, but it just feels like range is really underpowered throughout. Overall, you really do become insanely powerful proportionally quickly. The later levels were honestly overly easy, even with the additional content added, I still breezed through it all. Wearing plate as a warrior you're essentially invulnerable; and you can get several swords that can single shot almost everything. There's no real challenge to the game.That all being said -- I consider it ""adventure game lite"" in that it's short enough to beat in an afternoon and have seen all the content and feel satisfied that you played a whole game. Excluding silver key and demon door hunting there's about 7 hours of content per playthrough, which makes in a nice fix for wanting to play a RPG but not wanting to invest 100+ hours in an elder scrolls game.I would say it was kiddie -- but there's enough sexual innuendoes, and a brothel outright at one point, that make it rated-M and so it just falls into a category where it feels like something I would let a kid play as introduction to the genre but it has moments of being a little to edgy for that.Pros+ Easy difficulty+ Good lengthCons- Unmemorable story- poorly balanced combat triangle "

												The game was one of my faves when it was released. Unlike most RPGs, there were immense amounts of choices on how to build, and essentially, how to play as well. There is a main storyline, of course, and a presecribed path to take, but the game does sell on its promised choose your destiny format.That said, gameplay is quite broken in general, and takes adjustment if you wish to scrape by without the broken aspects. For instance, you can make money simply buy buying and selling stuff to the same shopowner, as his stocks of items fluctuate the cost. Additionally, the most broken skill in the game is Physical Shield, as it not only keeps you from taking any damage at all, but you don't get thrown around, and you never lose your precious combat multiplier, so long as you chug mana potions, and that helps break the game wide open for you. But, in general, any character can grind to the point of being all-powerful, with some time invested, of course, as any build path is open for any character, as even though ""Being good"" or ""Being bad"" does influence your skill pool minimally, it's even more minute because fluctuating between good and bad is not difficult (especially for being bad...). All that aside, the game was pretty much the first game to give a hero any type of plotline choices that I saw, and I must commend them for that. However, the game has a poor look for being released on Steam nowadays, and only diehard plot enthusiasts or general gamers who want to experience it all will enjoy this. I had to buy it for old time's sake, and while it has managed to accrue a bit of playtime, I don't see many out there enjoying this for what it's worth in this age of gaming. I really don't know of anything like Fable still, and I enjoyed it more than Fable III (haven't played the others...), but getting through the early game will be hard to weather through to get to the better parts of the plotline and become strong enough to feel less than some shrimpy character at times. In my opinion, casters are very underpowered, partly because Physical Shield is so overpowered, and will sap your mana if you don't kill things fast enough as a caster. The other paths get so much more powerful, and I don't see why you'd even bother. Still a huge step in the right direction for a choose-your-own-path type adventure, but there is still a clearly prescribed path, like any adventure with an adversary. It just has good areas you can stray from the path a bit, and they will effect your destiny in various ways.I checked... I played it on Steam for 2nd most hours compared to any reviewer, and that's not all that much... I don't know what that could mean for certain, but I'd guess that the majority of reviewers who upvoted it are in it for the nostalgia. It was a good game in its heyday, but I believe that the strengths of this game would be overshadowed too much by its weaknesses in today's gaming environment, even at its lower price. There are a number of games that deserve being carried over into today, but while this one is on the fence for me, I'm leaving my opinion where it was; This game doesn't hold enough appeal to stand out amongst today's games.
