My ImpressionWords cannot even begin to describe what I feel for this game.If you have ever been in love - that's the closest it gets to describe it <3.I may sound like a game-addict, but that's just not it, you have to play this game to comprehend it.SummaryFor those who don't feel brave enough to face the wall of text (warning: this game is like a wall of text itself and the Second Chapter will be even more so ;-)), still have a look at the verdict, please.  Positive Mediocre Negative   + Great story ~  slow at times     + Living world       + Interesting NPCs       + Fun quests   - easily missable   + Breathtaking locations       + Loveable characters ~ you have to part with     + Enjoyable combat ~ moving is mostly a waste of your turn     + Beautiful artdesign ~ old textures     + HD Graphics in dialogues ~ for important characters only     + Goosebumps music    The StoryOver 50h in length (it took me 52h) spans a grand story which isn't even over after this but leaves you craving for more.Basically, it is a quest to find your father, who was on an airship, which suddenly vanished from the skies. So you try to achieve this by stepping into your father's shoes and start your job as a so-called 'Bracer' - a kind of unofficial law enforcer. Therefore, you start out with your pair of siblings as 'Junior Bracers' and try to fill the hole left by your Father. This brings you closer to him and the mystery of his disappearance.Sometimes slow, just like a walk through forests and mountains with your friends,then rapid at others like zillion things suddenly making sense, events you thought might happen, come about and people do things you never thought they would do.Breath-taking and like magic keeps you in the world for hours without letting you goThe WorldIt's a big, living world; there are interesting quests, NPCs and locations everywhere.The NPCs were very special to me - some already know things about you (yeah, sounds blurry, but I don't want to spoil anything), some might remember you if encountered before. I have to add, that I really tried to speak to every NPC - whether he would sell me something, give me a quest or just chat with me.That I did every quest possible (though I failed once or twice - since you always have a timeframe depending on your main questline to do sidequests) was just natural - I was motivated to do my 'job' and help the people of the country.Ancient towers, beautiful lakes, magnificent towns, military buildings, rocky mountains, dark forests, misty valleys make up the scenery around you and there is even more to see.The CharactersVery different individuals but every one of them loveable and enjoyable.The two lead characters are Estelle and Joshua Bright, with Estelle being the main character, so to say. On your journey, you encounter multiple other characters who will join your fellowship. It was always hard for me to lose old comrades and gain new ones as I didn't know those and just got to love the ones I used to have with me (looking at you here, little T <3). After all, that's one of the things that makes this game very special to me.The CombatFirst of - I hate turn based games. The second thing being - I loved the combat in this game.Sounds strange again? - I know, but manipulating the flow of the fight by using crafts {1} or arts {2}, just focusing attacks on the next enemy, deciding whether to heal or attack when between a rock and a hard place - it makes the turns feel exciting and gets your heart racing.Additionally, this game also features elemental-based advantages, so if you fight against a plant-like monster, fire attacks will most likely 1-hit the cabbage. Naturally this works both ways, so don't think about attacking the water-guys with fire attacks and be wary of their attacks in case you modified your defence to fire. Nevertheless to apply this, you either need the knowledge, where the Monster Book comes in handyor a quartz {3}, that let's you see enemy stats (I used the latter for the whole game).Sadly here is one thing I didn't like, i.e. that moving your character costs you the full turn, It was really annoying and I ended up using the moving in only 1 or 2 fights across the entire game, which is a bit sad but makes you try to position your characters by attacking certain areas.The 'Retry Offset' (downscaling on losing fights) is another nice feature for those who don't like dying over and over again without seeing any light in a difficult situation. On the whole, this game is about the story and not the combat so you shouldn't rage about it and dislike the game because of one single fight.Definition of TermsCrafts are unique special abilities of each character, they use 'CP' (Craft Points) which you get by attacking or being attacked. At 100 CP you can use an even more powerful S-Craft, which gains power as your CP-bar rises, up to 200 points.Arts are the magic in this world, you gain access to magic depending on the quartz installed in your 'Orbment' (a device for using arts).Quartz is made of so-called 'Septium Crystals' (a secondary currency/resource), they come in different elements and strengths and feature bonuses to your basic abilities like Attack and Defence and grant you access to arts.The VisualsI won't call it graphics, this game is old and you can certainly see this. However this is the PC version, so you won't have problems playing it on 1080p, the text is easy to read, the graphics of the faces (only for important characters) are magnificent and most importantly - the style matches the game and enhances the atmosphere perfectly.You can certainly see that much thought and love was put into designing the whole world and every interior. Well, to be honest, the trees in the forest don't exactly look hand-placed, but who cares about that anyway?The SoundYeah, this gets an extra bullet-point, because every time I start up this game I immediately get goosebumps - I think that's enough to describe it.Moreover 'The origins of light' (or 'of the stars') is just a beautiful soundtrack and by far not the only great one in this game.The sound really adds to the atmosphere in the game.The VerdictLast but not least, the game is extremely fun and at the end of the day that's what matters in a game  - having fun.I finished this game with a smile on my face and tears in my eyes, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry - the best ending ever in the video games I've played.I advise everyone to get this game and enjoy the magic journey of the Trails in the Sky[www.trailsinthesky.com] :-)NoteIf you have read this far - thank you.I hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.My review for Trails in the Sky Second Chapter.

												Alright, kiddo, here's the deal with the deal. You want more JRPGs on Steam, right? Of course you do. You have your Final Fantasy, you have your Agarest, you have a few others, but you want more. I want more. We all want more. Guess what Trails in the Sky is. That's right; a JRPG. You buy it, you tell publishers ""hey dudes look there's a market for this genre.""And are you the type of person who sees a bunch of games starring rugged white guys with guns and gets sad that there aren't more female game protagonists? Well, you see that person with the staff and the ponytails up there? Guess what that person is. Female? You bet your sweet buttery biscuits she's female. Her name is Estelle. She's pretty interesting. And there are three other playable ladies in the game. They're all interesting also. And there's four dudes as well, and all of them are interesting. Everyone is really frigging interesting.""But I don't want to give money to some jerky big-name game publisher. Who is getting my hard-earned regional currency?"" Wise up, you dingus; your hard-earned regional currency is going to XSEED. You know how awesome XSEED is, mofos? Really really awesome. More awesome than you and I put together.As for the game itself? Alright, fine, let me serious up for a minute. *ahem*Call me odd, but when it comes to JRPGs, I'm the type of person that prefers strong gameplay over a strong story. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with video games as a storytelling medium (hell, the entire genre of visual novels exists for this exact purpose), but if I really want a good story, then I have both a library card and a Netflix subscription to take advantage of. I play video games because I want to, you know, *play a game*. Because of this, I'm much more likely to enjoy - as well as replay - JRPGs that favor complex gameplay over a compelling story (Pokemon, Golden Sun, Final Fantasy V) than JRPGs that favor a compelling story over complex gameplay (Lunar, Earthbound, Final Fantasy IV).The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is one of the only exceptions.That's not to say that the gameplay is bad; think of the battle system as a cross between Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy Tactics. It's fun, it moves at a good pace, and it features the *classiest* damn battle music I have ever heard. The thing to be aware of before diving in, though, is that the game is broken up into five chapters, with each chapter having its own locations, dungeons, sidequests, enemies, and so on. Once you complete a chapter and move on to the next one, you can't go back, meaning that anything you missed is now completely inaccessible. Even within the individual chapters, the sidequests (of which there are a TON, a plus in my book) have relatively small timeframes; there are also a bunch that aren't even listed until you happen to bump into them, including a couple that make me seriously wonder how anyone at Falcom could think that players could complete them all without a guide. While the sidequests are, of course, optional, they do offer some nifty rewards, challenging battles, and humorous cutscenes, and if nothing else, it's frustrating to be at the endgame and be missing only one or two entries in the bestiary or recipe book.But Trails in the Sky features quite literally the most vibrant, detailed world of any JRPG I have ever played.This game has an immense amount of text, and XSEED did an absolutely wonderful job translating it for English-speaking audiences. Be aware that the story is not fast-paced in the slightest - it's a slow burn with an emphasis on character interactions and world-building. Because of this, the cutscenes in Trails tend to take a long time, like many other entries in the genre, but the writing is so strong and the characters so likable that you won't mind at all. Even beyond the main characters and story, you rarely have to go far to find an NPC with something interesting to say - not a whole lot of ""Welcome to Corneria"" or ""Press Start to open the menu"" here. (Protip: reexamine each treasure chest after opening.)Interesting characters. Vibrant world. Stellar soundtrack. JRPGs. XSEED. Come on.			"

												Unbelievable world building and detail, well-developed characters, careful deliberate pacing (although slow due to having to set up a huge saga as its first entry) and a well-written script all contribute to creating a world that pulls you in and is populated by characters you care about. Despite the huge amount of text in this game (yeah by the way, stay away if you don't like reading) I found myself savoring each and every line in the game, even those by random NPCs.It's like reading a good fantasy novel, it really is the best world building and such work that I've seen in a JRPG, most likely ever.That would be reason enough to jump in, but the RPG underneath that world is also fun, balanced, and somewhat nostalgic. Battles have that ""everything matters"" feeling, a sort of mix between a strategy game and a traditional RPG system. Character progression is tied to the story, but gets really good after about the midpoint in the game, and battles ramp up in strategic scope as you go along.Overall, this should not be missed by fans of JRPGs, or anyone that enjoys good narrative and world building in video games, especially the more literary types who are accostumed to diving into fantasy novels and taking in all the details and workings of a fictional world to heart as it slowly unravels in your head.By the way, the random NPCs who roam around the village and such? The soldiers? The innkeepers? They have character arcs.Character. Arcs.That's all. There's no overstating the narrative and world detail that goes into this series.Get it.			"

												Should you buy this game? So glad you asked. Yes!Should this be your very first JRPG? Yes, but... read on.*My recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG. This was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned... *****  World of Zemuria: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)For this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?This game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.XSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. With the problems they faced[xseedgames.tumblr.com] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.Warning for the easily offendable: This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.***** Playable characters: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)You get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.So what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. All in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.Warning for the lazy: The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).Warning for time-constrained: Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.Warning for the romantically inclined: There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. ***  The gameplay : a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)What I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!With that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a guide[www.gamefaqs.com] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. Warning in general: achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!Warning for time-constrained:  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.*TL;DR: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).*Thank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)			"

												Trails in the Sky, or Sora no Kiseki, is an expansive RPG trilogy with massive content - very well done world-building and well-paced characterization. The story begins slowly and quietly with Estelle and Joshua, along with a couple friends. The pace picks up during mid-game before ending with a fantastic finale. The story does well in holding an epic scale while at the same time remains personal where it’s needed, as Estelle and Joshua travel together and develop themselves. It’s pretty clear that Falcom’s ambition is to create a tasteful unified world for all of their Kiseki games. That is something I really value.Estelle is pretty annoying, to be quite frank. But regardless of that, she’s a very well-developed character with a lot of personality depth. To compliment her stubborn and hot-headed nature and balance out the personality chart, there is her ugh … partner, Joshua, who is usually quiet, calm, and very clever. Their interactions and relationship in general are a pleasure to watch. The rest of the cast consists of very well-distinguished characters too, but I’m going to let you decide that. SnK isn’t the only game with well thought-out characters for sure. All I’m saying is, Estelle and Joshua are one hell of an enjoyable pair.The battle system is a mixture of traditional turn based and grid based battle system. Aside from the usual RPG combat elements, the grid provides the players with a lot of depth for strategic combat decisions, regarding space and sometimes even time. In terms of combat abilities, the characters are also very well-varied and well-balanced, allowing a lot of customization to suit your playstyle. Not to mention that the Quartz system plays a big role in determining each character’s combat abilities as well.If you love JRPGs, you should definitely give Trails in the Sky a try. Despite the slow beginning, I promise the deep world-building and character interactions will keep you engaged.			"

												Now this is one of those games that scratch that nostalgia itch, nostalgia for times when I was a decade or two younger and all I could ask from a game was to tell you and let you participate in a story that's worth being heard. You will find no shiny loot to show off to your acquaintances with, you will find no quick instant gratification here. If you seek that, go grab the current flavor of the month blockbuster.What this game has, and in spades, at that; is the world, the characters, the story, the music and a lot of subtlety. Oh, and a boat chase scene. It has a boat chase scene.Moving along, this isn't a game to be played with half your attention elsewhere. You're going to miss on a lot if you don't really pay attention. And when I say you're going to miss a lot, I mean both quests and entertainment. The character interaction, while scripted, is a lot more natural than is typical for the genre, with off-hand remarks, interjections, under-the-breath murmurs and such. The protagonist duo, again, not typical for the genre, does well to avert the usual ""Brooding Bishonen with Baggage"" protagonist problem with JRPGs to a large degree. Also, it is not a story about a couple of kids saving the world of useless adults; It's more about a couple of kids getting swept up into more than they bargained for, and doing their part.The combat can get a little repetitive at times, hair-pullingly frustrating at others, and just plain annoying at others still, because, dammit, I was in the middle of something and now this bunch of mobs is trying to interrupt me! Still, the possibilities with the customization of every character's magic setup along with the option to interrupt an enemy turn with your own limit break makes for quite tactical combat that can get you away with your skin even from a surprise attack.The storytelling is detailed and at times quite persistent, there are several scenes that last for about ten minutes before you're back to the gameplay, but again, with how naturally the characters converse, it doesn't feel off.  Now, the story itself does get a bit overwhelming at the halfway point, but if you've been paying attention, you can see many of the twists coming; or rather, you will figure out that there will be a twist; the twist itself is still likely to sweep you clean off your feet. Oh and by the way, NPCs travel around the world too, and remember you if you met before, and the subtlety of the worldbuilding is amazing. For a minor example, at some point there's a restaurant where you can hear that recent problems with monsters are making it hard to get ingredients for their dishes. If you don't take care of that problem, they  will actually go and change their menu (and the items you can buy there).The music is simply amazing, but that's nothing new for a Falcom game.Now excuse me, I have a New Game Plus to play. On Nightmare.			"

												Final Fantasies, Front Missions, Suikodens, Saga Frontiers, Vandal Hearts, Chrono Trigger, Shin Megami Tenseis, Fire Emblems, Breath of Fires, Grandias, Tales, Xenogears and Xenosagas; in all I've played easily over 50 jRPGs. And if I had to name the best jRPG I've ever played, there's no doubt in my mind- it is The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky. Forget about cult classics Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 7- they were very good games to be sure, but just don't measure up to this little gem. The only jRPG that comes close as far as I'm concerned is the original Suikoden, and even then I'm aware that's mostly my nostalgia speaking.On to the game itself: its combat is serviceable. I know that's not much of a recommendation, and it shouldn't be; the tightness of their combat systems has never been a main draw of jRPGs. In this genre, combat is usually more relaxing and cathartic than engaging, and while there are exceptions in harder games or game modes, the way to beat those is more brainy puzzle-solving than high-octane action. Combat in jRPGs mostly serves as breaks between storytelling segments, and the combat for The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky does an excellent job in that regard; you can dodge encounters when you don't feel like fighting, if you're underleveled you'll earn a lot of experience and catch up quickly, and if you're overleveled combat will provide very few rewards, signalling that you're more than ready to advance the story. Tip: Speed is the best stat, seek to boost it with your orbments.The cast of companions is good but not hugely memorable; besides the two main characters, there will be high points in your cast of companions like the devious Scherazard and low points like the dullard Agate. This works just fine, because the spotlight throughout the game is shone on protagonists Estelle and Joshua, and the mystery surrounding their father, Cassius Bright. I won't go into detail because spoiling the story would be criminal; it is hands down the best story I've ever seen in a jRPG, and probably the best story I've seen in a videogame, period. It is full of intrigue, misdirection and foreshadowing; in a fantastic deconstruction of jRPG tropes, not everything foreshadowed ends up coming to happen, as your group only sees an incomplete picture of a complex puzzle, and their interpretations of events and what's going on behind the scenes are merely educated guesses- which sometimes hit the mark, and sometimes don't. When the end of the game comes along and the storylines unravel, I was flabbergasted; I couldn't stop thinking about the game for weeks.The game's writing is delightful. In jRPGs, we've grown to expect either shoddy translations or faithful translations of shoddy original dialogue. Not here; the lines the characters speak always feel authentic, like something people would actually say in their situations. When Estelle and Joshua are playing the part of the rookies, travelling alongside a more experienced Bracer, it is brilliantly reflected in the story and the dialogue; there's a myriad of small details which Joshua and (especially) Estelle might miss, but a more experienced Bracer like Scherazard wouldn't. When a more senior bracer pulls rank on you, you can tell that they have good reason to do so (except when Agate does it. He's just a jerk).There's a bunch of optional quests to complete throughout the game in the form of Bracer assignments; some are fairly straightforward, others require more lateral thinking, and one in particular just about requires looking up the answers on the internet. Yes, the stupid library quest for finding the missing books. These side quests are okay, but nothing to write home about; the heart and soul of this game is in the story and the writing. The places you visit, the people you meet... it seems straightforward, but then it hits you in the face and you realize it was a curveball. Not always. But just often enough to keep you on your toes.If you have any interest at all in jRPGs, do yourself a favor and play this game. It is the best the genre has to offer.			"

												The Legends of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, a game I randomly found on the steam store which caught my attention.When I bought this, I never expected something like this game.The first in its trilogy which I recently learned, the second of which being released on steam around 2 weeks ago as of writing this, which reminded me to actually play this game again and see how the story went further.For more than 10 months, I've been missing out.I would abbreviate it but that's a no-no in this case.At its core, Trails in the Sky is more or less a strategy-RPG. What I mean by this is that when you encounter enmies, there's a grid-like field on which your characters can move around as well as the enemies, but there's also an overworld in which you can walk around, shop, do sidequests, as well as other things.Graphics and Visuals:I'm not really sure how to put it. I really like the artstyle and the character models, or sprites. I'll just go with sprites. The character sprites kinda look like dolls. Which I don't really see all to often, and I really like it. The artstyle is rather simple which works. But they aren't exactly remarkable. I mostly remember the areas for what's in them, and not for how they look. There were also a couple of graphical bugs and in some cutscenes when someone walks away they just suddenly pop away instead of moving out of the screen. As well as some waiting in their places until they come around and say something, as if it were some sort of stage play. Not to mention, considering the game itself is quite old. A PSP game if I remember correctly, so the framerate isn't all too fast.Now, one thing that just drags the visual quality up are the effects. Just look at ANY art attack or S-Craft and you'll know what I mean, but more on these things later.Overall: 7/10Soundtrack:Alongside with the story, my favourite part of the entire game. I'm just going to say it bluntly to ye alright?This game has my favourite soundtrack of any video game ever.Words aren't enough to describe it. Just. The arrangement, the instruments, holy flipsticks it's SO GOOD.Just a whopping 10/10Edit 11/3/2016: Played SC, has better soundtrack. Still a 10/10 though.Gameplay:Edit 11/3/2016: Realised this is a review, not a tutorial. Edited the gameplay sectionI'll try to keep this quick and simple. Standard RPG stuff. Combat has regular attacks, magix (or arts) (fire, wind, earth, water (holy crap avatar), time and I think space and mirage? The latter 2 elements definetly exist, I just forgot whether they have attacks or not). You move around on a grid of some sort and you can unleash a special attack once you got enough CP (Craft Points, not Cheese Pizza. Sheesh). So that's all regarding combat. The rest is what you'd expect from an RPG: Sidequests, people to talk to, etc. The dungeons aren't the most impressive either (they tend to have a REALLY simple layout)Overall: 7/10Story and CharactersBefore I say anything else, I must say that this isn't an RPG that you should play for the story. Don't get me wrong, I really like the story, but the story, well, simply gets the job done. This is an RPG that should be played for the characters. The characters are all well written and are also a joy to read. Each character goes through some growth (some more in SC than in this game), and has some sort of value to add to the party.Overall: 9.5/10Enjoyment: 9/10The characters and story are definetly what make this game. The gameplay also works and is pretty enjoyable, but IMO, the story takes the cake by far. However, like I said previously. There's quite a bit of backtracking, but that's mainly in the sidequests. So I can't give it a perfect score. But despite all that. I can say that this game takes the cake for my favourite JRPG. Atleast until I get to play Trails 2.Overall: 8.5/10A definite recommend for people who like RPGs and love a good story. The gameplay is also pretty fun (though not the most detailed) and you can mess around with some things. However, if you don't text masses; I suggest you stay away.			"

												Updating this review now that I've finished the game and there have been a bunch of fixes.The game was updated with support for XBox 360 controllers. The controller mappings are perfect and everything works seamlessly. That the dev continued to support this game after what was a totally adequate release is amazing. (Bug fixes, high resolution character portraits, higher res menus, and I'm sure other stuff I'm missing.)I've finished the game at this point, and it was 50+ hours well spent in a meaty and memorable JRPG.Good:+Great in Big Picture+Fully compatible with 360 controller+Great music+Good graphics (if you're into retro)+Save anywhere+Varied quests and side quests with interesting outcomes and unexpected twists+Exceptional dialog and character development (even on ""fillter"" NPCs)+Great, incredibly detailed story+Difficulty level is right on - there are no ultra frustrating battles, but when you die there's an...+Option to retry after wiping your party in battle (this is a HUGE plus for me)+100% chance to flee battleNot Good:-Battle system can feel pretty slow and the music is super lame and repetitive-Annoying low level enemies will interrupt your travels often (but again, 100% chance to flee)-The 3/4 view is weird and can be disorienting since the camera angle changes oftenOverall, this is an exceptional JRPG with a ton of awesome dialog and a really meaty story. I'm impressed and highly recommend to JRPG fans who don't mind a LOT of reading mixed in with gameplay. Really looking forward to the second chapter after that unexpected cliffhanger of an ending.

												Making its first appearance on the western market only in 2011 on the PSP, Trails in the Sky First Chapter is a game originally developed in 2004 and in many ways shows its age, from its rudimentary (yet pleasant) graphics to the slow battle animations. But these small things are nothing compared to the merits that this gem of a game shows.First of all let's start from what sets this game apart from all other JRPGs: the WRITING.This is some of the best writing I've seen in any jrpg; unlike a lot of other titles, the dialogues actually sound like things people would say in a normal conversation; while some of the dialogue might seem a bit superfluous and pedantic, every line and event shows a deeper meaning in the long run and you'll be pleasantly surprised every hour about how natural the interactions between the characters sound.Which brings me to the second biggest point of the game: the characters.The main cast of the game is exceptional: the members of the party are more or less all representative of a certain trope (the Genki Girl, the rude but tender-hearted warrior, the Spoony Bard etc.) but they all have interesting quirks about them and falling in love with all of them is pretty easy. Every character has a personality of its own and a role to play in the story. Even the NPCs (ALL OF THEM!) have their own name, personality and parallel story going on in the meantime.The game presents a level of detail hardly seen in the genre, and the lore is simply astounding. The world of the game presents a very complex socio-political situation and an interesting history spanning more than a thousand years, with so many different elements (cultural, religious, economic etc.) that give off an organic vibe usually present only in novels.The gameplay side of the game, while it's nothing overly exceptional (it's a 2004 game after all) is well made and fairly entertaining. The battle system is some kind of hybrid between Grandia and Xenosaga, you can move your characters around the battlefiled almost like in a tactical jrpg, and every other turn you can get a bonus like HP healing, critical hits and so on. The battles are pretty easy (and a bit boring) in the beginning but things get quite different after enemies become stronger and more difficult to kill and you have access to more interesting and complex spells and crafts. At the end of the game things can get quite challenging, and there's a boss battle in particular which will feel extremely satisfying to win.The ability system of the game is quite similar to the one present in Final Fantasy VII, you have these orbs called Quartz, and according to the combination of the Quartz's elements you can access different spells in battle (and also get some passive bonus like +10%HP and so on)The plot of the game is very solid: unlike most jrpgs where you have to save the entire world from catastrophe, the action is restricted to a single kingdom and there is no thousand-years old deity to slay at the end of the game; the game presents and more ""humble"" and personal story where two young adventurers set off to a journey to travel around their homeland and end up finding a lot of unexpected things along the way. Nevertheless it's quite intriguing and after a certain point in the game you'll keep playing to see how things turn out in the end.The Good:- Superb writing- Massive and interesting lore- Complex and lovable characters- Good battle system- Story packed with intrigue and mysteries (after a few hours, though)The Bad:- The pacing of the story is not always perfect, and you might yawn a few times during the first hours- Slow battle animations- So many missables. Getting everything in this game without a guide is a nightmareIn conclusion:PLAY THE GAME IF: You're into jrpgs, good writing, engaging stories, and you're not afraid to delve into something that might be a lot more complex than you thought.DON'T PLAY THE GAME IF: You don't like reading and have little patience for a plot that takes a while to evolve. Also if you hate cliffhangers.Overall, I'd give this game a 8.5/10. One of the best surprises of the recent years!			"

												One of my favourite games for the PSP has finally started to show life again by having the first chapter arrive on Steam after 3 years!It features the main character Estelle Bright and her adopted brother, Joshua, as they go on a journey to follow in their father's footsteps become Bracers, who are basically a request guild (or oddjobs, if that makes more sense, but in a more justicey kind of fashion) that lets you explore the world and its rich self-contained lore. The game presents its characters in a bright fashion that can't help but make you feel attached to them, especially well done with its two main characters, but its not limited to just Estelle and Joshua. As you go on about your adventure, you'll meet interesting characters (including NPCs, yes, they have personalities! Take that, Skyrim Radiant AI) from all across the land all while protecting your country and its Queen.The games boasts a big +50 hours worth of core gameplay, not including the many sidequests that are set aside for you to take on later, which are inhernt in any kind of RPG. It plays as a strategy RPG, similar to titles like Disgaea, minus the crazy numbers and level grind, but it has the unfortunate drawback of being a bit slow and takes its time before being more than just natural button inputs during battle. While there is an interesting crafting system such as the quartz (basically materia if you wanna go by Final Fantasy 7 familiarity) and weapon skill crafting, it doesn't help the in-game combat to be more exciting and only forces you to sift through more menus and text. I'm hoping the second and third chapter will add more to it to help create much more needed combat management in a S-RPG, nothing crazy like Phantom Brave, but it definitely leaves something to be desired as its main strengths are the incredibly large amount of dialogue. I'm so sorry, Xseed translators, that you had to put off second and third chapter off for so long because of the scary amount of texts.EDIT: Whoops, probably should've worded that properly to avoid any confusion. I'll just clear it right now. I AM SO HYPED FOR SECOND AND THIRD CHAPTER THANKS TO CARPE FULGAR, AHHHHHHHH. That'll fix it.If you have a love for old school type of JRPG that have memorable characters, such as Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 4, or even Tales of series, then I'd definitely would say its worth investing in this trilogy.

												I played the original release of Frist Chapter back in 2006 and the Second Chapter in 2008, and now my son (4-yr-old) is playing the re-released on Steam. On a glance this is one of your staple JRPG: cute and seemingly clueless though motivated protagonists, tactical turn-based combat, heavy text-based menu and stats/mechanisms. But beneath that thin layer of disguise, you would have one of the most wonderfully made story-driven RPGs with a plot as dark as the Witcher series (dare I say) you have ever played--if you play all three entries you will reach the same conclusion.Needless to say the story goes beyond the good vs. evil scheme, but characters in this game also evolve in a believable way. They are very aware of the changing world and interact with each other in meaningful ways. Suffice to say you won't find any one-dimensional character in this game, be it a protagonist or antagonist. Also worth mentioning is the quality of English translation, which I believe has been to be marvelously done by professionals. It's almost like a re-interpretation of the source material--if you will--in Japanese. This definitely sets this game (and most likely its sequel--Second Chapter and the 3rd) apart from the likes of Final Fantasy and such.You will probably find choke full o' troupes or cliché common to comics and mangas in this game:- shadowy groups with profound motives beyond human comprehensions and far reach to every corner of the continent by all means fathomed by only the most conspiracy-minded individuals in the creative industry,;- mysterious enemy combatants ranked in number not by sheer strength but their legendary reputations;- villains turned out to be activists manipulated by a greater force each step of the way without a clue;- etc.However if you can look past this and accept that most of the deeper story-driven games are more or less like this, and it's only a matter of expertise to conceal the usage of these troupes, then you will have a wonderful time like me to explore this universe--its lore and its characters. Not to mention this is one of the few REAL steampunk themed games available on PC, or even the entire industry, consider it being a niche not generally looked into. And if you are concerned about cliffhangers since this is the only the first entry, worry not--for each ""chapter""(game) conclude its story in a satisfying way, while foreshadowing the next one and leaving room for a respite and a sense of achievement.Gameplay wise, this game sports both open-world (opened up gradually in the first 5 hours) and meaningful character customizations (able to be re-speced at any time) through assemblies of clockworks and gem-socketing (thus comply to its Steampunk theme). Enemies are varied and requires certain tactical thinking in the manners of both character positioning in the battlefield and strength/vulnerabilities of each enemy type. Character progression is also non-linear, meaning there's no hard coded class definition, so you can have detailed customization of each character's role, while everyone still has their unique specialties.Aesthetically this is one of the more pleasing JRPGs you'll ever come across. The graphics have been remade into HD and its aesthetic design definitely takes cue from both contemporary and mid-19th century old-world life, and the visual design does a great job taking care of every minute detail in 3D and the textures are excellent if you take into account of the fact that this game is made in the early 2000's.The soundtracks have been one of my favorites and it certainly sounds like it 's heavily inspired by the work of Academy award winner Joe Hisaishi.To conclude this review, I would absolutely recommend this game to all RPG enthusiasts, even if you don't usually touch JRPG. When you do, make sure you endure through the first 3 or 4 hours of this game after which point the story really starts to pick up its pace.Final verdict: first chapter of a deep and story-driven steampunk RPG trilogy, 9.5/10.

												This game is pure fun, especially now that most of the crashing issues are fixed.So, the game. Mostly, it's an exploration and dialogs where the fun lies. And books. But there's a light turn-based tactical combat, although it's far more simple than any other established title in the genre (FF:T, Agarest, Disgaea, etc.).Story progression revolves around the Bracers Guild quests, with some optional sidequests picked around the town(s). To sweeten the pot, there's a magic system based on Quartz crafting (similar to materia system from FF7) and cooking.Also, it has a wonderful soundtrack.This game was quite thoroughly polished from it's original version released in 2004, with a lot of additions from the later PSP release (some features are coming down the road, after release). Sadly, it had some rocky start, but now it runs quite stable and very smoothly (it's an old game with low system requirements), but it holds very well, especially with new high-res fonts.In conclusion, if you're looking for some refreshing JRPG with very detailed world, characters and story-oriented gameplay, you MUST try it. Also, every sold copy will help to bring the rest of the series outside Japan.			"

												I'm not really a reviewer, in fact I think this is probably my first one. The reason I feel compelled to write is that hopefully my voice will be heard, along with all the others, that will force XSEED and Falcom to ensure that the full saga is localised in English and released on Steam.There is still demand, even now, for a well-crafted, fun-to-play JRPG with a memorable story. This game is one of them.The story is a beauty, flawed maybe but still compelling enough involving central characters that I found I actually gave a toss for. The battle system is fun, didn't really get old - the S-Crafts (Limit Breaks, if you will) are always fun. A big plus for me is that there was very little grinding required and success was more to do with how you tactically approach battles that helped you overcome your enemies.There is plenty of sidequestery to indulge in, indeed I don't believe I collared everything and there's also a New Game Plus for a second, tougher playthrough - which I'm just about to have a go at.Essentially, whether you're a fan of JRPGs or not, wondering if they're still relevant in this age, it's still a great game.

Trails of awesomeAdventure awaits you, maybe not adventure of your lifetime, but one not easily forgotten. You go through hardships, kill monsters that nobody can take on but you, explore world and do good deeds, mostly of protecting folk, but most importantly you talk, and oh boy if it isn't the best kind of talk, the one you have with your best buddies at your best times. Estelle is your girl for all fun talk needs, but others help too, NPCs aren't NPCs, they are people, they have names, histories, characters and something to say on every subject. Liberl is alive and oh so real.Battle system is interesting, creative, complex, at times unfair, but always fun.Cooking is helpful, even if coming by ingredients is problem of sorts. Magic is something of your creation, as it depends on what orbs you craft and which ones you put on.Sidequests are for the most part not bad, some even good. You get to play detective a lot.To borrow from Estelle's treasury of sayings:- We can kill three birds with one stone!Three birds being: fun, good read and engaging gameplay.We need the second chapter, pronto!

Posted: June 11, 2015
Long story short: One of the best narratives in any RPG, coupled with engaging gameplay and aesthetic. Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky may be a bit too long and forgiving for some, but is the most perfect game to get for anyone looking into the JRPG genre.SPOILER-FREEI haven't played too many JRPGs apart from Final Fantasy VII, Fire Emblem, and a butt-load of Pokemon games, and I've also never played a game before in the Legend of Heroes series, which has been going for nearly 30 years. This game was originally released back in 2004, and only got an English release in 2011 for PSP. Before we get into mechanics, aesthetically it feels like an older game. Textures and models are a little low res, characters are 2D sprites, and may look a little strange with texture filtering, and the audio may sound more like MIDI loops at times. I also found that with 16:9 resolutions, sometimes you'd see the void past the skybox or the world in the corners of the screen. That being said, the art style itself is vibrant with expressive character portraits, and the music itself is very catchy. The regular battle music does not get old, which is always a plus. Even with some of the technical issues from being an older game, it still has a unique charm to it.The gameplay itself has you walking along areas with monsters lying about. Touching an enemy (or getting touched by it) enters the battle, similar to Earthbound, and you can approach it from its back to get an extra turn. This allows the player to avoid encounters (and in fact the game is very forgiving, as you can run away from battles, no risk, no cost). Each of the game's chapters takes place in a different region, and generally you'll be hanging around in each area for a bit, doing a few side quests presented to you (which may count for about 30% of gametime). Side quests are presented via a bulletin board, and give a time limit on how far you can continue with the story without losing the quest, which is nice for those new to the game to know about.The combat takes place on a grid-based board, where characters can move towards enemies and attack in 2D space. Characters have magic attacks which take time to charge (costing EP), and have special abilities which can be instantly casted for CP (which is earned by dealing or receiving damage). Every character has an S-craft (a limit break ability) if they reach 100 CP, which becomes extra powerful at 200 CP, and they can execute these not only on their turn, but also in between anyone's turns. On top of that, special effects like critical attacks are attached to a certain upcoming turn, and the player can use arts magic and S-breaks to try to swing those effects to their favour, adding another level of depth to the combat. Since the overall game starts a bit slowly, it gives the player plenty of time to learn these mechanics, and to understand how they fit together. When the player dies, the game is very forgiving, as you can just restart a battle from how it started. The game also enables a feature by default where restarting a battle like this lowers the skill of the opponent by a bit, making it easier to beat them. Dedicated players should turn this off, but I believe this feature works well for keeping the story flowing.Magic and equipment are mostly given to you throughout the game. There exist shops that sell these items, but money is a bit scarce in the game to do that all the time, and it ends up just being easier to find these items on the field or by doing side quests. Generally equipment is clearly better or worse than other equipment. It purely comes down to which one has the better numbers. On top of that, some later magic items are clearly better than others. Fortunately, you only get 6 magic slots per character, so deciding what kinds of magic each character uses is interesting, as they can not only give types of spells, but also passive bonuses such as extra HP or dexterity. This concept is pretty fleshed out, and gives the player a lot of room to experiment with different strategies, and trying to find playstyles for each character. Overall, the combat is very interesting, and is presented quite nicely for new players to the genre to get into. It's also not insultingly simple, so you'll feel good doing combat, and since you can run from encounters easily (apart from bosses), you'll never feel that you're just grinding through an area.But the biggest draw of this game is its story, mainly through how complete every character seems. They all have motives, they all have personalities, and quite a few of them develop. Generally, each party character is introduced in a chapter of their own, and they all have small story arcs as they try to overcome a problem that they're having. The two main characters, Estelle and Joshua Bright, are incredibly engaging to follow on their quest as they head to each region to become senior bracers. There is a clear goal from the beginning to end of the story, and it feels complete when it everything comes together in the end. Those two characters are some of the best written that I've ever seen in any video game, and I wish I was exaggerating that statement. There's a motif of growing up echoing through every scene of the game, and it's expressed heavily through these two characters.While each chapter of the game is its own mini-story, each with its own new characters, villains, and locales, there is an over-arching plot that I won't say anything about. The two main characters end up getting pulled into this plot through everything they do, and it's quite clever how everything ends up in the game. Overall, it's a little cliched, but the writing itself, as well as the strong personalities of the characters keeps it from feeling bland and rehashed.The world itself oozes personality too. NPC characters are witty and all have personalities too, and generally world events, even those that happen before the game's story, all echo through architecture and dialogue. The strongest part about all of this is that you don't need to play any other game in the franchise to learn this; it's all introduced fluently and succinctly. The most amusing part are the comments that display when you try to check an opened treasure chests. I won't spoil any, that'll be a treat for you.I'd recommend this game to anyone, particularly if you've never played a JRPG before. It's charming, it's engaging, and it's complex enough to be interesting without alienating the player. It's extremely forgiving with its quick saving and difficulty tweaks, and its story and world is so captivating that it's hard to stop playing. And it's $20, which is a steal for its length of ~40 hours.RATING: 3 UP, 0 DOWNSMy up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals). Ups relate to how much good a game has, and downs are how much bad a game has.[/table]  0 UPs 1 UPs 2 UPs 3 UPs   Not worth playing, skip it Alright, play it if you're into the genre Very good, play it if you're looking for something worth trying One to go down in history, a must have for everyone[/table]  0 DOWNs 1 DOWNs 2 DOWNs 3 DOWNs   Nothing detrimental in the game A few things wrong, but doesn't ruin it Kind-of broken or aggravating, you may not be able to put up with it Very, very broken, a lesson on what not to do "

												Brought this to support XSEED and friends in their brilliant effort to localize this great series. The Kiseki series prides itself on its immersive worldbuilding and attention to small details (no NPC left out, seriously), and of course, spinning up an epic tale. Sora no Kiseki/Trails in The Sky FC (First Chapter) by itself may not be brilliant or epic in terms of story when compared to other entries in the Kiseki series, but every decent tale needs an exposition. FC is the hand (for a lack of better term in my head) that will pull players into the world of the Kiseki series. Story aside, the combat is dynamic and deviates from the usual and monotonous single button mashing. On the first playthrough, players will need to pay attention to the battles or risk having the mooks wipe the floor with them. On subsequent playthroughts at higher difficulties, mainly nightmare mode, this also applies, even if the player has acquired end game tier equipment. Those who are obsessed with optimizing their party will spend a lot of time on orbment customization. There are also many sub quests and secret sub quests that players can undertake to obtain both better equipment as well as other tidbits of info that contributes to world building. Completionists should be satisfied with the replay value this game offers. The game's OST is done by Falcom's own jdk band and there are quite a few iconic gems in the game, keep your ears opened and you won't be disappointed.All in all, FC is but a prologue for the epic tale that spans over seven other titles. If you are a first time player of the Kiseki series, give this game a shot and see if you're hooked enough to play the sequel which should be translated soon. You won't regret jumping on this train (well, maybe a little bit. You'll be waiting for a long time if you don't know either Chinese or Japanese. The scripts for each game are pretty big). For long time fans of the series who have disposable income. Please get this to show support for those gutsy enough to translate these games for the peeps who weren't fortunate enough to try out this great series all these years.On a more technical note. Game is crashing way too often. Three crashes during the prologue scene is a bit concerning.			"

												One of the best RPGs I've played in years. Never played any games in the Legend of Heroes series before but since the game was by Falcom I thought I had to try it. (Falcom developed Ys, Xanadu, and various other series, they very reliably make quality games)I really enjoyed the combat system, it's got a nice mix of strategy rpg features while remaining fairly simple to understand. Positioning and pushing enemies around becomes important quickly, and making up good combination attacks on the fly is fun. There are randomly placed bonuses for each turn which force you to play differently each time (criticals, etc) and adapt. One negative though is that there is no way to skip or speed up attack animations, this can get pretty annoying fighting large groups or once you've played the game a lot.After the sluggish prologue the overall pacing of the game is great and the enemies and bosses stay varied throughout the game. Sidequests feel connected to the main game and give you worthwhile rewards. I wish the difficulty selection was available from the beginning though. I'm sure normal difficulty is very easy for some RPG veterans, I found it a bit easy but still died a fair amount of times. I felt like I was only just getting the hang of combat by the final boss, so I wish I could've started on hard.I enjoyed the characters in the story, none of them felt overly generic or annoying and there's a good amount of character development and surprises. The plot twists are well done in that they all have some hints towards them, nothing really comes out of the blue so paying attention to details is rewarded. The story leaves some questions unanswered but that isn't much of a negative if you get this now since the sequel (Second Chapter) should be released by the end of this year.			"

												I've been playing JRPGs for about 20 years now, and Trails in the Sk is one of the best I've played in that time. It was wonderful back in 2011 on the PSP and it's even better now on the PC.If you want a JRPG that defies convention while retaining a classic, yet complex battle system; Trails in the Sky is for you. If you want a JRPG that holds your hand, gives you a win button and features cookie cutter characters talking about darkness and the world of hearts; Trails in the Sky may not be for you. But hey, you might want to give it a try and see what JRPGs are all about once you move past the ridiculous conventions that Square Enix has fostered over the last decade with Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts.But most of all, support Trails in the Sky to get more JRPGs on Steam. Trust me when I say that Japanese developers and publishers are watching the PC space. A lot of JRPG players have moved to PC and have wanted to see the genre make the jump for years. We're seeing a few games hit the PC, but it's nearly not enough. With Trails in the Sky, we can send a clear message to all the publishers and developers that strong story-based JRPGs have a home on the PC and that it's well worth the investment. But first, you have to invest in Trails in the Sky and it's a good investment.			"

												I play games for a few reasons, but first and foremost, I play a game for its story. A game with a poor story can't be saved by amazing graphics or awesome gameplay. However, if the story is good enough, I can forgive a lot.Trails in the Sky may not have the best plot in RPG history, but it more than makes up for that with incredibly strong writing. The dialogue is amazing and each character gets several moments to shine; the main protagonist especially is incredibly fun. The combat system is really interesting; the orbment system superficially resembles FF7's materia system, but it works really differently in ways that make the game a lot more strategic. The actual fights are most similar to FFX, with some really cool wrinkles.The soundtrack is amazing, the controls are great, either with a mouse or a control pad and the graphics, while dated, still really work. This is the first half of a duology; it's already one of my favorite games and from what I've heard, the sequel is EVEN BETTER. If you like or even tolerate JRPGs, you should definitely give this game a shot. It's really really good.			"

												Disclaimer: This is my favorite JRPG in the entire universe, so please take this review in the spirit in which it has been given. Please forgive any potential fangirl squeeing.LEGEND OF HEROES: TRAILS IN THE SKY (Sora no Kiseki FC)WHERE TO BEGIN?!This is my favoritest of favorite JRPGs. Ever. Seriously. There is not a JRPG I love more than this game, though I suspect that the release of SC may change that--you know what, no. Technically SC and this game are the same game, Falcom just had to split them up! So it still counts! I'd be willing to even say that FC is one of my top ten games of all time, regardless of genre. Considering the other games in that list include the original Fallout, Baldur's Gate II, Chrono Trigger and several other games widely regarded as ""best game ever,"" that should tell you something.Trails in the Sky (Sora no Kiseki FC) is, on its surface, a pretty basic story with a fairly basic game attached to it. It looks unassuming and pedestrian on the surface, but that is simply because it hides, biding its time, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. And strike it does, and when it strikes, it strikes hard! Trails in the Sky is a fairly standard high fantasy story set in a world of political and military intrigue, but it is also the story of how two goofy teenagers grow up and mature into capable adventurers over the course of the game. But that doesn't even really cover much. The meat of the game is in its writing and story--and there's a lot of writing. Gobs and gobs of dialog and story; even the sidequests are usually fully fleshed out rather than a simple ""go collect twenty bear asses"" that tend to plague older RPGs just as much as they do MMOs. Even unnamed filler NPCs will commonly have multiple lines of dialogue. Trails is one of the very few games where I really feel like the characters are having an actual human conversation as I play--complete with interruptions, asides muttered under their breath and a collection of emotive portraits for most named characters that really helps convey the tone very well. Obviously the conversations in this game are scripted rather than chosen by the player, but they just feel very natural and real. The story--oh, the story. It starts out very simple, a basic pair of greenhorn adventurers, Estelle and Joshua Bright, new to the Bracer Guild, a group of unionized do-gooders and monster-hunters, learning the ropes and working their way to full bracer status. Over the course of what will easily end up being a 50+ hour playthrough--even on my fourth playthrough, with prior knowledge of the game and using an achievement guide to get a maxed-out save file ready for SC, I still logged 42 hours on my file when the credits rolled--you will see the story shift from hometown heroes retrieving a stolen jewel to helping with a school festival, to busting a thieves' guild and unraveling a real-estate scam. And it only gets better from there, culminating in an epic yarn that spans political intrigue, military secrets, ancient technologies and the remnants of a lost, highly-advanced culture. With all of this going on, the story starts out very light-hearted, but slowly darkens over time, growing more and more serious, setting up for the Second Chapter's much darker overall tone.Writing teenagers is really quite hard, but Falcom and XSEED's localization staff really pulled it off fantastically. Estelle and Joshua feel genuine, like people you could really meet one day. Estelle acts goofy, makes realistic and understandable mistakes and Joshua is the archetypal bookish boy (though of course his story is more complex than that). The level of realism in how the plot handles having teenage main characters is actually really impressive. The two leads contribute a lot to solving the major cases they're assigned to by the Bracer Guild, but they've always got backup from more experienced and powerful adults. They're told reasonable things about their limitations, and they reasonably and realistically fail. A lot. The fact that they mess up and they experience real consequences as a result is something I love about Trails. This isn't the usual ""little kid saves the world, adults are totally worthless"" sort of story that seems to happen with annoying regularity every time you've got a teenager as the protagonist.It's also, at least to me, as a ""girl gamer""--that being, a female human who plays video games, of course--a treat to play such a fantastic game with a female protagonist. Especially impressive considering how old this game actually is--Trails was originally released in Japan in 2004! There aren't even very many games today, in 2014, with a locked female protagonist you can't change or play as male. In 2004 they were practically unheard of. That wins a lot of points from me personally, since I don't have a lot of money for gaming and I generally choose to spend my limited funds on titles with female protagonists over those with male protagonists.Even as much as I love Trails, it's not perfect. It has some flaws, but none of them are dealbreakers by any stretch of the imagination. The PC Steam version has some weird bugs that the PSP version doesn't have. Some of these bugs are related to the fact that the PC version on Steam is the original 2004 PC version with the PSP features backported into it. Running it on Windows 7 and 8 results in weirdness and I understand a lot of XSEED's delay with getting Trails FC and SC out had to do with making the engine behave in an operating system not called Windows XP.My biggest single gripe with Trails is the combat. No, I don't dislike the combat, but I think it's a bit too simplistic on the surface--I wish they would have gone with an AP system instead of a ""single-action, single-turn"" system. I like how the turn order changes based on different things you do and your stats as well as the use of S-Breaks to ""cut in line"" to get specific turn bonuses. All of that was really great, but I do wish they gave you a pool of AP to combine things like positioning or aiming spells and abilities without having to wait 5 turns to finish up the hit. Using an AP system would have made the combat a lot more fast-paced and enjoyable. The boss fights are still very fun for the most part, even with the SAST system. It's mostly the trash mobs you face in the field, especially when you get into a fight with a big♥♥♥♥♥group of eight damage-sponge mobs. It got so annoying at points where I'd waste Joshua's field-wide S-Craft simply to get through the fight quicker without losing XP and sepith.So yeah. A lot of breathless fangirling in there, to be sure, but I'd like to think this ""review"" might actually be useful to someone interested in buying the game. My advice? BUY IT IMMEDIATELY. RIGHT NOW. THEN PLAY IT UNTIL YOU COLLAPSE FROM EXHAUSTION. Because it's that good. The Trails series has become Falcom's biggest money maker in Japan and the only way we're ever going to see more of the series than Sora no Kiseki FC and SC is if we vote with our wallets!			"

												I'll make it very clear now before I proceed: Trails in the Sky is an excellent JRPG I hold in very high regards. With that said, let's move on aye?I have played some great JRPGS, even some counted as the best this world has ever seen. Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 6, the Tales series, Star Ocean and the Quintet trio. The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the sky... definitely has the right to stand amongst them. It's not the best JRPG I have ever played, but definitely somewhere near the top. I'd even say this is one of the best games I have played in 2015, on Steam, and definitely on the PSP. But aye, my word is no fact, so let's list a few reasons:- The story is really good, albeit predictable at times. This is even more complimented by the EXCELLENT characters. Every character gets enough development, and have some sort of relation with at least one of the characters, which makes everything fall in place. Especially the main duo, Estelle and Joshua, are great characters. You just can't wait to see how they develop throughout the game.- The gameplay is good. It doesn't really do anything bad, but not anything outstanding either. But every character feels different from each other, and this is further distinguished by the orbal system. Want your Estelle to be a healer or a tank? That's where the orbal system comes in. S-crafts and S-breaks also have the potential to change the tide of battle, and it's exciting to see these attacks pull off.- All locations, towns and dungeons feel different from each other. They are fresh, and never feel like a drag. You can even explore some of these locations before doing them in the main quest, netting some neat equipment and making the journey even easier.- Quests feel varied and never really boring either. There aren't even too many quests that involve killing a certain amount of monsters, so there's no need to worry about that.- The game can be finished in 30 hours, but why would you? The game has so much content and if you want to do everything, it can easily go up to 40 or 50 hours.There is only one negative I can think of when it comes to this game: it's a completionist/achievement nightmare. Unless you use a guide, there's bound to be something you miss, resulting in you missing more than just one achievement. I am not an achievement hunter at all, but even then it's pretty discouraging to see that you have just missed some tiny pieces. I got the feeling that I talked to everybody, and even then it wasn't enough.Overall, a really great JRPG I recommend to everybody. Can't wait for part 2 to come on to Steam!			"

												Trails In The Sky is a JRPG from Falcom, a cult classic developer that's been churning out diverse and well crafted role playing games in a variety of styles (from action to strategy to dungeon crawling to metroidvania) since the Nes days. Joining all these games are equally diverse and gorgeous soundtracks from the developers in-house band/sound team.Trails In The Sky's biggest twist on the jrpg formula is that it's actually well written...Falcom you madmen! How do you ever expect some crazy gimmicks like ""a good script"", ""foreshadowing"", ""plot twists"", ""humor and whimsical moments that are actually funny"", or ""character development"" to ever catch on in the anime/game biz? Obviously this is why you guys are so obscure.Oh yeah and the battle system is really fun too and both the story and gameplay are nicely paced, if you don't mind a ton of reading. But let's be honest, you're mainly playing this to see Estelle and Joshua grow and develop as characters along with their relationship.The cute, sweet, funny, slice of life bits are honestly the best part too. So I'm happy it stays that way for about 40 hours, hahaha.Go play it. Best Jrpg I've ever played. Can't wait to play the rest of the trilogy!			"

												Oh man, I remember playing this back on the PSP. :DThis is a JRPG that was originally released back in 2004 on PC, 2006 on PSP and also on Playstation 3 in 2012.I'm really happy to see this released again on Steam with new features and it even supports the new higher res displays. It also supports the XBOX 360 Controller, too. Nice. :DThis game is brought out by Nihon Falcom, known for the legendary JRPG series, Ys.If you remember playing RPG games on the original Playstation 1, especially games like the Grandia series with the exploring style, then you will get used to this game right away.The story is great, the detail is amazing, the sound score is awesome and the game brings a kick back nostalgia  feeling. What more can you want? :DOh by the way, for anyone who wants to know how to set up the game's options properly, you have to run the game's configuration tool from the Steam client. There you will have access to change the filter, resolution, button mapping and more.Grab this game while it's on sale, it's worth it. ^ ^			"

Then you're in for a treat.The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is fantastic if you want your JRPG goodness done right. Nothing new, nothing special, just good quality entertainment to be found. Can't recommend any more than this. Please buy it so we can get the whole trilogy in the US.			"

												What an adorable and progressive story. I think the best part about Trails in the Sky is that the people are people. They're not just archetypes. They're developed, with feelings, and personalities, and they are, with the exception of one, all very relateable. It follows a few various tropes, but in the end you really are engrossed in the life of becoming a Bracer (the guild being super helpful law enforcement officers; reminiscent of the police I encountered when studying abroad in Japan). The story doesn't revolve around you, it evolves with you. Things are happeneing in this world, and the party isn't the focus of those events. Your characters strive to rise to the challenges presented to them, and though the storyline and paths are linear, I didn't at all mind being guided through such an enchanting tale with thought-provoking characters.Light-hearted and childish, this game can be understood by preteens and teenagers, but much like any good story, it has underlying themes and issues that adults can grapple with and appreciate.From the bisexual bard whose bisexuality is not the defining characteristic of his character, to the strong, bull-headed, stubborn female protagonist, this game does a pretty good job of showing me a world I'd want to be a part of, and was glad to have experienced, if only for a little while.

My Impression:Words cannot even begin to describe what I feel for this game. If you have ever been in love - thats the closest it gets to describe itPositive:+ Great Story+ Living World		+ Fun quests, missable (adds extra fun of finding them)+ Breathtaking story and locations that keeps you in the world for hours without letting you go - just like magic+ Loveable Characters+ Enjoyable Combat+ Great music		Cons:- Don't get to battle with the same characters throughout the story. Story dictates who is in your party, no swapping.- Moving wastes your turn and is useless during combat- You could say graphics, but it's a port and an old school style JRPG, so not much of a conTLDR:The game is extremly fun and thats what matters in a game at the end of the day - having fun.I finished this game with a smile on my face and tears in my eyes, I didnt know whether to laugh or cry - the best ending ever in the videogames I played.I jsut purchased SC, and will play it after I finish typing this.I recommend to anyone (new in the JRPG genre, or a JRPG veteran) get this game and enjoy the magic journey of the Trails in the Sky. It's been awhile I played a game as good as this one and is definitely worth anyones time.10/10 "

												I usually judge an RPG twice.  Once at around the 2 hour mark, and once more at around 10 hours in.  If an RPG manages to get past those two milestones, then it's safe to say that I've become invested and am enjoying myself.  The story is very good, despite a few cliches here and there.  I feel like all the characters are unique, and more importantly, alive.  The progression of the story is also interesting, as it plays out more like a ""coming-of-age"" story than what I'm used to from most games of the same genre.  Estelle and Joshua travel across the country, remaining the only permanent members of the party.  In each chapter, 2 characters are introduced and added to the party, and go their own ways at the end of the chapter.  It's refreshing to follow Estelle and Joshua through the story as they grow into their own respective roles.			"

												I really should start by saying this game isn't for everyone. The plot gets off to fairly slow start, even by the standards of most JRPGs, and the pacing of the overall combat system follows a similar suit. It truly is the type of game that heavily favors story over gameplay, and thus you're going to need a lot of patience in order to get the most enjoyment out of this experience.You can try to think of combat as a mix of Final Fantasy X with its conditional turn based system and a number of SRPGs like Final Fantasy Tactics. It's a fairly simple system to adjust to, but it does have a handful of flaws (the inability to manually reposition characters when performing most actions being chief among them) that tend to make battles drag on longer than they should, especially in the later parts of the game. Considering the fact that this is merely the first game in a three part series, my first impression upon finishing it was that this was merely a heavily veiled prologue chapter for its direct sequel.But if you're willing to look past the flaws and clichés that naturally come from a game of its age (or if you're a forgiving chap like I am), you'll find a genuinely engaging story that really starts to pick up after you've sunk enough time into it. The combat, while admittedly flawed, still manages to feel as satisfying as many of the other JRPGs I've grown to love throughout the years, and the main cast of characters have presented themselves to be a nicely memorable bunch of individuals. (Olivier in particular, who may as well be Zelos Wilder in disguise.) Oh yeah, the soundtrack is a blast to listen to as well, and you're bound to run into some standout tracks by the time you reach the end of the game. *cough* Silver Will *cough*So uh, yeah. I thought this was a worthwhile game and all, and the amazingly potent cliffhanger at the end is enough to drive me to buy the sequel on its own. Feel free to check it out if you're interested.			"

												I always have the most difficulty talking about a game I am completely enamored with, but The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is one of the best games I've played. I have only played a handful of JRPGs such as Valkyria Chronicles, another of my favorites (most of which, including LoH aren't traditional JRPGs) however the appeal of this game, along with the likes of Valkyria Chronicles, is the connection to the characters, supported by a terrific battle system that emphasizes strategy and preparation.What makes this game special, for me, is the dialogue and the characters. So much care and thought is put into the writing and the cadence of the dialogue, that it really reads like a comic or a manga where, even though you read the dialogue, the intonations of the characters come across to make them real people with values, strengths and weaknesses, and not simply there to move things along.LoH takes its time, as well it should.Too often, things are thrust into an ""end of the world"" scenario in video games that compels a forward momentum with the main quest, but LoH meanders. It is a tale about the journey, and not so much the final boss battle, to the point that the game is more than the sum of its mechanics. This is rare, in a video game, I think. Lesser games use the story as window-dressing for its mechanics, but things like putting on the school play, while little more than ""cutscenes"" are given weight and gravitas that it is clear, to me, that the developers consider it just as important as the battle system.The battle system, too, is a lot of fun and while I don't have much to say about it, I do like the balance it achieves in terms of giving each character its own style, while still allowing a certain degree of customization with the Orbment system.I'm reiterating myself, but the meat is in the writing, and there is always the impression that Estelle & Co. are making their own personal journies within the greater macrocosm of a mysterious political world that is shifting with tectonic unease... pieces on the board are moving, and the beauty is being able to step inside the shoes of Estelle's perspective (who is really the main character, at least of this chapter), and be lost, grappling with the pieces of the puzzle.A balancing of the microcosmic, personal concerns with the larger, political and altruistic values is something that LoH manages to achieve, to the point that the game feels... well, like a full course meal. This is food for the soul, you could say.From the technical perspective, the music is terrific and enhances the atmosphere and connection to the diegesis. I had a few CTDs when I first installed, but IIRC, there was a patch and since then I have had no problems in my 55 hrs with the game.10/10			"

												You will enjoy this game if you like - Worldbuilding/Lore- Dialogue- StoryThis game happens in a world with a developed history. You know about 4 countries, but your entire adventure in this case is spent in 1 (other games on the franchise expand on the other countries), you travel through Liberl, getting to know all the regions, cities and people. You literally know the people in the country, because basically all NPCs have unique names, dialogues, and their own stories, advancing as you complete quests. The World is shaped by a concept known as Orbal Energy, which people developed technology. It is interesting because it powers things we use electricity, but it is different. They also explore a bit about Combustion vs Orbal Energy in game, so it's like a real world but with a different discovery that sets it apart, giving origin to many concepts of the lore.This is the first chapter (game) of the first trilogy of this world. It is spent more getting to know the inhabitants and making you care about people you are tasked of protecting, with the main part of the adventure being just that. However as you delve in the ending you will start to unravel the conspiracies and plots happening at the background. The villains are not simply evil, they all have their motives which are relatable. So the story is political and character driven.			"

												This Game. Holy Hell. So just a little background info, I'm an honest to goodness JRPG gamer. They're my favorite genre and I'm pretty critical about them. I've been through the ""Tales of"" series, Final Fantasy Games scattered about, Chrono Trigger, whatever. I found myself really wanting to sink another 40+ hours into a game, and Steam recommended Trails in the Sky to me. They recommended a fantastic game.If you want a game that you can play casually but it still motivates you to go about doing extra quests because doing those extra quests help you out in the main story line, then this is your game.If you want a game that has a very deep story and is part of a trilogy and can therefore play multiple games with characters you're going to love, then this is your game.If you want a game that's slower paced, very easy learning curve to get into and a deep customization system, then this is your game.I love this game, 9/10, would definitely recommend for people wanting to get into JRPGs, looking for a new JRPG to play, or something to just sink lots of hours into while not being in some sort of sandbox game.

												Oh my god, I can't believe I only got to play this game now. This has got to be one of the best rpg's I have ever played. The ending just got me and now I know that amazing things are coming in the second and third chapter. ♥♥♥♥ graphics, ♥♥♥♥ the sometimes insanely dipping framerate, this game is gold and time well spent for anyone who enjoyes well crafted worlds, intriguing and deepening storylines and loveable, realistic characters (even Agate grew on me :D) I was afraid I would not be able to go through the entire thing because I am spoiled by new age graphics and voice acting everywhere, but I am so glad I did not skip this one, just like rpg's of old, if you give it a try, it will grip you and not let go until the very end, and what an end it is, I have to fight my conciousness right now not to go to some wiki and find out how it all ends, because JESUS do I want to know. Anyways, anyone and everyone who enjoyes rpg's, get this game, you won't regret it. Sure some lines are cheesy and some decisions are stupid, but overall this is brilliant :)			"

												I played the first ~20 hours of this game and put it down for several weeks. It definitely starts slow. This game puts a tremendous amount of time and effort into world-building, and before you're invested in the world, it's difficult for it to get its hooks into you too deep.That said, when I picked it back up again, the remaining 40 hours of game went by in the next week and a half. I eventually gained an appreciation for the world and the plot picked up enough to carry me through. The combat also opened itself up enough from its relatively limited early stages to make for more satisfying battles and customization, though it never gets too complicated.The end of the game is excellent, and while it ends on a cliffhanger, it's one that you can resolve immediately by playing the sequel -- a game you'll enjoy more thanks to its direct continuation of the story and the fact that you've already ""paid"" for the extensive world- and character-building.

												This is one of the best JRPG's I have ever played story/plot wise, combat is also particulary good but mainly I play this for the story rich enviorment it offers. I would recommend this to almost anyone who enjoys a good checker board JRPG but like any other game - depends entirely on the person who plays it.Every character in the game has a special role, with each progress you make the game becomes more interesting to play, even the side/minor characters in other towns you will be visitting have always something new to say. But what got me the most of all into the game is the strong bond between the two main characters you'll be always playing (from start to end), not to mention the uncoverage of their hidden backstory throughout the progression of the game.In other words, I think this game deserves an excellent grade in my book, there is also a sequel to this game which I will be definitely playing and if you ever decide to play the first one, then I think you won't regret playing the second one either.

												TL;DR: The biggest thing I have to say about the game is that it's fun, it makes me think and use my imagination and there's literally nothing on the Steam Store that is as high quality or satisfying in terms of Strategy RPGs. There's a direct sequel on its way so if you're still on the fence about buying this, wait until Second Chapter arrives to make a final decision. Here's my review of the sequel:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198100856137/recommended/251290[Story - good]: If you don't like the anime and JRPG genres you should probably stop reading because this game has many cliches and cultural habits from them and no amount of praise will be able to convince you to like it. However the world building and dailogue of First Chapter is like the calm before the storm, the disc 1 of PS1 RPGs, an incredibly large prologue. The little things dropped here and there really get you wondering about where it's all really headed but you have to be willing to give it a chance.[Characters - very good]: Speaking of cliche I can admit that there's a lot of them. Especially with the characters, you can pretty easily figure out who the bad guys are or how the good guys are going to react to situations (save for the end, I knew it was going to happen but HOW it happened was a surprise). But at the same time they grow and change which can be seen in their dialogue, your main characters are fledgling bracers afterall.[Graphics - depends]: I personally like everything about how the game looks, cinematics and all. But others may be turned off by the older 3D and anime style character models.[Music - average]: It isn't the most epic soundtrack but it at least fits each situation except maybe the normal battle music but at the same time it's a jazz tune which basically tells you to sit back, relax and enjoy the game's pace.[Difficulty - good]: For me the challenge is just right but it also depends on how much you think about how to use your assets. Depending on the fight and how you plan, the fight can be stupidly easy or frustratingly hard.[Combat - very good]: There's a reason it's turn-based and with so many ways of attacking. Part of the fun is figuring out what you can do with your spells, special attacks, equipment and positioning. Sometimes simply moving your characters to the front or back rows can make all the difference in a fight.[Length - good]: The pacing makes it seem long but by the time you hit the end you'll realize it's not and wish it kept going (which it will because First Chapter and Second Chapter were originally intended to be 1 game).[Replayability - average]: I've already played through to the last dungeon once but had to restart and I'm not bored or tired of it 50 hours into this new playthrough either. Add in the New Game+, achievements and how much of a completionist you want to be along with bonuses you'll get to carry over to the upcoming Second Chapter, there's plenty to offer by replaying it.[Bugs - average]: Some people have had more trouble with these than others but the game has been out long enough that most of the common issues have been solved by the publisher with patches already or has a guide on how to fix the problem on the steam forums. Which, by the way, gets monitored by the publisher and is regularly visited to help with issues and keep us updated on the rest of the Trails in the Sky series.My only real negative is not being able to skip battle animations and cutscenes which makes redoing parts when you realize you missed something and have to reload from an earlier save, a bit of a pain.

												I first bought this game when it came out, since I'd heard some great things about these games. I ended up playing for a couple hours before shelving it for something else, and for the next couple years just glanced at it in my Steam library, thinking ""I should probably play this"" but never actually doing so. Finally in January I just knuckled down, got out of the prologue, and then almost didn't stop playing it until I was done both games. I wish I had done so earlier, as the two Trails in the Sky games make up one of the best RPGs on Steam, and I'd say certainly the best JRPG.The Legend of Heroes games all take place on Zemuria, a continent in the midst of an industrial revolution using what's called Orbment technology, a fantastical power source that fuels just about everything, even empowering humans to superhuman abilities. The Sky games specifically occur in The Kingdom of Liberl, a small nation who specialize in the technology that's recovering from a costly war with the much larger Empire of Erebonia. There's a lot of political background in the two games, which is interesting.You play as Estelle and Joshua Bright, two teenagers working to become Bracers, general do-gooders that take jobs across Liberl. Not long after they attain the Junior rank, their father, legendary bracer Cassius Bright, is called away on a job, and mysterious things start to happen that propel them across the continent. I'm sure that sounds a bit trite, but believe me when I say Sky's story is very good, and virtually all of the important characters are likeable in their own way, in part owing to the great translation XSeed gave it. Estelle and Joshua in particular are both great lead characters, and I found myself actually wanting to do side quests just because the dialogue in them was always good. There's a ton of world-building in both games, and Liberl feels fully thought out as a setting.The combat system is also nice, showing you the exact turn order Final Fantasy X-style. You can manipulate by buffing someone's speed of course, but also by using attacks that will push an enemy back down the line, or by using Arts, the magic your orbments give you which take two turns to cast. Bonuses will pop up along the turn order, and using the right move at the right time will prevent an enemy getting a boost to their damage, for example. A character's Arts are determined by what augments you equip in their Orbment - those give bonuses but also decrease a stat too, so to some extent you can minmax characters how you like.There are some negatives to Sky, though. Not only is this game quite long itself even if you try to rush it, it's also only half the story, since it ends right when another JRPG's plot would have gotten going. It wasn't intentional by Falcom from the start, and it owes to the fact this was originally a PSP game, but it still means you have to buy Second Chapter to see the proper ending. In that regard I suppose it's good I didn't play it originally, since SC took a bit to come out afterward. I also said the battle system was interesting, but I found myself disliking a lot of the boss battles, which in theory should utilize it most. Practically all of them between both games rely a lot on having multiple targets or minions that are around to be annoying, and can often be resummoned by the boss. In many cases it felt like the main difficulty was just dealing with them, and then the actual boss wasn't much trouble after, although I was only playing on normal both times. I felt a couple bosses were a bit spongey too. Some characters also feel more useful than others in battle, like one who in theory is meant to be a glass cannon, with high damage and low health, except many characters can do a large amount of damage without having that problem. Finally this is just a personal gripe but one character you encounter early on in FC, Olivier, I basically couldn't stand. He's the comic relief of the bunch (which the game doesn't exactly need a specific character for), but that amounts to him saying something useless or annoying in every conversation he's present for, and it gets old. He also has a habit of flirting with male characters in really over the top fashion, something the characters think of him as a weirdo for, which is...yeah, seems a bit needless.Overall though these flaws only really brought the game down to a 9 from a 10 for me. The Sky games may be close to a masterpiece, and have a hugely satisfying ending when all's said and done. I fully recommend both of them to anyone looking for a good RPG, particularly on sale as they are at the time of this review. Seems like XSeed is finishing up their translation of The Third, kind of an extra epilogue chapter after the conclusion of Second Chapter, and I'm looking forward to that as well.			"

												Allow me to start this off with my ratings before I go into the actual review. Surely this will help those who are in a hurry.  Subject Rating   Gameplay 8/10   Balance 6/10   Stability 9/10   Story 9/10   Challenge 9/10   Graphics 7/10   Overall 9/10 So, on with the review.Your first question might be, what exactly is Trails in the Sky? Trails in the Sky is a JRPG, and if you don't know what that is, then just look up Final Fantasy. However, although it is a JRPG, it has many things that define it and set it apart from its competition. Such as its battle system and the design of its NPCs, but I'll get into both of these things later. Trails in the Sky is a challenging game with a very long story, the 50 hour playtime mentioned on the store page is an understatement, not an exaggeration, and you're looking at 100 for the sequel, and there's still a third game coming to Steam that is also part of the same story. If any of this has caused you to lose interest, I suggest you stop reading now. But if you're interested, here's the details:The StoryThe story of Trails in the Sky is quite long as I've said. However, to be fair, it won't be 50 hours if you don't do some (or all) of the sidequests, which I highly recommend you do, as some of them can be quite fun. However, the story is heavily focused on the characters and the world they live in, so if you don't like stories that start off a tad slow and don't like waiting for the big climatic event, you might not like this. I myself found it enjoyable.What makes the story so great is how there's so much more to it than what it presents you with in a basic playthrough. This is because every NPC in Trails in the Sky has a name of their own, and almost all of them have a story to tell that evolves as the game progresses. Every time something happens, every time there's something new going on, you can talk to almost any of the NPCs and you're likely to find the next part of their little inner stories you can keep up with. This makes the world very hard to not be interested in, and definitely helps with the story itself.The most important part of any story that closely follows the characters is to have the characters be well-written, and that's certainly the case in this game. All of the characters are interesting or likeable in their own ways, with well-defined personalities and good character development, especially in SC.The only downside, however, is that you will not get the full story with this game alone. Without spoiling anything, the game ends on a cliffhanger with a lot of questions left unanswered and the plot without a conclusion, meaning you will have to buy SC to see the rest, as SC continues off right from where FC leaves us at. However, both games are worth it, so just buy them both during a sale if you're short on cash, or support the devs who most certainly deserve it and buy them both at full price. If what I've said thus far sounds good to you, you won't regret it.The GameplayThe gameplay in Trails in the Sky is something that I enjoyed, but some did not. Trails in the Sky is a VERY text-heavy game. It is not a visual novel by any means, but you will be reading almost as much as you would if it were, and you have to, because not reading means not understanding what is happening. This means that if you want to buy Trails in the Sky, you have to be coming for the story just as much as you are the gameplay itself.Then there's the exploration. This game has quite the large world for you to explore, and you will be doing a lot of walking through it. By a lot, I mean a lot. This is even more noticed if you aim to complete every side-quest. Fortunately, the game's world is very artistically designed, and if you enjoy exploring and traveling manually rather than using the fast-travels and warps we've come accustomed to from other games, then you will find yourself at home.The other mixed aspect of the game is its combat. Unlike most JRPGs which would have you hitting random commands left and right to make things happen, Trails in the Sky offers a more strategic battle system involving a grid and the ability to move your characters about it. If you've ever played XCOM or any game like it, this can be related to that in a way. It's a bit more complicated than most RPG battle systems, and it definitely isn't perfect, but it offers a good challenge, and in my experience, was very entertaining, especially during certain boss battles that made great use of the system.The magic system in this JRPG, however, is honestly one of the most in-depth ones I have ever seen. Fun, too! Rather than just hand you powers for levelling up as though your character visited the charity of magical-thingstuff along the way and got best grabs, this game gives you orbments. The game explains it in more depth, but the short explanation is you get to shove colored spheres into slots and based on what spheres they are, what their element values are, and how they're arranged, you will get different kinds of powers. It starts out simple, but toward endgame, you will have quite the variety to choose from.The most noteworthy thing about the gameplay, however, is its challenge. This is a game developed by Falcom, and it definitely lives up to their reputation. But don't let that discourage you! The game can certainly be beaten by a newcomer on Normal difficulty, but if you're looking for a more hardcore experience, the higher difficulties can do the job. You'll have to play very smart, be very strategic with your use of items and powers, and have a bit of luck on your side if you want to beat this game on the highest difficulty.SummaryTrails in the Sky is a wonderful JRPG that we are lucky to have on Steam where anyone can buy and experience it. Though its graphics may be old, they maintain a charm that is still appealing today, and the game itself has aged quite well. Though you may have to walk around a lot and the combat system could be a bit better than it is, neither one is necessarily bad, and though you may have to buy SC to get the full experience, the story, characters, world, and especially the music more than makes up for any short-comings. A definite recommendation from me, and may Trails in the Sky: The Third's release come as planned in early 2017!			"

												A fun romp through an intersting world full of well-realized characters and a semi-brilliant ditz well on her way to growing up in the shadow of her father-- then pulling off stunts he'd never have dreamed of. Yes, Joshua is the prettiest princess, and no, they didn't muck up the port from Playstation Portable. Technically, The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (not going to shorten it, Steam will throw a fit) is a competent piece of work, with some minor issues if your video card isn't exactly up to you running around places it hasn't quite had time to load up. It has a distaste for onboard video in spots unless you voluntarily cap the framerate, but even at that issues are few and far between. Aesthetically, it works-- the environments are fully realized, and you can poke your noses into every nook and cranny. For a game of its age the modeling and textures in the environment are pretty good-- but I think they could have done a bit better ina few spots. The characters are done in a high-rez Chibi style that does suit them and allows for little bits of animation that makes them seem like they actually exist in the environment and have weight.Mechanically, it does pertty well for itself, which little changed from the original PSP release-- grid-based movement that doesn't need to be micromanaged-- just point the the critter you want dead, and the AI can take care of the rest. Controls take some getting used to, and I recommend strongly you take a few precious minutes out of your return deadline to familiarize yourself with them in the config tool. If they're not to your liking, you can change them *there* and NOT in-game. Overall, it's good for a score of 90 here, for well-written and crafted characters and narrative alongside hours upon hours of side missions, hunting for chests, and all other manner of distractions. the rest of it is mostly present, and serves to get the story across. Lots of progression both in terms of mechanics and the world itself. Choices can mean the difference between getting your but kicked halfway across the continent and maybe not having to fight at all on some occasions.

												This is a JRPG, plain and simple.Its a simple and enjoyable game with decent combat and likeable characters. The skill system is a good one, forcing you to make choices to get certain skills though I do wish there were more varied options in what the skills do. (mostly just different damage types for resistances) The campaign is long if you do all the side quests though you never really have to much grind like many other games. The world feels reasonably flushed out.A warning however: There is a LOT of dialogue, so if you don’t like the characters it might be hard to go through. There were some points in the story where i really needed to go afk but i couldn’t because the long conversations in the story took 10mins to read through before i could save. The characters are very ANIME, (yes i am using that as an adjective) sometimes very cliche. I like it but its not for everyone.No one thing about this game makes it amazing but I think as a package it comes solidly together to make a good experience.			"

												A wonderful story-rich, turn-based JRPG. Doesn't offer anything new or innovative- but it's extremely fun to grind for better orbs and gear while losing yourself in the (possibly-incestuous???) adventure of two coming-of-age children stuck in the middle of a national conspiracy.  The game does feel like it drags at the finale, but the end boss was a unique challenge and the  end of the game sets itself up nicely for the sequel.			"

												Fantastic JRPG. Really scratched that itch for storytelling and character dev. Combat is unique and very well implemented. noticible lack of grinding which is unusual for a JRPG. its there if u need it though. As a JRPG nut, I loved nearly every aspect of this game. my first playthrough took roughly 65hours and i loved every second of it. Im stoked that there are still 2 LoH:Trails in the Sky games coming after this to steam. Absolutley a must play for any RPG fan. 10/10 Story 8.5/10 Combat 10/10 Character dev. 9.5/10 art style.Also a total 10/10 for the voice actors they snagged for this game. Johnny Yong Bosh, Stephanie Sheh, Patrick seitz and Michelle Ruff to name a few. (Anyone who dares say they enjoy anime will recognize these names right off the bat.) But perhaps the best part about the game; That ending..... thats all i can say. That Ending.....			"

												I just started, but this is a very nice RPG. The plot's interesting, the combat's a fun, smaller-scale SRPG, with very interesting mechanics. None of the characters are especially annoying, and the graphics are nice and crisp. If I didn't know beforehand, I'd think this was a splended indie jRPG, as opposed to the reality of this being an enhanced PSP port. It's very wordy, so I hope you like reading. The game features a New Game + for even more hour sinking fun, and is the first in a 5-game series, all with one giant plot. The 2nd game is coming later this year/early next year, and more will be brought over if these sell well. I'm really enjoying the game and happily recommend it to any jRPG fan.			"

												Typically, I'm not a big fan of JRPGs, since I consider Dragon Warrior 8 and Final Fantasy X the last major JRPGs with any likable characters, cohesive plot and fun gameplay (with the exception of Fire Emblem: Awakening, and that's not really a pure JRPG). Sure, I'll sometimes play The Last Remnant or something along those lines for its gameplay, but I haven't met a JRPG since the PS2 days that nailed down my (admittedly subjective) three characteristics of an all-around good game (story, characters and gameplay).I say all this so you can understand how surprised I was by Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, especially given the old-school style of it. I think 'heartwarmingly whimsical' describes the tone of the  game best, even at its 'to be continued' conclusion. It's a shame this game doesn't have more attention, because it certainly deserves it, and I can't wait for the second chapter to come out (hopefully by the end of this year, as planned *EDIT* Guess not).As far as gameplay, what you see in the pictures up there describes it perfectly. It's an old-school turn-based system, where you can use a combination of gems to tailor each person's specific playstyle. There's also the Bracer Levels, where completing sidequests will give you BP and unlock rewards with each level, giving you a reason to do them. As mentioned by most the other reviews, the amount of dialogue in the game is staggering, with even NPC dialogue changing dependant on where you are in a quest. Which brings us to story. Now, this is a story you have to be a bit patient for. It's a very slow build, but does its best to immerse you in a world that feels like it's changing around you (helped, obviously, by the changing NPC dialogue). This is the good kind of vast storytelling, where there is a massive story going on in the background, but the focus is on the core group you're following and their small part in big events. There are plenty of cliches and tropes to be found here, but that never bothers me as long as they're used in a way that doesn't come across as cheesy, which they generally don't in this game. All told, it's an EXTREMELY slow boil, but if you're big on story-heavy games, this is for you . Honestly, the story was probably one of the (if not THE) best I've seen in a JRPG (Admittedly not the highest bar to set, especially with the biggest JRPG developer out there obsessed with sequels to a terrible game and pink-haired waifu nobody likes).As for characters, this game has a wide array of endearing characters who (with a couple exceptions) go out of their way to avoid being archtypes to fill the void between you and gameplay. The two main characters are well fleshed out, and the story itself is a very satisfying one that ends quite well. I like that they actually managed to write teenage characters without them being so grating that I wanted to stick a pair of scissors in both ears. It's no Mass Effect, Walking Dead or TLOU in the character department, but Legend of Heroes certainly had enough good characters that I found my time with them honestly enjoyable.So do yourself a favor. If you don't mind slower JRPGs, pick this up.*Edited for typos and to add a bit more substance to it			"

												I rate this anime game 4/5 Gokus, because it has some of the best characters and storytelling I've seen in any recent jrpg. It reminds me of the kind of tone that classics like Grandia and Lunar had. The attention to detail is insane, and every npc villager in every town has something new to say after almost every event. I was really impressed by how much small talk dialogue they added.It loses a Goku because the battle system is a ton of wasted potential. It gives you movement and attack ranges, and could easily have had more combat depth because of positioning, but in practice that doesn't happen because using a move takes your entire turn. This ends up encouraging you to simply attack at all times, since moving is baked in, and leads to no control over position unless you chose to spend multiple turns micromanaging (and if the enemy moves you have to do that again). This of course results in the usual jrpg menu-battling slapfights that I have a severe aversion to.The combat is sadly very jrpg, requiring little player agency aside from the rare interupt to disrupt casts. Most fights can simply be completely avoided, but doing this led to me being a dozen or so levels lower than what I needed to be at the end of the game and unable to pass the levelcheck at the final boss until I pointlessly ground out bear asses to make my numbers good enough to do damage to his numbers.The game ends as part 1 of 3, and there's a pretty huge cliffhanger. So waiting for the second chapter (which supposedly ends the main story of the two protagonists) might not be a bad idea if you're worried about Falcom's typical glacial pace.			"

												Classic RPG remake with touching storyline with lots of twists. Played the game mostly for the story. It's practically impossible to complete the game perfectly within a single playthrough with monster book filled (conflicts with getting perfect BP). The combat is not to my liking though. At points in time I feel that fighting encounters is really a bother as it's time costly with large group spawns.			"

												I've been a long standing fan of JRPGs, and old style games. Though lately, some of them just havn't been pulling me in like they used too. This game however, was a great surprise. From the very start, the first thing you'll see is crisp, beautiful graphics, though retro style, they aren't blurry, or hard on the eyes. If you use the configuration tool before you start the game, you can set the screen to your native screens resolution, unlike other JRPGs, which again, is a huge plus. As you start the story, you get the old school feel, both how it starts, the deep character personalities. As the game progresses, it pulls you in. Be Warned, this is an old school game. If you're the type of person who doesn't care about a story, and likes to just button mash through text, like a brain dead turd, this isn't the game for you. If you're the gamer who actually cares about getting lost in the story, this is not one to pass up. First game in several years where I lost total track of time. Every character, no matter how little they impact the story has background character to them and a depth games just don't get anymore. The battles are old school turn based, same as the difficulty. If you're not leveling, and paying attention, (and saving often), you will be sorry. (HP potions, and food actually matters!) 20$ is a steal for this game if you're the right gamer for it. If you're a person who hasn't tried JRPGs yet, and want to get a taste, why not drop the 20$? It's a great game to get you into the style as well, easy to get into, easy on the eyes, and quite easy to get lost in (in a good way).  (Cheaper than a 1 hour movie at the theater too, what do you have to lose?). Cons: *Doesn't have any cons (imho)At least as far as I can see. It's a solid JRPG, with a solid combat system, solid storyline, solid game-play, and doesn't leave anything feeling diminished in the game itself. Note: Some have experienced crashes, though I've experienced none myself, the game has been running flawlessly.			"

												The Legend of Heores: Trails in the Sky (RPG)Story 9/10Characters 10/10Gameplay 8/10World 10/10Sound 9/10Graphics 7/10Verdict: One of the finest RPGs I've playedTLDR: Sometimes this game goes for $10. Buy it. If it's sitting in dust in your library, play it.You see, I passed this up years ago, dissing the generic title and what appeared to be a run-of-the-mill RPG. Boy was I wrong. This game is right up there with some of the finest RPGs to come out of Japan. The older Final Fantasies, Suikoden, Breath of Fire, Dragon Quest, Lunar... it's on par with all of them. Characters feel real, with a real sense of purpose and more three-dimensional than many of the dismal RPGs I've played lately. Even generic NPCs in this game is given real care and attention, you'll see them grow, their lives changing as you play through the 40~50 hours quest. Think Working Designs kind of quality. The story in this game doesn't break any new ground. but the writing and execution is top-notch.The game's graphics, although deceptively simple, are very detailed, charming and expressive. Music is extemely good, coming from Nihon Falcom, the same company that made Ys. Combat plays out like a tactics game, where your characters move freely about a grid-based map and executing a variety of attacks encompassing different ranges. The game's pacing is superb, although let down a bit by the final dungeon, which I found monotonous and dragged out.It's kind of hard to describe how I felt when playing this game, but its the same feeling I always feel when playing a genuinely good RPG. You get invested in the characters and the world around them, and you'd keep on playing just to find out what happens to them next. I'll be hungering for more Legend of Heroes games in the future.

												This game is just simply amazing. If you enjoy long and adventurous RPGs, not to mention JRPGs, then you've come to the right place! The plot itself is excellent. It reflects the struggles people can experience, the pain of losing what you consider dear, and the heartwarming friendship of those around you. Estelle Bright, the main female protagonist, discovers herself stumbling upon a path to a long and winding journey with the main male protagonist, Joshua Bright. She doesn't know what to expect, but she prepares herself both mentally and physically for the challenges up ahead. Sounds a bit cliched, perhaps? But if the journey begins with an odd pair consisting of a whiny, child-like teenage girl and a smart, awkward teenage boy, who both have an unbelievable amount of potential, you start wanting to follow along to see how their future turns out.In addition to the main plot, which was fantastically written, there is a multitude of sidequests that each have their own unique effect on the gameplay. You don't just quickly rush through the events and understand the story. You take your time with each event, paying close attention to every detail, and not only understanding the story, but feeling it and living within it. And you are able to do all of this because characters of The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is capable of pulling you into their own world.The connections and relationships between characters are rather interesting, and you easily feel the need to know how these connections develop over time. Each character has their own wonderful background, full of mysteries that are yet to be uncovered and investigated. There is so much to learn about them and there is so much left unsaid. Their personalities are quite the attention grabber as well!And while wandering around and exploring to your heart's content is enjoyable, the battles are also extremely exhilarating and always keep you on edge. There is never a time when you can sit back and relax during a battle. This is because it is not always easy to defeat the monsters or the opponents, and this is a good thing. Why? If something was easy-peasy, it would be expected to get boring after a period of time. These battles are battles that you must endure and help your main characters fight through successfully. They provide some difficulty, and though it can be frustrating at some points, it really does keep you going back for more.To top off this tall stack of excitement, the soundtrack, artwork, and design are simply impeccable. The music accompanies the beautiful scenery of the game. I always found myself being awed by it all; it never failed to amaze me. All in all, this is a fantastic game. I certainly do not regret purchasing it at all, and I always find myself being tempted to replay it over again. So, is this something you should buy? Definitely! You have my vote!			"

												So far so good, the story is very good, and the in game battle mechanics are not at all complicated. Iv seen some jrpg games where all the commands are messed up, but this game is very well done in controls. The graphics is beautifull, and when you enter a town, you really feel like your in a town :DEnjoy ^-^			"

												Wow..this game is awesome. If you ever wanted to play JRPG's on pc, this is great example of one game. The storyline, the character interaction, and music all fit into this game like a great recipe for making a cake. Put together, this game is AAA quality. Not many people like JRPG, but i really enjoy them usually. IF your a fan of the final fantasy games on steam, this one is a definite candidate to get after you play the FF games of course.Recommended for very fun game, great storylines, nice music, fun battles, and many many hours playing this game..NOTE: The second part of this game is also avaiable on steam, but im waiting for it to to go on sale.

												Third time buying this game, and it's still worth it. X-Seed's localization of this amazing classic is a blessing to J-RPG fans far and wide. While there is an extensive amount of reading, it never comes off as scripted and uninteresting. Each character has a unique personality, lending to the believability of their struggle as the story ominously unfolds. Anything else I could say about this masterwork of a game has been said to death--if you're a fan of J-RPGs, you'll definitely get your fill out of this one. Brace yourself for adventure! Help show X-Seed that the J-RPG community is still alive and kicking by buying/gifting this digital diamond! Support the possibility of a steam-release for Trails in the Sky: Second Chapter! You won't regret it. Unless you hate puppies. :(			"

												Female heroine FTW....Now that that's out of the way, this game is definitely not for non-RPG fans, unless you like text. A lot of text. The story has decent pacing, and I like how every chapter ends on a really strong note. It makes you feel like Estelle and Joshua more than earned their recommendations. The characters however, other than Joshua and Estelle, can be rather forgetful, even if they are somewhat charming. There's just nothing special about them. They fill their tropes and fill them well. Except Schera: she's one of the standouts. As for Joshua and Estelle, they're much better characters. They should be; the entire adventure is about them. The music is good, but not great for the most part.  (There are exceptions obviously.) Graphics are clearly not the main focus of the game, but what it does, it does well enough.Bottom line: The game is pretty good for RPG fans. However, if you don't have time and/or patience, the phenomenal ending may not be worth it. If you DO have time and/or patience, I still would recommend this game.			"

												This review is mainly based on the PSP port of the game and will be updated with a more comprehensive comparison after I get farther into the Steam version. Trails in the Sky is about a 30-35 hour JRPG that involves action, comedy, mystery, minor puzzle solving and quizzes, tactical combat, and a well-developed cast of characters. The deep story is fairly linear and a player has to be well-prepared for characters to move in and out of their party (don't get too attached to any one character as your main healer, for example, because after that chapter's over they may be gone). This movement can make for interesting gameplay as the player has to make tactical decisions about how to spread out and use their ""orbments,"" which are the game's mechanic that give magic and special abilities to characters, especially as certain characters are better suited to certain types of orbments (e.g., Joshua's first orbment slot requires something time-based). The characters themselves are all really charming in their own ways and will swiftly grow on you, even the ones that you don't recruit within your party. I'm especially fond of the four main female characters you encounter (Estelle, Kloe, Scherazard, and Tita), whom are all different and fun. Even better, the game frequently passes the Bechdel test and we get to see the four women interacting. None of them becomes the ""token girl"" you see in so many RPGs. While I haven't played the other two games in the trilogy (as they haven't been brought over yet!), I'm eager to see what happens next. I haven't found anything on XSEED's website that says either way (though Wikipedia tells me ""by the end of 2014"") but I'm hoping the PC release will mean we'll get the next two games somewhere down the line either in this format or for the PS Vita.UPDATE: Now that I've finished the game on PC, a few quick notes. After about the fourth day after release, I didn't notice any real bugs that affect gameplay, so the quick patching XSEED did seems to have worked. Further, it was really nice to turn the HD text back on as the other version gave me a headache to read. I definitely like the enhanced control systems -- you can choose to play with just a keyboard, just a mouse, mouse + keyboard, or even use a gamepad (such as an Xbox controller, which is what I generally use for PC gaming). The range of control systems meant that I could switch back and forth fairly easily if I needed to (e.g., I'd switch from a controller to the keyboard to give my hands a rest from clutching). There didn't seem to be anything major that changed in terms of the story line at all but I definitely appreciated the graphics more playing on PC vs. the PSP/Vita. I'm fairly nearsighted (if I don't have my glasses on I can't see more than about 10 inches away from my face) so playing on a tiny screen like the Vita can be a little frustrating. So it was nice to see the graphics blown up, especially since I didn't really notice any lost quality.			"

												Trails in the sky is a wonderfully unique and comfy jrpg and here is how its broken down.StoryThe Story is about 2 bracers in training traveling across the country and helping people out. While this does sound generic and simple, this is wrong. There is alot of things going on and plenty of forshadowing with some plot twists thrown in too. It is a fantastic story that keeps you drawn in because of the great cast of characters and the amazing world building that sets itself up for the sequels to come.GameplayThe gameplay is standard turn based combat with some tiny twists here and there, The orbment system in the game is pretty unique because it lets you set up your spells however you want. (If you have to compare it to something think of it as something similar to FF7's materia system) The only downside is that combat is abit slow, but that itself isnt that big of a problem.SoundIf you are a fan of Falcom's music then you should know how good their music is. Most of the music here is nice, jazzy, and relaxing with some serious stuff thrown in too. If you have played any of Falcom's other games like Ys then this is the opposite, Theres not alot of music that gets your blood pumping but instead it makes you feel comfy.Overall i would reccomend this to people who want to enjoy a nice comfy adventure rpg with a great cast, even though the beginning of the game is slow, you will get sucked into the story and end up wanting more. Luckly the sequel should be here sometime in the future and it is amazing. Id rate this game a 8/10			"

												Very interesting RPG. It seems like a real WRITER actually spent time on this. The interactions between the characters are really interesting and fun to watch. On the other side, the combat system seemed a bit simple at first, but don't let it fool you, as you unlock more items and quartz (a bit like materia from FF7) your options quickly increase. So it's an interesting game even on that front.I've only completed the prologue, but so far this game was much better than I expected. If you want an RPG with an actual story and characters, but don't want to read a book, buy this. You won't regret it.			"

												If you want an immersive world where even the most irrelevant NPC's have something to say about what's going on after every little thing you do, then this is the game for you.The story is great, it really pulls you in, and the characters are lovable. There's mysteries and plot-twists and drama and everything you could want in a good story. I guarantee if you make it to the end and finish this game, you will purchase the sequel within minutes once the credits start rolling.This game is also great for completionists. There's tons of things you can miss if you aren't paying attention. Quests, treasures, etc.Do not buy this game if you can't handle large amounts of voiceless dialogue. The combat is NOT the selling point of this game, though that doesn't mean the combat is not enjoyable. I enjoyed the combat. But the story is the main selling point of this game.I give this game a 10/10			"

												If you want a company that cares about you and the gamers then you have bought the right game. Ever since its release there has been gamers that have been doubt by the numerous bugs that have plagued the game since its release. I've observed the forums and I am satisfied that XSEED Games are comitted to making sure that these bugs get fixed in a timely manner. When waking up every morning and starting Steam there had been practically an update almost everyday , sometimes a couple of a day , but thats a good thing. Take a look at some of the other companies trying to bring us updates. I don't see that happening. This company sets an example for customer service when it comes to the release of oversea Japanese games and I am looking forward to the other games when they get released on Steam ( Already heard about Corpse Party)			"

												Fantastic.If you like milling about talking to NPC's because you're a busybody and want to get up in everyone's business? Buy this now.If you like your stories in RPG to be more about political intrigue and turmoil rather than that destiny to save the world crap, get this now. Your characters are junior members in basically an international NGO! You have run-ins with the national military! Rabbelrouse with foreigners!This game's just fantastic. Only thing that isn't the greatest ever is the battle system, but it's serviceable, if a bit finicky. Tinkering with orbments to try and ease out the spells you want is a neat little problem solving challenge, if you want to get that into it.But seriously, get this game. It's actually the first of three, with the second coming in soon by all accounts!One hell of a cliffhanger until the next game comes out though.			"

												For those who want some nostalgia factor, Trails in the Sky is a winner. While the game only represents the first chapter of what had turned into one of Nihon Falcom's most ambitious projects at the time, the game itself is solid.The storyline is very well written and the dialogue feels far more natural between the characters than your standard JRPG fare. Unlike the standard JRPG cliché of a bunch of kids saving the world while the adults are useless, it becomes clear that they are in over their heads and are simply treading water. Also, the adults in the game are far from useless, as it becomes clear that while Estelle and Joshua, out heroes, have been busy, several of the adults in the game are busy in the background, or actually fighting.Each of the characters has their own personality quirks and their dialogue is much more natural seeming than is typical in most JRPGs. The NPCs are even more interesting in some respects, mostly because each NPC, regardless of their importance to the plot, have names and quirky personalities at times. This level of detail gives the storyline much more depth than you would expect and the amount of dialogue is MASSIVE. (no wonder the release was delayed by several months).The combat system forces you to think more tactically, learning the weaknesses of your enemies and exploiting them, using your character's strengths wisely and covering their weaknesses. Also, the magic system, while not as intuitive as some, is very customizable and gives you a large number of options, as well as using character specific skills.It is repetitive at times, to the point where you will find yourself avoiding combat to get past the monotony due to eventually being too overpowered. At other times, it is extremely frustrating (one boss has an achievement for beating just because he is that difficult and the plot continues regardless of whether you win or not) due to how turn orders work.As to sidequests, this game massively averts JRPG convention by having a large number of them. All of them are event linked, some are hidden and you have to find, and all of them have time durations on them. Short time quests must be completed before the next plot event, medium duration ones can last for a good while and long duration ones must be completed before the end of the chapter. These quests are responsible for about a third of the time you will spend on the game, if not longer and it is very easy to miss some (have fun finding them 100% completionists).Now, if you will excuse me, I am going to go back to it and do a replay in New Game + "

												First game completed in 2017. The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is now officially entering my list of JRPG games with great stories in it. (Other memorable titles for me are Suikoden 1&2, Fantasy Life, FF7, FE:Awakening and now this). This game is an old PSP game from 2004 that was ported to Steam (PC) in 2014 and I bought it when it was on 2016 Steam Summer Sale. The graphic is surely outdated and limited (what you expect from an old PSP graphic?) but I'm okay with that since I'm that gamer who played the game for the stories.This holiday (especially this January), I decided to cancel my trip to South Island first in order to save some money since this month, I have to cover more for my rent and groceries expense. Going out in Auckland and trips outside Auckland is surely costly so therefore I came to ""cheaper"" entertainment, video games. ($10 for 70 hours entertainment is cheap!)I started played this game like a week ago and ever since been captivated with the story, witty dialog and characters development. Knowing this game comes from Falcom, a Japanese Game company that was known as one of the granddaddy of JRPG, it's about expected that they deliver many interesting stories in their game titles.The dialog is quite entertaining and full of charm, there are many funny moments that I enjoyed. However what I found is most interesting about the game is that all the NPCs in the cities actually have their own story (if you wish to keep check up on them from time to time) so there are many different interesting stories that can be found inside the game.Even though it can be said, since I've been playing JRPG for many years so I kinda have figured out some cliches and can guessed a couple things of right before it gets revealed (provided enough foreshadowing in the story). Still, the story did a great job to not reveal everything too soon, and it manage to keep mystery (and some of it) until the end.I really enjoyed game like this since it again reminded me why I'm falling in love with the video game industry in the first place. I played many games like this in my younger days so it kinda gave me some nostalgic moments, recollecting memories from Junior & Senior High.For me, the story is quite an important pillar of an RPG games since the story is what made it memorable. You might be forget some of the dungeons, magic names, etc but usually stories and music are 2 things that RPG gamers often still recalled after so many years.So there you go! If you are a big fan of JRPG that doesn't mind the graphic and much more focused in a great storyline then I do really recommend this title! Enjoy! #finallycompleted			"

The League of Extraordinary Bracers has arrived!I have been patiently waiting this release since its announcement back in September 2013. Me, being the Falcom fanatic I am, was readily awaiting to double dip on FC in order to ensure Second Chapter and the rest of the series to arrive (thank you Matador for gifting me this game, I promise I'll get you something for this!).I could write a novel about this game and why is it such a masterpiece as Trails in the Sky features by far one of the most fleshed out universes I've ever seen in videogames, with a lot of attention to world detail and the overall plot of the series.The battle system is really cool albeit slow, rewarding good turn management and seizing opportunities; it plays similar to a SRPG with grid based movement where you can at all times see when your turn is coming up next when choosing actions. Casting ""Arts"" (basically magic) takes up time to cast and it can be interrupted, so deciding which magic to use and when is essential. ""Crafts"" (character skills) consume a separate resource from Arts and are casted instantly; the most interesting one however is S-Crafts (Limit Breaks) which can be cast at any point in battle (technique called Craft Break) as long as you have the required 100 CP that it demands and should you have 200 CP the S-Craft deals additional damage or has an extra effect to it. There are also turn bonuses such as HP/MP Recovery or Critical hits and you can effectively position your next turn to take advantage of any of these. Outside of battle there's the Orbment system where placing Materia-like gems in a line defines what magic you get; line up enough fire magic in a line and you get powerful fire Arts. Orbments themselves also offer passive benefits such as attack increases or more max HP so customizing your character via Orbments is possible as long as their lines and innate stats allow your build to be viable. Then there's the Bracer Guild which are mainly sidequests and your main income of money and items; completing the tasks requested by NPCs from the Bracer Guild awards you Bracer Points which allow you to rank up in the guild, getting a handsome reward at every rank. Sidequests vary in requirements and must be completed in time before certain plot events, some are repetitive like ""Kill X monster"" while others are rather unique and have some cutscenes that lets us see more of our charming cast in action. Some quests also have special hidden conditions which if met will net you extra BP.Graphically, like every other Falcom game, it looks very dated. As the time of this edit, higher resolution textures and HD assets have been added which offers you what could be the best PC version of this game there ever was. The music is really good and catchy, almost relaxing as the normal battle theme Sophisticated Fight is a pretty relaxing jazz, although it does get better as the end draws near with Hollow Light of the Sealed Land being one of the greatest videogame compositions ever graced for a final dungeon. The game's main theme song Whereabouts of the Stars is a pretty great song that perfectly captures the feel of the game after its conclusion. There is some scarce voice acting, mostly as grunts and small lines during battle with only the english dub being available. It ranges from pretty good to abysmal and can be turned off.But let's get to the real meat: the story. This game is pretty infamous about this, with over 1 million japanese characters to be translated[operationrainfall.com] and the gargantuan effort of a poor editor working full time and extra hours in order to meet the deadline[www.gameinformer.com] (thank you Jess, you are missed) Trails' plot can only be described as ""huge"". It is simply exquisite though, very well written and will surprise you with its ending, being an infamous cliffhanger that has left everyone who's played the game to its end wanting to play the second part already. But Trails is not just a major plot twist in the end, the game has a lot of subtle foreshadowing that doesn't only pertain to this game, but to the entire series, which is mindblowing to say the least. Then there's the NPCs, each has their own unique name and change dialogue constantly after every plot related event; they're aware of what's happening around them and often wander off to different places gladly telling you what their business is. These, while mostly useless, help the world feel more alive contrary to most JRPGs where NPCs are just there to comment on random things and don't often seem to be affected by the main plot's events.The game's biggest downside and its most glaring flaw is the slow pace. Having a prologue of 6 hours worth of gameplay should tell you enough about how slow it is; characters tend to have lengthy conversations and the plot progresses at a snail's pace. While it starts small and mostly boils down to ""helping each Bracer Guild branch out"" eventually the bigger scheme is revealed and the game kicks into a faster pace.Should you purchase Trails in the Sky? It's up to you. Should you have the patience to reach the ending and awaiting the second game I truly believe you won't regret it. Trails is one of the masterpieces of JRPG in recent times and I feel it's a shame it took so long to reach our hands.			"

												So I picked this game up a long time ago, back when I had a zombie PC that couldn't play new games well at all. I got through the first third or so of the game before, suddenly, I got a brand-new PC and I could play more hardware-intensive stuff. And this game found itself forgotten... for nearly 2 years.Sick of seeing this still on my shelf, I picked this gamey back up the other day and have been burning through it until now having finished it. So, how was it? Well, if I was able to play it consistently without feeling like I needed to escape or run off to do something else, then generally that is a pretty good sign. :o...Which is odd, because this game feels like one from a bygone era that I, and the rest of the world, have more or less moved on from. It's a fairly traditional JRPG with turn-based combat, an interesting (if somewhat typical) cast of characters, and a plot that is more or less the predictable ""save the kingdom/world"" scenario. What keeps it interesting is the amusing character interactions, good gameplay (for a JRPG), and some sudden twists to the story that threw it off it's seemingly completely predictable course. While much of the story you can see coming from miles away, the parts that don't keep what should be a boring generic story rather interesting.Also there's a sequel, and because of how this game ended, I basically have to play that now to know what happens next. Hooray. Without spoiling the end... simply put I can't just leave things sitting as they are. There's some major stuff that needs resolving, having revealed itself after the seemingly decisive ending and typical multi-stage final boss.If I have a criticism for this game, it's that it has some really stupid ""collectibles"" of the sort that you basically require a guide to get them all, and if you miss the moment to get them, then you won't be able to get them again. Really annoying. For an achievement loon such as myself, it meant I had to play the entire game with a guide at the ready since not only did I want the achievements, I also didn't want to miss some of the special items you get if you do all the collecting. Games really annoy me when they do that. >_>But for someone looking for a competent, if old-fashioned, JRPG, then this is a pretty good one. If nothing else, you get to hit things with a giant bo staff alot. Whee.			"

												Game may be outdated but it is one of my fave JRPGs of all time.Please support XSEED to continue the Trails in the Sky series.The Second Chapter is up next and it is the biggest game to translate with over twice the amount of scripts in the First Chapter, the Second Chapter will be released later this year or early next year.

												Completed the game quite a while ago, and decided to review this VERY UNDERRATED JRPG.Do note that this is Part 1 of the trilogy.This game is best for those looking for:1. Great story  2. Excellent world-building 3. Brilliant musicAs part 1, this game introduces you to Liberl Kingdom, and expect even better things from its 2nd partWarning: This game may be too dialogue-intensive for some people unfamiliar with the JRPG genre "

Pros+ Great Battle System! Love the SRPG style combat. + Story is incredibly well written and keeps you wanting more. + The Characters. My personal favorite part about this game. You will find yourself getting really attached to them the more you play.+ Music is AMAZING! Falcom tier greatness (Huge Y's fan). + Side quests are worth doing and don't feel tedious. Ended up doing them all. + Pretty straightforward as long as you pay attention. No vague hints at where to go and no walking around aimlessly for hours.  + Really enjoyed the Quartz system (If you have ever played Golden Sun its kind of similar to the Djinn system used in those games) + Some down right incredible plot twists Cons - First hour of the game is slow.    Overall I loved this game and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game for anyone looking for a story driven JRPG with some of the best characters I have ever seen, insane plot twists, and really addictive gameplay. This is easily one of my all time favorite games... Final Score - ★★★★★			"

												This game is incredible. The writing is the best I have ever seen in a video game. The detail is just mindblowing. The battle system is really easy to get used to and if you know what you are doing then you can pull off some amazing combos and just destroy the bosses. I have played this game 5 times when I first got it (250 hours of my life ) and that was before I got it on steam. After that I did 2 more runs and I regret nothing. The characters are really well done. All of them are really usefull in battles too its just up to your preference.Even the NPC's are really well done they always have something new to say. Hell some of the generic NPC's are better than most Rpg characters I have seen in my life.I DO have 1 problem with the game though.The final boss has REALLY high physical defence. Even if you increase your strenght you can't do that much dmg on him withouth using an S-Craft. This makes getting one of the achivements really annoying. He also has great magical defence too.Also I pretty much tried every status aliments on him and nothing works. Even the super boss of this game is affected by some of the status aliments ( then again the super boss is dificult for other reasons). The final boss is still not all that hard its just takes long.			"

												Fantastic game, simply put. If you love JRPGs with a ton of charm then you'll love Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky. I can't emphasize enough how nostalgic this game is in terms of returning to the golden era of JRPGs (90's). The feel is very reminiscent of classics such as Xenogears or Breath Of Fire III, very endearing and colourful. The characters are endearing and articulate, the storyline humourous but also interesting and exuberant. The gameplay is simple, yet distinctively engaging.Pros:- Very nostalgic of yesteryear classic JRPGs (A positive in my mind)- Cutesy chibi-esque graphical composition- Engaging storyline, and narrative with dynamic character development- Competent combat system with an intuitive system- Captivating and charming soundtrack- A lot of content for your money (50 hours +)Cons:- It's still quite buggy (at the time of writing this review)- Olivier is just as annoying as he is portrayed to be (lol)			"

												10/10 without a single thought. Amazing game with an easy 40+ hour story line and 50+ if you do all the side quests which in some cases have tiny stories that might carry over into the sequel. Old school turn based battle system that is similar to FFX in some ways. The music is also top notch but that shouldn't be a surprise as it IS a Nihon Falcom game. And finally the characters..., they pretty much make this game. Their interactions between each other and how they change throughout just make it and awesome and sometimes hilarious experience.			"

												I'm no good at writing reviews so I'll just leave a recommend for this game to, hopefully, help the developers.This game was a true joy to play and I'm already eager to play the next one in the series. The game is very dialog heavy, as several other people have mentioned, so you should be prepared for that. When people say it's about 50/50 dialog/combat, they are not kidding. There are sections where you read dialog for a good 10-20 mins. You could skip the dialog of course, but the story (in my opinion) is the strong side of this game.All in all, huge recommend from me.

												Easily one of the most fun RPG I've played in a while, mostly because you can build any characters how you want, want the dual sword wielding guy to be a healer? well do it then, or even a big guy that punches stuff left and right to spam magic spells, it's up to you.The side quest are very fun to do because some of them make you fight boss monsters that you cannot fight without doing it and they all have their own dialogue scene that are identical to the ones from the main storyI'd give it probably a 9.5/10 mostly because it's easy to figure out what makes you overpowered and the game starts very slowly, other than that, there's not much about the game I could really complain aboutI'd wait for second chapter to come out before buying it though because this game ends on a HUGE cliff hanger.

												If you liked any of Falcom's earlier games and JRPGs in general, you will kind of know what you're getting here. The game features a solid and fun story that progresses very slowly for the first say 5-10 hours. Combat is turned based in a Final Fantasy Tactics kind of way and skills and spells are aquired by placing so called Quarts into Orbment slots. These have alot of customization allowing for you to experiment outside the regular tropes of JRPGs. Each enemy usually has a weakness against a certain element which is shown when you select them in combat.Trails in the Sky has tons of content and quirky dialogue, and some of it is hidden and easy to miss (and hence gone forever in your playthrough). Also, this wouldn't be a Falcom game without a fantastic soundtrack, but this one change the traditional tunes for some jazzy ones, which took some time getting used to. Game is pretty long as well.Rating: 8.5/10 - Play it			"

												One of the best JRPG out there available in English. There are already sequels to this so i hope they will be putting it on steam in the future (Like Trails in the Sky SC)it includes alot of new systems some very unique animation as well as good story plot.very good game for those who wants to look for a good JRPG. brings back alot of good memories of other old rpgs for me. All JPRG involves grinding, it is what the game is about , you fight, you earn exp then you level up. This game is worth it and has around 50-80 hours of gameplay.i am glad it made into Western market so more people will know about JRPGToo bad casuals who only play CAWADOOTY are trying to give it a bad score. Great soundtrack, great battle system, great storyline. Edit 19th September 2016: I finished the Game after 43 Hours of Playtime. The Ending.. was so... wow...I will buy the Second Chapter as well !What a masterpiece! :)			"

The story is 'traditional' lets say for the most part, but the characters really sell it. It never takes itself too seriously, but avoids getting goofy. The characters are great and there is a ton of dialogue. The world has a surprising amount to see and do. Combat is fun and interesting.If you like JRPGs, you will surely love Trails in the Sky. Great to support Falcom and their PC releases too.			"

												One of the best games I've played in a while, and easily one of my favorite RPGs...and thats after one playthrough, 50 hours long.  Definitely getting the next chapter of this series.The only caveat I would give anybody is that you need to put in the time to get the full effect from this game.  Because the game delivers a long story with some extremely detailed characters, you have to immerse yourself into the game to enjoy it thoroughly.  Once you do though, it is so rewarding.  I could go on and on about the characters especially, but to save space I'll just say they feel like actual humans with complex stories and feelings, making them very easy to relate to.  Of course, the interactions and comic relief are abundant too, and quite effective (I lost it ater ""Princess Joshua"").  The gameplay elements also deliver, as there are some really interesting features including basically shaping your characters' abilities through sepith, quartz, and Arts (magic, if you will).  Between that and the turn order and battle grid, there is quite a bit of strategy and preparation involved, so while the game isnt overly difficult, you can put yourself in a pretty big hole if you give the game the chance, or give yourself an advantage.  You also can craft healing items, but I think I only ever used 3-4 of the couple dozen items available, so its more filler than anything.  If you're a completionist like me, you won't need to do much grinding since you'll be fighting a lot of monsters on these quests, but it can get tedious to fight off so many of the same monsters in the same place again and again, but the ability to ""bump"" into enemies you want to fight and the 100% escape rate make it manageable.Without question, this game is absolutely worth the price tag.  If you enjoy RPGs and storytelling, this game is perfect for you.			"

												This game... wow.  Absolutely amazing!  It's been a long time since I've played a solid JRPG that has moved me so emotionally.  It DOES start off slow, and I will admit that, at times, the Bracer missions are sometimes bland, but the combat is solid, the orbment system works great, and most of all, characters have DEPTH.  They start off pretty derpy and stereotypical, but they DO evolve heavily and you really, really get pulled into the individuality of each character -- something that most new games lack.  Also, the translation is FLAWLESS.I have played through this game twice now, the first time being on the PSP.  The PC port is outstanding (I am pretty sure the game was actually designed for PC originally anyway).  Do yourself a favor and GET THIS GAME!			"

												If you like (J)RPGs, you should give this game a closer look.The main driving points for my recommendation are the story and the characters, but I'll avoid spoilers. If you want to know the actual story of the game, you won't find it here, read a synopsis ; )The story is literally a journey, that develops ""organically"" - if that makes any sense. It starts out small and the stakes and impact of your actions on the world gradually get bigger. The natural progression is kind of refreshing for me, since often RPGs throw your characters into situations (""You found the magic sword, now you have to save the world!"") and it's something I am not too fond of. So that and my impression, that the story is also well written, stick out in my mind.The characters feel like they have actual personality and are genuinely likeable. They have their flaws, but also ambitions and strengths. Even side characters get fleshed out and all the characters togeher make the world feel alive.Other aspects that tie the game together are the great soundtrack, the fun strategic battle system and the really nice visuals, especially with the character portraits shown in dialogues that help a lot to flesh out the emotions of the characters. I'm pretty sure it's the same engine they used for the Ys games (Origin and The Oath in Felghana), so if you played those games and enjoyed the visuals, you know, what you'll get.I spent ~60 hours playing through the game a single time and enjoyed every single minute of it, so I felt the game was worth the price.

												This is one of the best JRPGs you can play on PC.Simply put, Trails in the Sky gets just about everything right. The characters are well-written and likeable, the battle system is fast but has a decent amount of tactical depth, and the graphics get the job done. It is never a chore to play. There's never some element of it that feels unnecessary or excessive, unlike many JRPGs of the past several years. I must also commend the excellent mouse control - while you can play it with a gamepad, movement and menu navigation via the mouse is so simple and easy that there's just no reason to do so.What truly elevates Trails, though, is the attention to detail. The characters may seem like archetypes at first (the tomboy, the angsty young man with the hidden past, the wannabe-Casanova, etc), the dialogue (and there is a LOT of dialogue) makes them all feel very human and more difficult to categorize so simply. NPCs have new dialogue after every cutscene, letting you follow their little stories if you choose to do so. There's a lot of worldbuilding, too: the setting doesn't feel like it exists solely to show off impressive vistas and impossible places, but feels grounded in a very internally consistent way. While not a lot of it is forced upon you, there's a wealth of detail makes it feel far less like a playground for adventure and more like a living, breathing world.It isn't all roses, though. While the worst of the issues that plagued the launch appear to have been solved and I haven't seen any crashes recently, there are still reports of crashing on area transitions, videos not playing correctly, and black boxes around objects. Be sure you know what you're getting into and prepare for the possibility of having to work to get a stable and playable game. It's worth it, though.			"

												Put shortly, this game excels in every aspect that a JRPG should, and is one of the best classic JRPG's of all time. The music is phenomenal with a fully orchestral score, and it suits the tone of the game superbly. The story is long and well developed, and it really takes time to develop the relationship that the two main characters have. The combat is fun, fresh, and quite intresting; however it does get a bit stale near the later points of the game. It does have depth and during some of the boss fights it will really test your might, overall though, the fighting system is not fully explored through normal combat, but overall it is still enjoyable. This game is truly an epic story that takes atleast 50 hours to complete; and even more if you 100% the game which if your like me; you'll want to do as soon as you beat the game the first time.I can't reccomend this game enough.

												  This game is one of my favorite RPG's ever with more complicated histories in game lore than most.  Trails in the Sky focuses on two main characters (Estelle Bright and her adopted brother Joshua) who travel around their nation of Liberl. At the start of the prolouge, as you become Junior Bracers, you seek to become full-fledged members (also known as Senior Bracers) of this international organization who show an unselfish desire to help the needy. Their travels are without crises early on, but eventually lead to the forces operating in the shadows of Liberal which becomes the focal point to the game.  The difficulty of enemies can be notably hard, but having the ability in the game to catch almost all of them by sneak surprises lessens their potency. The final battle is the strongest encounter that could potentially provoke some mild anger from the player, but preparation will help manage this.  The cliffhanger to Trails in the Sky left me in awed when it left an excellent plot twist with an unnoticable antagonist that our protagonists came across through the storyline (I will leave the guessing for you to figure out). Trails in the Sky served its purpose of getting me to eagerly buy the next installment Trails in the Sky SC.  I certainly had a great time throughout it, whether it was the quests or treasure chest hunts, which is more than I can say for some other games.			"

												Overall, an excellent JRPG. Great story, great characters, and good mechanics. This is certainly a game to get into if people want a good story to follow. While slow pace, the story is never boring and this is one of the few games I've had a connection with the characters and story. You will need the second chapter (SC) if you want to get into this.The cons of this game are two-fold:The PC port is shotty. I've played this on the PSP before and had no problems, but on PC (with an overkill PC and SSD) there's certain maps and areas that studder and gitter within 50-125fps that feels like it's running at 4fps. The menu sometimes doesn't want to show labels on items. Sometimes you won't be able to load up the saved games are at start-up. I've had more crashes than with a Bethesda game. Luckily the autosave is good. None of this is game-breaking, but rather dissapointing. Although I'm unsure if this is somehow only a problem on my system. The gameplay is rather bleh~. Battle system is standard. There's not a whole lot of customizability with equipment and upgrade (you get better stuff progressively). Difficulties are whacked. Normal is rather challenging without grinding (I only grind before the final battle so I would have less headaches). Hard is a nightmare, and beyond... you've got to be a masochist because it's health/attack based difficutly. There's only a few good fights where the opponents try to fight smart, otherwise they become bullet sponges. If you play on normal, nothing will be teeth-grindingly bad, just not very challenging without. Once you turn it up to hard, you get kicked in the balls. Oh, and you can't change difficulties later on so choose wisely. Side problem: The graphics are decent for the most part other than the sprites. They scream 2004! If that was changed, people would probably think this was a recent lower(ish)-budget title. If you play on normal and suffer through the small port/localization problems, it's a really enjoyable game. Nice to sit back and play to enjoy the story with some small battle challenges here and there.			"

												I have heard many things about this game before its PC release, from people who have played the PSP version. One side promised that I’d experience incredible world-building, a wonderful soundtrack, and a fantastic story with endearing characters. Another side made it seem like the pacing was trash and that the story and characters were nothing but a bunch of cliché anime tropes. Now that I’ve experienced the game myself, I would consider this one of the best JRPGs I have ever played. My hope is that this review will convince those who are skeptical about the praise for The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (like I was) to try it out for themselves.Let’s start with the characters. I’m a sucker for female protagonists, and Estelle Bright is as good as they get.  Tomboyish, sassy, and somewhat ditzy at the beginning, she alone makes the narrative rather amusing. Her travelling companion, Joshua Bright, is practical, talented, and much more reserved – a perfect foil for Estelle. There are many other important characters along the way who come and go, and you don't have much of a choice when it comes to who is or isn't in your party.  There are also a ton of NPC characters, and their dialogue will change as you make progress in the story, making the in-game universe feel alive. Having followed all sorts of anime, I’m the type of person who drops something just because of bland characters and overused gimmicks/jokes.  I didn’t take much offense to any of the characters in this game, so I’d say the people who bash this for being overly cliché are just being unnecessarily harsh. Nothing particularly groundbreaking, but tried and true archetypes are used to perfection, and the top quality translation pops.Now, about the story and setting.  This game is divided into 1 prologue and 4 chapters (5 parts in total). You move to a new region in the country of Liberl in each chapter, and there's pretty much no turning back. The game looks pretty good, given its age, although the scenery in locations between towns can be on the bland side. There’s this claim that the first 4 parts are slice of life, and things don’t really get interesting until near the end, and that's not entirely true. What it really is, is slice of life with plenty of world building, setting up, and well placed foreshadowing woven into it. This game is the first game in the trilogy of a bigger series, and this whole game is essentially a prologue for Trails in the Sky: Second Chapter (which is about twice the length and apparently much better paced). The folks over at Falcom (the developer) make no effort appease the folks who want instant gratification. Hints about later events and even later games are present throughout, and there’s lots of optional reading that really broadens your understanding of Liberl and its surrounding countries, giving you the opportunity to connect the dots when the rest of the games in the series come over. Pieces of the puzzle are thrown at you from the very beginning of the game, and it’s damn rewarding to see some of them falling into place at the end.In the gameplay department, there are a ton of missables, so following some sort of guide is more or less a necessity. You don’t have to sweat it on your first playthrough though, since there is a New Game + feature and a ton of optional quests that you’ll likely skip the first time around anyway. The battle system here is definitely refreshing for those who are tired of traditional turn-based. Once again, nothing groundbreaking. The battles aren’t the main attraction of this game, but they're still quite fun to do, and you'll want to really understand how orbments work because the upcoming sequel is more difficult and will expect you to know how to manipulate it.In Trails in the Sky: First Chapter, Falcom has built an absurdly detailed world with a masterful narrative that makes it clear that the best has yet to come. If investing in a fictional universe is your kind of thing, you owe it to yourself to give this a shot.			"

												Exploration is a whole lot of fun with how big and detailed the world is. Everything in this game is pretty great, but really, exploring the world and meeting all the characters is what this game's all about. Def recommend this game to any JRPG fan.			"

												This is one of my favorite JRPG's, and one of my favorite RPG's in general.  It really has everything going for it--a sweeping soundtrack, excellent spritework, and a world that changes around you as you complete even the smallest story events.  I can't emphasize enough how much work went into minor NPC dialog.  After every cutscene, basically everybody in every zone has something new to talk about.  If you're anything like me, you'll be making a lot of trips back around all of the unlocked map to talk to everyone over and over in a circuit.  I really enjoy the little bits of worldbuilding that you get out of every little conversation.  In the same vein as the dialog, new missions crop up all the time too.  Sometimes you find them on the local guild job board, and sometimes you find them out talking to people in the wild.  Some are just basic ""Go to X, kill monster Y,"" but others actually involve the characters you've been talking to all this time.  You know how that cook has been claiming lately that his food shipments haven't arrived?  Well here's a (story) mission that addresses that!  That lady that is always napping outside the cafe with her cat?  Her cat's missing, find it!  (And her awkward flirting with Joshua is reward enough for that little quest...)I think the battle system is very FF7-ish, with what are basically materia gems, which some will find a nice throwback, and others will think is unoriginal.  Originality aside, I enjoy the gem system for the nuance it adds to the combat system, with multiple similarly colored gems slotted-in resulting in more powerful spells.The initial release of the game was kinda rocky.  The game started off with a lot of glitches that have mostly been ironed out as far as I can tell, and the game is constantly being enhanced beyond being a simple re-issue of the original old Japanese version.  They've added a number of very nice HD character portraits, and menus look really nice and crisp.  Overall, I wouldn't let the earlier glitches drive you away from this great game.			"

												I've never been more upset at a game for making me love it. There I was, about to finish the game and move on to one of the dozen RPGs I haven't finished yet, and then it ended on one of the worst (best?) cliffhangers I've ever experienced. Maybe if the game didn't have such a well-done story with great characters and simple yet enjoyable gameplay, then I could've held off on buying the sequel for a while longer. But no, this game just HAD to have the gall to be a wonderful experience. I'm so upset.On a more serious note, this game is certainly not perfect. The gameplay, while fun, definitely takes a backseat to the story, and can grow a bit tiresome after a good amount of hours. Speaking of the story, it might be both the game's greatest strength, as well as it's greatest weakness. My finished game file shows about 45 hours, and two-thirds of that is mostly world building and character interactions, with some small hints of a larger plot here and there. Don't get me wrong, the world building was very well done, and it did a wonderful job of making me care for the characters... but until the payoff happens, it can be a bit of a slog. I started playing this game in February of 2016, and didn't complete it until November. If you're willing to push through a slow beginning that lasts for almost the entire game, then I would definitely recommend this game, because it really is worth it in the end. Just be prepared for a long journey, and maybe bring some tissues for the end.			"

												Great game with a lot of dialog, npc's who actually have something interesting to say, fun skill system and a massive amount of plot twists. The MC's are very likeable, and eventhough there is no audio dialog, the text alone will give you enough LOL's.Battle system might be a little slow, though. Spells are a lot stronger than melee, and bossfights can take a very long time (esspecially the last one). Nonetheless a great game. So please press the purchase button, so they can make an entire series of this game until the day I die.			"

												First time I played this was back in 2011 on my trusty PSP which now lies somewhere because I have no idea why. And boy, that was an experience. Being a hardcore fanboy of RPG and especially those from Japan (because I'm a giant fat weeaboo) and played games like the original Legend of Heroes, Ys, Generation of Chaos, Persona/Shin Megami Tensei and whatnot I was very quick to pick this up from my local Gamestop back in California. I think that was the best 20 bucks I spent during that semester.Trails in the Sky is a spinoff/sidestory, or if you would like to call it the sixth game in the Legend of Heroes franschise. It's your typical turn-based JRPG with a little twist and a bit of strategy to it. Battle doesn't become too dull thanks to that and because of the ""Arts"" system you can customize your characters (which are quite the amount) for a specific role whenever you want to. And it is paramount for the important battles. Unless you are playing on easy. Which you shouldn't do anyway. Shame on you if you do. Like, seriously.But then, a lot of peope play RPGs for a good storyline which Trails in the Sky does not falter at. More the opposite; albeit that it has a problem of pacing. Now, the game is divided into chapters (I actually forget how many) but the game doesn't start to pick up about halfway through and for many that can be a turnoff. But to compromise this there are a lot of other things one can do. Sidestories, extra missions, exploration. The world of Trails in the Sky is vast and extremely beautiful which is one of its selling point. It's extremely well detailed and the characters just compliments this so well. Compared to a lot of other JRPGn out here on Steam the characters are actually interesting (*cough* Agarest *cough*) Seriously, of a cast of 35 party members in Agarest only three of them were actually somewhat interesting. Now, Trails in the Sky doesn't really have THAT huge of a cast but that doesn't matter when the majority of the characters are great. But of course, it's Japan so we have some sort of stereotypical characters which you will always see. *sighs*But those minor flaws just pales in comparison of the whole greatness of the game. It's a rich and engaging world with some actually great music (I actually have the CD with the OST, suck it ♥♥♥♥♥es!) that fits the vivid world and enhances the experience. Battle is somewhat fluid, characters actually have an interesting personality (for most part) and has an amazing story... if you can get past the first two chapters (but hey, the story isn't actually bad even from the beginning).The experience from playing it on a PSP was great but I don't think I could experience the details from that small♥♥♥♥♥screen the same way I can do on a PC. I mean, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ The difference is amazing and I can finally enjoy both the artwork and the surroundings to its fullest potential. Only downside is that I feel like a neanderthal sitting in front of my computer and playing games with a controller. With both hands close to the crotch with the vibrating controller, I could do something else. Ya'now.9/10. ""Anime was a mistake"" - Hayao Miyazakibut this game wasn't			"

The only issue i've had so far is that it crashes occasionally. It may be my set up,  but sometimes it just crashes in the middle of playing. If anyone has advice on how to stop it that would be wonderful.EDIT:  So I found information on how to solve the issue thanks to Kalirion, and some other posts on the forum. (Thanks btw! n_n)Now that everything is running fine I have to say that the game seems very in-depth, and i'm really enjoying the light hearted feel between the main characters!			"

												A great JRPG that has won my affection. It gives you a world to explore with great dialogue that changes with each event. The battle system is simple but at the same time complex once you begin trying to maximize each character's strengths. While you can power level in a few select places, the enemies are always a good match. Bosses are spaced well and the timed quest system is interesting. You must complete some quests before others or lose the chance to do them at all. I would recommend this to anyone who likes JRPGs and is okay with lots of reading (this is not zero text game, long cutscenes of reading). Overall, a 9/10.			"

												A long story-rich RPG game with decent battle mechanics that make you think. Finished the game within a week and that is skipping all the side quests after Chapter 2. It should take longer if a person wanted full completion. The main drive for wanting to play is that right from the beginning you start off with questions, about the main characters past and finding your dad that disappeared's whereabouts. It's the quenching for this curiosity that makes you play until the end. I find that most RPG's it's very hard for a game to hold your attention enough to make you play till the end and this game does this superbly. There are a lot of mysteries and well-built storyline in this series which explains why it is a trilogy.The characters are likeable and play a crucial part in the plot. Near the end of the story I found myself not sure of who to put in my party because I liked everyone of them and they each have their own strengths. They each have their own motives for acting and are very related to one another which makes it hard to think of them as just another party member that joins for reasons that are unbelievable. They join the party and leave because they have other things to do and the reason is not just the world is in danger so I am going to stay in the party from start to finish. I found the battle system a bit slow for my taste (was fun for me nevertheless), but there are orbments/customisations that allow you to skip battles entirely. Even when skipping there are times when the game lets you farm monsters for levels allowing you to catch up on levels to advance the plot. The battle system is unique as instead of having critical hits there are bonuses on a specific turn and by using crafts/skills or ultimate abilities you can intervene or bypass a turn to prevent the enemy from getting said bonuses. Position is also crucial as if you bunch your characters up you can get hit by aoe attacks but it also makes the enemy come running at you in a cone so you can hit your aoe attacks more easily; also you can choose to make position your characters far so that it takes 2 turns to hit you. The game requires customisations to get skills and thus is very flexible with no strict warrior/mage development archetype. The music is excellent. I never get tired of listening to it - everything including the battle music, the map music, the OST that runs in the backgrounds for dramatic effects and the main character's harmonica song whereabouts of the light.For difficulty, I first started on nightmare and was a wreck, spent 6 hours in the prologue and gave up, it's near impossible on first playthrough. Hard difficulty seemed like it would take awhile to complete so I started off on normal mode just to know the story. All in all the game was a good experience and I'm looking forward to playing the sequel. I'll probably aim for 100% completion before that in my next playthrough.  I recommend playing this game if you don't mind the cliche story and/or slow battles.			"

												I usually don't leave reviews but I felt compelled to with The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky. Is it good? Short answer? OH MY JESUS ♥♥♥♥ YES!!Long answer? This game is in my top 5 that I've ever played. Not only does it kill the itch I've been getting for some good old classic JRPGs, but it has surpassed all of my expectations by a ton! This may not be the game for you if you don't like heavily story driven games, but if you do this game is a must play. I feel like I need to address a few elephants in the room before I continue though. First, the game starts very slow story wise. This won't mean anything to you now but everyone who's completed this game knows that you need to play until the play. Second, I feel like a few of the sidequests may require a brief look at a walkthrough to complete (or maybe I'm just dumb but whatever).Now we get back to business. The gameplay is excellent for those of you who love tactical RPGs like XCOM and Fire Emblem. On harder difficulties, it requires you to really think outside the box and employ some pretty unconventional strategies. To sum it up, the gameplay is like Fire Emblem meets Final Fantasy VII.Now, we get to the real selling point of the game.The story makes this game truly shine above soooo many other games.  The characters and dialogue are just incredibly well written to the point that you could probably just copy and paste the dialogue into a book and it'd be pretty well received. Also, a big thing that stands out within this absolute gem is that it tackles some pretty mature subjects without absolutely royally ♥♥♥♥ing it up. Anyways, to sum it up, this is one of the most criminally underrated games of all time by far. It is easily worth the $20 and if you love yourself some classics like Final Fantasies VI and VII, Chrono Trigger, and Fire Emblem, you'll love this game.			"

												This game is worth purchasing if you are willing to let the story and characters carry you through the uninspired gameplay mechanics. It's your typical turn-based RPG with decent music and a kingdom in trouble, so there is nothing new or exciting to see there, but that's okay because this game is cute as hell and the characters and the story will worm their way into your heart and keep you playing just to see what happens next. The ending was satisfying and sets up the next chapter without answering every question.Perhaps the best thing I can say about this game is I purchased the sequel immediatley after I finished it. Was it perfect? No, it wasn't, but it cleared every bar that it needed to in order to hold its head high as an RPG and it managed to make me care about the characters and their world, so what more is there to say? I don't think you'll be disappointed in this one.			"

												If you are a fan of story-rich JRPGs, this is a must! It's flown under a lot of people's radar and I can't see why. Whilst the story is very much the first installment in a series and somewhat slow to start, the characters are all very likeable, especially our two main heroes.As for combat, it uses a grid-based system in conjunction with a lot of turn-based norms. There's a lot to be familiar with and lot of new things to discover as well. There is also a lot of customization options with the orbment system, but for those intimidated by complexity, the game has an easy mode you can play to take some of the pressure off, but it still keeps you on your toes.Overall, brilliant experience. I'd reccommend it to anyone who considers themself a fan of RPGs.			"

												Trails in the Sky has fits all the pieces together just right that easily place it among the J-RPG greats.Great storyThe game is about two young teenagers called Estelle and Joshua. Setting out on adventure to find their dad who's gone missing. As things progress the plot thickens and the mystery of their fathers disappearance becomes much more serious and they get neck deep inside a large conspiracy on the kingdom. As characters and persons Estelle and Joshua grow a lot during their journey which makes it a very charming coming-of-age story as well.A ton of interesting, well-written and fun charactersI really like that everyone you meet for your travels, always serves a purpose for the story while they're in your party. This also does mean they will leave you eventually, but it fits the story every time.Epic adventureDespite its dated looks, it's fantastic how cinematic, action-packed and emotional the game can be. The story that unravels becomes quite grandiose toward the end. The slow pacing and a lot of quiet time in between make the endings of each chapter all the more rewarding.Good writingOn multiple occasions the dialogue between characters made me smile, feel sad or just get completely lost in this world.Very solid combat systemThe orbment system gives a fun take on magic and the crafts skills complement on that as they work a bit different. There's good amount of tactical planning required for some boss fights where the design of the combat system shines.Nothing but love for Trails in the Sky from me.			"

												Lots of Jrpgs puts you quickly into a situation where you have to save the world, slay gods, stop religion and whatever... They never take the time to build the world up first. Fleshing out the characters, and giving them a proper reason for what they are doing.Trails in the Sky is different. This game is very slow paced... But that's the appeal of it. It never rushes to do anything. It takes it's time to build a coherent world, give everything a meaning and introduce many various characters. Who develops nicely throughout the game.The main characters are Estelle Bright and her adopted brother, Joshua Bright. They are raised by their father, Cassius Bright, to become full fledged Bracers. Bracers are guild members who are tasked to protect the well being of their fellow citizens and country. In this case, Liberl. A small and peaceful kingdom, that got invaded by the Erebonian Empire 10 years ago. In what was essentially called ''The Hundred Days War.'' Liberl suffered heavy losses, but still managed to drive the Empire back and survive the invasion. With the help of the military and strong support from the Bracer guild. But at the cost of many lives, like Estelle's mother. This is what pushed Estelle into becoming a Bracer, if not only for her father. To become strong and experienced, so she can protect her friends, country and most importantly, her family. From another invasion attempt.Lots of Jrpgs tend to focus way too much on the main characters and not enough on non-playable ones, but not in this game.For instance, you are introduced to two news reporters within the first 2 hours of the game, Nial and Dorothy. They both have their own unique personality, character portrait and goal in their mind, with a lot of dialogue there to explain said goal in detail. From all this, we can assume they are somewhat important and MIGHT play a bigger role later in the game.A lot of the characters you meet in the game are portrayed like this, and this is one of the many strengths of the game. To make every character look even a tiny bit important, whether they are friendly or not.And in most cases, even when our heroes are faced with enemies that are human, they don't kill them. They stop them or knock them out. This helps present our heroes... As actual HEROES. This is a great way to empathize with the characters we are in control of. It would be a bit hard to empathize with murderers.This is what the game is good at. Creating a world that is detailed, introduce characters that are detailed and to explain things in detail. To build upon things, further and further, until the end.If you can deal with the slow pace of the battle system in the beginning, you will really enjoy it later on. Opening more orbment slots, inserting Quartz (Materia in this game), getting new Arts (spells in this game) and that kinda stuff makes it fun to experiment with in battle later on. It has cliches like any other game/anime, but that's not a bad thing. It's how writers handle these cliches. And I think, Trails in the Sky handles it better than anything I've ever seen and played.I'm not really good at writing detailed reviews, but I hope this made you somewhat more interested in the game. The Legend of Heroes is a very well written, story rpg series. And I hope it can get more support here in the west, so we can get the rest of the games released over here.			"

												Trails has one of the best stories in JRPGs, awesome world-making with even the secondary characters reacting to the stuff that happens during the plot. It's really dialogue-heavy and could use some editing but it eventually engrosses the player in the world.Trails In The Sky also has one of the worst combat systems ever put into an RPG. So many stupid design decisions -  positioning is important yet you cannot decide from where you attack, you can either move where you want or attack. The AI cheats blatantly, the enemies are spongy to the point where they have 20,000 HP (when your characters have around 3000). Spell animations are long and you'll see them thousands of times making fighting a chore. I beat Persona 4 few months ago and Trails has nothing on that game where it comes to combat systems.That's the main flaw. I've invested lots of hours in the game already but didn't finish it. The last boss fight takes about two or three hours and I just can't bear to sit through all the animations again. I'll pick it up before the Second Chapter appears on Steam.			"

												I'll just start by saying this: This is the first game I have felt compelled to play from start to finish in 6 years. That story-rich tag isn't just for show people. Now anyone who looks at my profile can tell that I am a avid tf2 player and that I play it more than anything else in my libray. That was untill I picked up this little gem. Since I bought it I havent stopped playing it except to eat and sleep. From the spectacular music to the well paced story telling I have loved everything about this game so far. One boss I fought in towards the end took me a half hour and I was actually physically exausted by the time it ended. The only down side I can think of is if you like playing games in a series one after the other, you might not want to pick this one up yet. There are 4 other games in the series to my knowledge and only this one had been localized so far. But I have heard that the Second Chapter in the series is coming to America at the end of this year. So ,long winded speech aside get the game. You won't regret it.			"

												Honestly, this game is great.  If you are a fan of JRPG's, tis is a must have.  It is a great step for Steam to add this game to it's line up and makes the future of JRPGs on here bright.   The story is great, the characters are great.  Now, a lot of people may have been having problems with the game crashing (I have not, so I can't help there).  Others may have problems with the cut scene colors being weird, but that is fixed by playing in windowed mode.  The developers have been lisening and are investigating the problens now.All around, this is a solid JRPG that the developers care about.   Would recommend very highly.			"

												*Spoiler Free*I picked this up during the winter sale and although my wallet cried over all the games I bought during the Steam sale, I cried over how awesome this game was. 10/10 would cry again.Jokes aside though, this game is a ""coming of age"" tale for Estelle (our main female lead) and Joshua (our main male lead). Estelle and Joshua aspire to become Bracers which are basically civil workers who do good deeds/jobs for the good of the people (different from the Royal Army whose main purpose is to protect the people from monsters). We follow them around to different regions (as Bracers-in-training) solving people's problems like escorting civilians safely to towns, doing errands like finding some books, fixing things, exterminating strong monsters etc. On this journey we meet many friends along the way and I can safely say I found something likeable for every single character- even the overly flirtatious guy at the expense of his misfortune and his banter with the party members. All the characters grow on you as the game goes on and you genuinely feel sad/happy when things go wrong or right for them- which not many current generation JRPGs do thats for sure. This gem of a game has touched my heart and I don't regret every single minute of my life joining Estelle and Joshua on their journey to become full-fledged Bracers. I highly recommend this game to not only those tired of the overly moe JRPGs made nowadays but also those that want a nice story about 2 teens on a quest to do what they think is right with all the laughs and tears in between. I rate this a 9/10. Pros and Cons list below for those interested.Pros:+THE. FREAKING. TREASURE. CHESTS. - If you thought looting chests and getting great loot was awesome, well; let's just say the chests themselves have something to say about that...+ Diverse Characters - from NPCS all the way to playable party members, there's so many different people to love/like!+ Diverse Enemies - no rinse and repeat monster models for EVERY REGION. There are a few but generally each region has different monsters and thats sweet.+ Gameplay - the gameplay is pretty neat; nice turn-based battle grid system with interrupting-turn super skills + EXP system - This game does leveling right. The exp gained from monsters is based on a exp scaling system so if you are underleveled (let's say lvl 18) fighting a lvl 20 mob, you get more exp than if you were level 21 fighting the same mob. This prevents you from being too underleveled but at the same time prevents overleveling (to an extent).+ Story is good (albeit linear)+ OST is great+ Graphics can be upped to 1080p x 1920p+ $20!!! - considering the price of current JRPGs go for at least around $30 usually; this game is certainly a steal for the amount of content.Cons:- Linear story - you get story locked which prevents you from going back to the previous regions once you pass certain points in the story.- Some party members you've had in early chapters are unplayable until late in the Final chapter.- Graphics are dated (the game is old- released in 2004) I personally don't mind but for some people graphics/looks is a factor.- Few bugs - there was a point where I would talk to an NPC and one of my party members would walk/run in place; pretty funny and not that big a deal but a bug nonetheless.- No Voice Acting - This isn't as big a deal as let's say in a Visual Novel but besides battle voices and grunt noises, there is NO voice acting.- This is the First Chapter and the Second and Third Chapters have yet to be released in English (although Second Chapter is currently being localized).

												Trails In The Sky is wonderful! I love T.I.T.S.! I'm obsessed with T.I.T.S.! I just can't stop playing with T.I.T.S.!...Yeah, maybe I should go into better detail. This game is a near-perfect refinement of the classic JRPG formula: chat up characters, fight and grind through turn-based battles, and save the world. It may not be ground-breaking, but Trails in the Sky shines in its execution: the turn-based battles favor planning, good positioning and clever tactics, and the world is rich with memorable, endearing and just plain odd characters (even townsfolk) whose personalities really stand out thanks to XSEED's excellent localization. No ham-fisted moral choices, no convoluted weapon crafting, just a good, solid RPG experience.			"

												This is one of the best JRPGs of all time.  I will tell you why.  It absorbs and distills so much of what made the classics great, cuts out the annoying bits, and then exapand drastically upon the good bits.I played the hell out of this game on PSP.  I then replayed it on Vita.  At this point, I wanted to buy it on PC just to support the series, developers, publishers, localizers--partially in the desperate hope that we will get more games like this and more games in the series, regardless of what platform they're on.  But, now that I've got it, have booted it up and fiddled with it, I am excited to replay it all over again.The PC version brings a lot of bells and whistles.  This game is not about its graphical splendor, but the PC version is definitely pretty.  I have to comment that the art design is great in this game, too.I could just go on and on.  Please buy and support this game.			"

												Been longing for a JRPG that was good and was on pc, this one delivers with a fun combat system and a unique way of equipping your team for the road ahead. I give this game a 8/10One of the slight draw backs that i docked 1pt for was the fact that most boss battles you have to use your specials in order to win or they  just wipe you out. The game has a good story and characters  with very Unique characteristics in the respect to who they are.The other reason I docked 1 pt is the fact that the game can be kinda sluggish at times and you cant really level up your characters prior to battles. Happy hunting and enjoy The Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky			"

Yes it might be a little slow at first but I personnally quite used to this in other similar games and I'm happy to do every single sidequests threre is. HTe graphics are decent enough and the attention to details is amazing but sometimes also a bit askew. For example you do a sidequest in a place and then you go back to this place for the main story and the dialogues doesn't remember you had come before. On the ohther hand you borrow a fishing rod and then follow the stor for a while but when you leave town suddenly your heros remember you need to give it back.  I can't wait to play the next part of this epic adventure.			"

Very great that steam able to port them to PC and hoped that the next series will be out soon in Steam.

												I've been playing computer RPGs for a bit over 30 years, Claiming that I've seen it all will be a lie though, but I've seen my share of both good and badly created RPGs during that time. And for a long time I've said that Baldur's Gate was the best RPG ever written, but I think I have to revise that as of now...I'm not far yet in Legends of Heroes (just left Bose to invesigate the lost skyship), but I can already tell that it's a very well written RPG. Though the story still has to unfold for me, the dialogues are what I'm basing my statement upon. They're very well written and each character shows it's own personality. Add to that the HUGE amount of (unintentional?) humor in them and it's a story to enjoy. I even have to convess that Legends of Heroes is one of the few games that's made me laugh a lot when reading the dialogues between the characters.Graphical wise it's very dated though, but I thikn it sticks to the true jRPG feeling where story is more important than graphics. I gotta say though that even with the outdated graphics, the engine is used very well (considering this is a  pretty old game), where you can rotate the camera, but your characters stay in isometric view.The music is pretty much okay, though not up to 'current standards'. But for me, much like the graphics, it stays true to the old jRPG feeling the game intends to deliver.I'm only sad though that I've wasted so much time on other - a lot less appealing - games lately and didn't take the time to play this one. That'll change and when I've finished this one I'll go straight on to the Second Chapter...			"

												7/10, If you're not a jrpg FAN, then $20 is a little steep.Just wanted to give my sincere opinion of this game. I enjoyed this game quite a bit because I feel there are so many excellent game mechanic descisions, but I couldn't help but be overall disapointed, only because of the radiant reviews I had read prior to purchasing the game. The music was okay, sometimes I felt like I was listening to an rpg sound track that has been turned to elevator music. The light jazzy battle music actually got a little old about 5 hours in. Creatures in this game are split between a busy mess of horns and tentacles (which can look cool), or just a lazy mix between two real animals. For instance, there are two seperate creature models in the game that are BOTH a shark/gator mix, and their names are actually shark-gator and gator-shark within game, which seems a little... lame. For the most part it really is a good game, I loved the recipe system and the quick turn based strategy battles were fun, and the lack of random encounters was refreshing. Also the materia-like magic system was fun to play with, but not as deep as I'd hoped. I'm a little jaded that the game ended just as it seemed to be getting good, as I figured that this game would be long as the descriptions I've read, but they fail to mention that it's actually a series of seperate titles that make one long game. This game can be finished handily within 30-40 hours without much effort and if you're familiar. The story was pretty lack luster until the final couple chapters, but the writting is actually very good and contextually sensitive to what you've already finished or achieved before engaging in conversation. My final impression of the game is that it is built upon excellent game mechanics, but the final product feels incomplete despite it's good writting. If you like anime humor or anime plot lines, then you'll enjoy this game just for that.			"

												Best writing in a JRPG? This could have been a pretty boring game, but the writing is extremely good and carries the whole thing.The combat is sufficient, but not as interesting as it could have been. Right off the bat it seemed tedious, and stayed that way most of the game so far. (Well, it starts to get more interesting near the very end of the game.)Partly it's because the enemies are so utterly random that they're disconnected from everything. I want to go into a crypt and fight ghosts and skeletons, or a fire temple and fight fire elementals. At least make the enemies have some meaning. 90% of them are amalgamations of random plants and animals. Turtles in bubbles, sharks with legs, flying fish, bipedal sheep, etc.etc.etc.But aside from nitpicking, really this is a fantastic game. The writing is superb, and the overall design is great as well. Lots of good design decisions here and there that make you say ""hey, exactly, why don't other games do that!"".Now that I've completed it, yes, the writing is easily the strongest part of the game. I'm not sure I've played a more well-written game. Mass Effect is about the only thing I can think of, but I think this is even better. If the combat/gameplay was just a little better this would be pretty close to a perfect game.			"

												Very enjoyable JRPG, especially when the story kicks in even if it takes many hours for that to happen. The game got a good cast too, no characters are really annoying or act like a stupid brat. A nice touch is that NPCs often change what they say as you progress, unlike most JRPGs where NPCs say the same thing over and over.The soundtrack is unfortunately the weakest part of the game. It's not bad and fill it's purpose well enough as no songs feel out of place or anything, but compared to many other JRPGs that often have great soundtracks, this is pretty average with no songs being that special. More songs wouldn't hurt either, for a game you play 40-50 hours they get a bit repetitive. I was surprised to see that the game have 105 minutes of music in the game folder, certainly felt like less.			"

Posted: November 30, 2016
												All right, I have finished the game. Let's review the experience then! Introduction:  The beginning of the game is a heartwarming fairytale about Estelle and Joshua living under the care of their loving father Cassius. There is also hints about them being trained to become bracers, not just on their own but also due to their fathers tutelage. The player is introduced into the quartz system and is given a guide to read upon whenever you feel like it, I personally appreciated this, to be allowed to check upon the options on my own, not to get stuck in a tutorial (FF8 anyone? >,.<) which in all honesty feels like torture. Our prologue is the tutorial, part of the story and not really obviously a tutorial for the player. The game mechanics are simple and got some depth, although one might argue it's depth might be too shallow for an jrgp - but don't forget: Too much could be bad also. Plot I really enjoyed the plotline and it's mystery. I did guess correct more times than not about which people was the bad guys and whatnot - although there were some parts in the end I really couldn't grasp before some thought was put into it. I was honestly not very surprised about Joshuas past, but could not guess it all correct either. And that's fine. Sometimes a proven to be good plot should not be completely twisted around, that could alienate the player. Game designSimple, yet enchanting. I spent some time to decide what I really wanted to kit Estelle in - hard choices due to her not having so much EP in the base stats - but the complete freedom to build what you wanted did entice me to make her a badass quartz-sorcerer rather than a brainless whack-a-bam character. Turn based combat system might feel old now, but at the same time I was never truly bored in this game. Coming from Final Fantasy series, Suikoden, Warhammer tabletop games and rpg games in general, I simply felt at home here. Art The art style was very asian and typical jrpg. Almost too much, I felt no real uniqueness to it. I had trouble taking the characters seriously reading the text. The bad guys felt obvious in the art combined with the text. If it was intended, fine. But I felt it could've been better, less obvious. A touch of the artists peronalities was lacking. Characters: Overall, the characters in the game was reasonably interesting, Estelle and Joshuas relationship was interesting to follow, as well as the side characters involvement. But I must also admit, they did feel a little bland too, lacking depth. But maybe this is intentional for the sequel to explore? Favourite character. Olivier. His personality was very unexpected and interesting in this game, I felt he added a true touch of charm and flavor in the game.Least favourite character: Tita. I detest small children using big guns in games. It never stuck as cute nor interesting at all as a concept for me. I refused to use her whenever I wasn't forced to. If anything, I would've liked the odd old professor as a companion using weird random gadgets and weapons. A huge potential loss in my opinion. Conclusion I give this game 9/10. A very light and solid rpg for sure. Don't expect much heavy reading here. But going overboard would not help anyone either. A feel good game, closely connected to the feel good movie of older days. Maybe if I can afford it, I will buy and play/review the sequel. If I ever get the spare change needed. Living as a student is harsh! Recommendations I can recommend this game for people who stand at the fence, wanting to test rpg's for the first time. Or anyone who enjoyed Suikoden and it's simple combat system. Diehard rpg fans who only seek depths and harshness like Witcher 3 or a time consuming relative of Disgaea would not enjoy this game - it's not deep or complicated enough for you.    "

												Nihon Falcom, we meet again. Falcom, developer of the legendary Ys series that had it's start way back in the late 80s, found it's way into my heart with it's storytelling, gameplay, and soundtracks. But mainly, the only RPGs I have every really played, were Action RPGs that focused on free flowing combat and skill to take down the most difficult of bosses. Now I'm no stranger to Japanese action RPGs, but as for turn-based stuff, Trails in the Sky FC was my very first 'experience' with the turn-based formula from beginning to end, and I am very, very glad I gave JRPGs a second chance to win me over. Trails in the Sky is unlike any game you've ever played. Like most JRPGs, you will experience the inner conflicts of the protagonist, trying to establish their place in the world, along with love, death, betrayal, and hidden pasts and motives. But lots of times, to build up such a large story, development in other areas of the game that can be considered important can sometimes be neglected. However, with Trails, the story is rich, deep, epic, and most importantly, it breathes life and balance into other areas of the adventure that sometimes aren't developed more. This is world-building at it's finest. Townsfolk that change dialogue after finishing new missions, and other characters that join Estelle and Joshua on their journey that you'll always remember fondly until the very end. This game is one of the few titles where my eyes water during certain scenes, which is a testament to how well developed the story is, and how your attachment to the characters builds, and stays with you through to the end.This game is very, very long, and it's only the first game out of three, but aside from the story, the turn based combat system just feels amazing. Strategy/Tactical RPG fans will notice the grid based battlefield when planning a character's attack, which adds quite a bit of flexibility to your strategies when fighting, but unit placement is nowhere near as important as it is in a game like Agarest. Combat is simple, fun, and never seems to get dull or boring.The Orbment system also adds flexibility because you can build your characters into roles you want them to serve. Want to build a balanced team of healing, buffing, and DPS? You got it. Want to have a more DPS heavy team? You can do it. The orbment system is very fun to play with, and the huge amount of Quartz gems make for tons of different combinations to experiment and play with in battle. Overall, Trails in the Sky is a game with the deepest character development I've ever seen in an RPG, a fun and simple battle system, and one hell of an epic storyline that will board you on the feels train all the way to the very end. For the first game of a trilogy in the Trails arc, I cannot recommend this game enough. $20 for 60+ hours of enjoyment well spent. And supporting localization for more amazing titles to come on PC!Now to wait patiently until Second Chapter.			"

												It's a great travesty that garbage like Neptunia is more highly regarded than this masterpiece.There isn't much I can say about this game that hasn't already been said. It's great. The battle system is decent, albeit very easy. The atmosphere is perfect; the game does an excellent job of capturing the feeling of an adventure of discovery, and while the story is slow-paced up until the second half, it's fitting for the tone of the game. The characters are all endearing and likable, and relatively fleshed out for their screentime. The world is absolutely one of the most detailed and believable ever presented in a videogame, with a lot of complexity and minutiae to discover. Every NPC has their own small storyline that runs parallel to the main plot, which makes the world feel so much more alive than most games where NPCs are hardly anything more than decorations. The music is relaxing and enjoyable - even the battle theme is smooth and jazzy - up until the game gets serious and it changes pace to fit that. The character interactions are absolutely fantastic and there's a lot of subtlety to the way the story and characterization is presented, especially in the foreshadowing department. All in all you're doing yourself a massive disservice if you pass this game up and consider yourself in any way to be a fan of RPGs or detailed story-based games, as the series is one of the absolute best in that department. Trails in the Sky is the weakest game in the series in terms of gameplay and the third weakest in the story and character department, but it's still an incredibly enjoyable experience. Also, the sequel is crazy ♥♥♥♥ing good.			"

												Pretty much the almost near perfect JRPG of my Dreams. Pros:Talking to NPC are pretty enjoy seeing the Hero Interact with them.Smooth Hybrid Classic style Battle System (don't expect to Mash ATK and win).Godlike Music.Story Characters each have some kind of flare to them making them pretty lovable.A very wonderful looking environment.$20 for this game? Hella Cheap.Cons:It's a really old Game that is release in 2014 might not appeal to Newer Gen of JRPG players.Text can get a lil mashed together or gets too Small.SC isn't released yet nor if there a hint of a US TT to complete this series.At times it does have a lot of useless dialogue that can drag on a cut sence.IMPORTANT SIDE NOTE: (Crashing Game Bug)This games does crash a lot when you try to do any sort of shopping or Leaving a BuildingI ran many Test I recommend using from the Default setting just setting only the ""Shadow Quality"" to the Lowest setting by far I played the game without much problems(Don't get your hopes up). But, that doesn't mean that XSEED should not fix this.			"

												ALRIGHT, I HAVE TIME TO WRITE A REVIEW.The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a fantastic example of a JRPG that doesn't follow the final fantasy model of rpgs while still holding onto remanents of it. I've always been a big fan of position-based RPGS, although lacked skill in playing them. What I meant earlier that it still held remanents of the model is that positioning is just a way of balancing weapon range, arts (might as well be called magic), and speed. This makes the game feel like a traditional JRPG although the gameplay is completely different, which makes this game a whole lot better in my opinion.When I first started the game, there were two surprises that I wasn't expecting. One was the great design of the GUI overlay, and the second was the graphics. Simply put, the graphics in this game are initially off-putting. As soon as I saw the low poly count of props, I was immediately reminded of PSP games emulated on the PC. Low and behold, this was a PSP conversion over to PC. However, what it makes up in low poly count props and pixelated walls are HD character pictures and fairly well done character models. I'd say the latter was more important in terms of graphics, since I quickly got used to the environmental graphics. The visuals of the games are one of the only small cons that I saw in this game, so it was no big deal.The overarching storyline is pretty good. Two ""bracers"" (basically adventurers) end up setting off on a journey in solving Liberal's (the country) problems, and meet many companions/enemies along the way. There's alot of character development going on between every character interaction, keeping me intrigued to the plotline at all times. There are moments of tensity, sorrow, and laughter. I only see a problem in the classic ""deus ex machina"" in alot of scenarios (if you've played the game, you know what I'm talking about). Overall, plot is very good and intriguing but I find it would be more compelling without the sudden ""I actually had a trump card all along!"" points.The battle system, as in all JRPGs, are what takes the cake. The customizability of each character is insane, with hundreds of combinations possible. The game even gives you a BOOK that has 3 pages  which tells you what combination of orbments make what spells. Attacking is very simple, reminding me more of final fantasy than fire emblem, and keeps the gameplay easy to learn yet still involve a measurable amount of skill. My only complaint is that monster patterns are limited and repetitive after fighting several battles in the same area (which is probably why you can avoid them, but sometimes it's needed to fight for XP/items). Otherwise, I loved the traveling/battle system greatly over ""walk a certain amount of steps before reaching another random encounter"" system. I could go into greater detail of the battle system, but you'd learn it anyway if you just play the damn game.The biggest issue I found playing this game was compatibility. It took me half a hour to search up solutions to why this game would crash immediately after running at first. This game should at least include a help/FAQ compartment inside that gives off solutions, since I believe not all gamers know of ""forums"". Nonetheless, this game is worthwhile if you ever get it to run. Highly recommend buying it. It's 50+ hours of addictive content, with additional playtime if you want to get every achievement. Now one of my favorite JRPGs I've ever played.			"

												Possibly one of the best jrpgs I've ever played and I highly reccomend it to anyone interested in the genre. The pacing is a little slow but it's building up to the 2nd game in the series which should be out soon.The main characters are built up really well and very loveable. Combat is ok, not fantastic but not a drag and the orbment system is pretty cool to play around with.I reccomend it for the fantastic characters and storyline and can't wait for the next one.			"

												So I had never heard of this game until Kotaku made a fuss about it -- which did not translate into this being an instabuy because I have been burnt by professional reviewers before.  With that being said, the first 5 hours of Trails in the Sky have proven to be the best thing I've tried since the original Wild Arms.  (There have been better since then, but Wild Arms PS2 is the last game I can think of that has that folksy classic vibe while still using 3Dish sprites.)  Recommended for all lovers of JRPGs that move away from the Final Fantasy Cookie Cutter.			"

												ITactical combat. Interesting skills and abilities. An absorbing, engaging plot. Characters you want to grow with.Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky has none of these things. Instead, you get tired, limited - and very slow - combat; a rather creepy romance sub-plot; lots and lots (and I really do mean lots) of text to read; a plot that really doesn't get going until very, very late in the game; horrible, twee and juvenile writing and padding. Lots of padding.There is a charm to the graphics outside of combat, though....TL;DRI didn't like this. At all. And I'm going to go into a lot of detail about why. I don't really expect anybody to read this, but hey, it's cathartic.It's been a while since I've played a 'proper' JRPG and, sadly, having played this it's not only made me happily remove the Second Chapter from my wishlist, but put me off playing any other JRPGs for a while too. I mean, it's so bad it has compelled me to write my first review.But everybody else loves it?Yep, I'm going against the majority view here and, admittedly, I'm not an obsessive fan of JRPGs (though one of my favourites of all time in Shining Force 2 - unless we're saying that's a SRPG? In which case it's probably Lost Odyssey). But I love the RPG genre, turn-based in particular, and there aren't that many to choose from outside of RPG Maker attempts (though that is changing).So what's wrong with it/you? (delete as appropriate)Okay, where to start? (That applies to either of the above statements)Well, for the first few hours I didn't mind it. Sure, there was a lot of talking to get through before seeing my first combat grid, but it was alright. I found the world to have a bit of charm and the orbment mechanic seemed to have potential.So...?But then...nothing happened. I expected the story would open out into something vaguely interesting (it didn't), the orbments to provide some real tactics in combat (they didn't), the characters to become appealing (...you can guess my comment here) - but no.Well that's nice and vague. What were your issues specifically?Specifically, Estelle was incredibly irritating, Joshua was a smug so-and-so, Cassius was some superhero that everybody in the world seemed to know, Olivier and Scherazard were meant to provide some 'comedy' and failed etc - I basically hated them all. The script was awful too, constantly doing that thing we see in US TV where every part of the plot has to be insultingly explained for the viewer in great detail. It also did the whole 'I know something important but I'm not going to say anything yet because [reasons]' far too often, then followed that up post something happening with the 'Yes, that's what I thought would happen.'I gather that there are some callbacks in the next game to the world-building in place in here, but whether any of that is meaningful is debatable. I'm sure somebody can clarify.Regardless, there is a lot of dreadful dialogue to get through, with everybody seemingly never having spoken to people before and feeling the need to relate a life story whenever you get close. There are fairly frequent long-spells where all you are doing is wishing you could skip through the text quicker. I admit that I stopped reading completely during Chapter 3 because it was all too much - and that probably saved me another few hours playtime.Then there is the turn-based combat. At the start I thought the orbment idea had potential but it never played out, nor was stuff explained anywhere. The characters never felt they had defined roles - there was no real stand-out arts user (though some characters had much bigger EP pools, they didn't have considerably better art attacks) and melee was similar output for everybody too - they all felt pretty much the same.Mixing orbments up didn't really do much to the tactical element either, something I put down to the fact that proper debuffs/status affects don't really exist; you'd never cast an art purely for the potential status affect (not with a massive 10% chance of success) so it became more just about pure damage-dealing.And - as noted above - everything happened so slowly (by this I mean the arts/movement/melee animations and AI turns etc). And last bit spoiler: it really grated that in the last dungeon melee on the doom machines was almost useless and you have to constantly use arts, those battles became long, tedious affairs that where I never felt in danger, but still had to waste time seeing the same poorly-animated spells going off again and again. Or maybe I was underleveled for this bit - I did every side mission bar 1 and only fought the chest monsters in the last area so was around level 38 when I finished, but given the Death Rage spam instantly killed any character it was cast on, I'm guessing the game expected me to grind a bit to make that fight (and the chest fights) a bit easier. Had I not beaten the boss on my first go I probably would have gone a-grinding for a bit.I actually started this on Christmas day 2014 - so it's taken a year to finish. I remember getting through the first 10-15 hours pretty quickly, but then got bogged-down and couldn't face playing it, so dipped in-and-out for an hour here and then over a number of months. It's only in the past 6 weeks or so that I made a concerted effort to complete it so I could remove it from my library; I couldn't abandon it because I'd already invested too long in it.So was there anything you liked about it? Any chance you'll change your mind on getting Second Chapter?There were some good things in it. The difficulty dropping if you lost the same fight too many times was good; it looked rather nice outside of the combat portion and it was pretty easy overall, with the odd spike here and there.But there's nothing that would make me consider getting Second Chapter; I just had no interest in the overall story and certainly no love for the characters, so I wouldn't be interested in spending another 50+ hours with them. And from what I've seen, the next game is almost exactly the same in terms of the combat, which I didn't enjoy this time around. So no.Well thanks for that. You should have just stuck to saying ""I thought this was rubbish!""True - but where's the fun in that?			"

												By far one of the best games I played in 2016. I only wish I wouldn't have waited so long to start it. I've owned this two separate times for Sony PSP, but never started it. Only after playing a few hours into Trails of Cold Steel did I get the ""Trails"" bug and felt I needed to know more about the world Falcom has created for us. Memorable characters, great stroyline, fantastic character interaction. I'm 25 hours into Trails in the Sky SC and can't wait for 3rd to come out this spring. My biggest wish is that we finally get Trails of Azure, and Trails of Zero. This game is a ""must play.""			"

The combat is tons of fun as well, utilizing tactics in simple encounters and even in boss fights. I think there are times that it can be a little ""busy"" with all the sidequesting and hidden secrets to find, but that's part of the charm for these kinds of games. Can't wait to play SC!			"

												Gosh, I'm not sure where to start. Literally just finished this game 5 minutes from writing this.The story is great but takes some time to really get to the meat of it. Paying attention to the various happenings as you travel really helps to bring everything together, but is not necessary. I'm just especially anal about such things and think that they added nice little nuances as the story unfolded--you could even puzzle some of them out, but I won't be spoiling anything here. Just know that there is the obvious story with side quests and there is the hidden story, the one that is overarching for all of the games and I'm digging it so far! Even had me tearing up right at the end there. qqThe combat isn't hard, but some things are annoying. For example, the inability to manually move and attack within the same turn is not possible as far as I have seen. You can either move manually and do nothing or move automatically and attack. This kind of makes combat feel a little less tactically controllable as seems a shame sometimes to waste a whole turn just moving out of an attack or repositioning for your next one. Other than that, I love the orbment system. I feel like you can really customize th types of magic you want each character to have plus extra buffs to go along with it. And you can change these out while you're on the road to suit the circumstances. Only have fire but the enemies are weak to water? Switch 'em out!I love the various personalities of all the party members you meet--and absolutely loathe some of the characters that are NPCs but that's just good writing in my opinion! Party members will leave gear behind if you won't be seeing them for a while so you don't have to worry about anyone running off with the good gear and/or orbments! Weapons are character specific.I did not have any boss or progression troubles, but I could definitely see how other players could if they skip too many field enemies. You can SEE these enemies from a distance away so they are easy to avoid, but avoiding too many during any chapter can seriously put you behind in levels. I don't see this as a con, just a typical RPG mechanic. However, the temptation to skip field enemies to get to the story can be too great sometimes. Just trying to give out some friendly advice.The enemies also get more sophisticated as you scale up; they tend to start out as the easiest and only one or two at a time in each chapter, but then you get greater numbers of enemies with more intricate attacks, resistances, strengths, et cetera. It keeps you on your toes in places and really makes you pick your battles--preemptive attacks are the best for learning/beating hard enemies! The only time this doesn't work is on treasure chest enemies, which cannot be back attacked and which only show themselves when you open the chest they are guarding. However, when beaten, these chests tend to give GREAT loot--gear, weapons, orbments, et cetera.Some technical issues I had could be annoying but were not anything game-breaking. I had an issue where opening the menu once would not show any item descriptions and I would have to close and re-open the menu to see these descriptions. I also had severe stuttering and skipping during parts of the game, mostly in towns and dungeons. This didn't start happening until about halfway through my playthrough. They never froze my game, but they did give me concern that it would. It could also make things tough in the dungeons when I need to pick and choose my battles and navigate; I could never find a fix for this issue. Nothing game-breaking, but I'm not sure if some update or something caused these. I didn't have them when I first downloaded and played the game.That's about all I can think of to write. I already have the SC downloaded and ready to play! I hope this review encourages you to try this game out if you're on the fence! I had never heard of it before encountering it on Steam and the reviews I read really let me know that this was a game I would enjoy--and I did, for about 54 hours, haha! Looking forward to seeing the saga continue and I can't wait for the Third Chapter to get here! o/			"

I am currently starting my second playthrough of it and all ready I am starting to remember how amazing it was. The ending is beautiful and I cannot wait for the sequel to be released on pc.

The Legends of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (First Chapter) is a JRPG set in an industrial era which follows the adventures of two young heroes, Estelle and Joshua. The game has a perfect balance of story, main quests, and side missions. The game is fairly challenging in the combat mode, which is somewhat simple. All of the characters are easy to attatch to. The ending caught me by surprise, and now I am impatiently waiting the second chapter that is being translated into English and will hopefully be out in a couple of months at the time of this post.

												What a game. I'm a huge J-RPG fan, it's my favorite genre by far, but, as in every category, J-RPGs can be vastly different one from another.This is an ""old-school"" J-RPG, where the emphasis is put on the characters and the story, with a servicable battle system (that gets more interesting in higher difficulties, but not the main focus), and I must say, it might rely here and there on well-known ""tropes"", but the quality of writing and the way things are told is nothing short of perfect.So, if you like J-RPGs for their memorable stories and characters, hop aboard! Trails in the Sky takes its time, it's a slow start, but for all the building that is presented through the game, there is always a pay-off, and a great one.DO NOTE that this game ends on a cliffhanger, and that its sequel, Trails in the Sky Second Chapter, begins right after this one finishes. In more than one way, they are one really big game divided in two for development reasons (and not for some cash-grab). That being said, it has become one of my favorite J-RPG of all times, along titles like Suikoden 2, Final Fantasy 6 and the likes.			"

												I am a person who rather play than read and/or watch.Do understand few things: not to brag, but I've played many, MANY JRPGS and plot-heavy games through my life. Some even helped me decide my life's decision. After the first chapter of the game, I can easily tell/guess the coming plot. It is almost too easy to guess what's coming. That itself usually puts a -10 in my books, because the plot twists are no longer a twist...it's something expected. However....This....this story... It got me so hooked onto it that I laughed and smiled at the accomplishments of the characters, and cried tears of joy during happy times; and not forgetting, the sad tears I have gushing out from my eyes when it is at the end. The way the characters developed, the pure honest to goodness emotions that is overflowing from the characters, warms my heart.Gameplay:Simple, easy enough for beginner gamers to adapt, and nightmare difficulty for those maniacs. In other words, easy to learn but hard to master. 8/10Story:........ 10/10Character Development:....... 9.5/10Graphics:Old school styled. Not really high end, but that makes it more accessible for most people. 7/10Game Logic:There's tons of magic and high leaping around... but yet again this is a fantasy world so.... 7/10For those who wants immerse and entertain themselves for 50+ hours, 10/10 get it.For those who wants to improve their gaming's strategic sense, 9/10 get it, and play on nightmare.

												This game is absolutely wonderful, and I'll enumerate why it's great, but there are several really good reasons to not buy it if they apply to you.Don't buy the game if:>You don't like to read a lot of dialogue>You expect to 100% the game without a guide>You want a plot that's exciting and stuffed full of action throughout>You don't want to wait for ""the summer of 2013"" for XSEED to localize the Second Chapter (sequel)Getting past all of that (which is easy if you have any manner of patience), you've got a really nice, quaint JRPG with SRPG elements like battle placement. The plot is simple, engaging, and well-crafted, but it really hooks you in because of its characters. If you take a few seconds to open yourself up to the characters, you'll find that they're really quite extensively shaped through the game's dialogue. The two protagonists are both fleshed out nicely and work very believably together. The combat systems are fairly robust, and the orbal system (by which you gain the ability to use spells and get some passive buffs) is done well, even though these systems really start to shine in the game's sequel/second chapter.The PC port of this game (it was originally a PSP game, as I recall) is extremely efficient. Toasters and microwaves could run this game easily. Many standard options for PC versions of games that you'd expect are there, and the controls for the game give you enough control to play the game with no trouble at all; most of the time you could play the game with one hand if you rebind all your keys for use near WASD (or you can control the game entirely with your mouse). If you're one of those weenies that cares about your JRPGs being too tropey or whatever, you don't really have to worry about that. There's nothing that's gonna ruffle your delicate feathers in this game, and it's really not anything you'd see in a cheap anime. There are a few elements borrowed from culture at large and some clever extrapolation can get you figuring out some of the twists before they happen, but you're mostly going to be in the dark.Expect a cliffhanger ending, since the game is and always has been part of a planned trilogy. Completing the game, however, is still quite satisfying, and I really do think that most fans of the JRPG and SRPG genres will quite like this game. I CERTAINLY did.			"

												I am not one for long reviews, so...Great combat. Simple to learn, hard to master. The graphics aren't great, but frankly it is more of an art style so I will cut them slack for that. And for the story... the feels are so strong with this one. Yes, 100% recommend			"

												What a game. I'm a huge J-RPG fan, it's my favorite genre by far, but, as in every category, J-RPGs can be vastly different one from another.This is an ""old-school"" J-RPG, where the emphasis is put on the characters and the story, with a servicable battle system (that gets more interesting in higher difficulties, but not the main focus), and I must say, it might rely here and there on well-known ""tropes"", but the quality of writing and the way things are told is nothing short of perfect.So, if you like J-RPGs for their memorable stories and characters, hop aboard! Trails in the Sky takes its time, it's a slow start, but for all the building that is presented through the game, there is always a pay-off, and a great one.DO NOTE that this game ends on a cliffhanger, and that its sequel, Trails in the Sky Second Chapter, begins right after this one finishes. In more than one way, they are one really big game divided in two for development reasons (and not for some cash-grab). That being said, it has become one of my favorite J-RPG of all times, along titles like Suikoden 2, Final Fantasy 6 and the likes.			"

												Great story telling. It's not particularly deep but it builds at a good pace to a pretty awesome ending. The characters, both NPCs as well as party members,  are all really fun. One of the party members who joins is one of the most amusing RPG character I've seen. Combat is okay'ish. On default difficulty there were a couple tricky fights and a few where I was nervous I might lose, especially toward the end, but they never reached the point of being frustrating. Another plus is that there was no grinding, the thing that usually turns me off from JRPGs. You can easily avoid random encounters if you feel like it once you get the 'Eagle Eye' quartz.			"

												The best JRPG I’ve played since Chrono Trigger.  SETTING: Trails in the Sky takes place in a fantasy world where people travel around in airships and enjoy many modern conveniences thanks to the development of crystal-based Orbal technology.  The story begins on the eve of the Queen’s birthday celebration, 10 years after the kingdom’s last big war.  When I started the game, I actually thought this setting didn’t sound particularly interesting (airships remind me of the SNES Final Fantasy), but the story soon sucked me in.  Trails in the Sky is a big game, over the course of which you have a wide world to explore.  And yet each town and location has its own distinct flavor: it never feels like “oh here’s another stop off point with an inn and a weapon shop.  The history and backstory revealed over the course of the game is also more interesting than I thought it would be.  STORY: It’s also a long game (and this is just Part I), but—once things really get started—you’re pushed on by a compelling narrative.  In the main story, there’s never any backtracking, padding or enforced level grinding; it’s more like you finish one big mission only to be confronted with a new emergency.  The story contains some great twists and defied my genre-based expectations.  For example, you might think you’d be chasing down those Sky Bandits you hear about throughout the whole game, but by the end of the first chapter you’ve moved on to face new intrigue.  You’re also arrested at some point, and I thought “Oh, here comes the part where you need to break out of prison” but things resolve themselves differently.CHARACTERS: The setting and plot are great, but the key to a good story is always the characters.  And Trails in the Sky is populated with a memorable cast of characters.  There are the heroes: at the start of the game Estelle is sort of a headstrong tomboy and Joshua, her adopted brother whose past (before their father took him in) is a mystery, takes things more seriously and is a bit of a goody-two-shoes.  Some of the best parts in the game are the “down time” moments where we see Estelle and Joshua grow as characters, learn about their family’s history and watch their relationship evolve.  There are also plenty of memorable secondary characters; even many who play only a minor role are given a distinct personality.  Some may be a little cartoonish (playing Trails in the Sky is a bit like being in the middle of a good anime), others start out seeming like caricatures but later reveal more depth.  COMBAT AND GAMEPLAY: The combat system is mostly what you’d expect in a JRPG.  There are a few elements that stuck out for me, such as the fact that players and opponents (basically) occupy places on a grid and you sometimes need to factor in distance and how far you can move in a turn.  You can also strategically plan your actions to make the most of bonuses that are tied to specific turns.  The biggest element is the use of battle quartzes that you either find or have crafted: these determine which arts (magic spells, basically) each character will have in her arsenal as well as giving bonuses.  You have only a limited number of slots so you have to make choices, and the ways you’ll use each character in combat will differ a lot based on which quartz you give them.  Another element that stood out for me are the Recipes: instead of just buying heal potions, you can learn a number of different recipes and (combining items you get from killing monsters with ingredients you buy from the general store) you can make various food items that each restore a certain amount of health, cure different abnormal conditions (e.g. being poisoned) and may even give you some sort of boost.  I spent a lot of time learning recipes and cooking things.GRAPHICS, SOUND, MUSIC: Basically, on the high end of what you’d expect from a JRPG.  For the most part nothing to write home about, but every so often there'll be a visual sequence that stands out (e.g. looking out over the waterfalls or exploring the royal castle).TRANSLATION AND LOCALIZATION: Excellent.  Almost without exception, the English dialogue sounds totally natural.  If I were to nitpick, there are a couple of places where I think culturally specific elements could have been dealt with a bit better (mostly the flamboyant character getting called a pervert—but, eh, he is sort of a pervert).CRITICISMPACING/SIDE QUESTS: Having said all that, the game can be slow in parts if you try to complete all the optional side quests and find all the chests containing special items.  These are optional, but doing these jobs is part of your duties as a Bracer.  Some are interesting, but later on many seem repetitive.  Some also have a, not entirely transparent, time limit for completion.  Because of this I seemed to fail one in each town (there are also hidden side quests).  The time limit can be particularly frustrating as—main story wise—you are simultaneously being told, “We need to get to X right away.”  In other words, unless you ignore the false sense of urgency you can miss the deadline to complete some jobs.QUARTZ/ARTS SYSTEM: Figuring out which quartz you need and which order to put them in in order to get specific arts is complicated and I never really got the hang of it.NON-LETHAL K.O.: The game specifies that when HP reaches 0 you’re only K.O.’d and not actually dead (which, thank goodness, because I’ve had to revive characters a number of times), but Trails in the Sky does have some of those frustrating moments of “ludonarrative dissonance” where you defeat some important opponents (all of them are K.O.’d) only to have them escape out the window to fight another day or (even more egregious) refuse to cooperate and act like they can still take you on again(!).  Yes, this is a convention of the genre and in MOST cases it’s justified in service of the story, but it’s a pet peeve of mine.   CONCLUSION: Those are the only things I can find to criticize and they’re minor points.  In general, this game is great fun.  I see myself replaying it sooner or later in order to find all the secrets I missed out on the first time around.  Especially if you find this on sale, don’t hesitate to snag it!  If you like JRPG at all you will not regret the purchase!			"

TL DR: You will either hate or love this game. This is true JRPG, with a lot of text with an intricate story that takes its time to be told but pays off in the end.This was a game that surprised me a lot! As an old school JRPG fan, I've been getting the feeling the genre has been dying out or as turned into the now acceptable, bland and cliché storylines with characters so generic and empty, they might as well be any random NPC you control under fancy combat mechanics where in the end you just end up mashing the same buttons. Not the mention the fan service weeb-fest.This game proved me that there is still hope in this genre, but the catch is, you will either love or hate this game for the reasons pointed above. This game is very dialogue heavy, the story take its time to settle since the characters are the ones that move the plot (the prologue can take up to 4hrs or way more if you explore everything) - But it's not a bad thing, because the game very intelligently written, with moments of pure awkwardness to emotional character development. It’s just if you aren’t used to playing what an actual old school JRPG is, you will probably think the game is slow, the graphics are dated, the combat is boring and the characters that everyone praises you don’t care for them. And you will probably be right, because it takes time and patience to reach the payoff stageBut if you are a true fan of JRPG’s you will love this one. The story is phenomenal, in most part due to the diverse and fully fleshed-out characters that will drive you to keep advancing the plot just so you can see what happens next. It’s like a good book, where you just have to keep turning page after page because you are so immerse in the experience. It doesn’t rely on fancy mechanics and graphics but rather puts its energy in creating an immerse world and characters along with a great soundtrack. And the combat can be complex if you let it to, though it can also be broken once you find the secret combo recipe :)Honestly my only complaint is that, the world environment is so richly detailed it’s a shame you don’t interact with it that much (like plundering NPC’s houses, or finding ingredients off the road to craft meals).

												This game is seriously great. If you like any of the Ys games and want a turn based JRPG instead, this is right up your alley. Let's say you play through it and love it. There's two more chapters, and they're just as long, satisfying, and noteworthy. We should be seeing the second chapter soon, and based on its performance, we'll see the third. The characters are all likeable and have their own quirks. A bit of weirdness, badassery, and good comical fun. The story and pacing is great. Full of mystery, intrigue, and wonder. It might take a bit to start up as far as the story goes, but once you're in, you're hooked.			"

A big world for you to explore. It is the game in which even treasure chests have dialogue. What other game does that? Ah, and Olivier. You will love that blonde trobadour.Good gameplay mechanics, very good music. And a sequel coming soon for that ending. Have I mentioned Olivier?Cons are the list of bug and crashes, which are being worked on while I write this; the lack of the Monster Guide, which should be added soon; the fact that the Second Chapter is not here yet.Let's hope XSEED brings the rest of the series to Steam. Yes, it is THAT good of a series.NOW, GO BUY THIS GAME. AND GIVE IT AS PRESENT FOR ALL YOUR FRIENDS.PRAISE EIDOSPS: Ooops, it's Aidios in the translated version :P			"

												The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a charming and delightful RPG, and I’m very glad it made its way onto Steam.  It’s an entry in the recent trend of “jRPG/Console-style RPG” being ported to PCs, and it is a darn fine ambassador of the genre.  It does adhere to character archetypes and story tropes common to the genre, but even these familiar elements are so lovingly handled that they only serve to increase the quality of the game.  In fact, there’s this sense that a great deal of affection went into the game’s production.  For example, nearly every NPC no matter how incidental has a name, a believable place in the world, and frequently updating dialogue that progresses with and reacts to the evolving story.  It’s this attention to detail that makes Trails in the Sky feel like a living setting.The game features a turn-based combat system that incorporates movement and positioning into the fights and places great weight on the initiative system.  These elements help make combat a more tactical affair than simply repeatedly selecting the “Attack” option until all the enemies fall down, though admittedly that is still a valid strategy at times.Trails in the Sky took me about 50 hours to play through at a leisurely clip.  The story is a bit slower paced, but intentionally so.  Appropriate time is spent developing and exploring characters and places, and even familiar and cliche concepts are made fresh (or at least fun) with the extra time spent getting to know them.This is a game I have no hesitation recommending for both newcomers and fans of the genre.  Here’s looking forward with anticipation and excitement to the next one!			"

												One of the greatest stories ive ever experianced in a game. This game is slow as heck off the start. the story isnt nearly as grand in scale as most games and its far slower paced then pretty much any RPG ive ever played. There is WAAAAAY more focus on story then combat. that said however the world is rich and full of life. NPCs are literally more intresting then full blown characters in other games out there. So many interconnected stories going on in the background the world building is astounding and the raw amount of text is totally insane if you dont like reading avoid this now. People change what they say after every tiny little story progression point and conections are facinating and a lot of fun to piece together from little everyday things to much grander things happening around you The world truely feels alive. In terms of combat its a mix of SRPG into a Turn based game. I really enjoy the effects meter next to the turn order so you can actaully tell when for instance ""a random critical hit"" is gonna happen and you can break the turn order so you can steal that crit for your team which is intresting and the craft system combine with ""EP (basically mana or SP in any other game). its not the best combat system out there but its different and its fun.the actual main plot takes its sweet time building up. if you have low patence or a bad attention span i wouldnt bother. If you are the type of person who can invest into something you will get a crazy well written story out of it. the writting style is much slower but its very steady. This game wont always be throwing plot points at you but its building upon the overall plot and when the plot twist happen oh my god.In terms of structure this game reminds me of the old SNES RPGs in terms of how it feels. take that design idea and push it foward i always found newer RPGs just dont have the magic that a lot of older SNES RPGs had but this took that feel to newer era of game design. Even the music it just has many tracks you can hum a long to as you walk down roads their memerable and sound amazing. Would I recemend it well if your intrested heck yeah. Its not a game for everyone but if this sounds like your cup of tea its bloody fantastic. and Xseed and Falcom are both awesome for making this happen and deserve the support Xseed is an awesome localization company that is true to their fans and you can talk to them on forums even and Falcom is a godlike game developer that just cares and does so many things right its crazy.

												Dear potential ""The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky"" buyer,as you are probably looking throught the reviews to read about the pros and cons about a game which you want to spend your hard earned money on, you came to the right place ! (or review ... ^^)Now that I already was on the same spot as you are now, I now want to cover some point of what you have to expect.First off, I have now finshed the game, which took me about 40 hours so I can confidently say I know the game a bit ;)These are the points I want to cover:-) Story-) Gameplay-) Controls-) Graphics-) Sound-) Conclusion-) StoryYou know that feeling when reading a good book and don't want to stop because you wanna know what happens next ? Well, welcome to The Legend of Heroes !It is really a very well written story with a lot of emotion. You can expect a rollercoaster ride with your heart once you are fallen with the characters. There is everything you want from a good story: love, hate, friendship, betrayal and tons of unexcpected events which makes it hard to stop playing.Even the NPCs (they don't deserve the name in this game as each and every of them as a personal story) are inflicted in the story and make it more complex.The only drawback is that this game only covers the first part of the trilogy (the other two part may arrive on steam too)I do not want to tell any of the story here as you should experience it for yourself ;)A little warning tough: If you don't like a lot of reading and and a deep an long story you are maybe wrong at this game.TL;DR: If you are fed up from shooter games with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story, feel free to jump in a game which will blow your mind.-) GameplayI would call the gameplay genre standard. It is a typical jrpg with turn based combat system. There is everything from basic attacks over special attacks (which are specific for every playable character) and magic (which is available through so called orbments). If you are familiar with the grandia series then you know how it works in this game. The game is not too hard nor too easy and has tons of quests and sidequests which you should complete to get more money to invest in better equiment and items to improve the stats of the characters. Important: You can beat the game without having to farm monsters. Speaking of monsters: The game is splitted in different areas called maps. Maps can be towns, passways, caves, buildings etc. and may contain enemys. You have to defeat enemys to make progress in the game and level up your character, which also increases stats.-) ControlsI am using the Xbox 360 Controller and the only thing that I have done is reassigning the X,Y,A and B buttons as it was not 100% comfortable at default.Other that that the controls work flawlessly.I cannot say how this game plays with keyboard and mouse as I didn't use them at all.-) GraphicsThe graphics are beautiful and look good, similar to the grandia series.XSEED recently started patching the games with HD textures (as stated on their facebook page), so it should get even better over time.It supports high resolution screens and I can safely say I had no issues and/or crashing the whole 40 hours.-) SoundI really enjoyed the orchestral soundtrack, which underlines and supports the story and makes it even more intense and dramatic. Be ready to get epic battle music when the big bosses show up.Other than that, the music is a little bit repetitive but it was not that big of a deal.P.s: the whole soundtrack is located in game directory (folder ""BGM"") and features high quality .ogg files.-) ConclusionIf you like JRPGs or you want to take a break from the plain old shooter games, than I can safely say that this game has very well earned your money and time. You get an awesome game with even better story, graphics and sound which will set you back 40 hours of great gameplay. "

												I never knew Nihon Falcom had an RPG series other than Ys, but I'm glad I tried this one out. While Ys tends to be more action and less story, this one is the polar opposite. While various elements of this game are reminiscent of the Tales series games, the storyline of this first chapter is incredibly detailed. It's the kind of storyline where you feel like the writers thought of everything. Any plot holes that may exist are minor but the conversation itself is intelligent, thoughtful, and thought provoking...while maintaining a good balance between the serious and the farcical.The music has an interesting mix of jazz, classical, and folk elements and it all comes together quite nicely. All that aside, the ""Story Rich"" tag is an understatement -- I don't think I've seen any RPG with the Story:Gameplay ratio of this game, even if you include Tales games' skits. (and Final Fantasy tends to drop the storyline around the third act -- this game does not) As a result, the gameplay is a bit simplistic and underdeveloped...but it's not hair pullingly difficult either. The AI in general seems extremely simple and easy to manipulate to score cheap victories in the tougher battles. If your dark secret is that you only play RPGs for the story, it's worth grabbing this title.			"

												The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky finally comes to Steam! If you're into JRPGs then you need to play it.Amazing music, writing, characters, and a story you won't forget. Trails in the Sky is simply awesome.Trails in the Sky is the first game in an epic saga that's still going strong in Japan, so buy it and support the localization of more games of the series, believe me, you don't want to miss out on this one.

												Dear potential ""The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky"" buyer,as you are probably looking throught the reviews to read about the pros and cons about a game which you want to spend your hard earned money on, you came to the right place ! (or review ... ^^)Now that I already was on the same spot as you are now, I now want to cover some point of what you have to expect.First off, I have now finshed the game, which took me about 40 hours so I can confidently say I know the game a bit ;)These are the points I want to cover:-) Story-) Gameplay-) Controls-) Graphics-) Sound-) Conclusion-) StoryYou know that feeling when reading a good book and don't want to stop because you wanna know what happens next ? Well, welcome to The Legend of Heroes !It is really a very well written story with a lot of emotion. You can expect a rollercoaster ride with your heart once you are fallen with the characters. There is everything you want from a good story: love, hate, friendship, betrayal and tons of unexcpected events which makes it hard to stop playing.Even the NPCs (they don't deserve the name in this game as each and every of them as a personal story) are inflicted in the story and make it more complex.The only drawback is that this game only covers the first part of the trilogy (the other two part may arrive on steam too)I do not want to tell any of the story here as you should experience it for yourself ;)A little warning tough: If you don't like a lot of reading and and a deep an long story you are maybe wrong at this game.TL;DR: If you are fed up from shooter games with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story, feel free to jump in a game which will blow your mind.-) GameplayI would call the gameplay genre standard. It is a typical jrpg with turn based combat system. There is everything from basic attacks over special attacks (which are specific for every playable character) and magic (which is available through so called orbments). If you are familiar with the grandia series then you know how it works in this game. The game is not too hard nor too easy and has tons of quests and sidequests which you should complete to get more money to invest in better equiment and items to improve the stats of the characters. Important: You can beat the game without having to farm monsters. Speaking of monsters: The game is splitted in different areas called maps. Maps can be towns, passways, caves, buildings etc. and may contain enemys. You have to defeat enemys to make progress in the game and level up your character, which also increases stats.-) ControlsI am using the Xbox 360 Controller and the only thing that I have done is reassigning the X,Y,A and B buttons as it was not 100% comfortable at default.Other that that the controls work flawlessly.I cannot say how this game plays with keyboard and mouse as I didn't use them at all.-) GraphicsThe graphics are beautiful and look good, similar to the grandia series.XSEED recently started patching the games with HD textures (as stated on their facebook page), so it should get even better over time.It supports high resolution screens and I can safely say I had no issues and/or crashing the whole 40 hours.-) SoundI really enjoyed the orchestral soundtrack, which underlines and supports the story and makes it even more intense and dramatic. Be ready to get epic battle music when the big bosses show up.Other than that, the music is a little bit repetitive but it was not that big of a deal.P.s: the whole soundtrack is located in game directory (folder ""BGM"") and features high quality .ogg files.-) ConclusionIf you like JRPGs or you want to take a break from the plain old shooter games, than I can safely say that this game has very well earned your money and time. You get an awesome game with even better story, graphics and sound which will set you back 40 hours of great gameplay. "

												One of the greatest stories ive ever experianced in a game. This game is slow as heck off the start. the story isnt nearly as grand in scale as most games and its far slower paced then pretty much any RPG ive ever played. There is WAAAAAY more focus on story then combat. that said however the world is rich and full of life. NPCs are literally more intresting then full blown characters in other games out there. So many interconnected stories going on in the background the world building is astounding and the raw amount of text is totally insane if you dont like reading avoid this now. People change what they say after every tiny little story progression point and conections are facinating and a lot of fun to piece together from little everyday things to much grander things happening around you The world truely feels alive. In terms of combat its a mix of SRPG into a Turn based game. I really enjoy the effects meter next to the turn order so you can actaully tell when for instance ""a random critical hit"" is gonna happen and you can break the turn order so you can steal that crit for your team which is intresting and the craft system combine with ""EP (basically mana or SP in any other game). its not the best combat system out there but its different and its fun.the actual main plot takes its sweet time building up. if you have low patence or a bad attention span i wouldnt bother. If you are the type of person who can invest into something you will get a crazy well written story out of it. the writting style is much slower but its very steady. This game wont always be throwing plot points at you but its building upon the overall plot and when the plot twist happen oh my god.In terms of structure this game reminds me of the old SNES RPGs in terms of how it feels. take that design idea and push it foward i always found newer RPGs just dont have the magic that a lot of older SNES RPGs had but this took that feel to newer era of game design. Even the music it just has many tracks you can hum a long to as you walk down roads their memerable and sound amazing. Would I recemend it well if your intrested heck yeah. Its not a game for everyone but if this sounds like your cup of tea its bloody fantastic. and Xseed and Falcom are both awesome for making this happen and deserve the support Xseed is an awesome localization company that is true to their fans and you can talk to them on forums even and Falcom is a godlike game developer that just cares and does so many things right its crazy.

												After completing this game without any spoilers of any kind i can say without a shadow of a doubt, it is the best game i have played during my life. The story, the characters, the development of said characters, the gameplay, the humour, the amazing OST, the beautiful art style... This game is a true masterpiece. I am writing this moments after finishing chapter one and was litterally begging for chapter 2. If you must play any RPG game in your life, this is it.

												Do you like RPGs? Well, lucky you.♥♥♥♥♥♥(best name ever) is one of, if not the best, RPG you can find in Steam.Great and memorable characters, a grand (but kind of slow) story. A big world for you to explore. It is the game in which even treasure chests have dialogue. What other game does that? Ah, and Olivier. You will love that blonde trobadour.Good gameplay mechanics, very good music. And a sequel coming soon for that ending. Have I mentioned Olivier?Cons are the list of bug and crashes, which are being worked on while I write this; the lack of the Monster Guide, which should be added soon; the fact that the Second Chapter is not here yet.Let's hope XSEED brings the rest of the series to Steam. Yes, it is THAT good of a series.NOW, GO BUY THIS GAME. AND GIVE IT AS PRESENT FOR ALL YOUR FRIENDS.PRAISE EIDOSPS: Ooops, it's Aidios in the translated version :P			"

												I never knew Nihon Falcom had an RPG series other than Ys, but I'm glad I tried this one out. While Ys tends to be more action and less story, this one is the polar opposite. While various elements of this game are reminiscent of the Tales series games, the storyline of this first chapter is incredibly detailed. It's the kind of storyline where you feel like the writers thought of everything. Any plot holes that may exist are minor but the conversation itself is intelligent, thoughtful, and thought provoking...while maintaining a good balance between the serious and the farcical.The music has an interesting mix of jazz, classical, and folk elements and it all comes together quite nicely. All that aside, the ""Story Rich"" tag is an understatement -- I don't think I've seen any RPG with the Story:Gameplay ratio of this game, even if you include Tales games' skits. (and Final Fantasy tends to drop the storyline around the third act -- this game does not) As a result, the gameplay is a bit simplistic and underdeveloped...but it's not hair pullingly difficult either. The AI in general seems extremely simple and easy to manipulate to score cheap victories in the tougher battles. If your dark secret is that you only play RPGs for the story, it's worth grabbing this title.			"

												Super Short Review:A good 'traditional' JRPG with good story telling, characters, world and rpg gameplay. The RPG elements are simplistic and can get repetitive at times however different characters have some variable abilities and thus strategies. Overall this is a good first part in a 3 part series but it isn't anything mind blowing.			"

												Warning: If you play this game you might not be able to enjoy another jrpg of inferior quality ever again.Trails in the Sky is the first chapter in Nihon Falcom's long running Kiseki series. This JRPG has you follow brother and sister Estelle and Joshua as they embark on a grand adventure across the country of Liberl searching for their missing father while uncovering a secret conspiracy.This game features rich world building and a great attention to detail. All of your party members have such unique and interesting personalities that you'll be nicely immersed in the character development also. Falcom JDK Band's soundtrack once again takes center stage with comfortable music that makes you feel like you're right next to Estelle and Joshua as they trek the roads of Liberl.Combat is pretty fun too. With magic needing one turn to channel in this game, turn advancement and turn stealing become main focuses during battle. Nothing is more satisfying than your AoE magic landing on a critical turn bonus and wiping the entire enemy horde. My favorite part of the game mechanic has to be the Orbment system. Each character has a combat watch called the Orbment that you can outfit Gems, called Quartz, with. You generate spells by placing Quartz in a line and racking up elemental counts. I just love fidding with the Orbment to see what type of spells I can generate by different placement of Quartz. This game is all about being comfortable. With 100% escape rate against normal enemies, you are not required to fight every single foe you see (which is a plus too because this game does not have random encounter). You can skip most enemies if you like and get to the heartwarming slice of life main cutscenes. You can play the entire game with just a mouse too. Just relax and enjoy the story.Trails in the Sky is a solid JRPG with great world building, character development, and music. By the time you reach the ending you will beg for the heartwarming conclusion in Trails in the Sky Second Chapter with mind nukes, betrayals, happenings, and fateful confrontations along the way. You must play SC after this as the two games make up for one complete story.			"

												The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the sky is perhaps the most complete, detailed, fully realised game worlds I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing in my 15+ years of PC gaming. It also gave me strong vibes of the first Studio Ghibli film, Castle in the sky (a movie I very much enjoyed).The worldbuilding geek in me marvelled at the attention paid to the politics of the nations, the lore, character histories and motivations and the sheer epic scale of the adventure I undertook. The storytelling is truly excellent, with, different aspects of the story being developed in different parts and places. There'll be things that happen in the beginning of the game which are very much relevant to the endgame and they sort of surprise you when they crop back up again. I guess you could say there are layers to the storytelling.The characters were another very strong aspect of Legend of Heroes. Each character has their own story and motivations, and as I did quests with the various characters, I found myself bonding with them too. The attention to detail really pleased me, one can go to random corners of cities and talk to random people in their houses and they'll have their bit to say, and the characters around them will also be involved in the dialogue too. They have no bearing on the main story at all - or even any of the side quests yet all these details are there. There isn't a character or NPC in the game that doesn't have a name or some dialogue for them to say.The turn based combat is fun, and very strategic. How you equip your characters is very important in determining the dynamics of your battle and how your characters synergise (or otherwise) in battle. You can also organise the combat order, weapons and orbment powers.Graphically the game is OK, but seeing as the windows version was originally released in 2004, and this is an old school JRPG, there's really not a whole lot to expect in terms of fancy in game graphics. The rendered-scene art style is nice, however. Some of the dialogue can be a little weird at times, but I chalk that up to it being a Japanese game and there being a bit of a cultural divide, and possibly the case of some things simply not translating well.The game works really well, with only one very minor glitch encountered in my playthrough of ~54hrs (and I didn't even finish all the bracer quests) - and it was easy to work around it. I played this using a dualshock 4 controller and had no issues accessing all the menus and playing the game seamlessly. There is simply so much depth to this game in terms of combat mechanics, worldbuilding, lore and characters that I was as immersed in this game, nay moreso immersed, than I have been in most modern AAA 3D titles, despite the core game itself being over a decade old. The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the sky absolutely has my recommendation, particularly for fans of world-building, fantasy and good storytelling. Now someone please hurry up and translate chapter 2!

												""Trails in the Sky"" is a truly special Japanese RPG from Falcom, with all of the classic turn based goodness and none of the bloat that can at times make the genre tedious.  You play as a pair of young adventures who set out across a vast continent to explore and help those in need.  Things slowly escalate into a story of friendship, love, betrayal, espionage with of course lots of monsters.  This is the first game of ""The Legend of Heroes trilogy"".  The other two are still being localized for English audiences (due out 2015/2016).  It’s taken a while to translate due to the incredibly vast amount of text in each game.  This is great if you love a good story, but you will have to be willing to read a lot, there is no voice acting to be found.  However if you stick with it you will be rewarded with a memorable yarn.Graphically the game is dated (2004) but still very enjoyable, very bright and vivid, and the lovely sound track really compliments the visuals.  Game play is a refined and polished turn based affair with attacks, magic, special moves and a fair sized casts of unique characters to try out in battle.  There is also a gem system that allows you to customize your characters magic as you see fit.  All foes are present on screen (no random battles) and you can save at any time (not just at check points).  Plenty of side quests to complete and special loot to find make “Legend of Heroes"" very addicting for the JRPG crowd.  Overall ""Trails in the Sky"" is one of the crown jewels of the JRPG genre this century, a must play for JRPG fans and worth a play for anyone who likes to dabble in the genre on occasion, and it plays great with a gamepad.

(Maybe a little bit in the last 10 minutes?)-Extremely small amount of variation in the skills to use in combat.-Extremely small number of items and equipments. (Each city only sells 1 weapon for each character which you basically buy first thing you enter the city). -Cities don't have hidden items.-Hate the two main characters.-All the dungeons are basically the same thing. Each of them use only 1 set of texture also.-I fell asleep during this game many times. Game is probably like 42 hours instead of 48 hours.-Game has no challenge.-Whole game was like a prologue. By the end I was too bored to even think about getting the second chapter game.-From this title, I expected to travel around world map in an airship. NOPE. You can only walk.Earth wall is so op.			"

												One of the most underrated JRPGs I've ever come across and it still holds up today considering this is a 2004 game.I remember back years ago when I played the PSP port of this game and loved it so much that I hoped the second game in the trilogy would get a translation but alas it was not meant to be until years later when news came that it'll be released nearer the end of 2014 or early 2015.TLoH: Trails in the Sky is a starter course type of game before the main dish is served which in this case is Second Chapter and I'd mostly recommend this to anyone who is curious about the game, a lover of story heavy JRPGs or to people who have previously played the game to refresh their memories of the events that occur in this game before SC hits us like a storm.

												Now I have interest in making a review which has been in the making for a long time.  I checked this game out a couple of months ago and become interested as this game looked like ones from the 90s merged into a new project for our generation, I believe they got the game down very well.  In my first hour I am met to very good graphics, cinematography, story, and system.  This game looks like one which will take sometime to complete and I'm thankful for that since short games SUCK.It reminds me of a Tales of Destiny 2 mixed with Final Fantasy Tactics.  It was awesome to see it on sale since I've been on the verge for so long if I knew it was this good I might have bought it earlier.  The dialogue is immense and I am talking to everyone because I know something very amazing will come of it in game later.  I'll be watching Nihon Falcom for a new release :)			"

												I've been longing for a decent JRPG for quite awhile. I'll pick up a game and usually I end up getting bored before I reach the final boss. I am delighed not only was I so addicted to this game I basically played constantly in my spare time, but I'm already working on my second play through. Right after finishing. Because I want to pick up on all the plot hints I missed and the side quests I appereantly missed. >.<It's fun, the combat system is simple and reasonably fun (I love turn based games). I'll admit that it's not one of those games who's battle systems made me want to grind, but I didn't mind sitting running around fighting all the monsters that I came across.I love how this game doesn't give most of the characters backstories. They hint at them and then continue on. I like how it was natural in the story for these people to team up. A lot of times it's kind of like ""Meet random talented person. Get involved helping random person. Solve their problem. They join you for rest of game."" Characters leave group when it's natural and join hen it's natural.Overall, a good game! Definetly worth a play if you want an actual story, a JRPG, or turn-based game.			"

												If you're a fan of JRPGs, pick this one up.  The characters are memorable, the battle system is fun, and there aren't enough good things to say about the dialogue. You can tell how much heart and soul was poured into the game's writing and translation, even the unique, cynical blurbs left behind if you check an emptied chest. The game even got some laughs out of me. I could recommend it simply based on wanting a good read.The game looks great for its art style, and the ability to swivel the camera around 360 degrees definitely kept me busy in all the varied environments. You can switch up your builds with a Materia-esque system that keeps battles from growing stale. Trails in the Sky is not going to break new ground in the story department, as so few JRPGs do, but it has charm in spades. Probably my favorite game on Steam, and I can't wait for the sequels.			"

You hear this very annoying beeping sound as each text character appers, you have no option to turn off without turning off all sound. However (and I'm not saying you do this as the creators probably don't endorse this), there are ways of macgyvering a fix. Just do a google search about the game and annoying sounds to find the right threads out there (requires some basic computer skills). It has made the game wonderful for me.			"

												Like a good story? Play this game.The story in this game is awesome. I don't even care that the characters fit with some of your typical RPG tropes - they're likeable, the dialogue feels natural, and the writing is funny.The ending is... well. I won't even describe it, except to say that it's awesome and leaves you wanting more. This -is- the first chapter in a series of three, but if you're going for full completion (I highly recommend a walkthrough - there are a ton of Guide Dang It moments,) you should still get 40+ hours worth of playtime out of it.Like good gameplay? I don't care - play this game for the story.Okay, okay, the gameplay isn't actually bad...The tactical combat is interesting, and the combination of easy knockback and non-immediate spellcasting makes for some interesting strategy. At the same time, it's not so detailed that it gets tedious - if you're equipped well enough and have the healing items to spare for after battle, you -can- just steamroll the encounters. It's not as good as say, FFT:A, but it's neat enough to be entertaining.			"

If you value a well crafted story, deep skill customization, a huge vibrant world with tons of content, interesting and quirky characters and a straight up old-school J-RPG style of play this game is absolutely for you, it is worth every penny of the admission price! So far I have put in about 6 hours or so, and I haven't even really scratched the surface of everything that The Legend of Heroes holds. If you love JRPGs DO NOT pass this one up, stop reading this crap and buy this game right now.			"

												TL;DR: This is a good game. 7.5/10 This game is love-hate. It can be fun, and the story is pretty good. They do use almost every JRPG cliche in the book (She was a X this whole time. X secretly feels this way about X. X has no idea that X is a blahblah'ing blah blah) BUT it is a good story. It is text-based. You're going to read. You're going to read alot. Sometimes it's irritating the amount of text you need to go through in order for the story to advance. When the characters are acting as if it's really urgent to go somewhere, or do something, what do they do? They stand and talk for five to ten minutes.I probably sound like I hate this game. I really don't. It's a good game with alot of things that could turn people off. If you have ADHD like I, it might be hard to keep focus. The classic turn-based system is awesome. It pays homage to classic RPG's and I only found it boring when it came to early-game grinding. In fact, for me the game got gradually easier on hard difficulty. At times the story really got me. Trails In The Sky is no ""To The Moon"" but it is a decent story that gives you a perfect reason to play the Second Chapter. Recommended for JRPG fans.... but watch out for words, there's a lot of them.White Gehenna and Stone Wall.... Use those ones			"

												Great little rpg gem, puts emphasis on story and characters, rather than on combat mechanics. More than likely a must play for rpg fans. The game is a great experience. It is a port from PSP but a good one. The combat feels like a classic jrpg, but uses a grid akin to a tactic rpg. It is rarely relevant in actual gameplay as i found out, but can be used for some deepet strategy elements.-Lost			"

Characters are charming and you get attached to them Combat is fun and you don't have to grind NPC's have a TON of things to say (ie after certain events, they will talk about it)The bad: Graphics are dated.

Falcom seems to be pushing the JRPG genre forward, and I foresee myself and countless others playing their games instead of Square Enix's AAA garbage that is the modern Final Fantasy series.10/10Can't wait to play Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter!

												A quest for japanese videogames is always an adventure, that’s for sure.Since they‘re masterpieces as often as not, you indefatigably search for vast and unexplored brilliants, whose beauty emotionally tears you apart from the inside, and... you fail every time. This is their main component, so to speak: they appear in front of you suddenly, when your soul aren’t ready for waterfall of feelings and when you are most vulnerable. But there are exceptions even among ideal pieces of work: they are just too perfect. «Sora no Kiseki» is most vivid example. You’ve dreamt about such kind of game, you didn’t know about its existence, but there it is — you watch first cutscene (made with nipponese dedication to details) with lil’ Estelle, and in the next breath you become a part of the big journey into the ocean of all sorts of human nature.And what I‘ve dreamt about before I encountered with «Trails in the Sky»? What principles lies in the foundation of those dreams? First of all, it is a ginormous strategy, which creators know how minimise your megalophobia by turn each five acts of odyssey to completely new experience. Relying on your skill of empathy, authors engage you in «to-the-moon» family story, detective investigation with peaceful lunch on the mesmerizing shore or restoration of Eastern-like spirit on good-old hot springs.Secondly, it has a unique graphic and art styles thanks to which you can see and feel battles, relationships, the theatrical production and, for example, diminutiveness of the one adorable inventor in all glory. Furthermore, «unique» is adjective for all aspects of videogames that made with great love and zeal: soundtrack and characters, design of monsters and towns, background of sidequests and even minor events. Your heart melt every time when Joshua is playing on harmonica. You become excited as often as new inimitable person joins in your party.And, you know, next thing isn’t third and not even tenth. «The Legend of Heroes» is way too big — too deep — for just citation of facts. It is only first chapter of trilogy and you already have immeasurable impressions and obligation to return in majestic Liberl to be drowned in another 50-hours atmospheric trial.What I got to say? It is a curse. When your childhood was marked by «Front Mission 3», jRPG have become ever present part of your life. This curse is above price, and you need to say thanks for it.			"

												NOTE: There will be spoilers for this. If you want the TL;DR, it's that you should get the game and play through it if you like JRPGs. It's the first game in a trilogy, so be aware that the story is not complete with this game.This is a JRPG about growing up and finding your own wings while living in your parent's shadow. It also has saving the region as a secondary characteristic, but there you go.The game was confusing to get used to for the first several hours, but it's pretty intuitive and well-designed once you have a grasp of what means what and how things work together.The battle system isn't revolutionary or anything, but some strategy is still necessary for a lot of fights. The magic system isn't a new concept to me, but the way it's presented is unique enough to be a neat idea. It's an interesting way of allowing every character to use magic, but it really differentiates who is a strong magic-user and who is probably better just sticking to basic attacks and skills.The story does its job and the characters are interesting enough. I can't think of anything off-hand that feels out of place, although there are a few segments that don't feel all that necessary. The pacing of characterization is in a good place, especially for the two protagonists.The character balance in-game felt a bit wonky, though. I have only played on Normal difficulty, so take this with a grain of salt, but I've noticed that magic-heavy people are incredibly strong in the end-game and more physical-based people are much less strong. This basically makes Estelle+Joshua+Kloe+Olivier the best endgame line-up by default, since Kloe and Olivier are the two mages of the group. I also felt that Tita felt pretty much worthless past the first couple of quests that you have her in. Her AoE blind was fantastic when I first used it, but her stats are below average and she blows up when she's sneezed at, so there's not much you can do with her.The second game hasn't come out on steam yet when I'm writing this review, so I can't really comment on the ending at this point. The plot twist, while being foreshadowed throughout the entire story, still came out of left field and shocked me. It makes sense on a surface level for it to be possible, but the fact that it ended on a huge cliffhanger makes it difficult to take it seriously until I see it come up again in the second game. The verdict's out on that one.All in all, this is a solid game that will give any JRPG fan a good time.Also, did I mention that this game has secrets out the♥♥♥♥♥ Because it does.			"

												As most have said, you like JRPG's ? buy this!  So they can bring more over! anyway onto the review!Im going to start of with saying that if you dont like reading this game is not for you, there is a crap ton of reading involved.  That being said though it is extremely good writing and well worth your time.Characters:  There are the 2 main characters Estelle and Joshua Bright,  they are highly entertaining and good interactions with each other and the world.  Estelle is a dive in head first type of girl but not to the point of annoyance and Joshua in calm, collective and analytical.  You have there mentor Schezzard (I think thats how you spell it) who is nick-named the Silver streak, highly regarded in the guild but has a drinking problem.  There is the confident romantic who thinks hes smooth but is just cheesy and a bunch of other characters that are all very well developed and likable.  Due to the perfect amount of character development these people are a delight to watch and interact with. I give them an 8/10 points are deducted because lack of originality (the same type of chars can be found all over the place many not as well done though)Story:  Ah the story is a masterpeice IMO, it is a little slow paced but thats how I like it, but its not because of it originality but because of how its told.  You can read the latest issue of the news to learn about current events, you can speak with NPC's to learn more about history and day to day problems in thier lives.  There are also conspiracies and political mumbo jumbo. After every major plot point the NPC dialogue changes Now I havent said anything about the actual story because I beleive you should experience for yourselfs.  9/10 I deducted a point for reasons I shall later explain.Gameplay:  Gameplay is.. ok, its fun but nothing new and is pretty easy for any vertran JRPG players.  I would recermend this to new people of the genre as a good starting point.  To start with you have an overworld which has a minimap, monsters and points of interest (chests and quest items mostly).  The minimap is pretty straightforward if shows shops, inns, entrance/exits and other good stuff.  Monsters can be engaged by touching them and you can find chests around the place, Pro-tip always check chests a second time.Combat is held after engaging a monster and transitioning to a battlefield, there are tiles in which you navagate to hit enemys and so on.  You have several type of moves you can use, a basic attack,  art which is essentially magic and S-craft.  All are usefull and essential to the game, for more info on these please read the wiki.  The combat overall is fun but nothing groundbreaking.  7/10 for gameplay because its not what makes me want to play the game but it doesnt dicourage me from playing.Overall I give this game a 8/10, it fun, has a very entertaining plot and the chests... the frigen chests make me smile :)Sorry for all spelling mistakes I have never been good at it and thankyou for reading my review (my first review :D)			"

												As someone who has grown up playing JRPGs my entire life (specifically the Lunar series on Sega CD and the Shining Force series on Sega Genesis, as well as several others, all of which rank in my top favorite games), I was excited to see the numerous JRPGs on Steam.  Then I stumbled across The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky.  After checking it out a bit, I decided to get it and see what it was like.  What I found amazed me.  I found a game that had just about everything that I could have asked for in a game of this genre.  I felt invested in the story from the start, something that many games try to accomplish, but fail.  I discovered a cast of eight like able and relatable main characters, along with a good many well-done supporting characters, expansive towns that were filled with NPCs that had unique and diverse dialogues, and a game that takes well over 50 hours to beat.  The soundtrack is amazing:  I did not hear a single track during the game that I did not like or that I did not think was appropriate for the circumstances.  The humor is well done, and dispersed widely enough that I did not feel that it was coming too quickly, but I was still left with a smile on my face for most of the game.  The graphics are a little dated, but since I prefer a compelling story over good graphics, I was able to overlook that, and despite the fact that they are dated, they still look really good.  The combat runs smoothly, without dragging on like it is liable to do in some games.  All in all, I would highly recommend this game to any fan of the JRPGS genre, and I know that I will definitely return to this game for many years.			"

												A heartwarming story with excellently written characters, a novel and innovative magic system, a slew of hidden missions, and a battle system which seems like the old Grandia games mixed with Final Fantasy Tactics makes this game something definitely worth giving a try.  As a bonus, there are two games after this one and saves can be ported from it to the next ones.  Even when you do enjoy the story to it's clever little ending, you can be assured the characters you'll come to love will be returning in the next installment!			"

The verdict's out on that one.All in all, this is a solid game that will give any JRPG fan a good time.Also, did I mention that this game has secrets out the♥♥♥♥♥ Because it does.			"

												I've heard this game called a masterpiece, but when I look at it compared to what I consider to be masterpieces of the fantasy RPG genre, I don't know if I would put it on that level. That being said, this is a very very good game. I will review this game in three parts: The battle system, the story, and the upgrade system.The battle system:In this game, battles seemed to take a backseat to the story. The battle system was not boring, and having a variety of characters with different fighting styles throughout the story kept it fresh, but it didn't really have any outstanding features. There was a sort of battle chain that determined the order of when characters or enemies would attack, which could be interrupted in certain cases by the player or enemies using special abilities. Not exceptional, but not boring by any means. The only times I found myself avoiding battles was when the experience received wasn't worth it.7/10The story:Though maybe a little cliche, the story was engaging and interesting. Set in a world on the tail end of recovering from a large war, you play as the daughter and adopted son of a ""bracer"" which is a sort of mercenary policeman. You travel across the whole country you live in as you train to be a full-fledged bracer yourself, meeting many characters and developing the story as you go. The plot is riddled with twists and turns, but thankfully no unecessary-feeling backtracking. The side quests don't add to the story, but they do add to your experience and make you feel like you're doing bracer work. I hate to say it, but I called the major plot twist at the beginning of the game, though it didng take away from the overall story.8/10The upgrade system:Upgrades took two forms in this game: orbments and equipment. I felt like this was the most lacking portion of the game, and it almost felt like it was added as an afterthought. The equipment system is actually boring. There is no upgrading equipment, you can only find new equipment in dungeons and chests, as well as buying weapons and armor. By the end of the game, I had way too much money and nothing to spend it on, becasue the equipment stopped getting better in what felt like far before the end of the game. Every character uses a different class of weapon, so you really have no reason to save multiples of each weapon and prioritize on which characters get the best weapons. On to orbments.I wished that this had been a better executed part of the game. At the beginning, it seemed like it was going to be very important, but I felt like it was only really important for one character at a time. Orbment is essentially the magic or spells of the game. You give characters abilities by equipping them with certain orbments. You can also use these orbments to bolster stats at the same time. The one character where orbments would feel important was whoever I was using as my designated healer. It was confusing to use, and never really explained well, though once you get deeper in the game, you can figure it out pretty well, and the game gives you resources of which magic you can get with certain combinations of orbments.5/10Overall, this is a good game, worth a play. The characters are lovable and the world is engaging. My average of these parts gives this game a 6.6/10, but I would definitely say I enjoyed the overall product enough to make it an even 7/10.			"

												A pretty fun, super chill RPG with an extreme attention to detail, an Elder Scrolls-esque level of world building, a lack of all the garbage that makes a lot of modern JRPG's so toxic to some people, and the worst cliffhanger ending since Mega Man Legends 2.Second Chapter when?			"

												I just finished the game, clocking in at 50 and a half hours. I laughed, I got emotional, and I had a good time. The atmosphere and world-building was fantastic, the characters were all enjoyable, and was a relatively relaxing game to play. The only bad thing is that I have to wait for the sequel to come out!

												This is great. Grabbed it in the sale fired it up just to check it works and everything else went on hold 108 hrs later Im on here searching for part 2. Yes it is a complete game but the story continues. Steam why do I have to search about for the second chapter? The only downside is some of the dialogs can be quite long which I did enjoy reading but at 11:30 with work starting early can really make you wish you saved before the dialog started.			"

												If you don't like reading, stop. Don't buy it. This game is really good, the story, characters and gameplay are pristine for a game of this type. But it is a real warning, if you only like RPGs cause the acting and dialogue spoken to you, this game is not for you. It would be interesting to compare the quantity of reading you'll have to do in this game with a real book.If you are interested in this game take into consideration that the story is split between this game and the second one. After I finish this game I couldn't wait for the translation of the 2nd part to be out. At the moment, I'm playing part 2 and it just gets better, it's looks the same but it seems more polished at least in combat mechanics.A definite buy if you like SNES era RPGs.			"

 A Journey I picked this game up when it was on sale and didn't bother playing it until I heard of the other series Trails of Cold Steel. I decided to take a crack at it and boy it starts slow. There is no fast travel and personally I didn't like the aesthetic. Yet the game did grew on me. I enjoyed the sprites and the music was well done. Coming to a small town and the melody soothes me. The NPCs were all well done too. Each one has a story and when you progress through a major plot point, they have something to talk about. They each have their own daily lives that progress. The cast of playable characters are amazing and some of their arcs are developed in the second game. The combat is interesting with the orbments to add arts to your characters. Finding out which orbments giving the strongest skills in a blind playthrough is a pleasant surprise! The game is without a doubt a long game with emphasis on the story and text. Even with its slow beginning, the game does pick up and I would recommend this game for people who enjoy an actual living story.			"

												I just completed about 6 or 7 missions in this game and I cannot express how much fun I've had in it. This has to be one of my favorite turn based fighting games in a long while (next to FF). The rich story is a great read and has a lot of content, and I'm sure I'm only 5% through the game after about 5 hours of playing. Yes, that's 5 hours and I'm still at the start, kind of. The running around and trying to avoid smaller mobs is probably the only pain point I have about the game and have ALT F4'd it a few times. I've died but the game allows you to retry from the start of the battle, not really helpful if you have low health/power. You can pay 20 in game currency for sleeping at the hotel so you don't have to run back to the farm (where you start off and can rest for free). If you liked the older FF games, then you'll love this one.			"

												Legend of heroes:Trails in the sky incorporates all the good elements of a jrpg while still standing ground as it's own unique and charming work, not getting swept away in the tidal wave of rpg cliches. Plot 8/10Set in a world where there's been a technological breakthrough involving equipping adventurer's with magic, while bringing with it political turmoil. The story follows character Estelle Bright, a cheerful yet feisty girl and her brother Joshua. It's not so much about the whole good vs evil trope that's been used countless times before, but more just about two curious kids that get into more than they bargained for, as they get dragged into political war while trying to figure out the mystery behind their father's disappearance. The story isnt anything overwhelming or special, but it doesn't need to be. It's a heart-warming coming-of-age story, that does what other games don't dare do, and it doesn't mind.It's the type of game that also needs your full attention at all times otherwise you will definitely get lost on multiple occasions and this can more often or not put many people off as dialogue is very heavy aswell. However, this is what makes Trails in the sky so charming, just seeing how the characters interact with one another and how real they almost seem.Gameplay 8/10The battle system is heavily tactical involving turn manipulation and orders which determine what turn is guaranteed for certain bonuses, and if you manage to knock an enemy out of that slot a member of the party slots into it. A system that incorporates heavily on a grid based tactical layout, with the classical rpg elements of using magical attacks by equipping party members with quartz bringing with it a whole new combination of attacks to be used. As well as extra powerful attacks that override turn order but use up cp in the process.Sound 9/10Coming from a company that is known for it's wonderful soundtracks, Falcom doesn't fail to please in this department. It also includes one of my personal favourite pieces of music from any game-Silver Will. Then again what isn't to be said, it's Falcom, creators of the critically acclaimed Y's series.Overall Enjoyment 9/10Trails in the sky's world is explored plentifully with a very rich and deep history to learn about and enjoy. The characters, though the usual archetypes, are layered with personalities of their own which make them lovable and relatable, as well as some of the conversations they carry out being some of the funniest stuff I've had the pleasure to read. And as far as Estelle goes,she does her job perfectly as a protagonist that people can actually like and with atleast 50+ hours of gameplay, which is just the story alone, what's not to enjoy? I for one commend the effort that Falcom most noticeably put into this game and thank XSeed for bringing it over to the West. The gaming world needs more games like this.			"

												i bought and played this game when its just released on PSP at 2011. A fantastic experience, i did not sleep for 3 days just to play this game. My reason? the fantastic story. It started of with seemingly cliche story, but oh my god.. the dialogue between the characters are just simply marvelous. Each characters have their own screentime and development, even the NPC.  I was biting my fingers in frustration when i found out the story is to be continued in second chapter. I have been waiting the sequel for 4 years now.When i found out there are the PC port of the game on STEAM (2014), i showed my support and purchased the digital copy. And the same thing happened [to my surprise], i did not sleep for 3 days again just to play through this game. And same thing happened at the end of the game, I am biting my fingers in frustration and anxiety , waiting for the sequel.the gameplay of the game itself was rather simple, battle is simple turn-based mechanics with ability yo intercept/cancel enemy movement [almost similar to Grandia series]. It is simple but proved to be challenging at times.there are tonnes of sidequest, which are rather tedious at a glance, like killing certain enemies, collecting certain items, etc. But the result is so rewarding, not because of the items, but because it affect THE PLOT itself! [well mostly the NPC], but the dialogue of the NPC in the sequel will change depending whether you completed certain sidequests, or your rank at the end of the game.This game is a simply must buy, for a 20 dollar purchase, it is a very worth purchase.Now i am awaiting the sequel and swore to purchase it on the day it is released [and perhaps take another 3 days of all-nighter]			"

												First review here so please be gentle senpai :-)ok so what did I like about this game? First it has a rock solid story which gets more and more interesting as you advance. Side quest are pretty interesting and you'll not feel like the town lackey for once, investigation, some monster slaying it all feels pretty natural and you can miss most of them if you try to steamroll through the main story. Characters design  while a tad stereotypical ( read classic shounen manga ) works really well and you'll quickly grow fond of them.What I don't like is the combat system, while it has some interesting sides ( scraft and quartz for example ) the fact that you cannot move and act in the same turn is a serious flaw in my opinion. Perhaps because I played too much FFT or Tactics Ogre back in the days. And the biggest flaw of this game is that the sequel is not out yet! So I'll just mess around and wait for the second chapter release before finishing this one or perhaps learn japanese...To conclude I think that the game is really worth the money for any rpg fan more into powerful story than into groundbreaking combat system.

												As of the time of this writing, Trails in the Sky is the only Legend of Heroes game I've played, and I am not yet all the way through with it (though I'm getting there).The best way to describe this game is that it is pretty much the living incarnation of the JRPG genre. Turn-based combat, charming young protagonists, cutesy enemies that can utterly murder you - it's got everything you expect from this kind of game. At first glance, the game feels like an older Final Fantasy game what with its wide-spanning world full of optional content and story-driven structure. Properly enjoying the game requires you to enjoy the characters as much as the gameplay, as there will be a lot of roleplay elements where combat take a back seat in favor of story development.If you can look past the now-dated graphics, there's something beneath the surface of this game. I could go on and on, but to keep it simple, there was a lot of love put into fleshing out the country of Liberl. They didn't just throw in an item system with Heal Potion 1, 2, and 3, instead you heal with food - by eating any kind of food, you learn to make it, creating incentives to sample everything you come across; there's no such thing as a 'low level' ingredient either, and if you find yourself with leftovers, you can bet a later recipe will eventually use it. Not only that, but as the story progresses, the dialogue of almost every NPC changes, even the unimportant ones, as they continue their daily lives - it's an inconsequential thing, but being surrounded by all these tiny stories that progress as you do helps make the world feel a little more believable. It might not seem like much for all these NPCs to have so many lines of needless dialogue, but at the same time you have to appreciate the effort that was put in to create the impression of a forwards-moving world.Then there are the side-quests. Due to the structure of the game, many of these are missable or even impossible to complete past a certain point. Sometimes this messes with the pace of the game since unless the duration says ""Short"", you really don't know when a quest is going to expire. They are not necessary to the game's completion and can be skipped without much concern, but at the same time skipping them sometimes causes you to miss little bits and pieces of the world. NPCs from completed quests will show up later, or characters central to the main storyline will make mention of the completion of certain side quests, affecting the story just a little bit. Not only that, but many side quests are flat out hidden - If you are a completionist, this can be infuriating, but at the same time, as an explorer, there's little more satisfying than entering an area early and discovering a secret.Will continue this review as I complete the game, but thus far ~37 some hours in, I can safely say that I'm loving what I'm seeing so far. This is a world I care about.			"

												It's as slow paced as any JRPG and has about as much pointless (yet humorous) dialogue. The story poses many questions along the way and the plot becomes increasily more in-depth until the point where I played the 2nd half of the game only taking a break to go to work and sleep. In the end most (but pretty much all the important) questions are answered and the ending leads straight into the plot of Second Chapter. But then you replay the game and suddenly all the pointless dialogue was actually foreshadowing the whole time. Also this game can really break your balls, even on Normal (the easiest difficulty). Great soundtrack too.Gameplay: 8/10Story: 9/10Characters: 9/10Music: 8/10Epilogue: 11/10			"

												Damn solid, although it ends on a bit of a sour note for me, personally.  Nothing too major, just a trope/cliche that I'm not particularly fond of, and one that I think is overdone/done poorly a lot.  Still, considering this is just part of a series, I'm not too bothered by it; if this game is any indication, the rest of the series will more than make up for it.Nothing that you haven't seen before (not surprising considering it's age) but I don't think it's much of an exageration to call this a masterpiece.  Everything seems to be gracefully woven together, with attention to detail where it matters.  The characters are likeable, if a bit generic in some instances, but they play together nicely.  The world building is fantastic, each NPC having several different bits of dialogue depending on where you are in the main story.  Lots of locales, lots of friends.  Even bits that would be jarring on their own are supported so well by the rest of the game that it makes sense.Plus, it does one of my absolute favorite things a video game can do, ever!  I don't understand why developers can't figure out that the climax is so much more interesting if it draws from all your actions leading up to that point.  It's honestly rare, and probably worth playing for that reason alone.(On that note, if anyone is interested in getting into game development, definitely give this one a study.  The execution is mostly flawless, even if not all of the pieces are perfect.)9.9 out of 10, lmao			"

												This game took me by surprise, and then kept me occupied for — according to Steam — over 90 hours of playtime. Geez.It is very, very heavy on dialogue and story in general. I used to think Suikoden V had a slow start, where it took maybe 6 hours for the story to really get going; Trails in the Sky FC easily doubled that time (for me, anyway). But oh man, was it worth it. Character customization for combat is fairly satisfying and gets more interesting as the game progresses, but the actual combat is somewhat slow-paced. This goes from being hard to get used to in the beginning (and adding to the slowness of the intro...), to feeling just right towards the middle and end — where playing strategically and planning your moves really starts to matter.Ultimately though, where this game shines the brightest is in its likable cast of characters and its world building and overall story-telling. If you're the sort that loves seeing literally every single NPC in the whole chapter update their dialogue after every. single. change in the story... this game is for you! If you enjoy delving into the social interactions of the townspeople and watching them progress as your main story does, you'll likely love this. The only downside to this is, of course, that you'll probably end up doing a LOT of running around and talking to people every time something significant happens. But technically this isn't at all necessary to actually progress the main story.If you're a completionist, you'll absolutely WANT to do the extra running around and exploring, though: the game is extremely sneaky about hiding items, dialogue and entire side quest chains. On the one hand this could be seen as annoying or frustrating; I certainly did miss a few quests and was bummed about that. But on the other hand, it is immensely rewarding to just accidentally stumble onto an interesting side story or mystery or monster extermination quest when you aren't expecting to.The game does an amazing job of familiarizing you with its setting — be it its lore and ancient history, or the current political, social and militaristic state of your country (Liberl) and its surrounding nations. The only thing that I've played that comes close to doing this as well as Trails in the Sky is, well, the Suikoden series. ...Speaking of which, a lot of the music in this game reminds me of Suikoden. And aside from maybe a couple somewhat repetitive town tracks, the soundtrack is really, really good. I just wish it was purchaseable DLC on Steam. TL;DR: Very, very long game. Lots of dialogue. Story is the focus, combat is secondary. Many hidden things. Great music. Very likable characters. Super duper highly recommend! ...Oh and it ends in such a way that you're going to really, badly want more of it. Thankfully the second chapter is on Steam already. :)			"

												LoH caught my eye initially as resembling FF Tactics mixed with some more traditional JRPG game play (FF7 limit breaks, for example). I was not entirely off in that assessment and playing through the entire game was well worth the gamble of just purchasing it without much scrutiny towards the rest of the game.The basic plot follows two youths on a journey to become successful mercenaries. The larger story is definitely not worth spoiling here, so I'll just share that there is definitely enough intrigue to fill 50+ hours of gameplay. In fact, just when you finish the game and think there is a happy and peaceful ending, things get flipped on their head, setting up the next game. LoH is also set in a world where there are 3 interconnected-yet-antagonistic nations, one of which (Liberl) is the setting for the entire game. I have to admit I was disappointed in not seeing more of the world, but honestly this just makes me want to play the sequel that much more. At no point did I feel the environment was too small or uninteresting.LoH is not especially difficult, but some grinding became necessary about halfway through the game. Your characters actually level pretty well with each new territory you are led to in the story. My only gripe would be that the combat always occurs in a flat terrain. There could have been some variety here, though for your routine low-level enemy fight, I could see terrain as getting in the way of an otherwise quick and easy grind.If you're a fan of ANY JRPG you should give this one a look.

												As the game starts, you find yourself with a typical RPG start of sorts, drawing you in slowly to what is some basic but enjoyable gameplay and some well written dialog and enjoyable atmosphere, and if the game continued with that kind of attitude it would be great.But it doesn't.It grabs you with story hooks that make you crave more, and world building that sets your characters in an expansive environment that you will beg to explore and enjoy.It sets up large and sweeping plots while continuing to get you to enjoy the here and now of the game with smaller mysteries and quests, none of which the game NPCs will let you forget as you travel around, each of them having unique dialog after large bits of story fall in to place and often smaller bits of dialog if a side-quest relates to them.With almost sixty hours sunk in to my first play through I cannot recommend this game enough to people who've been looking for a JRPG.Everything remains fresh through out the game as the story progresses and the world is built around you, and that is the games primary strength.The combat system is simplistic, but often satisfying and is complimented nicely by the ability system within the game, unlocking more as you progress with new and interesting spells becoming avaliable with the more you want to focus on a particular element, to which there is almost no enforcement but your own desire to shape a characters abilties or play style, with almost anyone being able to fill out the holy trinity of tank, damage or healer, or some mix inbetween!The game itself runs almost perfectly, with the exception of very occational crashes if you alt-tab during combat loading and the occational glitching out of the window when you first run the game.Translation is also done well, while honoring what i can imagine to the be the traditional japanese with some small in-jokes it by no means leaves you feeling an outside.Honorable mention for all the in-jokes within the game also, including the final weapon of 'Heavy-Blade' Agate being a Large black sword of unknown material called the berserker, an obvious reference to the strongest fantasy comic!Overall rating out of ten?9.5			"

												TL;DR: This game is fantastic and is definitely worth the money! 10/10This game is honestly one of my favorite, if not THE favorite, JRPGs out there. I honestly have only good things to say about this game.The story and the characters are definitely the best part of the game. It's a story about a girl named Estelle and her adopted brother Joshua. It tells of their journey, across the country of Liberl, as they train to be Bracers, defenders of justice and peace. On their adventures they get caught up in something so enormous that it puts the entire country of Liberl in danger. The story is very well paced and written. There are plenty of plot twists and surprises in store for you when you play the game. The writers definitely deserve an award for how well executed the story was.All the characters presented in the game were very well rounded and thought out. None of the characters felt particularly flat through the game. You also get a feel and story of all of your companions that accompany them along their quest. Even side characters are fleshed out. There are no flat characters in this game. The best part of the game is seeing how Estelle and Joshua mature over the course of the game. Again, the writers definitely outdid themselves.The game also had plenty of content to entertain you for what will feel like forever. The story, along with all the side quests and dungeons, took me nearly 45 hours to do. If you're looking for a long, thorough RPG experience, you've struck gold. None of the side quests felt particularly boring or repetitive and definitely fleshed out the game.The combat in this game was very enjoyable as well. The combat system takes place on a grid with player characters and enemies occupying squares on that grid. The combat is turned based, but is not static (i.e Character 1 attacks, Enemy 1 attacks, Character 1 attacks, etc.). The combat is based on speed of the entity and their action. If you're fighting a particularly fast enemy, they may be able to attack thrice before you are able to retaliate. Some turns also offer bonuses such as guaranteed criticals and healing. These bonuses also work in favor of your enemy so it helps to plan out your moves to make sure you get the bonuses and not your enemies. There are a few more mechanics but it would simply take to long to explain. With that being said, the combat system is not complicated. I just don't want to type 3 paragraphs about the combat. Simply put, the combat is simple, effective, and fun.The only thing I can see about the game is that may put people off is the graphics. The game was released in 2004 so it definitely has some age to it as far as video games go. I personally enjoyed the graphics as it gave the game a nice atmosphere to it. You're fine as long as you don't come into it thinking the graphics will be comparable to today's standards. In the end, this game was absolutely amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. The story and characters, compelling. The content, enormous. The combat, fun. I honestly couldn't ask for anything more. Can't wait for the sequel.10/10 (11/10 with rice)PS: The music in the game is also pretty darn good!			"

With interesting battle concepts (once you get through the start), This has been one of a few RPGs i've picked up and absolutely love.  With most of the Final Fantasies and every other RPG out there that i used to play, this has to be one of my favourite games.  The incredible depth to the story and how well laid out the game is what makes this game epic.I just hope more people buy this game so that the translators get what they deserve in translating this epic			"

												Don't let the hours fool you, I played this game day and night on the Japanese version before it was released in english. The reason that I bought this game on steam is solely for the purpose of writing a review and getting the word out hopefully and supporting the translators, and I'm usually pretty stingy when it comes to games. That alone can kind of give you an idea of how good this game is.If you are a fast paced gaming person and can't stand dialogue or jrpg, then this game isn't for you.If you are into stories that♥♥♥♥♥♥excellence for breakfast, or if you are an anime fan, or if you want a superior version of Final Fantasy tactics, Jeanne D'arc or Fire Emblem, or if you enjoy a in-depth combat system that literally smears♥♥♥♥♥♥across square enix's face, or if you would like a masterpiece that makes the Mona Lisa divert her eyes in shame, then this game is for you. Trails in the Sky is only the first installment of an epic tale, this game currently on steam is the first chapter of a 5 chapter (so far) trillogy, there is unconfirmed information that the second chapter may be released in english this december, I pray to Etro that all you jrpg fans can get a slice of this series out of sheer good will as a gamer bro.

												Hey guys, I just recently finished this game and if you are into JRPG's with a great story line this one is must play. It has a great memorable story the characters are well designed. Some things I really enjoyed about this was at no point did I have to grind out levels (assuming you don't run from fights) so you are always moving forward, there is a ton of depth to this game but it has a very good pace so you are always moving forward you don't or at least for myself  never felt like I was stuck having to spend hours on some small side quest that was boring and lose interest and that does happen in some games I believe I did all of the sides I only did one play though I found the side quests added to the story a lot of course I missed a lot too for items like there Ultimate's and probably some other chests.I am 30 and been playing RPG's since I was around 6 back on the NES then SNES so I have played many RPG's since I was a child. Anyhow it is a very well done game, I would defiantly recommend this to anybody who wants a large engaging game with a great memorable story. You are able to customize a bit but I wont go into detail you will have to play it for yourself and find out as for myself I would like a bit more options for that but in no way was it something that held the game back. Hopefully If I can ever come up with some extra coin I will try the second chapter of this game to continue the story and if it is anything like this game It will be a joy to play. Anyway if you are looking for a solid Single player RPG this one is definitely something to pick up and give a try of course everybody is different with individual expectations of what a RPG should encompass but as for myself this has made it onto my personal top 10 list I cannot wait to continue the journey in the second chapter.-Nik			"

												An absolutely incredible game. A hidden gem of retro RPGs. Easily worth $50.00, let alone $20.00. In my opinion, the trailors and the steam page don't do it justice; its a game you have to experience first-hand to truely understand its genius. This game has a large amount of detail and sidequests involving all the NPCs-- all of which I foolishly skipped on my first playthrough because I was that engrossed in the game's main storyline. Even if you do rush the main story, you're still looking at about 40 hours of gametime on a first run through the game. Then there is the New Game+ with harder difficulties to tackle, not to mention the undying impulse to go back and view the story a second time to try to catch-on to all those subtle plot points you missed or didn't understand the first time.As for criticisms, I will say that the game does start off rather slow in the Prologue. Be patient! Once you are finished with the first couple of missions and get the hang of things the real story will start to take off. It doesn't take that long at all but I do realize that the first hour of a game makes a strong impression on a lot of gamers so I don't want people to be discouraged! Its no where near the level of Kingdom Hearts 2's boring five-hour tutorial sequence.Buy the game and if you love it, tell your friends! This game is not well-known and quite frankly deserves more attention than it's getting. The localization of it's sequel has already been confirmed, while the third is still up in the air. Be sure to spread the word!			"

												In a period where RPGs in general are in a bit of a slump, I spotted this purely by accident; I wasn't sure whether It would prove worth my time; but it was on sale, and I hadn't played an RPG for a while, so I thought, 'what's to lose?'I regret nothing.An incredibly developed and immersive world. People that actually feel like people. A Battle system that's easy to use but also highly customisable. A strong Storyline That keeps you guessing. It's got all this and lots more. For something I picked up as a 'What If?' I have been repaid many times over. I strongly recommend this to anyone who likes RPGs, purely on it's own merits, but as an added incentive, the more buy it, the more likely the other entries in the series will also appear.			"

												This epic story is just a setup for a mind-blowing trilogy. And holy fock biscuits, I cried at the ending. I mean the story beats the late Final Fantasy games by leagues!!The world design is finely crafted, the cities and villages felt truly alive, the dialogues are well-written, even for the background NPCs, and the dialogues changes depending on situation and story progession!! The phrase ""It is about the journey, not the destination."" is this game in a nutshell!!Gameplay is fun, skills are customizable, making players needs some planning, and tactical decisions on character roles in combat.Though the main story is on the epic level, the numerous side quests in this game are equally fun and shed more light on this charming game world.Musics of this game are regarded as ones of the most beautiful pieces and collections to ever grace the gaming history.TL;DR 11/10. XSEED is awesome for translating this game. Support the awesome XSEED. Buy it NOW!!			"

Good to see it finally getting justified recognition on Steam.It doesn't start as slowly as other reviews have made out, and there's no more text to read than, say, Persona 4.You'll be rewarded with an all-time fave if you like:- great plot- well-written characters- suspense- strategic battles that give you time to think- cute graphicsWhat you WON'T get is- anime porn titillation- monster hunting- cinematics- ridiculous plot you never understandThis PC version is very easy to play, works beautifully with a mouse. There's 60 hours here on a normal play-through.  If you like JRPGs, or are curious about how great a good one can be, get it.			"

												An excellent JRPG. I'd never really heard of this game until it popped up on Steam but given how few JRPG's end up here I snapped up straight away and I'm really glad I did. The games story is a slow burn, starting small and spending a good long time building the world and developing the characters. The main protagonists are junior Braces, a sort of cop for hire, and the game tracks their progress towards becoming fully fledged members. You'll start small, bounty hunting monsters, recovering lost items and conducting investigations. Eventually though you'll be swept up in a major conspiracy that will have you playing a key part in the events of your nation. The game world is detailed and well realised with a real weight of history. The characters are charming and likeable and each gets plenty of screen time to develop so that you actually come to genuinely care about them. The combat sytem is solid, nothing revolutionary but enough meat so you wont get bored with it. Enemies are visible on the main screen so you can avoid them if you wish or sneak up behind for some bonuses in combat. The graphics are dated, but its a ten year old game, that said the game still looks good at high resolutions with bright colours and a nice anime style, I found they had really grown on me by the end of the game, despite the low polygon count. I really can't recommend this highly enough, if you like JRPG's you owe it to yourself to buy this game.Pros:+ Well detailed world with believable politics and history+ Very strong narrative+ Likeable characters+ Some humorous dialogue+ Slow burn, starts small, finishes big+ Good soundrack+/- There is a lot of reading in this. I personally love this type of character and world building but your milage may vary. For me this is an absolute plus but just a heads up. I say ""Yay, plot!"" you take might be ""Ewwww, reading?""Cons:- Graphics are a little dated, but hey its a 10 year old game. They grow on you.- You'll have to wait for the second chapter. This will be hard.			"

												This game is now officially one of my favorite JRPG!First of all gonna point out some bad things since u'll most likley gonna check those first if u're not sure about buying game or not:- some plot twists a tiny bitsy obvious if u pay attention- beautiful flow of combat tiny bitsy broken in the end with very hard boss, but before that everything is perfectly balanced- some issues regarding having hd resolution (for example smoke in one area will cover ""square"" in the middle of your screen, but not entire wide screen area)Now check out great parts:+ AMAZING story - trully fairytale for adults and kids alike!+ MAGNIFICENT characters! Each and every one of them is unique, interesting, has his/her back story, desires, ambitions and distinct speech pattern (there are no VA for dialogs and I was very surprised that around middle of the game I began to almost literally hear character voices in my head, hear how they could've say this or that thing; it's an amazing achievement on itself since most of characters in now-a-days games are very um... forgettable)+ Overall world created with love and attention to details! I mean you can actually see story arcs of all NPCs around you! Even what seems to be some meaningless guard can has a mind blowing stuff to tell!+ Combat is perfectly balanced! Unlike most of JRPGs (especially very popular old-school series) in here you see enemies on a map! Meaning you don't have to fight same bunch of monsters every 3 steps you make (I'm looking at you SMT...) meaning developers do care about your time which you can spend on something more interesting (like reading one of great in-game books, or read in-game newspaper or just talk to NPC guys in a town)+ Very bright and colorful anime style graphics! I'm sorry, but for me that's a major plus. Aren't we all tired of same old greay-brown pallete in almost... like every game?+ Music... oh holy Yuno and Revy... this music is amazing! This is one of very rare ocasion when I want to listen to music separatley and after this review first thing I'll do is to check whether it's somewhere in the game's directory...+ Overall game flow. It's just... perfect. Pacing is perfect, events structured logicly, everything is interesting. I'm gonna probably stop fan boying here about this game and will say one last thing.BUY THE GAME!!!!!! You will not regreat it!!!!!			"

												This is classic JRPG gaming at its finest, and the new touch-ups in translation and editing, improved PC performance and inclusion of the PSP extras that have been added since the original release now make this the definitive version of the game.The story follows Estelle and her adopted brother Joshua, as they train to be admitted as Bracers for the Liberl Kingdom. Bracers are akin to a private military or mercenaries, who accept any jobs ranging from mowing law to espionage. What starts as a light-hearted and easy going gig turns into a huge ordeal when Estelle and Joshua become embroiled in a series of events that threaten to change the shape of the peaceful kingdom of Liberl forever. Originally released in Japan on PC back in 2004 as ""Sora no Kiseki: FC,"" the series has become somewhat infamous for the absolute sheer size of its text, overshadowing those of even the most well known and story focused Japanese RPGs out there. The ""FC"" stood for First Chapter, which advertized itself a little less sneakily than the translated title. Make no mistake: Trails in the Sky has its own contained story that promises to provide you with at least 50 hours of classic RPG goodiness, but that story is by no means complete at the time the credits role. In fact some of the game's greatest twists and surprises appear right at the very end of the game and are like to leave you frothing at the mouth for a conclusion. Fortunately the sequel is already in the works and is currently being forecasted for a Winter 2014 release (barring delays). It would be a mistake to assume that Trails in the Sky significantly suffers from having an inconclusive narrative however. As said, the series prides itself in its monstrous amounts of text, and all of this goes into world and character building.  Unlike many Japanese Role Playing Games where characters are little more than palette swaps the cardboard roles (The Hero, The Sidekick, The Wild Card, the Womanizer, The Justice, etc.) Trails takes time building its characters with great care and detail, and the result is some suprisingly fresh new ideas and ways to use these classic character types. Which is humorous considering it is a ten year old game (ahem). In terms of gameplay Trails in the Sky is a very classic-styled RPG. You experience in the game from an overhead camera perspective and follow your characters' sprites as they talk, walk, explore and battle. Due to story reasons the game is fairly linear in its progression: There are five chapters (Prologue, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and Final) and in each of these individual chapters you have have access a new main town that serves as the hub from which you can access numerous dungeons and areas connected to them. Once you have completed a chapter and have moved to the next hub, the previous one becomes closed off, so be careful not to miss anything. For those who want the perfect playthrough, be sure to check out guides on quests and Bracer points, as several of these are hidden. Of particular note is a set of in-game novels called Carnelia Volumes, which often have ridiculously short windows to acquire. Keeping up with these volumes until the end of the game will allow you to trade the series for either Estelle's or Joshua's best weapon in the game, so its definitely worth keeping an eye out for these. The combat uses a classic turn-based battle system as its base. When a character's turn comes up you can choose to move, attack anything in range/move towards an enemy that is out of range, use magic, or use character specific skills. Magic, referred to in this game as Arts, need energy points (EP) to use. There are also Craft Points (CP) which are used for character-specific skills. CP fills up as your characters attack, take damage or have equipment that continuously raises its value, which maximizes at 200. At 100 CP a character can use their super move (Limit Break for you Final Fantasy fans) which will do significant damage to enemies. If you use this super move with 200 CP instead the attack even gets buffed.Unique to Trails' battle system are random benefits that appear in the turn order. These can range from Physical Attack Up, Art Attack Up, HP recovery, EP recovery, CP recovery and Guaranteed Critical. These are set at random points in the turn order and their benefits last only that turn space. Be careful though! Enemies can and often do benefit from these spaces as well, and the last thing you want is an enemy to get an attack in on a Guaranteed Critical space. Fortunately there are various techniques you can use in the game to manipulate turn order, such as waiting to reduce time until your next turn, using an attack that slows the enemy, etc. It is a system that can be a great boon to those who know how to use it and a great enemy to those who choose to ignore it, so do so at your peril, lest the monsters get all the good panels. Finally, for those who enjoy New Game+ features this game has it in spades. Levels, equipment, orbments (used to cast magic), and items all carry over in case you wanted to steamroll through the game a second time. The only significant thing that does not carry over is completed jobs and the Bracer points you received in your first playthrough. These will all have to be reacquired one by one. Beating the game also unlocks Hard and Nightmare difficulties which are not for the faint of heart. In addition the game also has a handful of things that will transfer over to Trails in the Sky SC once it has been released. Depending on how much Bracer points exist on your file when you start up SC you will get a bag of goodies that will be a nice reward for your efforts. Characters also remember which jobs you did (or didn't) for them as well. That's right: this game was Mass Effect before Mass Effect was a thing!~ Finally, a certain character's level (up to level 40) will transfer into the sequel. If you going into SC raw the game will start this character at level 35. All in all Trails in the Sky is a fantastic breath of fresh air in the sadly diminishing classic JRPG household. The game remains relatively a light-hearted and personal coming of age story for Estelle and Joshua for the most part, but those with discerning eyes and savvy genre senses will notice inklings of deeper depths hidden from the surface, and these all wonderfully set up for the sequel. If you are looking for a classic RPG with unique characters, an interesting (and at times surprising!) story, loads of sidequests to keep you busy, and a fair case of hysteria as you contemplate when the sequel will be released, you could certainly do much worse than Trails in the Sky.

												ok so currently i am only on chapter 2 but this is a really fun game. this is the first time i've ever played anything from this series. the music is pretty good. story i do enjoy. the move sets and art aka magic is pretty decent. so to give a short thing about it because i am sure there are better reviews out there then mine. its a tactic type game. its very easy to fail in a fight. if you never have played the game you wouldn't have a clue what the enemies do and when some of the status effects hit you it could spell game over. or if they kill the npcs with you it also spells game over. now one thing that is alright is you get to retry the battle and each time you do that the enemies get weaker. i'm not sure if this is a good thing imo. i think that is maybe the only function i don't like because it makes it too simple if you fail enough. i might be mistaken but it could be for the npcs too because it really doesn't take much to kill them. so maybe in that light i can understand.anyways this game is worth picking up and i still look forward to finishing it.edit 1. So after a long run i finally finished the game. there are a total of 4 chapters and it did not disappoint me at all. i won't lie i failed quite a few times since the last post. maybe 10+ times. there were some very challenging fights. the boss fights were freaking amazing. it kept me up on my toes. i know it sounds like i am huge fanboy, but there are just those games that really stand out. this to me is just one of the many titles out there in video game history that deserves more attention then it has. i know not everyone will agree with me and that is fine. I just really liked it. now i am looking at getting the 2nd one to continue the series.			"

												TL;DR skip to last paragraph.This is a linear game.  There is a story to be told, and it will guide you through with that end in mind.  For 90% of the game, I would say the story was . . . cute.  Nothing spectacular.  Nothing terribly unique, even.  Never, in my 30+ years of video gaming, have I seen an ending like that.  Not that you couldn't tell something was going on, but the big reveal was pretty epic.  It puts the whole game in a different light.  I instantly wanted to play through the whole game again, just to see it in context.  The mechanics are solid.  By the end, though, I was yearning for a bit more complexity.  The system was fine, but I wish there were more options in terms of equipment, orbments, and characters.  Equipment was mostly linear.  You buy what's in the shop, then pick up an upgrade in a dungeon.  You just rinse and repeat for each chapter.  No real choices.  The next piece of equipment is always better.  There is the option of finding the ultimate weapons, but that is little more than the final step in a relatively linear progression.The orbment system was actually pretty complex, but they could have done much more with it.  Once you get the hang of it, though, you can spend most of a play-through just playing with orbment combinations.  Sadly, it doesn't take long to master.As for characters, this game was pretty unique.  Many different games have you picking up team-mates as you progress through the story; but most let you keep that character from then on.  In this game, your comrades only join you for brief periods at a time.  It's a bit irritating, but it also makes them feel more like characters, rather than just extra bodies.  Each comrade has their own motivations.  They aren't going to leave everything they care about just to follow some strangers around the world.  It makes them feel more real.The combat was excellent for a turn-based game.  The choice to move around the field of battle turns out to be more than just a gimmick.  Rather it affords a new dimension to combat (for instance it lets you position your enemies).  Status effects are worthwhile but unessential.  They managed to strike a perfect balance.  Using them makes many fights much easier, but every fight (but one. Errrr  LAWRANCE!!!!) is possible without considering status effects at all.  Skills, S-breaks, and weapon effects make combat complex enough to stay interesting.  The turn bonuses are mostly gimmicky, but play a big roll in the BIG fights.Overall, 9/10 for first playthrough, 7/10 for subsequent playthroughs. The game is worth playing for the story alone, and the combat is sufficiently complex to stay interesting.  The game is simple enough, though, that it's only good for a couple runs and some nostalgia runs years later.			"

												Heisenberg aproves. This game is great, creative story that keeps you engaged the entire way.  Interesting characters, the story focuses around the 2 main characters Estelle and Joshua but they do enough to make the other characters interesting as well. I pretty much binged the entire game♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off all my friends who wanted to keep playing our Civ 5 game til 7 am. Played all the way to the end of the game not realizing it was part of a trilogy. Now I gotta say I am highly anticipating the second chapter. Apperently it comes out fall 2015. It better because I have no patience and can't wait to see how the story unfolds. I am fighting the urge to spoil the whole story and watching it on youtube but the game is so good I can't bring myself to ruin the second chapter. I highly recommend this game to any JRPG lovers and people who love a good light hearted story.			"

												So this game, this game is just beutifulIm mostly doing this review because of the steam award badges but still, i want to talk a little bit about this game. When I first got this game had no clue at all what was about, i just knew it was an RPG with rich story at least told by the steam tag and it was on sale, I also was bored from my other 160 games of my library, so that was an intant buy for me.The start of the game starts really slow but from a start the game puts you to have questions about the story, the world, the character mostly everything, after a little bit the game starts to explain the world which its really good explained and really interesting. The gameplay starts to get explained and you get even more hooked because it is really fun if you make the mechanics work to your benefit, you can beat overlevel bosses if you are in a lower level just by having good tactics. The most important part of the game is the story, if you buy this game and you are one looking for a story you have to take in mind that this game is the First charpeter of two, so you are probably going to buy the second charpter one way or another, at the end of the day the game is really big in hour play time making it worth it in many ways possible.That was my review, pretty much the first one ive made but I hope you can pick up the game and enjoy it, really worth my time and i hope yours too			"

												Great game.If you're a fan of JRPGs there's nothing really to blow your mind. It's just a solid game with a pretty good story with a lot of twists.Pros:+Runs great, I don't really recall any technical trouble, except maybe once or something in 50 hours.+good controls, you can play with just mouse for example which felt really natural.+Good combat. I like the grid movement and using line attacks or AoE.+Story. It may start a bit slow and feel pretty childish and tame, but don't let that fool you. It gets deeper and more mature towards the end.Cons:Graphics are pretty weak especially if you look at big screen. Still quite charming quality to them.Sound design is pretty weak. Some ok music, but you get quite tired of it.Please support this series. I really want to see all 3 games and more released in the west :D			"

												Alright, here goes. After two and a half hours, I really enjoy this game. It looks great, the combat is fun, the story is decent (if not exactly original), and i really love the characters. In many ways, it should be easy to recommend to everyone. In a perfect world, this would be a well-known classic.However... as I said, I'm two and a half hours in. About twenty minutes of this has been actual gameplay, and that includes walking around in a town and learning about the skill system. That's really not a whole lot of ""gameplay"". I have heard a lot of people defend it by saying the story matters and so on, but I don't really agree. Final Fantasy XIII got a lot of hate for being a corridor the first 30+ hours, yet the same people like Trails in the Sky even if it's yet another corridor? That doesn't make sense to me. Why hate one game and praise another for the exact same reason? And yes, I did enjoy FFXIII a lot. But I think it had a nice ratio of cutscenes vs gameplay. Some cutscenes, some gameplay, some cutscenes, some gameplay etc. Trails in the Sky has very long cutscenes, then some brief, extremely linear gameplay, then yet another looooong cutscene. Again, two and a half hours in, and have played around 20 minutes. If that.Also, I love games like ""999: 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors"" (though I always get the door, person, hour order wrong), and those games are 90% cutscenes. But they are *intended* to be cutscenes. I knew what I was getting myself into right away. Trails in the Sky is intended to be a JRPG with strategy-RPG elements (move around the battlefield etc), and the story isn't really anything new. So why this endless focus on cutscenes?But if you can get past that, I recommend this game. It looks great, the characters are awesome and the combat fun. And who knows? Maybe it opens up later. Fingers crossed. :)			"

												An amazing example of JRPG, Trails is dialogue-heavy and slow-building, with a very detailed world, polished story and good characters. It's a comfy, no-rush kind of game, though the plot picks up at the very end, in spectacular fashion. It's on-rails as opposed to open-world, and rewards exploring and talking to NPCs with endearing micro-plots. Looks well and pretty, plays smoothly with a classic JRPG battle system. This is the first game, and its Second Chapter is available on Steam.			"

												A classic RPG, now with quotation marks. 255/10.But seriously, yeah, if you don't mind an RPG that's a little slow-paced and aren't bothered by the fact that it's over ten year old, this is one of the best out there. Now that it's on Steam with its sequel coming out at some point before 2700, there's no excuse to overlook it. Music, per all Falcom games, is phenomenal, and the gameplay is easily recommended for fans of Golden Sun or Radiant Historia.This game is the highlight of my Winter 2013 and I'm excited to see a new group of people get a chance to experience it.

												I really had no idea what to expect when I picked Trails in the Sky up, but was rewarded with an wonderful adventure spanning everything from coming of age, monster hunting, bounty hunter (after a fashion), political shananigains, and ancient world ruining artifacts.Trails starts off rather slow and seemingly unsure of itself, but by the end of the prologue it has a firm grasp of what it intends to be and then it all takes off at an ever increasing pace.  Combat is not great, but it's not terrible with the turn based system, but this game really shines in the visuals and character depth. By the end, it is quite easy to relate to many of the characters in one way or another, and it does this without lessening the larger-than-life feel some of them have.All in all, a solid, enjoyable JRPG.

You do this while running super fast without fatigue, none of the party members breaking a sweat. Estelle will always pose for the camera when you finish a battle with her, and Joshua will always be the best princess.

												This is less a review and more a series of thoughts concerning the game.This game looks incredibly generic, from the title to the artstyle to the overarching story. But there's a reason generic elements are so ubiqutous: when someone that knows what they're doing uses them, they work really well. And Falcom knows what they're doing. The combat system is rather pedestrian, but if you're playing this game for the combat, well, like they say back home, you're doing it wrong.I've seen multiple places describe this game as being ""huge"", particularly concerning the story, but a better adjective would be ""rich"". You're not going to get an 100 hour epic with universal implications, you're not going to get miles upon miles of ingame territory filled to the brim with secrets, but you will get a vivid and powerful experience, most notably in the story, and especially with the writing. Believe the hype on that count, the writing in this game is an absolute masterclass.I've also seen a lot of places compare this to Tales of Symphonia, and while I see where they're coming from, the similarities are pretty superficial in my opinion. They're both fantastic games though.If you like JRPGs, you should buy this game. Not to ""support JRPGs on Steam"" or whatever, but because it's a freaking good JRPG. You shouldn't need to buy it to make a statement, you should buy it to enjoy it.I'm really glad I waited this long to play the game, because if I had played it back in July, hoo-boy. The wait for SC would have been a killer. It's a killer now, and I beat the game last night.Finally, thank you so much to XSEED for taking a chance on this game, it truly has been a pleasure to experience, and I'll be handing you my money for SC with a smile on my face.

												I'd seen this game on a few best RPG's lists, and I was very excited to try it out.  In the end, I think I mostly I finished it because I was interested in the characters' stories, not because the actual game was any fun.  But I have a whole list of complaints.  -You don't control who is in your party until literally the very final dungeon.  Before that, the story dictates whether you'll have 0, 1, or 2 party members in addition to the two main characters.  -All quests have an unclear timing system that progresses as you complete quests in the main storyline.  Sometimes you'll try to do something only to be blocked by the story, and then you'll forget to do it and you'll fail the quest.-Progressing through the story locks out previous regions each time you move on to a new one.  This FILLS the game with missable items, quests, and abilities.-There's no fast travel system, and the quests have you running all over the place.  Sometimes you'll visit areas multiple times because you don't control when quests become available.-Aside from Estelle and Joshua, the two main characters, almost everyone else is a pooly developed stereotype.  There's the strong but silent fighter, the gregarious foriegner, the little kid, the pretty boy, the femme fatale, the sexy one.  -The combat takes place on a grid like a tactics game, but there's never any variation between the battlefields, aside from cosmetic.  You can't move and attack on the same turn, so positioning is almost entirely useless.  Most battles come down to either casting your Area spells on a horde of little enemies, or everyone focusing on the big boss.  The only fight in the game that required any thought was the very last one.  It takes 30 hours to provide compelling gameplay, and even then it's simply ""Move out of the indicated area"" and ""Defend against this attack"".-It never really affects the game, because combat is turn based, but there is pervasive slowdown through the entire game, whenever there's more than one or two enemies or NPC's on the screen at a time.  It happens most often in the overworld, but considering this game came out in 2004, my desktop PC should be able to run it just fine in 2017.All that being said, I can't recommend it at full price.  Wait till it goes on sale, and prepare to be disappointed.			"

												I wish I'd liked Trails in the Sky more than I did. It sat in my backlog far longer than it should have, and perhaps my expectations got unfairly bloated with hype, but for whatever reason I can't fully recommend this title. I stress that it is in no way a bad game, but when it comes to JRPGs and the investments they require, there are better contenders out there more worthy of your time and money - two things many of us do not have in abundance.Curiously, Trails is made up of a lot of great parts, though they all seem to have caveats. The characters are fun, if clichéd, the writing is lively, but there is far too much of it, the combat has some really neat ideas, but ultimately feels slow and repetetive before the end. One thing I can unconditionally sing the praises of is the fantastic music, which I never tired of. I loved seeing convetional JRPG storylines, that often feel a little melodramatic, bucked for Trails' episodic, 'villain of the week' stories full of grounded drama and reasonable threat. I also really dug how the game naturally curbs its difficulty after a crushing defeat. If it wasn't for this smart offset I probably wouldn't have finished Trails as by the time I reached the final (difficult) dungeon I was spent, and not looking to give the game too much more of my time. That would have been a shame, as the eleventh hour twists and final cliffhanger were impactful and well written, and made the forty hours it took to get there almost worth it. For all the tropes it shook and the JRPG mechanics it defies, Trails suffers from poor pacing more than anything. A game needs to respect a players time, especially in an age where our Steam libraries are no doubt bursting with hauls from Humble Bundles and Summer Sales. Our cup runneth over, and this leads to Trails in the Sky's biggest downfall. It doesn't respect a players time, it unneccesarily pads out what could have been a tight, engaging twenty hour experience into a much longer slog full of less-than-stellar content. I enjoyed a lot of Trails in the Sky, but ultimately there are better things out there to spend 45 hours on - and I wish I had.			"

So far the harder difficulty was a bit cinchy, I was hoping they'd mix up the elements a bit more, but overall things hit harder, have more hp, etc etc. Can't wait for second season!			"

												The battle system is satisfying. Fighting takes place on a big grid (so positioning actually matters) using ""Arts & Crafts"". The Orbment system is a little abstract at first but eventually you get used to it. Quartz are basically like FFVII Materia except nothing like Materia. Look at the in-game journal to find out which Quartz gives you the Arts (magic) you want. Even though the game can occasionally feel like a real slog in some of the larger late-game encounters, it never becomes too much of a problem and the majority of battles are pretty well balanced. Even as I'm writing this up I'm getting the urge to start up the game again - I just really enjoyed the battles that much.The writing is pretty good. The characters are well realized. Sometimes characters can be grating but its okay because they are teenagers and that fits. Even so the dialogue works well enough to keep character interaction entertaining and interesting. The humor is hit and miss for me. Some of the gags and jokes are just too corny and/or sweet. However the empty chest messages are fun - so much so I felt compelled to find every chest I could just to see the messages. At times the game can feel like words words words but not so much to make me drop it.The story doesn't do anything groundbreaking but serves its purpose well enough. Its an adventure that actually feels like an adventure. The game follows two teenage step-siblings Esteban and Joe of the small town Rolento in the Kingdom of Liberal after fate sends them on an adventure across the land searching for their missing father and sleuthing for the privately owned, government contracted police force. They travel the Kingdom visiting wonderfully detailed city-hubs: Bose™, Juan, Zoo, and finally ending up at the capitol of Granpa. Along the way Esteban and Joe team up with all sorts of fun characters such as Charizard, A gate, Tifa, Chloe, Zane, Oliver and many many more.The soundtrack is alright. A lot of the tracks are super catchy. One song in particular is still stuck in my head.The game is a time vampire. Honestly if you are on this page and considering purchasing a jrpg, you already knew this. It isn't even that long reletave to other games in the genre. Still though ~50 hours is a good chunk of time. Fair warning.The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is pretty alright.			"

												So let me start to say that this game is solid. It's got good, balanced gameplay, and some neat balancing tricks that make sure you can always live up to a challenge if you take time to prepare. But that is not what makes this great.This game is great because of the story that fits together so nicely, and the characters that go deeper than your screen. You'll find yourself either loving or hating them, but none of them, will leave you cold... Except maybe that one dude that *spoiler spoiler spoiler*What are you doing here in the review section?

												I think this may very well be the best JRPG I've played since FF9. This is somewhat telling in and of itself. I like how it doesn't have so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BS like we've seen in so many recent games (HELLO LIGHTNING, GO EAT A FIRE PLEASE), focusing instead on things like storyline, character development/evolution, believable (albeit long) dialogues, a wonderfully epic soundtrack, graphical details instead of graphical candies and less-cliché bad guys. You know, those things that made RPGs great. The best part? I'm barely into Chapter 1. Can't wait for the rest (and the upcomming 2 games that further this one).			"

												The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is about a girl and her adopted brother going on a quest to become senior Bracers (not government affiliated). Their father left on a mission on behalf of the Bracer Guild so the siblings decide to train to become senior Bracers during his absence. During their quest they run into plenty of funny and serious situations and meet many allies while learning about a deeper plot going on within the kingdom.The gameplay is pretty straightforward. You can talk to citizens to learn about what's going on. You can receive quests from the quest boards inside the guild buildings. After completing the main quest for that city you move on to the next city.Battles are turn-based and have both physical and ""magical"" based attacks. You get spells based off of which crystals you put into each character's orbament and how they are placed. Other than that it's just a matter of gear and strategy.Overall this game is an enjoyable experience. I have played quite a few rpgs, and even a few jrpgs (Tales of Xillia for example), and I would say this is one of the better games I've played. This game is only the first in a three part series, so there's plenty of excitement to come.			"

												This game is really hard to judge. First said, I normally dont like  to play games on computer, when I could play them on a gameboy too. The only drawn scenes, which i hoped there would be more from them, where the intro and the ending sequences.The story itself is fantastic, the whole heroe, i mean bracer thing is a cool idea. Even so, i didn't liked the ending, its a bit clichee how the involved person acts. (And I hoped, the male would be the maincharacter, though ;) )Sound is interesting, especially the music josh plays.Fightsystem is okay, but there could be a brother range in difficulties.Last critisicm: It would be great to have some influence of the story (I hoped to bring josh to love kloe, but he still loves his sister)			"

												 I was originally looking for something along FFT: WOL but this is the best tactical RPG I've played on steam thus far, the combat started pretty bland but it changes it up with character changes every so often. The story is great and very engaging, and so far seems to pack alot of content and a seemingly awesome magic/skill aquirement system involving allocating certain gems to characters defining what they do.Story- 8/10Combat- 5/10Bias- 10/10Unless you wanna sink time into a JRPG with lovable characters and some mediocre combat dont waste your time, otherwise it does great and in what I wanted it to be and wouldn't mind spending 100+ Hrs on this game.

Not to mention the battle system is simple and easy to get into and understand yet it does offer a level of deeps to it to allow you to customize your  characters to fit certain rolls you'd like them to fill.

												TL;DR - if you love JRPGs like Pokemon or LoZ: Link Between Worlds, this game would do nice in your Steam library. This game is easily in my top 5 JRPG I've ever played. Its a cute (yet somehow kinda mature) adventure that'll get you emotionally attached to the characters and make you wish it would never end. The game lasts about 30+ hours without sidequests or getting lost (probably won't happen as there is a nice map), but if you play the game like a normal person (doing most of the sidequests), it'll take you between 40-50+ hours. Replay value is definitly there. You have the option to import your last character's stats, weapons, armor, and general items. At the end of the game, you'll be thinking ""the heck did I just witness?"" so replaying the game will give you a stronger understanding of the game. P.S. play the game with a controller!			"

It is huge, with resonable length, and amazing story. The battle system is interesting, yet not too addictive to make you asking for more. What makes this game epic is the story, the ever changing environment (NPCs change their dialogue many times as the story progresses), the plot twist, the lovely characters, humorous conversations and touching moments.This is a MUST-PLAY game if you like JRPG.

												Trails in the Sky is quite an investment of time (as expected from an average RPG), and it fails to disappoint. The game has surprisingly jivey beats and boppity boops that you will never get tired of. The battle system is very similar to that of Grandia which an extremely good battle system for a JRPG and in my opinion is very underused. Like Grandia, the game doesn't feature a random battle system, but if you arent quick to avoid an enemy, then you may find yourself in combat at a disadvantage. The CP meter makes for a very diverse battle system all while keeping it simple and enjoyable. The Slot and Quartz system also makes for a huge variety in character customization to fit your playstyle perfectly. MOST characters in this game are very unique, and play their roles superbly whether it is comic relief, or intense.Even though this game is great, it does have it's drawbacks. The two main characters at times can be cliche and bland (as the game progresses they do manage to grow on you, so it's not awful). The game also doesn't have too much in terms of replayability, so if you get it I suggest doing all the sidequests and getting the most of the game on the first run through.			"

												Trails in the Sky is the best JRPG since Chrono Trigger and the most fun I've had with a game in years.What I appreciate most in RPGs is an accomplished combat system. This one is refined, not overly complicated and turn-based, allowing for entertaining and enjoyable battles.

												One of the best JRPG out there available on steam in my opinion. The combat is good with different powers and fighting styles with each character. The story in this game (so far for me, I'm near the end of chapter 2) is well paced and really indepth with new characters, towns and enviroments being introduced in each new chapter.The enemies are well balanced with nothing being to over or underpowered (depending on what you levels are) and all the enemies have strengths and weaknesses which will allow you to use different powers and arts to your advantage.The soundtrack and the sounds of the game are rich in depth with each monster and enviroment having there own set of sounds.There are also two other parts to this game: First Chapter, Second Chapter, and the last Third Chapter. the second chapter is on steam but not the third chapter...not yet anyway.In conclusion just buy it if you want a ""modern"" classic JRPG experience.

												Fantastic game. It may not be for everyone what with the long dialogue and dated graphics. The story is intriguing and ends on a huge cliffhanger.Tons of side quests (which are a tad generic). Lots of character interactions - like many have said before, it very much feels like the world is actually alive. NPC's dialogue changes after story events.It's very much a traditional JRPG and it doesn't stray too far from that paradigm, but it's clear that a lot of love and care went into this game.			"

												(I've done my best to minimize spoilers - hopefully missing nothing much, I know some of you out there get all emotional about this kind of things :P)tl;dr - Stop reading and PLAY IT!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I am, once again, reminded of the fact that I should never judge a book by its cover. Or in a  game-oriented way, that Graphics should never be used to judge a game.See, here's the skinny. At the start of the game (the intro in-game cutscene where you meet the main characters) I thought that the graphics was somewhat kiddish. The character models look like they were made of clay (Hint hint, Celebrity Deathmatch?), and when models state had to change (ie from standing to sitting down on a chair), it was done with a quick fade in and out.That was where I got snarky. I thought of how low-tech this game was. Was this game gonna be worth the effort? (In my defence, I was not aware that this was a PSP port of a game at the time.)Anyway, I perservered on and kept playing. T'was the best decision I would make. It had a large cast of main characters whoses personalities were very well done, an awesome orchestral soundtrack (SILVER WILL!), great humor (which gets better later on), and above all a riveting story to tie it all together.There are only 3 parts where I will point out as detrimental to a player.Firstly, if you are a completionist/achievement hunter, this game WILL make you work for them. Personally I have restarted 3 times just to ensure that I would have every achievement in the end. Get a comprehensive guide. (I had 5 browser tabs open just to make sure I collected them all)Secondly, there are hidden ""points"" (used as a form of scoring) in the game that you are bound to miss out on, even with a guide. Even so, there also exist other ""collectables"" (of which there are at least 6 kinds) which are a pain in the butt-ski to find, and missing them will make you hope to The Powers That Be that you made a save beforehand (hence the restarts I've had to do). Think of the previous game that forced you to save with every move you make - this game will Rival that.Lastly and the most painful of all...(""Drums Please!"")...that this is just one-third of the complete story. That's right, the story ain't over sucka! Once you get sucked into the lore, have fun trying to claw your way out of it. Oh, and just so you know, the third chapter only comes out in 2017, so HAVE FUN SUFFERING WHILE WAITING! (*Sob, I'm one of them)			"

												I remember playing this on the PSP a few years back, I loved it then and I still love it now. This game is ridiculously detailed, and the story is just full of twists and turns that will make you keep coming back. This, in my opinion, is the best version of the game after playing it on PSP.Story+ Detailed and gripping story that's almost like reading a book ( if you don't like reading this isn't for you )+ Memorable characters+ Tons of side quests that also tend to be full of dialogue and have an impact on the story ever so slightly to where it feels like you've made a difference.+ NPCs constantly move around as the story progresses and aren't simply glued into a single position like some games. Even what they say constantly changes to continue where they left off !+ / - Some of the scenes contain silly one-liners; if you can't tolerate this steer clear.Music+ The soundtrack is just catchy, beautiful, badass, and emotional ..! I have nothing more to add.Art+ Art is well done for it's time and is certainly an improvement over the PSP version.+ Character portraits aid the texts in depicting emotion, they're wonderfully detailed; you can feel the emotion flowing from each one !GameplayPlayability+ The game can be played with just a mouse or keyboard, and even both ! You can even hook up a gamepad and play, the direct input system makes it x100 easier to setup !+ Menus are extremely easy to navigate both in and out of combat !Map and Combat+ Gameplay is designed well, allowing you to sneak up on enemies for preemptive strikes, but be careful as they can sneak up on you !+ Has a similar system to materia ( if you're familiar with FF7 :P ), called ""Quartz."" Quartz allows you to apply temporary bonuses to your characters only while they're equipped, but wait there's more ! Depending on the element value of said quartz, you'll also unlock more Arts ( magic ) to use in combat !!+ Battles are a mix of tactical strategy and turn-based combat. The battles grow in difficulty as the game progresses and forces you to make tactical decisions by switching your equipped quartz to aid you in coming battles.+ As you fight enemies the EXP will either increase or decrease based on your level + the enemy's level, allowing you to easily catch up, or be prevented from going FAR over level. ( lowest possible EXP is 1 per enemy )Economy+ Mira is the general currency of the kingdom, but it's not so easily obtained. Mira can be acquired mainly through completing requests or selling items. However, there's a secondary currency with a more major role, Sepith. Sepith can be used to create Quartz, but can also be converted into Mira !+ Monsters don't drop Mira ( why does a monster need money ? ), but they drop Sepith because they're attracted to it.Miscellaneous+ Tons of treasure chests to collect++ Treasure chests will troll you if you attempt to loot them after being looted+ Eating food allows you to learn recipes.. collect them all to heal your friends or try the recipe in your own kitchen !+ There's a newspaper, Liberl News, that updates you on the events in the world. There's also a novel, and a book that teaches you Cat language. Hours of reading !+ Rare fluffly shining enemies ( shining poms ), can you find and kill all 5 for each chapter ?			"

												Normally I don't go out of my way to recommend games no matter how great they are (this is the first one I've done), but I'm making an exception here.  I play a lot of RPGs, but of late I seem to have trouble finishing them.  Sometimes this is by design (Elder Scrolls).  Sometimes the earlier entries in a series have clunky mechanics or run poorly (Mass Effect 1), maybe the setting is kind of generic (Dragon Age) or too ""mature"" (The Witcher).  Not to say these are bad games, in fact some of them are pretty awesome regardless/have awesome parts/lead to awesome future installments!More relevantly, as this is a JRPG, I'd recently tried replaying FFVI, which I'd nostalgically remembered as one of the all-time greats, and...couldn't get into it, at all.  Mechanics, story, setting, characters, didn't really catch my interest or seemed nonsensical.  Couldn't muster the enthusiasm to even start my planned replay of FFVIII after that.  I thought, ""well, maybe my tastes have changed over the years and JRPGs just aren't my thing anymore"".But then, I found this (cannot for the life of me remember how, but thankful I did).  I blazed through nonstop start to finish and am eagerly anticipating the next installment.  Okay, I've been blathering on for multiple paragraphs about other games, forget making an elegant transition, let's start listing some things I liked in no particular order:+ Setting:  a constitutional monarchy in the midst of its industrial revolution sandwiched between an empire and a republic.  Sort of steampunk-ish?  I always like that kind of thing, when done right.  The definition of ""done right"" is, I suppose, a matter of personal taste.  Dishonored = yes, Final Fantasy = excuse to have tech levels all over the place.+ Worldbuilding and attention to detail!  You will not find generic Townsperson, Old Woman, Soldier, etc. NPCs.  They all have a name, something to say, places to go, family and friends, and it all changes throughout the game.  There is a newspaper (two of the reporters are recurring characters) and serial novel.  On another level, at one point in the final chapter, the option of fleeing and seeking political asylum in a foreign embassy is briefly discussed where I think most stories would just skip straight to having a final showdown.+ The small scale and general lightheartedness of the story.  Although the stakes do get high near the end, for much of it Estelle and Joshua are just travelling through the land as trainee bracers.  Personally I get tired of being the Ultimate Hero, the Chosen One of Destiny, Saving the Entire World occasionally.  At the same time, other, more senior bracers ARE off doing Big Important Things.  Tying in with the above, it makes the setting feel more believable to me.+ Great music!  Which I've heard is standard for Famicom, but I wouldn't know.+ Great localization!  I have a newfound appreciation for the work that goes into these recently after observing the development of and playing through the newest fan patch for Fire Emblem 6...and that is nowhere close to the amount of translation needed here.+ Combat:  this is no Fire Emblem, but battles do take place in turns, on a grid, with a variety of AOE and line attacks.  Random bonuses are available at certain phases of the combat.  Needing to consider positioning and turn order (perhaps using an S-craft to steal an enemy's guaranteed critical, for example) helps it feel more strategic than, say, cast Ultima for 9999 damage, repeat until dead.  Something else I appreciate:  Enemies are visible on the map, so if you don't feel like having a random encounter GOOD NEWS!+ Characters:  the main character (Estelle) is a girl!  the main character's badass dad and mentor (Cassius) is not automatically dead or retired by virtue of being in those roles!  Joshua attempts to be a Dark, Angsty, Brooding Hero with a Mysterious Past, but Estelle shuts him down until it is relevant! *cough* Squall *cough*  + Not sure how to categorize this:  the six temporary characters join the party when they have a story role and leave when they don't.  They have agendas of their own, you know.  It bugs me at times in other games when the number of people travelling with me is far in excess of my arbitrary maximum headcount, or conversely someone is still there when their stated reason no longer exists.+ OMGWTFBBQ the ending			"

												Yes! This truly is one of the best RPG games ever made. Seriously.Often overlooked, but extremely fun and well made, this game offers you so much stroy-driven fun to assure even the most seasoned RPG that this will not be a boring, trivial experience. The combat system is fun, and the artwork is great; but the truly most amazing thing about this game is how it sucks you into its story like a good book. At several moments in this game, I would call it a ""page turner"" if it was indeed a book.That said, this is not a game that focuses only on gameplay, or forces you to be amazing at combat. This is simply a really fun game that anyone can enjoy, and to me fills a very important gap between passive, and active entertainment not often seen in the video game industry. This is the kind of game you can sit down and play when you are exhausted from a long day's work, this is a video game you can play when you've had a few before going to sleep, this is a game you can play anytime you need a middle thing between TV/Book and a game, but can't seem to find another you haven't played. This is in fact a really great game that anyone who can enjoy the ""Yakuza"" series or ""Heavy Rain"" or all these most excellent casual games can easily enjoy. It is not frustrating like Final Fantasy, it is not competitive like Diablo, it is not merely point and click like Syberia; but to anyone who read my review and thinks that this game might be up their alley, trust me, it is EASILY one of the best at filling this real sweet spot in the video gaming industry.

												I'm on Chapter 2 so far, but so far this game is exactly what I wanted it to be. Its a solid JRPG with an interesting story, memorable characters, and fairly customizable ability system. The combat is turned based, which is what I was looking for, and there is enough variety in the abilities and the enemies that I haven't grown bored with it yet. So far I haven't really had to grind, but I don't avoid many enemies and do all of the side quests so that may just be me. The game feels very open to me moving forward at my own pace, I don't feel rushed nor do I feel punished if I try to push ahead too soon. When it comes to the graphics, they wont exactly blow your mind but they are fun and have some personality to them. They have a very nostalgic feel and really take me back to some of my favorite games from the PS2 era.  All in all, while I wouldn't exactly call it groundbreaking, I would say this is a very solid JRPG and fans of the genre should probably give it a try.			"

The story is great and very engaging, and so far seems to pack alot of content and a seemingly awesome magic/skill aquirement system involving allocating certain gems to characters defining what they do.Story- 8/10Combat- 5/10Bias- 10/10Unless you wanna sink time into a JRPG with lovable characters and some mediocre combat dont waste your time, otherwise it does great and in what I wanted it to be and wouldn't mind spending 100+ Hrs on this game.

												The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is about a girl and her adopted brother going on a quest to become senior Bracers (not government affiliated). Their father left on a mission on behalf of the Bracer Guild so the siblings decide to train to become senior Bracers during his absence. During their quest they run into plenty of funny and serious situations and meet many allies while learning about a deeper plot going on within the kingdom.The gameplay is pretty straightforward. You can talk to citizens to learn about what's going on. You can receive quests from the quest boards inside the guild buildings. After completing the main quest for that city you move on to the next city.Battles are turn-based and have both physical and ""magical"" based attacks. You get spells based off of which crystals you put into each character's orbament and how they are placed. Other than that it's just a matter of gear and strategy.Overall this game is an enjoyable experience. I have played quite a few rpgs, and even a few jrpgs (Tales of Xillia for example), and I would say this is one of the better games I've played. This game is only the first in a three part series, so there's plenty of excitement to come.			"

The only drawn scenes, which i hoped there would be more from them, where the intro and the ending sequences.The story itself is fantastic, the whole heroe, i mean bracer thing is a cool idea. Even so, i didn't liked the ending, its a bit clichee how the involved person acts. (And I hoped, the male would be the maincharacter, though ;) )Sound is interesting, especially the music josh plays.Fightsystem is okay, but there could be a brother range in difficulties.Last critisicm: It would be great to have some influence of the story (I hoped to bring josh to love kloe, but he still loves his sister)			"

												There are two reasons im writing this. 1: The game is very enjoyable, I enjoy the story and all aspects of the gameplay. 2: I recently read that the second game will be released in NA at the end of the year on steam and depending on how well the sequel sells will determine if the company will release the third installment of the game in the US.The purpose of me writing this is simpley to say I enjoy the game thoroughly and that all of us who enjoy this game should spread the word.Thanks for your time.

												I absolutely loved this game!  It was fun, the story made me smile and cry.  You'll fall in love with the characters and the gameplay itself is great.You can play through multiple times and still find yourself having fun. If you love JRPG's, then give this game a shot. It is well worth it.Can't wait for the next installment of this series!			"

												The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a good RPG. It's not special, it doesn't bring anything new or interesting to the table. If you enjoy RPGs in general, or if you haven't played any/very many of them, then this is the game for you.However, if you're like me and you want something special, you want to take away more than the feeling of playing a decent RPG, I recommend moving on.

												 I was originally looking for something along FFT: WOL but this is the best tactical RPG I've played on steam thus far, the combat started pretty bland but it changes it up with character changes every so often. The story is great and very engaging, and so far seems to pack alot of content and a seemingly awesome magic/skill aquirement system involving allocating certain gems to characters defining what they do.Story- 8/10Combat- 5/10Bias- 10/10Unless you wanna sink time into a JRPG with lovable characters and some mediocre combat dont waste your time, otherwise it does great and in what I wanted it to be and wouldn't mind spending 100+ Hrs on this game.

												This game is amazing. It is everything you want out of a JRPG. It has good character development, fun graphics, tons of unique side quests, comedy, a dastardly villain, customizable equipment, and more. Not only were the battle mechanics fun, but hard battles weren't hard just to be really annoying. It is this reason that I have held off playing FF games.The story captivated me and I grew very attached to the characters and their relationships to each other. The end was extremely emotional for me, and only made me want to immediately play the sequel. It was beautifully crafted and is a thoroughly organized game by any standard. The only criticism I have is that there are so many cut scenes and so much text it feels like a visual novel a lot of the time. Because I played this game live on Twitch, some scenes would take 40 minutes to get through. That said, the scenes did not feel forced and offered up valuable information for the story and for the characters.			"

												Simply one of the best J-RPG series ever made. I played Trails in the Sky FC and SC and was in awe the whole time.Amazing worldbuilding, the game's world in incredibly coherent and immersive, everything makes sense. The characters' stories are some of the deepest I have ever found in a J-RPG, as well as the evolution of each character and the relationships between them.Why is it a game? It should be a manga or a book :) To be honest, while playing the game, I didn't really care for the gameplay, I was mostly interested in the story.Combats are quite fun though, if you play on hard modes you'll need to be very strategic 'cause it can get tricky!At first, I thought the music was cheap and cheesy, but I came to really love all the musical themes after a few hours. ""The Whereabouts of Light"" is a really beautiful song, a tribute to Joe Hisaishi's Laputa theme.While playing Trails in the Sky, I laughed, cried, got goosebumps from the epicness, felt tense... a wide range of emotions, which exaclty what I seek in a good story.Can't wait for the Third Chapter!!

												The battle system is satisfying. Fighting takes place on a big grid (so positioning actually matters) using ""Arts & Crafts"". The Orbment system is a little abstract at first but eventually you get used to it. Quartz are basically like FFVII Materia except nothing like Materia. Look at the in-game journal to find out which Quartz gives you the Arts (magic) you want. Even though the game can occasionally feel like a real slog in some of the larger late-game encounters, it never becomes too much of a problem and the majority of battles are pretty well balanced. Even as I'm writing this up I'm getting the urge to start up the game again - I just really enjoyed the battles that much.The writing is pretty good. The characters are well realized. Sometimes characters can be grating but its okay because they are teenagers and that fits. Even so the dialogue works well enough to keep character interaction entertaining and interesting. The humor is hit and miss for me. Some of the gags and jokes are just too corny and/or sweet. However the empty chest messages are fun - so much so I felt compelled to find every chest I could just to see the messages. At times the game can feel like words words words but not so much to make me drop it.The story doesn't do anything groundbreaking but serves its purpose well enough. Its an adventure that actually feels like an adventure. The game follows two teenage step-siblings Esteban and Joe of the small town Rolento in the Kingdom of Liberal after fate sends them on an adventure across the land searching for their missing father and sleuthing for the privately owned, government contracted police force. They travel the Kingdom visiting wonderfully detailed city-hubs: Bose™, Juan, Zoo, and finally ending up at the capitol of Granpa. Along the way Esteban and Joe team up with all sorts of fun characters such as Charizard, A gate, Tifa, Chloe, Zane, Oliver and many many more.The soundtrack is alright. A lot of the tracks are super catchy. One song in particular is still stuck in my head.The game is a time vampire. Honestly if you are on this page and considering purchasing a jrpg, you already knew this. It isn't even that long reletave to other games in the genre. Still though ~50 hours is a good chunk of time. Fair warning.The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is pretty alright.			"

												This Trails series is in top 3 JRPG series for me.  Concept is similar to that of Genso Suikoden ( another godly JRPGs). Gameplay wise, Suikoden is better but story wise, Trails series is better ( as it is a Story RPG). First thing I want to mention is that this series is connected as in Trails FC, SC and 3rd is one story. However, it is deeply connected with other trails series (tails of azure, zero, sen). All story is on one world but story is in different locations just like in Suikoden. It is highly recommended to play serially. Only complain abt this game ( Trails FC) is that first 8 hrs it can get quite boring as it acts as a prologue for the the whole trails series in a  way. You need to have a lot of patience to the game to fully blossom ( it is worth it). Another complain is that battle is slow and moving from one place to another gets quite annoying at times ( this is due to the fact that the game focus more on story and Ys series focus more on battle). Anyways, if you are a JRPG lover, you will definately love this game and you will definately be motivated to buy trails SC and Trails 3rd.			"

												wow this game... I really like it!The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a RPG game that remind me of a mix from Fire emblem battle style, Game Style as a 3D RPG maker and Magic arts Attacks from Tales of whatever... This game has many different, unique, funny characters you meet throughout the game, and it can be both the NPC or Some who Join Your team Later on ..That's why I like this game so much because there is so much dialogue that is in the game. if you do not like to read a lot, so this is probably not the right game for you.but also during the game, there are a lot of side quests, which can kill a specific monster or find out lost gadgets that people need help to get back. doing this give you Bracer Point, giving you higher rank, money, and other things. after all. during the game you try to become Bracers which is the point of the game.The controll of this game, is that you can play it with the keyboard of with the mouse. ( I recommend using the mouse )The battle in this game appears when you walk in to a monster on the Road or when you are in a event and need to finish the boss to move on to the story.In battle, you will have some type of meter to the left of the screen. and the thing is very important because it shows who start to attack and who will be there after the attack. it will also be certain who or what the enemy makes a special attack, but also so is it when your next chance is to get an extra strong attack. but this is also for the enemy.There after, we have the location where the match is. which now reminded of Fire Emblem battles. you can go forward and attack or just walk in any direction when it is your turn. You can also use the Items and Run if needed. There, after we've Craft and Arts. Arts is the magic that is used depends on what type of crystall you have inside your Inventory. Crystaller get by defeating various monsters. there are Fire, Water, Rock, Wind, Time, and two more that I have no particular idea what they do. Besides being able to have in one's inventory in order to make stronger spells. (Difficult declared but it's easier than it sounds)Craft is what one's own person in one's team has learned, that can be used as an attack. easier explanation Craft attacks that all individuals have, which have different effects that are all different good use only.Craft is what one's own person in one's team has learned, that can be used as an attack. easier explanation Craft attacks that all individuals have, which have different effects that are all different good use only. as an example, can Craft made in order to attack twice, or make enemies dizzy. but also can craft and arts reorder the meter on who will get to attack first. which is very useful.also arts and crafts movement series uses the EP and CP. EP's point of Arts and CP are for Craft points. EP for you by buying slots which is the way to get access to more arts or in other words the Crystall as I said before. CP can collect up to 100 in order to make its super special case attack. but you can collect up to 200 CP if you really want to do great damage!The music in the game is interesting, because it is very fitting for this game. there are a lot of music I like from this game, which is good. but it feels as they are used too often. especially in the battle music. Now I do not mean the boss music without the usual battle music. but if it goes badly for the music will change, which means you are losing. but besides that, the music is great in this game.something more, oh right. the are treasure chest all over the game that you can speak to, many side quest. a good long story. Nice characters and NCPs, good music, battles, controll......Yeah! This is a great Game! I really Recommend you to play this If you like RPGs like this one. 9.6/10 - when I did play, there was some bugs here and there, but it didnt really do anything to me.			"

												This game didn't seem like my type of game, but I'm glad I gave it a try.First thing you'll noticed is how good the music is. And it stays amazing throughout the whole game.Sadly Trails in the Sky didn't change my opinion on Turn-based combat. It can get really painful when you encounter tons of enemies and just want to run away.BUT that didn't matter because the story in this game is just out of this world. Plot twists, lots of interesting characters, sad and happy moments. For people who are after a good story rich game. this one is for you.If there's anything about this game I didn't like, it was the achievements. So many of them were missable, and in a game this long and story rich, you want to make sure you don't miss anything. Pro tip: If you want to get all achievements in one playthrough, use a guide.

												This game,  is just simply amazing. Yes it is dialogue heavy, but the characters are so well developed that is voices aren't really needed. The prolongue is a bit long but it teachs you everything that you will need to know about the game. The game is a simple turn base JRPG but with the turns being on the side of the screen for you to see. Magic, Physical, or just spamming special abilities, this game is has a lot to offer.  You want your person to focus on attacks, go right ahead. Oh wait you to focus on support with healing or just be tanky, go right ahead. The customization of the game is there for you however you want to make your people.Sure the game can be completed in maybe 25-30 hours, but with all the stuff in the game, why wouldn't you want to explore or try out new stuff? I started the game on the second hardest mode and I got to say, only the beginning is really hard, the rest is just some grinding needed.Even with this game's very few flaws, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has played a previous Legend of Heroes series or just loves a really good JRPG			"

												After some initial issues getting the game to start, which I managed to fix by starting it for the first time through the config, I've been able to play for hours with no issues. Pros:This game has made me laugh and cry.I have spent hour after hour on this game and still have many more hours of play time to go. The story is enough to hold my attention and the characters are deep and well written. Relatively low grinding required to level characters for each zone.Cons: At first game would not start, not sure exactly what the problem was. EDIT: Apparently I totally missed the autosave function, but it does exist!Not being able to back track to past areas (at least at this stage of the game).Some quests have a very small window for completion and you may fail them before even receiving them, requiring a replay or to reload a save file.My Advice: Keep multiple save files, at least one new one per chapter and a running save as you play.

												It's a little repetitive, and you've definitely got to take your time with this one, but it's not surprising that this game is considered a classic.  It's hard to recommend to many as the pace is somewhat plodding, but if you like slower JRPGs there's a lot to love in the combat system (when it's actually being tested) and detail/setting here.Looking forward to second chapter.

												I was on the fence with this game for a while. I love dialouge and there is so much of it that even I skip some. This game is full of thick syrupy character development, Tons and tons of side missions that don't feel like side missions. Lots of choices in battle strategy and no real way to just sit back and let the game do the work for you.It's a JRPG on steroids. The battles are fluid and fun, lots of choices to bring your characters to victory.Every single battle feels like it's part of the story.Every single quest feels like your actually apart of a busy world.There's no missed opportunities to bring a character to life, or add some kind of character development.The story so far (im only 24 hours into it) is fun and something I want to achieve.If you pick up this game, you are going to do a lot of reading. A lot is really an understatement. You are going to get frustraited at battles because the smallest battles seem very important and intense. You will feel pressured to do side missions because they are all on a time limit. You will enjoy every moment of it, assuming that's what your in for.Something most people haven't really commented on is the control scheme. It is perfectly designed for both keyboard and mouse, and controller. If I had known how perfect the controls were for the mouse, I wouldn't have bothered using my controller. Seriously they are amazing. I just like to have a controller in my hands. If you like Story, if you like reading, if you like intuitive battles, and variety in the types of quests and missions you undertake, this game is for you. You need to buy it. It's amazing.			"

												To really boil it all down, ""Trails"" is a simple, comprehensible, solidly built RPG that feels like a ""lite"" version of ""Final Fantasy...""until the deep endgame, where things get very serious.And then they get even more serious.The comparison to ""Final Fantasy"" is not accidental. This game displays a lot of what made the earlier entries in that series so great: Memorable characters, a real variety of enemies that get steadily revealed as you progress, mechanics that reveal themselves naturally, and a lot of things to do and see.""Trails"" does sometimes find itself teetering between ""satisfyingly long"" and ""is this over yet?"" Fifty hours of real, core gameplay is no small thing, for a start. On a more specific note, you have to get into monster encounters to keep leveled, and the monsters definitely aren't pushovers. Arts (The ""Trails"" form of magic) help out a lot, but your reserve of casting power seems quite shallow at first. This, combined with the battle system being predictable and a touch slow, makes the experience a bit of a chore in spots.At the same time, the game does manage to keep pulling you along - the story being one reason. but also, from a mechanics standpoint, due to how decreasing XP rewards send clear signals that it's time to move along.A small technical ding is that the game sometimes grinds down to a low framerate. One gets the feeling that the graphical backend doesn't get managed very well all the time, which means that a game which could have been at home on a PS1 or PS2 will start to slog...on a GTX 970! Thankfully, the problem is relatively rare and tolerable.""Trails in the Sky"" isn't flawless, but it IS really good.			"

												While other jrpgs (and remember that this is one of the older titles) probably have better/deeper combat systems, this is one of those gems where the focus is on the story and the world around it. It's a bit needless to mention that only with the 2nd chapter is this duology ""complete"" (this story still obviously has a final boss and everything).The world feels alive and deep if you stop to take in what side NPCs tell you and what you learn from sidequests.The game itself is in (traditional) linear fashion, which you may or may not like.Overall it's a very good jrpg with optimization(60fps+) and fixes for the pc port.Like many other games it also has controller support.

												I'm reviewing both FC and its sequel SC since Trail in the Sky is one big game cut into parts with one big story.Pro: ->Pretty much the best story ever in a PC Game. Nothing is remotly close, at least on PC. It starts slows but there are plot seeds everywhere, great character development, twists etc.... and it build up into something quite big.-> Lots of lore and full of hiden stuffs (story and equipement)-> Combat are fun and tactical. In hard at least. The hard mode have being added later on quite lasily and here and there you'll face an unfair fight but it is still a lot of fun-> OST is goodCon:-> It is slow with a  lot a walking. Would be better if you could skip attack animations if there was some sort of fast travel.			"

												This is a story heavy JRPG with a focus on character development. The game starts off slow and it takes it's times to develop the characters. If you enjoy a game with an emphasis on character development, I think this is one of the best I have ever played. The combat is tun-based on a grid system. The system has quite a lot of depth due to turn-order bonuses, the ability to manipulate turn-order, and the ability to change character positions on the grid.  Your characters abilities are determined by what quartz you put in each character's quartz grid. The game is very open with information, giving you all the quartz requirements for spells at the start of the game in the bracer notebook. The music is pretty good, but its Falcom good music is what they do best. I think the biggest complaint I had in my first playthrough was that the game was too easy. After you beat the game once  you can play on higher difficulties. Also if you want to complete a perfect run, save often because it is really easy to miss things.			"

												I finished the game (just the first game; FC) in normal difficulty a few days ago and the thing that really stands out is that it is more of a story driven game rather than your ""grind-heavy"" rpg. I didn't even have to grind so much since the leveling system allows you not-to-grind at all (you get increased exp if you are underleveled or decreased exp if otherwise depending on the chapter you are in). Battle can be a bit dull at the beginning when you're still trying to figure it out. But once you get the hang of it (setting different quartz combinations for your orbments), it becomes fun to try various strategies among characters you can use. Other differences is the currency system which is slightly different from other rpgs, a cooking system, side-quests that are fun to do, books and newspapers to read, NO RANDOM ENCOUNTERS, and so much more for a game that was released in 2004. And again, the very best part is the journey you took in, the story that unfolds as you go through the game. The characters aren't annoying with the protagonist having an interesting personality. I liked how they developed throughout my playthrough, only to find out I was already attached to all of them. So I suggest to take your time and read through the dialogue if you really want to enjoy this game to the fullest. Of course there are still flaws, like the game might be too slow for some, dungeons that can be confusing, pre-emptive strikes that are a must required in some cases, or the battle system which isnt for everybody. But reviews are subjective, and these complains are applied to almost all jrpgs out there. Each to their own cup of tea.To conclude, after playing so many old RPGs like Lunar, Final Fantasy, Zelda, The Tales series, and many more, I can finally say that Trails in the Sky is now my favorite.

												SummaryGreat Classic RPG by Nihon Falcom. The first chapter in the series and it looks pretty good. Definately Recommended! 9/10StorylineThe story starts off slowly, introducing the main characters Estelle and Joshua, their Dad. As the game progresses you'll meet a different characters, some that join your party. The start might be a little too slow for some, but trust me - stick with it and it will become literally one of the most enjoyable epic adventure/plots played in some time. At the same time you'll uncover more about the past of the characters as told by others in a great intertwined story- can't spoil too much just play it. Story is likely to be around 40 hours including sidequests etc, lots to do.Gameplay/CombatThe main exploration done is in pretty linear maps but are not small, plenty of variety, there's some backtracking but not too bad. You start off with 2 characters and the party will grow. With these type of games its all about getting better gear, managing energy points, charge and s-craft, positioning and gearing your characters appropriately for the fights. The Orbment system allows for much flexibility - the key to successfully fighting enemies is gearing the right Orbments to get the appropriate skills, some are so powerful they can annihilate groups of enemies with ease - Read the in game help guide on what combination of Orbments to unlock the skills! Tip: You get pre-emptive attacks when you approach enemies from behind, so try to do this as much as possibleMusic Similar to most games done by Falcom - the music is fantastic. All of them suit the mood - enjoyable and (especially the final dungeon theme!) epic!VisualsThey are quite dated, but being a game from 2004/2006 with updated visuals it looks pretty good. But we don't play this game solely for its visuals.BugsThe game did crash on me several times in Full Screen mode after Alt-Tabbing. But never fear, the develepers have added a secret AutoSave Page 0 so you can get to where you were without losing too much progress.Highly recommend this game for old school style turn based RPG. Can't wait for Second Chapter. Support Falcom/XSeed by getting this so they can bring more chapters in this series to English!			"

												You can really tell when developers take their time and make a quality game.  A lot of time and hard work went into this game and it really shows, it wasn't hastely made, this game was made to tell a great story AND be a fun RPG.  The detail they put into the story is just amazing, EVERY characters dialog changes and relates to your current progress in the story.The gameplay is a little different from the normal turn by turn grid based play. Its more like a queue and who goes when and how often is determined by the characters speed.  The game also randomly assigns small ""boosts"" to certain turns in the queue such as ""this queue slot heals 10% of their max health"" or ""this slot gets a garenteed critical hit"". The strategy comes in when you can shift around the queue slots to get these boosts or take them away from enemies. All characters have the ability to ""take"" a slot with their S-craft move at any time (its like cutting someone off in line). They are game changing moves but will take time to get them back. Casting magic takes 2 slots (one to ready the spell and one to cast) and also shifts the queue around by adding a slot depending on how fast they cast the spell.This game has so much to it, so much strategy and a great storyline. I can't wait for the Second Chapter!			"

												Definite recommend! The battle system, once you get used to adding up the values of your various quartz to get particular abilities, is actually very intuitive. I also like the element of being able to pick and choose your battles and see them coming, rather than the old style 'random encounter'.The world is rich and immersive, although I find the main characters quite 2-dimensional so far, something I hope will change come the release of Trails in the Sky: SC. However, while the characters themselves seem to be fairly predictable caricatures so far, the storyline is interesting and combined with the brilliant world-building is really quite something. It is also quite amusing seeing the NPCs going through their own little mini-plots and giving their take on the major events in the game!Word of warning though - it is extremely easy to miss your chances for things in this game; save frequently, save often and if you are the kind of gamer that likes a complete save file, I strongly recommend making use of the interwebs frequently throughout your gameplay.

												This game is great homage to old school JRPGs like FF7. Story is engaging and well paced, but it's light hearted and not overly serious. Combat system is well designed and fun to play. I'm 35 hours in and only on chapter 3. (there is a fairly long prologue and 4 chapters) so there is plenty of content to suck up your time. Even with plenty of other higher profile games in my library waiting for me to play, I find myself continually coming back to this game. My only real complaint is the music.  I find it to be kind of annoying, the quality isn't that great, and it gets old fast. Other than that this is an amazing game!!!Long story short, if you like turn based JRPGs then you should absolutely buy this game. For $20 it is well worth it because you can easily burn 40+ hours on this game. Go buy it already so they will hurry up with Part 2.			"

It really helped developed each character's personality and although the dialogue can be cheesy at times, it was also quite charming.

The combat is also very well balanced - not difficult (I lost and retried less than a dozen times overall) but does require you pay attention to what is going on.It is quite long and has lots of details (lots of NPCs with dialogs as well) for a game that is possibly intended for younger gamers - no blood, no deaths, no strong language, etc. But perfect for someone like me that enjoys story-driven JRPG.Xseed Games - get off your collective butts, guys, and finish translating the second chapter already!

												First off, the translation team REALLY SERIOUSLY did a FANTASTIC job on this title. I have talked to just about every single NPC in the game, read every single treasure chest text, and I do not ever recall noticing any error at all. That's just amazing, and if you take into account the INSANE amount of dialogue in the game, it's mind-blowing.Secondly, the combat system and overall gameplay is solid as well, nothing TOO challenging yet it doesn't bore you, and as you progress into the game, you will eventually realize that the game isn't really about battles at all, you don't have to grind like mad for anything and you can actually avoid random encounters altogether - in more ways than one!Story is good too, with plenty of humor and comic relief. It gets really exciting towards the end and when you finally reach the finale, the feels kick in.Lastly, I really can't wait for the english version of Second Chapter and of course, the third and final chapter of the trilogy. Fortunately though it seems that the long wait will finally be over soon (at least for SC), and I'll definitely pick it up as soon as it's released.As a side note, after finally finishing the game, I find myself reminded of the Suikoden series (particularly Suiko II), both share quite a few similar aspects such as story, dialogues, diversity, graphics, and the ending (seriously, saving & liberating the kingdom as ""rebels"" and then finishing off with a sad ending, all too familiar). As such, I believe Suikoden fans would most definitely enjoy this game, even though the combat system is quite different. Heck, anyone who enjoys a good JRPG and plays mainly for the storyline would DEFINITELY enjoy this series.TLDR; Play it for the story, you will not regret it.			"

												First things first: if you arent' a fan of JRPGs, or RPGs in general, this probably isn't for you. If, however, you enjoy a good story, plentiful dialogue, and a world that feels alive, then it might be just for you. This is the best game that I have played in a long time.  I expected this to just be a long, vaguely engaging RPG.  I must admit the title sucked me in.  Longest RPG?  Let's find out.  Well, it turns out it was no bluff.   It started with being rich with story line and having a large inviting world, but I was put off guard by the surprisingly good dialogue.  Some of the lines made me just stop and think, for their sheer provocation of thought.  And the dialogue keeps going too. I was amazed at how many unique conversations you could have with seemingly uninvolved NPCs, and expecially with the more prominent characters who might be just relaxing on the sidelines.  The amount of dialogue, and quality of dialogue, is simply staggering.  It's fantastic.That's not to say that gameplay has been neglected.  In fact, the turn-based hybrid-ish system isn't quite like anything I've seen.  FFXII comes to mind, but there isn't much similiarity even there.   However, know that it's fun, engaging, and doesn't get tiresome.  The battle theme is also the classiest I've ever known.  I wouldn't have expected such a jazzy number to be the default, but lo and behold, it is.The music certainly is deserving of acclaim as well.  Some of the tracks can fall just in the background, and not have attention brought to them.  Others can make you grin as you stop to listen to them for awhile.  The soundtrack is pretty good, overall.  No faults certainly, and some of the songs rank among my favorites.All in all, it's a fantastic game.  I can say it's easily worth $40 to me, so at it's current price it's quite good value.  I will warn though: I can't foresee how much replay value can be found in this.  So while you can put at least 20 hours into the game for a rushed playthrough, you might also speak to every person and do every quest, relishing the atmosphere.  If you do that, you could probably spend more than 50 hours playing this.  I've put in about 35 hours of this writing, and I haven't even finished the game yet! (Quite close though). It's quite the charmer, but again, it might be something you enjoy once, and don't do again.  Perhaps like reading a good book.Honestly, if you enjoy this game half as much as I do, you'll be rather pleased. And if you enjoy it more than that?  'Twill be your win.  I hope you get this game, dear reader.  It will make a worthy addition to your library.  =)			"

Very interesting characters and the developers went the extra mile in giving personality to all sorts of assorted NPCs who you'll only see once in addition to the ~25 characters who are deeply involved in the main story. Decent battle system although nothing too complex, difficulty feels just right - easy if you do a ton of grinding and challenging otherwise - with a very satisfying final boss. Lots of touching cutscenes. Great soundtrack with some very hype boss music. Overall an ideal JRPG experience. Now just need to count the time until the sequel comes on steam :(			"

The detail they put into the story is just amazing, EVERY characters dialog changes and relates to your current progress in the story.The gameplay is a little different from the normal turn by turn grid based play. Its more like a queue and who goes when and how often is determined by the characters speed.  The game also randomly assigns small ""boosts"" to certain turns in the queue such as ""this queue slot heals 10% of their max health"" or ""this slot gets a garenteed critical hit"". The strategy comes in when you can shift around the queue slots to get these boosts or take them away from enemies. All characters have the ability to ""take"" a slot with their S-craft move at any time (its like cutting someone off in line). They are game changing moves but will take time to get them back. Casting magic takes 2 slots (one to ready the spell and one to cast) and also shifts the queue around by adding a slot depending on how fast they cast the spell.This game has so much to it, so much strategy and a great storyline. I can't wait for the Second Chapter!			"

												Just finished the game, writing my first ever steam review for it. Absolutely worth buying if you like JRPGs and similar games. Great in-depth story with a ton of world-buidling. Very interesting characters and the developers went the extra mile in giving personality to all sorts of assorted NPCs who you'll only see once in addition to the ~25 characters who are deeply involved in the main story. Decent battle system although nothing too complex, difficulty feels just right - easy if you do a ton of grinding and challenging otherwise - with a very satisfying final boss. Lots of touching cutscenes. Great soundtrack with some very hype boss music. Overall an ideal JRPG experience. Now just need to count the time until the sequel comes on steam :(			"

												Just finished the game (first chapter).Great characters, very fun personalities. Love the story as well, it manages to stay coherent and provide valid reasons to keep you running around every possible location on the map. The combat is also very well balanced - not difficult (I lost and retried less than a dozen times overall) but does require you pay attention to what is going on.It is quite long and has lots of details (lots of NPCs with dialogs as well) for a game that is possibly intended for younger gamers - no blood, no deaths, no strong language, etc. But perfect for someone like me that enjoys story-driven JRPG.Xseed Games - get off your collective butts, guys, and finish translating the second chapter already! And the third! I would buy them instantly. Too bad I can't read Japanese..			"

												I grew up playing JRPGs and sometimes I just wish there were more JRPGs....that's when I found this series! Its a heavy story based game with a lot of dialogue. At first the shear amount of dialogue seemed a bit more than what I was use to but after I got use to it, I realized that I ended up likeing the characters more because of it. It really helped developed each character's personality and although the dialogue can be cheesy at times, it was also quite charming. I'm looking forwared to the next 2 games of this series coming out to steam in the future!			"

												First things first: if you arent' a fan of JRPGs, or RPGs in general, this probably isn't for you. If, however, you enjoy a good story, plentiful dialogue, and a world that feels alive, then it might be just for you. This is the best game that I have played in a long time.  I expected this to just be a long, vaguely engaging RPG.  I must admit the title sucked me in.  Longest RPG?  Let's find out.  Well, it turns out it was no bluff.   It started with being rich with story line and having a large inviting world, but I was put off guard by the surprisingly good dialogue.  Some of the lines made me just stop and think, for their sheer provocation of thought.  And the dialogue keeps going too. I was amazed at how many unique conversations you could have with seemingly uninvolved NPCs, and expecially with the more prominent characters who might be just relaxing on the sidelines.  The amount of dialogue, and quality of dialogue, is simply staggering.  It's fantastic.That's not to say that gameplay has been neglected.  In fact, the turn-based hybrid-ish system isn't quite like anything I've seen.  FFXII comes to mind, but there isn't much similiarity even there.   However, know that it's fun, engaging, and doesn't get tiresome.  The battle theme is also the classiest I've ever known.  I wouldn't have expected such a jazzy number to be the default, but lo and behold, it is.The music certainly is deserving of acclaim as well.  Some of the tracks can fall just in the background, and not have attention brought to them.  Others can make you grin as you stop to listen to them for awhile.  The soundtrack is pretty good, overall.  No faults certainly, and some of the songs rank among my favorites.All in all, it's a fantastic game.  I can say it's easily worth $40 to me, so at it's current price it's quite good value.  I will warn though: I can't foresee how much replay value can be found in this.  So while you can put at least 20 hours into the game for a rushed playthrough, you might also speak to every person and do every quest, relishing the atmosphere.  If you do that, you could probably spend more than 50 hours playing this.  I've put in about 35 hours of this writing, and I haven't even finished the game yet! (Quite close though). It's quite the charmer, but again, it might be something you enjoy once, and don't do again.  Perhaps like reading a good book.Honestly, if you enjoy this game half as much as I do, you'll be rather pleased. And if you enjoy it more than that?  'Twill be your win.  I hope you get this game, dear reader.  It will make a worthy addition to your library.  =)			"

												This game proves that the JRPG genre still has a chance to shine in this current video game generation.  I know the game came out for PSP but for a game on Steam, the list of a good JRPG game, is pretty lacking. (and it's a Tactical JRPG to be at that)  I was a little bit concerned when the prologue of the game started off a bit slow.  But once I finished the prologue and started Chapter 1, I was hooked.  The story is amazing and keeps you wondering what will happen next. From what I've heard, people are saying the game plays like Grandia.  Well I've never played Grandia but if it's like this game, I might try that game too. If I were to say some of the negatives, the normal battle and boss music is quite jazzy and catchy, it gets old pretty quickly. Not to mention in a certain part of the normal battle theme, I somewhat hear the Raymour and Flanigan furniture theme.  (BTW, you will never not hear the Raymour and Flanigan theme when you enter a normal battle in this game ever again. You're welcome! :P)  Another complaint is the lack of Anime cutscenes.  For a game that has the capabilities of doing so, I've only seen it twice.  Once in the beginning and once at the end of the game.  There's only 4 chapters and a prologue.  They could have at least put one at the end of Chapter 1, 2, and 3 but that's just my opinion. But that's enough ranting. As for this game overall.  It's a solid game with a few minor issues.  I give it a 9/10			"

												I'm not going to lie, I never even heard of this series before.  I've played many RPGs and I didn't go into this with very high expectations.  I'm 31, not really an anime guy at all, and I have to say I was honestly impressed with the depth of the story in this game.  This is coming from someone who's played Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment, pretty much every game in the Final Fantasy series, Legend of Dragoon, etc.  The music was captivating and the story wasn't half bad.  I will argue that the fights were a little too easy compared to what I'm used to (*ahem* Dark Souls).  With that said, if you're skeptical, seriously give this game a chance.  It may very well surprise you.			"

With that said this is a very well written game in both dynamics of gameplay and charecter progression. Not to say level grind progression, oh no, rich and vibrant story telling that grows the people in the world into both heroes and villians that you not only root for and hope they make it out alive but cry for and rage at because you just can't believe that the would do that. I highly recomend this game to ANYONE that enjoys JRPGs. But more so I would recomend this if you could only buy and play one game every ten years. It really is that good.			"

												I almost didn't get this game as it seemed there were a lot of bugs.However, I got it anyway, and have enjoyed it quite a bit so far. I'm only in chapter 2 at the moment and have only come across one game breaking issue (which I believe they have patched - it's where I had to open a chest to fight a sidequest monster and I got stuck in place after the fight ended; restarted, opened the chest from a step farther away, and no problems ever since).It's a very enjoyable old school tactical turn-based RPG. You do not customize your character stats, but you do get to pick equipment and what magics to equip --- you don't, however, pick your clothing or anything like that. You can go and grind to get more XP and items to craft your magic ability, or you can just go at it head on. I've played some games where setting up your ""formation"" in tactical turn-based game was useless, but I've found it really can make a difference against higher level or higher-number opponents.The game is a bit lightweight in the customizing department, so I would label this as a ""simple RPG"" or an ""easy to pick up RPG"". Graphics are not bad. Sound is not bad. Overall, it's just a lot more enjoyable that I thought it would be, and way, way less buggy than I thought it could have been. I hope they do the other games in the series as I would definitely buy them.			"

												I'll be honest, I have heard of this game before when it was released for the PSP several years ago but I haven't gotten the chance to play it because of rough times trying to get through economic hardships. That, and it's my first review here so I honestly don't know how to describe in detail of how great this game is after playing through.Now, the game feels light hearted and I think it's just me because I have yet to scratch the surface of the game doing a kind of sort of blind gameplay without having to spoil it of course. The graphics are good, the mechanics and battle remind me a bit of playing Record of Agarest war without the visual novel esque like or combining attacks to take out enemies in battle.The initial controls are confusing for me at first since I typically use the WASD keys to move around. Lucky for me, right before you begin playing there's an option to adjust the resolution, sound, graphics, and keys if your the type of cat that prefers the WASD. At some point I did find using the mouse only to speed pass enemies which, you'll encounter when your travelling from one area to another. I want to add more but I'll end it here by saying that so far, I'm enjoying the game. As someone that plays JRPGS in the past I hope to see more of them coming to Steam. No doubt the devs have my support so kudos to them. "

												As of the time that this review was written, Trails in the Sky FC was sitting at 92% positive out of some 2000 reviews. This tells me that there are ~160 steam users who wouldn't know an amazing JRPG if it shot them in the face with an Orbal Cannon. I got this game on sale for $9.99 and have been having a blast - well written story, engaging characters, witty dialogue, great gameplay with lots of customization, loads of side-objectives and collectables for your inner completionist - the ONLY nitpick I have is a small bug where mouse-over tooltips sometimes fail to show up on the CAMP menu, but closing and re-opening the menu always fixes it, so it isn't too big of a deal. I rate this game 10/10 - would massacre thousands of rainbow-colored penguins for shiny rocks again.			"

												An epic adventure with a bitter conclusion, Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is the rare game in which the story is the deciding factor on why you continue to play. No game in recent history has had the pull on me like Trails in the Sky has.With that being said, the world building is fantastic, with its only weakness being that it does not use the environment to its advantage. Games with the best world building use their environment to tell their story, but Trails in the Sky tells its story through a well made narrative full of action, adventure, joy and sadness.The music is top notch, rivaling the best games in the genre. Very few developers can seamlessly tie in music into their narrative in such ways.The game itself was rather refreshing as well. The game offered very little reason for you to backtrack, while still giving you the option to do so, while also minimizing the amount of extra content you needed to do for those who were hooked on the engaging story.There is however lots of optional content to do, and you will want to do it all if you have any desire to get all of the achievements in this title. There is even a New Game+ option for those who may have missed things through the adventure.All in all, I would say that this is one of the top 5 ""Must play"" JRPGs on Steam and an excellent choice for first JRPG for people entering the genre.

The GameTrails in the Sky is a sort of spinoff of the Dragon Slayer line of games.The full title should be The Legend of Heroes VI: Trails in the Sky, chapter 1 (of 3).The series currently contains 8 main titles, some of which splited in 2 or 3 chapters, but this one is the only available on Steam (chapter 2 should arrive soon, though)This is a single player only tactical-jRPG. Fights are done on an isometric square map, turn-by-turn.You control up to 4 characters (depending on the scenario) and can't chose which character will be in the party (except at some point in the game). Most of the time, 2 of these 4 characters are the main ones: Estelle and Joshua.Some characters will join your party multiple times during the game.Good points There's a real, complete story Solid RPG, the evolution of the characters is as you would expect The combat system is great if you're into tactical RPGs The graphics are nice The quartz system is interresting (but cold be explained better) I didn't felt there was too much dialogs You can re-play with what you had from your previous playthroughWeak points No teleportation. You have to walk long, long, long roads to go from one point to the other The final boss fight is terribly long, boring, and sometimes frustrating, I just wanted it to end! The side quests must be done before a certain point in the scenario, I felt it frustrating You have to use the config tool to activate the ""running"" mode instead of walking... and trust me, it changes life The receipes system is not practical, the game is long enough you don't want to spend time ""cooking"" so you end buying potions Sometimes, when you do long walks, it's boring to get caught by monster (until you get the adequate Quartz)I recommend this game, even if at the end I just wanted it to end (the played time is not relevant, I've been idle a lot)			"

												(Excuse my playtime, I've fully played the PSP version and then bought the PC version to support XSEED)Chances are, you're here reading these reviews because you at least somewhat enjoy JRPGs.Well, there you go. You already meet all the requirements to love this game....What? Still not convinced? Need details? Fine, fine. Here we go:Graphics:Alright, lets start with the bad stuff. Yes, this is pretty much a PSP game. No, it doesn't look great and the loading screens are kind of long. I guarantee after playing it long enough you'll get used to it, and the second game runs much better and looks much nicer. Still, if you really want da sweet graphucs, this game won't really deliver all that well. Fortunately, the walking speed is very nicely swift and maps are just simple enough that you don't have to spend too long looking around if you really don't want to.Story:Starts out looking like it'll be pretty typical/tropey, and it is in some ways. However, the story really picks up after a bit and the expertly written and translated dialog will have your heart before long, I promise. The characters each develop nicely and by the end you will be begging for more. Luckily, the second game is on steam now so you don't have to wait like the old fans did.Gameplay:Surprisngly intricate, actually. Like the story, its pretty simple at a glance, but you'll quickly figure out there's a whole lot of really smart game design that went into these systems. The orbment system, for example, I find much smarter than any skill tree. Basically, you fill your characters up with special items called orbments that give passive effects, and the colors/attributes of the orbments decides what magic they can use. EX: If you equip Joshua with Action, a time-attribute orbment that raises his speed, he'll get some time points. These time points will allow him to cast Soul Blur, a damaging time spell. On top of the EP (mana) you use to cast these, you also have a CP system that lets you use the crafts, or character unique skills. CP goes up when you get hit or hit something, and EP is replenished with potions or inns like in most games. In other words, you have one kind of resource that becomes more available as combat continues, and one that becomes less available. Balancing them feels good and makes combat very satisfying.There's also just a lot of other nice little things about the way the game is set up, like how side quests are usually like little stories instead of simple fetch quests, or how party members constantly switch in and out as the story calls for it, giving you a great deal of time to try each character and see their strength and weaknesses before you need to pick your team.A lot of passion went into making this series, and it really payed off. Most people who've played this game enjoy it thuroughly. Although, fair warning, the beginning is a little slow. Please stick with it and you'll see that the hype is very much warranted!			"

												I've only played a couple of game ""days"" (just past the farm), and I'm already VERY impressed with this game. It's funny, the battles are fun, the artwork is lovely, and the game overall simply gives a very polished, proffessional feel. If you like JRPGs, chances are good you'll like this one. (As for language, the English is very good - I haven't noticed any engrish at ALL - and I've only noticed one use of questionable language, which is refreshing in an age where everyone feels the need to add foul language to everything for absolutely no reason whatsoever.)This is definitely a title I feel bad having gotten on sale (though I might not have tried it had it not been on sale) because it's worth every penny of the full price. Maybe I'll buy the sequel(s) at full price. :)			"

												This game has been a pleasant suprise for me. I bought it expecting very little and quite honestly it has turned out to be one of the best rpgs I have ever played.The one thing I fele a lot of great games lack right now is an adequate story. This game gives you that. Each character has his or her own backstory and intricate motivations that you learn more about as the story goes on and in a non-predictable way (except for one major thing). Everytime I left this game I found myself fighting the urge to not run back to my computer to see where the story would take me next. The combat system is finely tuned and well executed and except for a few moments rarely got dull for me. This game is pretty much 50% gameplay and 50% story. You'll find yourself reading text for sometimes long periods of time. If you just want a game in which you kill things and the story doesn't matter this game is not for you. Expect to be playing this for awhile to beat it around 35 hours is what it took  me to get through the entire game, but it was worth it.10/10			"

												What quite a number of people don't realize is that this game was originally released 2004 for the PSP and only made it's way to the west a couple of years ago. This is a game that was created during a time when RPG storytelling and combat was a fair bit slower paced and relaxed. It was also made by a company (Nihon Falcom) that's renowed for their dedication to old school JRPGs. Despite or even perhaps due to it's age i feel that it matches quite well with a number of games out there. If you're looking for a game to invest time with good story and a comparitively unique combat system (during 2004 anyway) then this a game you should consider.For those who like the game but seek faster paced and more intuitive combat and possess either a PsVita or PS3 i'd recommend Sen no Kiseki. AKA Trails of Cold Steel. it's a mix of Trails in the Sky's general combat system with a more advanced version of Fire Emblem Awakening's link system and Persona  series social links.			"

												SummaryGreat Classic RPG by Nihon Falcom. The first chapter in the series and it looks pretty good. Definately Recommended! 9/10StorylineThe story starts off slowly, introducing the main characters Estelle and Joshua, their Dad. As the game progresses you'll meet a different characters, some that join your party. The start might be a little too slow for some, but trust me - stick with it and it will become literally one of the most enjoyable epic adventure/plots played in some time. At the same time you'll uncover more about the past of the characters as told by others in a great intertwined story- can't spoil too much just play it. Story is likely to be around 40 hours including sidequests etc, lots to do.Gameplay/CombatThe main exploration done is in pretty linear maps but are not small, plenty of variety, there's some backtracking but not too bad. You start off with 2 characters and the party will grow. With these type of games its all about getting better gear, managing energy points, charge and s-craft, positioning and gearing your characters appropriately for the fights. The Orbment system allows for much flexibility - the key to successfully fighting enemies is gearing the right Orbments to get the appropriate skills, some are so powerful they can annihilate groups of enemies with ease - Read the in game help guide on what combination of Orbments to unlock the skills! Tip: You get pre-emptive attacks when you approach enemies from behind, so try to do this as much as possibleMusic Similar to most games done by Falcom - the music is fantastic. All of them suit the mood - enjoyable and (especially the final dungeon theme!) epic!VisualsThey are quite dated, but being a game from 2004/2006 with updated visuals it looks pretty good. But we don't play this game solely for its visuals.BugsThe game did crash on me several times in Full Screen mode after Alt-Tabbing. But never fear, the develepers have added a secret AutoSave Page 0 so you can get to where you were without losing too much progress.Highly recommend this game for old school style turn based RPG. Can't wait for Second Chapter. Support Falcom/XSeed by getting this so they can bring more chapters in this series to English!			"

												To really boil it all down, ""Trails"" is a simple, comprehensible, solidly built RPG that feels like a ""lite"" version of ""Final Fantasy...""until the deep endgame, where things get very serious.And then they get even more serious.The comparison to ""Final Fantasy"" is not accidental. This game displays a lot of what made the earlier entries in that series so great: Memorable characters, a real variety of enemies that get steadily revealed as you progress, mechanics that reveal themselves naturally, and a lot of things to do and see.""Trails"" does sometimes find itself teetering between ""satisfyingly long"" and ""is this over yet?"" Fifty hours of real, core gameplay is no small thing, for a start. On a more specific note, you have to get into monster encounters to keep leveled, and the monsters definitely aren't pushovers. Arts (The ""Trails"" form of magic) help out a lot, but your reserve of casting power seems quite shallow at first. This, combined with the battle system being predictable and a touch slow, makes the experience a bit of a chore in spots.At the same time, the game does manage to keep pulling you along - the story being one reason. but also, from a mechanics standpoint, due to how decreasing XP rewards send clear signals that it's time to move along.A small technical ding is that the game sometimes grinds down to a low framerate. One gets the feeling that the graphical backend doesn't get managed very well all the time, which means that a game which could have been at home on a PS1 or PS2 will start to slog...on a GTX 970! Thankfully, the problem is relatively rare and tolerable.""Trails in the Sky"" isn't flawless, but it IS really good.			"

												I finished the game (just the first game; FC) in normal difficulty a few days ago and the thing that really stands out is that it is more of a story driven game rather than your ""grind-heavy"" rpg. I didn't even have to grind so much since the leveling system allows you not-to-grind at all (you get increased exp if you are underleveled or decreased exp if otherwise depending on the chapter you are in). Battle can be a bit dull at the beginning when you're still trying to figure it out. But once you get the hang of it (setting different quartz combinations for your orbments), it becomes fun to try various strategies among characters you can use. Other differences is the currency system which is slightly different from other rpgs, a cooking system, side-quests that are fun to do, books and newspapers to read, NO RANDOM ENCOUNTERS, and so much more for a game that was released in 2004. And again, the very best part is the journey you took in, the story that unfolds as you go through the game. The characters aren't annoying with the protagonist having an interesting personality. I liked how they developed throughout my playthrough, only to find out I was already attached to all of them. So I suggest to take your time and read through the dialogue if you really want to enjoy this game to the fullest. Of course there are still flaws, like the game might be too slow for some, dungeons that can be confusing, pre-emptive strikes that are a must required in some cases, or the battle system which isnt for everybody. But reviews are subjective, and these complains are applied to almost all jrpgs out there. Each to their own cup of tea.To conclude, after playing so many old RPGs like Lunar, Final Fantasy, Zelda, The Tales series, and many more, I can finally say that Trails in the Sky is now my favorite.

												I'm reviewing both FC and its sequel SC since Trail in the Sky is one big game cut into parts with one big story.Pro: ->Pretty much the best story ever in a PC Game. Nothing is remotly close, at least on PC. It starts slows but there are plot seeds everywhere, great character development, twists etc.... and it build up into something quite big.-> Lots of lore and full of hiden stuffs (story and equipement)-> Combat are fun and tactical. In hard at least. The hard mode have being added later on quite lasily and here and there you'll face an unfair fight but it is still a lot of fun-> OST is goodCon:-> It is slow with a  lot a walking. Would be better if you could skip attack animations if there was some sort of fast travel.			"

												This is a story heavy JRPG with a focus on character development. The game starts off slow and it takes it's times to develop the characters. If you enjoy a game with an emphasis on character development, I think this is one of the best I have ever played. The combat is tun-based on a grid system. The system has quite a lot of depth due to turn-order bonuses, the ability to manipulate turn-order, and the ability to change character positions on the grid.  Your characters abilities are determined by what quartz you put in each character's quartz grid. The game is very open with information, giving you all the quartz requirements for spells at the start of the game in the bracer notebook. The music is pretty good, but its Falcom good music is what they do best. I think the biggest complaint I had in my first playthrough was that the game was too easy. After you beat the game once  you can play on higher difficulties. Also if you want to complete a perfect run, save often because it is really easy to miss things.			"

												This game actually got me out of a gaming slump, and I am pretty enthralled by it right now. I'm not even sure why. The story is relatively mediocre to the point of being cheesy at times, with relatively stereotypical characters (The hotheaded girl who needs to prove herself, the smart pretty boy, the overly sexy mature lady, the flamboyant minstrel, etc.), it has a setting we've probably all seen before, and sprite models that really don't look that great, but in some ways, that's what makes it good. It's extremely nostalgic for those who play or have played many RPGs, both good and bad ones.The combat is kinda sorta grid based and turn based, but not quite. You could probably compare it to Lunar a little bit in that placement matters only slightly. The game works pretty well with an Xbox controller, and the keys are remappable if you know what button aligns to what number (you can also just press the button you want when messing with the keys). The magic system is pretty cool with the variety of combinations that any character can attain, and they followed the tradition of making the main slightly more powerful than other characters (i.e. she can use any kind of magic) since, well, you're stuck with her forever. Speaking of combat, apparently the bestiary hasn't been implemented yet, which is kind of a bummer, as you have to waste an orbment slot to see enemy information otherwise.It has that old school RPG feel, and it especially comes out when you talk to NPCs at different times. The amount of thought put into NPC dialogue is beautiful, and if you actually tried to bother with seeing what every NPC has to say at every time, you would be spending hours and hours just talking to these NPCs. That keeps it fresh in a way, because you can simply go a little farther in the story and suddenly have an NPC's life drastically change in some way. You can actually follow what they're doing in their daily lives in a way, and it's very interesting. Unfortunately that also discourages you from actually doing this, since even in the first, small town, there are at least 20 NPCs all with different dialogue at different times. But the thought shows, for certain, and it can lead to some small character development in some situations.Overall I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the classic style of JRPG, especially in this day and age where they're so few and far between. It's not the next big thing, the story isn't going to rock your very foundation, but it is enjoyable for those who want a light gaming experience.UPDATEI would like to mention that I've found a flaw within the game that caused me a bit of grief recently, but I feel I wouldn't have minded if I had known about it beforehand. See, it's never really mentioned much in the game until it's too late, but the sidequest Bracer Missions actually have a time limit to them. Not in actual hours, but time moves forward when you move the main story along. That is to say, a short term mission should be completed immediately if you're going for total completion, otherwise it'll be failed and locked out forever. The problem is, the game only gives you a vague idea of how long these missions last, and make no mention of the possibility of failing them until after you've actually done so.There are actually quite a few things in this game that can easily be missed, and you'll never be able to get them again, including anything from certain treasure chests you may have missed to entire side quests. This annoys me quite a bit as a semi-completionist, and while I do still recommend the game, it's something that really didn't sit well with me, so be aware of that if you're planning to do as much as you can in this game.

												Within the first few moments of playing this game I felt several emotions, one was of the nostaliga when JRPGs were the only real style of game I played. The second was a brief moment of confusion followed by a hurried google search and then a sort of amused feeling. I briefly thought the game had grabbed my RL name from here as it was linked to my FB account for naming ""Boy"" as I felt I'd end up naming him since that's typically the thing you do in these games and when it just jumped ahead and named him Joshua it freaked me out a bit, especially since as an avid harmonica player myself Joshua Bright was in fact playing harmonica. I'm already in love with the game for those two coincidences alone.10/10 Would quickly google the game's characters again. "

												Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a classic JRPG, it's graphics are dated and weren't all that impressive when the game was new. The battle system is right out of the old school, turn based, tactical style, which hasn't been in fashion for more than a decade. It's music is passable but its voice acting barely there at all. Added to which, it has one of the most extensive set of dialogue of any game made. Indeed the size of the script is almost daunting.So why do I recommend Trails as one of the best JRPGs ever made? Because it has one of the best set of characters ever to be put on the small screen. Because it has without doubt the best pacing of any JRPG story and because it is has the best written protagonists of this and most any other gaming genre. Estelle and Joshua Bright are the couple for whom you truly care. Across the course of their adventure you grow to care for them as if they were your own family and you end up desperate for them not only succeed in their adventure but to grow sufficiently that they are able to make that step from friends to lovers. For all that I ragged on the game for having old fashioned turn based combat it is true that if you like that sort of thing this is one of the best implemented systems you could hope to find. Taking many a cue from Final Fantasy VII the mixture of mako and limit breaks are here called Orbal Crystals and Craft Skills and they are, if anything, even better implemented here than in that game. You can build, within the limitations of each character's mechanisms, quite incredibly versatile magic flinging, fighting machines. Yes, Joshua has a distinct edge over most of the other characters but his back story give a good reason for this. Mentioning the back stories, almost the entirety of this large cast has one and they are well constructed, important in both shaping who these people are in their interactions with others but also shape them in terms of their combat styles and choices. Whether it is the sadistic, whip bearing Schera, the self-indulgent Oliver, or the Heavy-Bladed Agate, these and all the others whom you meet on your travels are perfectly written to be unique, enjoyable characters with whom you enjoy spending your time and miss when you leave them. However, it is with the two central character, the previously mentioned Estelle and Joshua Bright, that the story truly lives and breathes. They start off as two sixteen year olds, the girl and her adopted brother taking their exam to join the Bracers guild, which this Kingdoms mixture of police, monster hunters and citizens advice bureau. They pass this initial test only for their father, a very senior Bracer, to leave them on their own to go chasing down some major case, only to go missing. And so the scene is set for the pair to be slowly drawn deeper and deeper into a plot which eventually has the fate of the entire kingdom at stake. The pacing of this story is almost miraculous as it never seems forced but, rather, each step along the road from a bucolic rural setting with concomitantly small problems, to the finale in the capital city where the rescue of royalty and the foiling of  a coup, is utterly natural and an obvious extension of what has gone before. Hell, they even managed to work in a tournament arc (usually the bane of good story telling) without it feeling forced. This game is fun, funny, exciting, moving, compelling and leaves us on one of the biggest cliff-hangers you can imagine. Thankfully, the second chapter is supposed to be out sometime this year. I can't recommend this game highly enough. If it wasn't already clear I freaking love it and would urge anyone with any interest in JRPGs to buy it right now, if not sooner.  "

												+ Frankly stunning level of worldbuilding. Not only is the world you're stepping into built upon the solid foundation of a rich and fleshed-out lore, but everything that you'll encounter in-game is tended to with a similarly remarkable degree of attention to detail. There's no such thing as ""Villager F"" in Trails; every NPC has their own name, house, family and unique dialogue, and many of them you'll encounter more than once as you go about your travels, acting out their own, more mundane story arcs independent of your own. The in-game locations feel like more than quest hubs - they feel like proper towns, living, breathing and part of a wider, bigger world that ticks on by whether or not you're in it. And quite famously, every single chest in the game has a unique phrase that appears on examining it after you've looted its contents - while it's not on its own particularly impressive, it speaks to the sheer degree of love and care that's been poured into the game.+ Great cast of characters. Trails has a lot of strengths, but its single greatest one, the keystone without which it would all fall apart, is its cast, their relationships and their interactions; your emotional investment in them, and in their stories, is what makes the whole thing tick. And fortunately, its characters are strong enough for that to work - each is distinctive, and often even exaggerated and eccentric, yet all feel very human, sincere and believable at their core in a way that does a fantastic job of bringing them to life. From the foppish and frequently-hilarious Olivier, to the irresponsible yet ultimately warm-hearted Scherezard, to the magnificent duo of protagonists Estelle and Joshua, each is painstakingly built up and fleshed out as the game progresses, and even those who are recognisable as traditional JRPG tropes on their introduction reach the finish line as something more.+ Stellar translation. Unlike certain other localisation outlets (whom out of courtesy I'm not going to name, although I will say that the worst offender begins with ""N"" and ends with ""ippon Ichi Software America""), Carpe Fulgar have taken a great deal of care to preserve the spirit and character of the original dialogue, and their effort pays enormous dividends. Conversations which could easily have been cliche and tedious instead flow naturally, and are extraordinarily entertaining to read; the cast sling insults and good-natured jibes at each other with all the wit, precision and timing you'd expect from actual proper comedic writing, never mind from a translation. I'm being entirely serious when I say that this game is now the benchmark against which I judge all other localisations - it's that good.+ Outstanding soundtrack. I don't know how much Falcom pay their composers, but it's not enough; Trails's music is incredibly versatile, swinging from warm and comforting, to austere, to joyful, to mysterious, to inspiring and back again. It's bouncy and light-hearted most of the time, but calm and serene when it needs to be, and is fully capable of being serious if the occasion calls for it. It's easily one of the game's strongest features, and while it's difficult to convey how great it is through text I can't recommend enough that you tab on over to Youtube and go give it a listen.~ Combat is pretty laid-back. Provided you adhere to level-appropriate areas and sidequests, which is very difficult not to do because of the restrictive way that experience scales as you gain levels, you're not likely to have any significant difficulty until the final dungeon. Difficult encounters do exist, but you'll usually have to deliberately head into dungeons or take on bounty requests that you're underleveled for to find them. Additionally, every non-story encounter can be escaped from with 100% reliability, and every battle can be retried from starting conditions on loss - while again, that naturally means that you're better off looking elsewhere if you want a serious challenge, it also minimises the impact of sheer bad luck on the player, which is arguably a good thing. The combat system does have a depth well beyond what you're actually required to master, but I reiterate Trails is not the game to be playing if you want the gameplay to push you (that's what Ys is for). Although, in truth, that's really not what you play it for anyway.~ Pacing is extremely slow. Trails in the Sky cares far more about building up its setting and cast through everyday (or at least relatively mundane) interactions, and while that's obviously its own reward it's also the death of plot momentum. It's a lazy gondola ride of a game, and while there's no question that it gains focus in the latter chapters it still takes an extremely circuitous route to get there. You'll either love what it does or hate it, you'll find yourself either enthralled or bored, and there's not much that will be able to redeem it for you if you do find yourself in the latter camp. This is by no means an inherent negative, but it points directly to the question that's really going to decide if this is the game for you: are you willing to sit through a dozen distractions from the main questline if you can better get to know the characters by doing so? If not, you're probably going to find Trails a very frustrating experience, but if so then it's definitely worth your time.- Graphics are what you'd expect from a mid-00s JRPG on a conservative budget - that is to say, not much. Some nice backgrounds and environments stand out, but Trails always looked like it could run on a handheld, which is primarily because it originally did. It's certainly not awful, and it works well within its own limitations, but if you were expecting Final Fantasy XV you're going to be disappointed.- Optional content can be obscure to the point of absurdity. You're not acquiring the maximum possible Bracer points, completing all the available sidequests or collecting all the chapters of Carnelia without a guide. You're just not. If you enjoy the challenge, this could count as a positive, but doing it all without help would almost certainly require multiple playthroughs, a lot of experimentation and a healthy dose of just plain good fortune. The game is still a full experience without it, but it can be frustrating to be denied 100% completion because you didn't perform some obscure set of actions that no-one would ever have a reason to do.It has to be said that ultimately, with Trails in the Sky, you don’t get much originality for your money as far as JRPGs go. Most of what you’ll see here you’ll probably have encountered before, in some guise or another, in another game. What you do get, however, is Falcom’s magic touch that somehow elevates an experience that would probably be mundane and cliché in the hands of any other developer to something instead wholly human and believable. And in the end, that’s really what this game is, a traditional JRPG, but one that's executed really well. Its characters are mostly fairly recognisable tropes, but they’re recognisable tropes implemented with a touch of humanity that renders them far greater than the sum of their parts. Its OST isn’t particularly distinctive stylistically, but it’s a traditional OST that couldn't really have been pulled off any better. There isn’t even really anything particularly special about the world of Liberl, but what is there has been painstakingly crafted with love and care. Falcom have taken the traditional JRPG formula and maximised it, squeezing the best they can out of every single aspect. It’s most definitely not going to appeal to everyone, but if you’re in the market for a comfy-cosy JRPG that cares far more about breathing life into its vibrant cast and setting than about saving the world (although there’s just a little of that too), then you’re in for a treat with Trails in the Sky. And who knows? It might just win your heart while you're at it.			"

												The best part of this game is its writing. You should really take your time to read as much of the dialogues as you can, especially since the English translation is of a very high quality. Furthermore, every NPC changes their lines once a quest on the main story had been done, which sometimes is the way to get a hidden quest. Special mention for when you attempt to open a chest twice : since it'll be empty the 2nd time, you'll get plenty of humorous lines ;)The musics are good as well. I still have some of their melodies in my head now and then.The combats are ... ok. The main flaw is that you can't move and attack; it's one or the other. Too bad, because it could have improved their strategic side.All in all, I like this game very much. I’m impatient that its second chapter come to Steam.A game and a PC port well done, good job Nihon Falcom ! "

												What quite a number of people don't realize is that this game was originally released 2004 for the PSP and only made it's way to the west a couple of years ago. This is a game that was created during a time when RPG storytelling and combat was a fair bit slower paced and relaxed. It was also made by a company (Nihon Falcom) that's renowed for their dedication to old school JRPGs. Despite or even perhaps due to it's age i feel that it matches quite well with a number of games out there. If you're looking for a game to invest time with good story and a comparitively unique combat system (during 2004 anyway) then this a game you should consider.For those who like the game but seek faster paced and more intuitive combat and possess either a PsVita or PS3 i'd recommend Sen no Kiseki. AKA Trails of Cold Steel. it's a mix of Trails in the Sky's general combat system with a more advanced version of Fire Emblem Awakening's link system and Persona  series social links.			"

												This game has been a pleasant suprise for me. I bought it expecting very little and quite honestly it has turned out to be one of the best rpgs I have ever played.The one thing I fele a lot of great games lack right now is an adequate story. This game gives you that. Each character has his or her own backstory and intricate motivations that you learn more about as the story goes on and in a non-predictable way (except for one major thing). Everytime I left this game I found myself fighting the urge to not run back to my computer to see where the story would take me next. The combat system is finely tuned and well executed and except for a few moments rarely got dull for me. This game is pretty much 50% gameplay and 50% story. You'll find yourself reading text for sometimes long periods of time. If you just want a game in which you kill things and the story doesn't matter this game is not for you. Expect to be playing this for awhile to beat it around 35 hours is what it took  me to get through the entire game, but it was worth it.10/10			"

												It is very, VERY rare that I become so enamored with a game that I dedicate almost all my free time to playing it once I download it to my library.This game is a perfect example of that.Trails in the Sky (both FC and SC) is easily the best JRPG I have ever played, if not one of the best games I have played period. Between a wonderful story, a good soundtrack, a large number of side-quests, and a battle system that is both somewhat complex and simple at the same time, Trails in the Sky is a perfect game for newcomers to the genre and grizzled RPG veterans alike.10/10 - A gem among the JRPG genre.

												An epic adventure with a bitter conclusion, Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is the rare game in which the story is the deciding factor on why you continue to play. No game in recent history has had the pull on me like Trails in the Sky has.With that being said, the world building is fantastic, with its only weakness being that it does not use the environment to its advantage. Games with the best world building use their environment to tell their story, but Trails in the Sky tells its story through a well made narrative full of action, adventure, joy and sadness.The music is top notch, rivaling the best games in the genre. Very few developers can seamlessly tie in music into their narrative in such ways.The game itself was rather refreshing as well. The game offered very little reason for you to backtrack, while still giving you the option to do so, while also minimizing the amount of extra content you needed to do for those who were hooked on the engaging story.There is however lots of optional content to do, and you will want to do it all if you have any desire to get all of the achievements in this title. There is even a New Game+ option for those who may have missed things through the adventure.All in all, I would say that this is one of the top 5 ""Must play"" JRPGs on Steam and an excellent choice for first JRPG for people entering the genre.

												The Best Legend of Heroes Game Since Dragon Slayer on the Turbo CDOver the years, I have had some experience with several games in the Legend of Heroes series. My favorite, up until now, had been Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes for the CD version of the TurboGrafx-16. This was the first game in the series, although at that time, it wasn't a ""Legend of Heroes"" game, it was a ""Dragon Slayer"" game. This awesome RPG was one of the first Working Designs ports (Lunar and Vay, anyone?), and was well-translated and also had voice acting, pretty unheard of at the time. I loved it, even though I played it some 20 years later on an [electric banana]. The second game, Dragon Slayer: Legend of Heroes 2, was never translated into English, and therefore may as well be a piece of rotting sushi as far as I am concerned. At this time, the Legend of Heroes series truly formed with Legend of Heroes III: Shiroki Majo (known as Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch in the US.) Gone was the Dragon Slayer moniker, and unfortunately, much of what made it a good RPG. I have never played the original, only the PSP version, but it is as bland of a Dragon Quest rip-off as you can get. I can't fault the terrible translation, as I'm sure the original Japanese is great, but the gameplay was designed for a kindergartner. The other 2 ports in the Gagharv trilogy followed suit, LoH IV: Akai Shizuku (A Tear of Vermillion) and LoH V: Umi no Oriuta (Song of the Ocean) were both terrible for the same exact reasons.Then came LoH VI: Sora no Kiseki. I played it on the PSP first, charmed by it's surprisingly good localization, and it was an excellent diversion to the sub-human customers that patronize the liquor store I work at. The guild/jobs system is always fun, and the amount of optional secrets is what drives a really good JRPG. It was just missing one thing. It was only SLIGHTLY more difficult than the previous PSP games. I thought if only this had a decent strategic challenge like it's battle system teases, it could be brilliant. Then the PC version graced my life. With added difficulties of Hard and Nightmare, it was finally a Big Boy RPG, Hard being the highly recommended difficulty to play on (don't waste your time with the default difficulty.)Now the game has become a true masterpiece. Melding the verbose and insightful dialogue with a strategy nerd's dream battle system, the boss and optional battles are incredibly fun, and the random battles are no longer a joke. Olivier is one of the most amusing characters I have ever enjoyed playing as. He is a hedonistic, bi-sexual aristocrat that has really cheesy taste in music and will belt out some Jefferson Starship from time to time. I can't do service to how well the world is fleshed-out. There are hundreds of NPCs, and it really seems like every single one of them has their own personality. This is not easy to do.Taking a series that I regarded as largely pedestrian and bad, and turning it into a cult classic juggernaut, is nothing short of amazing. Credit and respect to everyone involved with making this slice of JRPG heaven.			"

												After endlessly searching for a good jrpg to play, I had a friend recommend this series. Needless to say he has created an insatiable thirst I now have for this entire series. The character and world building do take their time and the story may feel a bit sluggish at times but it's all worth seeing how the pieces to the puzzle fit together. The gameplay is classic tactics style set in a 3/4 isometric view comprised of both sprites and polygons. It's charming aesthetic lends very well to the gameplay and characters. You will begin to care about the influence each of these characters have on each other and their respective roles within the world itself. Even npcs have their own stories that add another layer of depth to the story for those that are interested. This game for me was like a fine book I couldn't put down after I began reading. I enjoyed every minute and look forward to the sequels.			"

The game has some awesome soundtrack as well.This game, for me at least, is a masterpiece and one of the best JRPGs I have played in a long time, it made me think like a bracer myself, to be Estelle in her journey, as she grows and learns how to use orbal arts, how she goes out of her way to explore her country and help its people, and develops her mind and character (that is, if you want to do every single quest in the game and get max bracer points).I enjoyed it, laughed with it, and cursed it when in nightmare difficulty in a no K.O run.

This is the first chapter of an excellent story of many emotions, with wonderfully fleshed out characters, solid game play, and of course, the freaking amazing soundtrack, which I bought soon after!I cannot recommend this game enough to those that enjoy JRPGs.

												      About a year ago, I bought a copy of Pier Solar and the Great Architects. I thought it looked amazing, and I especially liked the fact that it was a game that was showing my childhood console, the Sega Genesis, some much needed love. but after spending some time with it, I quickly found myself forcing myself to play Pier Solar. It became a great effort and inconvenience to just boot the game up. And the more I played it, the more I found myself not enjoying it. I thought maybe it was me. Maybe I had grown up to the point where the magic of JRPGs had worn off.     ThenI heard about a game called The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky. I knew the game had been out for a while on other platforms, but I never too the plunge, mostly because I never had the PSP, Vita, or PS3 to play them on. When I heard about this game being on Windows, I was extremely hesitant. I didn't want to be disapponted again. Praise be to Lord Gaben that this was far from the case.     This game takes me back to my childhood. Back to a day where games didn't have to have the flashiest graphics and gimmicks to sell. This is a game that rather than reinvent the wheel, it perfects it. This game made me feel like I was a kid playing 90s RPGs again. From it's gorgeous sprites and pixelated backgrounds to it's relatively simple yet engrossing story, this game checks all the right boxes and leaves no stone unturned in a stagnating market. If you like old school JRPGs and want to be taken back to the days of games like Wild Arms or Valkyrie Profile, if you enjoy turn based strategy RPGs, or just like well designed anime-style characters paired with well written dialogue, I highly suggest this game.

												It's funny how easy it is to write a review for games that you didn't enjoy and how hard it is to write them for games you loved.  This is a game that I loved! There was much to enjoy in this game for me from the writing of the main characters, to your traveling companions all the way down to the little wandering townspeople who's dialogue changes with the events of the story you can really tell that a lot of effort was put into the dialogue in this game.  It didn't give that feeling of bland lifelessness that many newer games do with their worlds that may be populated with many people, but they all say the same thing or are just simply filler objects with no dialogue whatsoever.  To put it simply, I found that I cared about the characters and that is something that is missing from the writing of so many games today.The story was engaging and filled with humour and suspense that has you pondering the various mysteries that are introduced throughout the plot and are resolved in a way that left me feeling both satisfied and ready to grab the next chapter in the series. The music wasn't heavely varied but was well placed and helped establish the atmosphere of the many locations you will visit with a few tunes being memorable.The battle system was fun and allowed for a variety of tactics without getting too bogged down in overcomplicated game mechanics.  The battles where fun and seemed to be designed in such a way as to offer a bit of challange without putting the player through the annoyance of having to constantly retry because you weren't using a tactic that was designed for that particular fight.  (I'm looking at you FFXIII >:|)Overall, the game was a long adventure that was filled with wonderful characters that I enjoyed and left me with pleasant memories.  I really do recommend this game for people that miss the well thought out RPGs that just don't seem to exist anymore.			"

												Wonderful game and story! It can be a little trope-y at times, but it's really fun and exciting to play through everything. Even more, the world feels like a real world and NPCs change their dialogue based on things happened alllll the time. The localization and translation effort was immense, and it turned out really really well! Dialogue is natural, and even with the tropey scenes at times, it's fun to keep up with what's going on. You do have some mysteries to tackle...Aside from the writing and the stellar plot, the battle mechanics are a lot of fun too. The fights take place on a grid system and weapons have reach and area in some instances. There are spell-casting times, so you can interrupt or run from them... assuming the enemy isn't just that fast. It's just an engaging system overall. As another bonus, you can see enemies on the map, avoid them, and eventually (if you want) become immune to bumping into 'em and thus avoiding all unnecessary fights. I definitely appreciated that convenience!It feels like you're getting into a grand adventure, and while the prologue chapter can be slow, it does deliver. There are also second and third games in the story; the second is also on steam already!			"

There is a 100% chance that I will purchase the sequels soon.Cons:-The combat animations are slower than I would have liked.-The overarching plot is predictable.-There is a lot of cheesy dialogue, especially in the early part of the game.Pros:-Grinding is quick and rewarding, but not necessary at any point.-Combat is well-balanced and difficulty progresses at the perfect pace.-Almost every NPC has a name and a narrative that continues to develop as the story progresses.-Lots to collect and complete (Bracer Points, Recipe Book, Monster Guide, quartz, equipment, books, newspapers, etc.)-Excellent soundtrackThere are also some recipes (most notably Apple Ice Cream) whose ingredients are sold in shops. The cost of the ingredients is less than price the cooked version sells for. This means that you can buy the ingredients, cook up to 99, then sell the finished product for a profit. Depending on the type of player you are, this could be a pro or a con.			"

												First off, if you hate detailed text crawls with well-written descriptions and dialogues, you will not like this game.If you hate interesting characters, intriguing plots, and interesting interactions, and just want explosions and characters dropping through the atmosphere to split the planet in half... you will not like this game.If you hate detailed sprite animations and anime style characters... you will not like this game.For everyone else, keep reading.THE SHORT: A great game with a diverse and beautiful world and intriguing lore, interesting characters, a well-crafted (if occasionally cliche) plot, and plenty available to keep one busy. The only caviats are that there is a metric butt-ton of text crawls with sparse VA work (though the base game is actually 13+ years old), and the combat can drag in places, but it more than makes up for that in character interactions. It may not be the most inspired or unique game, but it nails everything it needs to and rewards those that invest their time and energy into it with a story that few other games in the modern era can match.

												The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is an excellent strategy JRPG that I would recommend to any fan of JRPGs to try out!POSITIVES:+Great soundtrack+Battles are fun and never felt boring/repetitive+Interesting/unique cast of characters+Orbment system allows a great deal of customization for each character.  You can even have an entire team of spellcasters for one battle, or change it up to a traditional tank/spellcaster/melee formation whenever you want! The combination of orbments attached to a person will affect which artes/spells they can cast along with additional bonus effects (artes cast time reduction, %HP, etc)NEUTRAL:+/- There is a LOT of dialogue in this game which may be a negative if you do not enjoy reading.  However, it is well written and enjoyable to read (in my opinion)+/- The story progresses slowly in the beginning (prologue + chapter 1) but picks up its pace once you reach the 2nd chapterNEGATIVE:-Too many generic side-quests which interrupted the flow of the main storyline.  These side-quests are very time-sensitive, so if you're a completionist then you better finish them before they expire-Spells/artes felt overpowered halfway into the game (once you learn the stronger AOE damage artes).  At this point, it felt pointless to use regular strike and sometimes even craft skillsCan't wait for XSEED to release the 2nd chapter sequel! 8.5/10			"

												This is second best JRPG on steam. (the best being its sequel, Trails in the Sky SC)The story is fantastic, the soundtrack is amazing, the character customization is simple yet complex at the same time, the battle system is straightforward, but with a surprising amount of depth, there is a ridiculous amount of dialogue and backstory for just about every major and minor character. It's nearly perfect in every way.If you have any interest in JRPG's whatsoever, there is no reason not to buy this. It's 40-50 hours of pure JRPG joy. And when you're done beating the game, and enjoying it, then you can get another 70 hours out of its direct story sequel, Trails in the Sky SC. This is as good as it gets.			"

												I've only played and finished the PSP version, but I decided to give a try for this one too. So, for quick review :+ Good story (this is important)+ Fluid control, either with controller or keyboard and mouse+ High resolution with good 3D+ Pretty good voice acting- The texture kinda low at higher resolution. It's looks good on low-res display like PSP, or if you play it on TV. But on PC, usually people are barely one meter from monitor, sadly the texture looks blur.- This is subjective, but I do hope this has dual voice. Yes, I am aware with the lisencing issue. The English voice is good, but I still prefer the original voice especially Tita.Foods for thought :This is only the first part of a trilogy (Second Chapter and The Third), and so far, only First Chapter (this one) get translated. I really hope they'll release the english version for both SC and Third. Or else, you are stuck... like me ;_;.Based of what graphic card you have, you can override the setting from your graphic card control panel, so you can maximize the graphic. I have maximized the anti-aliasing, and now the 3D looks really smooth.So yeah, I recommended this game. Get it.			"

												What I can say about this amazing game. I already own the PSP version, and I had to buy the PC version just to support it. I didn't play the PSP version. But after waiting and waiting, I heard they're gonna re release this game on Steam. So by luck, I had to buy it. So good part about this game.Pros: If you love Lunar settings and Grandia somewhat battle system, you'll feel right at home. Pros: Amazing music. Some music repeats here and there, but it won't ruin it. It's fun to listen to it. A+Pros: The characters are amazing. They're not too ""Animelike"" But they're fun and great. Cons: The only bad thing I have to say about this game, the battle soometimes takes long time to finish. Not a bad thing, just takes a lot of time to beat. Final thoughts:  Lunar + Grandia = Legend Of Heroes. Great game. 8/10. A MUST HAVE!			"

												On par with the Golden Sun series for story and length, Trails in the Sky is an expansive rpg with Final Fantasy Tactics combat.  With a constant mix of usable characters, combat stays fresh and challenging.  The story builds upon the two main characters as they mature, using sarcasm, wit, drama, and comedy to full effect, keeping the story from growing dull.For those who were disappointed and bored by the repetitive Agarest, this game redeems the JRPG on Steam.  The only problem is that the sequel has not yet come out.And any time you have a reference to both Shakespeare and Dragon Ball Z in the same game...you should buy it.			"

Most of Critics give the story big score and I agree. I sobbed when I saw the end of story. Also given that this game is released 10 years ago first, the graphic is not so bad.

												History 	9/10 gameplay 	9/10 fights 		9/10 music 		8/10 graphics 	8/10 Well, Hello. This is the first review I make from a game, I never really had to do it, but I think the time has come. My favorite genere was always the JRPG genre, yes, I think a big fan of Final Fantasy (up to 9 after That not so much) For years I have searched for those games that had their heyday in the 90's during the era of PlayStation and PlayStation 2, I found some but something is missing. After almost giving up and then find this in many posts JRPG genre was dead found this gem. finally a game that keeps me glued to the story, a game, containing turn-based _fighting quite exciting too, random encounters pretty well balanced, and again made ​​me feel like part of the story. Many people think that graphics make a good game, I regret to say that at least for me, this does not affect, nor influenced in this game, the graphics from my point of view are excellent, the story and the game surrounds you so that Final Fantasy 13 looks like a nice movie and nothing more.

												History 	9/10 gameplay 	9/10 fights 		9/10 music 		8/10 graphics 	8/10 Well, Hello. This is the first review I make from a game, I never really had to do it, but I think the time has come. My favorite genere was always the JRPG genre, yes, I think a big fan of Final Fantasy (up to 9 after That not so much) For years I have searched for those games that had their heyday in the 90's during the era of PlayStation and PlayStation 2, I found some but something is missing. After almost giving up and then find this in many posts JRPG genre was dead found this gem. finally a game that keeps me glued to the story, a game, containing turn-based _fighting quite exciting too, random encounters pretty well balanced, and again made ​​me feel like part of the story. Many people think that graphics make a good game, I regret to say that at least for me, this does not affect, nor influenced in this game, the graphics from my point of view are excellent, the story and the game surrounds you so that Final Fantasy 13 looks like a nice movie and nothing more.

												This game looks like it belongs on the PS1, but not in a bad way. It reminds me of all the old RPGs I used to love as a kid and why I became so enamoured with Sony in the early 2000s. The characters are fun, the music is catchy, and the gameplay is rather addictive, especially for an old style JRPG like this.How much am I enjoying this? I got it and Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on the same day. So far I haven't gotten around to touching Witcher 3 and this game is the reason (mind you, I can't promise it'll stay that way once I do get around to trying Witcher 3).Pros:- Great soundtrack.- Good artwork and fun characters.- Very nostaligic feel for older gamers, especially people who were big into JRPGs around the late 90s to early 2000s.- Intuitive combat that feels engaging and encourages strategy.- Solid customization.- Cooking sidequest lets you learn how to make foods by tasting a sample of one, giving you a way of creating healing items outside of buying tons of the game's equivalent to 'healing potions'.- Bracer Guild missions are a great way to earn money, which is important as new weapons aren't cheap.Cons:- While combat is engaging, it can become a bit repetitive when you're fighting the same mob over and over again.- The characters are very anime-trope-y. Tomboyish girl with a heart of gold, mysterious boy with dark hair, older woman (yeah, 'older' by anime standards, she's 23) who uses a whip and apparently likes being 'in charge' as it were. I got a giggle out of it, but it can turn some off.- While encounters aren't random, its very easy to get ambushed by monsters on the map and get put into rough battles if you're not actively seeking out fights. Be ready to keep some healing items handy.NOTE:If you use the AMD Catalyst Control Center, it's overlay will actually ♥♥♥♥ with the game and make it bug out when you try to use a controller. I found that out the annoying way when it wouldn't let me use the menu at all. To fix this, just exit out of the Control Center before you start the game. Irritating, but a minor nusance at worst.Final Verdict: A good solid JRPG and a nostalgia trip for older gamers. If you grew up with games like Alundra, Chrono Cross, and the like then give it a go and enjoy feeling like you're a teenager again (... well, the good bits. Not the hormones, acne, and crippling social awkwardness bits).			"

												Amazing game! I spent 119 hrs on the first play through and I will go back for more with the Carry On into a harder difficulty. Is what RPGs should have after you finish them, a way to keep all you have achieved and not start again from scratch. Some of the things that I loved about it were the little details, like the battle music how it seamlessly changes depending on the situation, if the need is dire or status is normal. The availability of cooking over medicine when money is an issue. The magic system, every character is a fighter and they can deliver a decent amount of damage if equipped right. Some excel at something more than others, but gives you the freedom to choose what kind of magic/passives to equip them with. Loved the pretty graphics, reminds me of older RPGs and how they should make a comback.			"

												This game feels really nostalgic for me. This is classic JRPG gaming at it's best. All it is missing, really, is a fishing minigame.It's also nice that the dumb, strong, oblivious protaganist is a female. That doesn't happen very often!Buy this so XSEED brings over more of their franchises (Wild Arms, Shadow Hearts), and the other two parts of this series!			"

If you play JRPGs for worlds that feel complete and believable, with hundreds of little moments glueing the whole expierence together. If you like play JRPGs for the fun and joy over the drab and gimmick. Then this game is awesome. It is a JRPG that stands among giants.			"

												First of all, I have been a JRPG since I could remember.I started playing Secret of Mana ever since I was a kid on the SNES and it's been a wild ride since then.Fast forward to today, where I will be writing my first review EVER.I was certainly persuaded to write a review for this game for you people on the fence, as well as to support this game's company for their localization efforts.The Legends of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is what you'd term a ""classic"" JRPG.I don't really want to delve into the story too much because that would be spoiling it, but it is an amazing ride.The game is designed to be completed as a ""Trilogy"" so knowing that, you can see the huge emphasis on character development.It definitely shows.Each character has their unique backstory, as well as traits and ""things"" going on in their own life that makes the game very engaging. The battle system is interesting, though not truly unique. For you FF fans, it's like modified ATB where you can jump positions based on your actions.The story itself is a great ride. It starts off slowly, and builds up, just like any game really does, but the main selling point of this game in my opinion is the development of the 2 main characters.If you haven't really decided yet, please go ahead and buy it. Support this effort and you will not go unrewarded.I am already anxiously awaiting Chapter 2 of this game, and rest assured that when it is finally announced on Steam, I will be pre purchasing it.It has been out on PSP for a while now, but since I don't own a PSP, I did not know of this.It has been one of the best JRPG's I have played in a long long long time.I would definitely put this up there among the list for consideration of games that I truly enjoy.

												This game is fantastic!  The characters are memorable, late game strategy is fairly complex and there's no lack of challenge at higher levels.  I love the story, and I can't wait for the next installments.  If you enjoyed Xenosaga/Xenogears or some of the earlier final fantasy installments you're going to love this game.  Best features: - Characters all play very differently.  The story gives you plenty of time to learn each character's strengths and weaknesses, and while you cannot control your party until the end of the game (for truly legitimate storyline reasons), once you have that control you can put together some really interesting dynamics for the end game.  Teamwork is important, and many characters have skills that allow them to function in multiple roles without breaking away from their overall archetype.  - Deep and engaging storyline.  For a first chapter I'm really excited to see what happens next.  The initial story is fairly self contained, but the characters are developed just enough to give them true depth without revealing everything about them.  It seems clear that the next installments will expand on each character, and I honestly can't wait to see it.  The bad guys are developed in a similar manner as well, and there are already indications that some of them will be returning in the sequels.  Character motivations are unambiguous (except for when they need to be), and personal conflicts are well defined.  - Unique skills are awesome!  Individual character skills are highly accessible, very powerful when used properly, and thematic to each character.  A full party can shift gears from offense to defense at just about any time with these skills, and the enemies are vicious enough to reward both aggressive and conservative playstyles when necessary.  - Very Limited level grinding.  XP received is based on your character level.  If you're below level for an area you will gain levels very quickly.  If you're overpowered for an area you will gain levels extremely slowly.  As such, you will quickly rise to the appropriate level for a given area until it's time to move on.  Areas that need improvement: - Itemization is dull.  There are only a few game changing pieces of equipment.  Most are just currency sinks that keep you in line with the enemies' power curve.  In most cases characters will upgrade automatically (aside from the two main characters).  It would've been nice to see more variety in the gear.  - You can miss out on sidequests.  If you're not careful you'll bypass a lot of hidden quests, or if you advance the story line too quickly you'll lose access to some quests forever.  There's no real reason for this other than ""time constraints.""  The only benefit of this system is that you can't really overpower the sidequests, but for completionists it's a pain.  - Magic feels underpowered.  For the most part you won't really need to use magic aside from healing.  At low levels you don't really have enough MP to build a dedicated mage, and at higher levels it's difficult to stack quartz in a way that really maximizes the power of magic since the quartz that boosts magic damage is blue, and blue is primarily for healing magics that heal for a fixed amount and are not based on your magic stat.  Since you need to stack the same color to gain access to the most powerful spells, the system seems to work against itself as a result.  Magic is used in a few very specific circumstances, but any character can do the job for the most part.  Overall: 9.5/10.  The games flaws are minor and nitpicky.  It's strengths are glorious.  This game is worth every cent.			"

												This review is more for myself than anything game related. Basically since I can't do anything more at the moment to support this game, like buying the sequel which I will do as soon as it's available, I'll promote this release best I can. Hopefully the fact that I've never bothered to write a review before lends some insight into how I felt about the game after finishing it. There's some vague spoilers at the very end. Prefacing this by the fact I haven't invested time into a lengthy ( > 10 hours) single player game for 5~ years. I had a week before heading back to university and had a crazy urge to hit up some Skies of Arcadia or Tales of Symphonia, childhood era games that I felt were the absolute best in the JRPG genre. Due to convenience and timing of its release on Steam, settled for Trails in the Sky instead. There are plenty of reviews on gameplay and the story telling aspect. But it's like a JRPG version of Metal Gear Solid 4, dialogue and gameplay seem pretty even. Realistically you'll spend much more time controlling characters than reading text however so don't get discouraged, it's not a $20 movie. Without going into depth gameplay is good, two small gripes though.  1) You can never really dictate who is in your party until the last four hours or so of gameplay. You always have Joshua and Estelle (both completely capable in every regard) and the others sort of hop in and out of your party until the big get together at the end of the game.2) The grid for determining ""artes"" (magic and w/e) felt a little limited. There's a ton of options but it's not as in depth as I would have prefered. A couple characters, not all, but some are clearly intended to play certain roles. The last half hour of gameplay is why this review is being written. Others have said most of the game feels slow paced, which is somewhat fair to say. The majority of the game is scripted and some events almost felt predictable, but the story throughout continually builds on itself. This is to say it was never boring and I never got the feeling of ""let's skip all the small things and just finish this game, I'm tired of it"". Overall though it's a typical travel from town to town stopping the crisis type of story. But you defeat the final boss, and a couple things happen:Cutscene 1: You regain control of your characters, everyones happy, generic celebratory atmosphere. Run around for a bit, then the party splits up temporarily. One character is hit with a huge realization, like explaining all the questions you ever wanted to know about that character type realization. Immediately sets up the foundation for the sequel. No other party members witness this event however.Cutscene 2: Back to the celebratory atmosphere, different setting though. This time you're in control of only one character, the rest of the party is split up relaxing and whatever. As that one character you can talk to the other party members and some of them mention some more facts that would have been great to know about sooner about the character who just went through some serious development in the previous ""cutscene"". The character you control runs into the other one and in about three minutes of text you are left with a huge cliffhanger and immense dissapointment the sequel isn't on Steam yet.			"

												I got to say I love this game. The story is enticing and the interactions between the various characters is fantastic. Their colorful personalities and sometimes hilarious conversations really suck you into the story. The artwork is gorgeous and the soundtrack is very nice. All the beautiful character artwork makes it feel more like your playing an interactive anime story instead of any old JRPG at times. The combat system took a little getting used to but its not overly demanding. Its been a long time since I've so enjoyed an RPG game.The only minor issue I have with this game is the rotatable camera. It sometimes makes it very easy to miss certain things because they just happen to be outside your field of vision, depending on how the camera is rotated. And it also throws off your sense of direction at times. Other then that id rank this game very highly. And at its current price its an absolute steal.In conclusion, If you like JRPG games, or just plain RPG games with a good story and colorful characters, then you must not miss this one. Screw Final Fantasy, I'd take this game over that one anyday.			"

												Alright where should I begin with this little, understament of the century, game? Let's start off with the one part that I simply adored: the story. In this day and age every one in a while we get a game that has a story plot that not only hooks us, but makes us begging to want more as we play through the game, this game has that characteristic and after beating it I have only one thing on my mind: WHEN THE HELL IS THE NEXT CHAPTER GOING TO COME OUT?! Bottom line storyline is addicting. As for the gameplay it was interesting enough and as for the custimization in the game for your characters' spell sets is unique at best. Now is the game worth twenty bucks for all this? Yes, yes it is simply for the story alone you will not be dissatisfied with what this game gives you I promise you that.Also one final thing I would like to say whether they be spoilers or not: F*ck Professor Alba and for all he stands for. That is all.			"

												I am not really a JRPG person. Does Fire Emblem Awakening count as a JRPG? If it doesn't, I believe the most recent one I played is Phantasy Star IV on an emulator. Other than that, I've primarily been acquainted with WRPGs.But this game is great. As of the time I write this, It strikes a delicate balance between modern and classic RPGs. In terms of being player friendly, it is neither hand-holding or frustratingly cryptic. The graphics are outdated but pleasant, a good mesh of 3D and 2D and character portraits with a wide range of expressions (something I always appreciated since FE). The battle system calls for no mastery of strategy, but it's always satisfying to nuke a horde of enemies with a big fat AoE.So far I spoke only of how this game might be acceptable. Why do I like it so much? The story, my dear boy, the story.By story, I mean everything from the background of the world, to characterization, the plot, and how it's all presented. The steampunk-ish world where there are monarchs, airships, and magic goes between almost idyllic and gut-wrenching (in a good way) as events unfold. All the NPCs you meet have their own lives, and although it may be just a few lines, they change over the course of a chapter so you can see how their stories progress. The plot constantly piques your curiosity, but is not overbearing and feels natural, thanks to the focus on the main characters meshing beautifully with the standard secret conspiracy/shocking reveal fare of JRPGs. You'll grow to like them and care about them, and see things unfold from their perspective. Witty dialogue from a hardworking localization team certainly helps as well. In retrospect, you might be able to play 'spot the cliches', but the game manages to make it immersive and engaging.Oh, and the music's great too. More focus on chill than epic, but that's how the game rolls.So I think you should buy this game, worth full price, and if you're too poor for that do buy it when it's on sale.			"

												This has been the first game I've played in a very, very long time I've so thoroughly enjoyed that it shocked me.The story and characters are incredibly strong, and playing through it, I even felt inclined to speak to minor characters because with each new development, every character changes. The story took me a great deal of time to complete, something I really enjoy in an RPG, though some may disagree. The gameplay insofar as combat is very enjoyable, but not super-hard (at least, not when I played through it. I didn't ever grind throughout the story and managed to complete it without losing).I'm not great at talking about things for long periods of time, but I rarely ever review games, and I felt inclined to review this one due to how much I enjoyed it.If you're a fan of JRPGs, just buy this one. I'm confident you'll enjoy it.			"

												Freaking awesome!!! So damn immersed in the story line, each character has their own personality, almost as if you are living in the world of Liberl~ Praise the scriptwriter and artist for character devepment, each line written are given deep thoughts and meaningful to the story progress. The side quests are very much interesting to do, i tried to do every quest but when i reach Zeiss, the story was so intense I'd forget to done any of them. The world of Liberl is not that big but it is fun to explore every inch of the world, speaking to every NPC which each have their own story and easter eggs. I am ery much impressed in the progression of the story line and the plot-twist, although this game has been out for quite a while already, it really is worth to buy it for the story line if you will. The only flaw I would like to complain is that the character usually miss their attack too much (Not sure just me or happen to everyone) If you like good story line with turn-base system and well done character art, this is the game for you. Definitely worth the money if you ask meEdit: with the condition that you have the patience to read all the dialogue, coz after seeing many negative review this seem to them to be a big problem. But if you are will to give some time into reading it, you will find the story to be more interesting.			"

												This is a great jRPG right here, it’s solid with a nice battle system and has a good story, but let’s start from the beginning:The Legend of Heroes - Trails in the Sky (aka Sora no Kiseki FC (First Chapter)) is part of a trilogy and it’s a “huge” adventure of 3 games. kinda like Shining Force 3, Xenosaga, Suikoden, etc except without decisions of one scenario carrying over to the other scenario, just a couple of things carry over and they aren’t important nor game-changing at all.(As of the time of this review, the second (SC) and third game haven’t been released yet on Steam.)So… how does Falcom accomplishes this? By making the game’s plot very slow at the start! You may find the first 10~15 hours of this game quite boring (it’s mostly about ‘becoming a Bracer’ and several “mini-adventures” which are the non-optional quests that enable you to progress through the game), but after that the game gradually starts to shine and becomes a great game with great characters and a great non-cliché plot (the final chapter of this game is AMAZING and very story-driven). Also, the game takes the biggest time possible to reveal the background of one of the main characters, which is a bummer if you’re particularly curious about him like I was. Anyway, the game ends up being a great 40~60 hour jRPG that has a nice battle system with some challenging fights and enough things to grind for to get more spells.The soundtrack is good, some songs are awesome. Even though it has one of the most ""less good"" main battle themes i've ever heard in a jRPG, in general the soundtrack is good despite that.The graphics are ‘nice’, well, this is a Remastered version of the original PC game with the extras of the PSP version AND the assets of the Remastered PSN version. The game looks GREAT on a HDTV at 1080p. But the game (and franchise) is quite old, so you can’t expect triple A graphics. Even though it can be considered quite “Sora no Kiseki” (miracle(s) of the sky) considering the original state of the original PC version. Devs had to mess with very old code and re-adjust many things. That is commendable.And since it was originally a PC game, it’s fully playable with a mouse and keyboard besides perfect controller support, another plus.If you actually know how to give a chance to jRPGs, are patient enough and don’t mind over great graphics too much, this is the game for you.

												This game looks like it belongs on the PS1, but not in a bad way. It reminds me of all the old RPGs I used to love as a kid and why I became so enamoured with Sony in the early 2000s. The characters are fun, the music is catchy, and the gameplay is rather addictive, especially for an old style JRPG like this.How much am I enjoying this? I got it and Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on the same day. So far I haven't gotten around to touching Witcher 3 and this game is the reason (mind you, I can't promise it'll stay that way once I do get around to trying Witcher 3).Pros:- Great soundtrack.- Good artwork and fun characters.- Very nostaligic feel for older gamers, especially people who were big into JRPGs around the late 90s to early 2000s.- Intuitive combat that feels engaging and encourages strategy.- Solid customization.- Cooking sidequest lets you learn how to make foods by tasting a sample of one, giving you a way of creating healing items outside of buying tons of the game's equivalent to 'healing potions'.- Bracer Guild missions are a great way to earn money, which is important as new weapons aren't cheap.Cons:- While combat is engaging, it can become a bit repetitive when you're fighting the same mob over and over again.- The characters are very anime-trope-y. Tomboyish girl with a heart of gold, mysterious boy with dark hair, older woman (yeah, 'older' by anime standards, she's 23) who uses a whip and apparently likes being 'in charge' as it were. I got a giggle out of it, but it can turn some off.- While encounters aren't random, its very easy to get ambushed by monsters on the map and get put into rough battles if you're not actively seeking out fights. Be ready to keep some healing items handy.NOTE:If you use the AMD Catalyst Control Center, it's overlay will actually ♥♥♥♥ with the game and make it bug out when you try to use a controller. I found that out the annoying way when it wouldn't let me use the menu at all. To fix this, just exit out of the Control Center before you start the game. Irritating, but a minor nusance at worst.Final Verdict: A good solid JRPG and a nostalgia trip for older gamers. If you grew up with games like Alundra, Chrono Cross, and the like then give it a go and enjoy feeling like you're a teenager again (... well, the good bits. Not the hormones, acne, and crippling social awkwardness bits).			"

												Without a doubt one of the best rpg's I've ever played. The characters all have depth and personality, the story is amazing, and the overall feel is just perfect.I also love the battle system (reminds me of 'Arc the Lad', but on a small scale and smoother). I also love the mouse support for this game. You can literally play the whole game with one hand if you wanted. One of the best games ever made. I'm really looking forward to the rest of the series being ported to steam  :)			"

												SHORT VERSION: If you like games with well-crafted lore and setting, lovable characters and excellent attention to detail as well as world-building, this game is definitely for you. While it may start out slow, it's because it takes it's time to build up, and in the end it will be all worth it.________________________________________________________________________________Have you ever felt nostalgia for something that you haven't played yet? This was what I felt when I started playing Trails in the Sky. Made by Falcom back in 2005, Trails in the Sky tells the story of a plucky young tomboy named Estelle, and her adopted brother Joshua, as they take on the role of junior members of the Bracer Guild, a group that undertakes tasks and requests to protect civilians and maintain the stability of their country, the Liberl Kingdom.The story itself is very well presented, and is really something that modern JRPGs lack. The characters themselves are likable, with humorous banter, good one-liners and engaging dialogue when push comes to shove. The amount of foreshadowing is insane, having the subtlest detail early on in the story developing and playing a huge role later on. While it starts out fairly tame, with a bit of a slice-of-life atmosphere as you take on various sidequests from the Bracer Guild, it slowly becomes evident that something is happening within the kingdom, as numerous incidence and weird coincidences occur starting from an airship hi-jacking, which escalates into a full-scale conspiracy. The feel itself is reminiscent of late 90s to early 00s JRPGs like Suikoden and Xenogears, as the developers themselves wrote the story for years before they could even make it into the game, making sure that no plotholes or sudden asspulls happen in the story. There is focus on world building too, as there are various notes and NPCs in the game that shed some light into the history of the Liberl Kingdom, from political structure, history of the royal family, political events and relations with its neighboring countries, as well as regional customs. This can also be seen in reading the Liberl News issues, an in-game newspaper that can be bought and will not only shed light on recent major events that your characters have partaken in, but also show off backgrounds of places and traditions in the kingdom.The gameplay involves traditional turn based JRPG action with a bit of tactical movement thrown in with the use of movements in grids and heavy emphasis on turn order manipulation. Its a relatively simple formula, but becomes interesting as you gain more skills that work with turn order. Unlike most JRPGs before, status effects are actually good in this game and is key to making short of hard to kill enemies and/or bosses. The skill system has a bit of depth in it, promoting mixing and testing different combinations of gems (or Quartz in this game) that results in different skills.Exploration is open-ended. While the game doesn't have a full world map and eschews for interconnected highways and roads like Final Fantasy X, the game encourages players to explore areas that are available to the from the get-go, which rewards players with good equipment, good leveling spots and sidequests. Sidequests in this game are entertaining, as they're not just fetch quests or eliminating X numbers of monsters, but rather involve bit of investigation and decision making for full reward. This, coupled with the characters throwing witty dialogue makes sidequests fun to do and not feel soulless or seem like padding.As with all Falcom games, Trails in the Sky excels in the music department. The musical score ranges from a jazzy battle theme and upbeat field music, to relaxing seaside themes and orchestra. The selection makes every scene count and fits right in whether it be a sentimental one or while traversing along the highroads. Just the opening theme itself gives the player of what to expect from the game, starting slow and steady and slowly making its way to an epic orchestra.As far as it goes, Trails in the Sky is one of those games that I really really want to promote, its a very under appreciated and niche gem, made with a lot of heart as well as attention to detail and good story telling. With a good amount of drama, mixed with political intrigue and with a dash of humor, Trails in the Sky is a game that harkens back to the days of quality JRPGs.			"

												An absolutely fantastic JRPG title, despite its severe age. While it says the Release Date is 2014, in truth the title was initially released in Japan in 2004.One thing that caught me by surprise was the fact that there is no tag for Female Protagonist. While you can re-order your characters so that random events no longer revolve around Estelle, this will not change the fact that there are dialogue events where Estelle is the only controllable character. I suppose because you can have up to four characters you control in combat, this isn't really comparable to Tomb Raider for example. However, this doesn't change the fact that the story revolves around Estelle and she is considered the Player Character.But don't let this deter you. I was initially confused as well but I quickly found the change to be enjoyable, as it makes things pretty different and the reactions between Estelle and her friends, which you normally wouldn't see as a male PC, is really funny and cute. People who absolutely cannot stand it though can always just self-insert as Joshua or something, which is the other protagonist.On Nightmare difficulty, which made the game hell (please do not pick Nightmare, this was a colossal mistake), I've easily sunk 100 hours into this game. While it seems like picking Nightmare will give you more bang for your buck, it is a severe mistake to make if you're not playing on New Game Plus with previous playthrough equipemnt at the least. The game is basically luck-based from Prologue to Chapter 2, as you lack spells that I've discovered are 100% essential to surviving *any* fight you don't outlevel in Nightmare, such as Earth Wall, Chaos Brand, Hell Gate, Shadow Spear, La Teara...I say it's ""luck based"", but be aware there is an offset option. This makes it so that every time you hit Retry, the difficulty of the encounter is slightly reduced. This does not change casting spells or anything, this is just a flat stat reduction, but be aware that higher difficulties are just plain stat increases to begin with. There are no additional mechanics, nor do the monsters gain additional levels which grant them superior spells, it's just they have more speed, more damage, more health, and it means that if you don't strategize ahead very well, two consecutive hits on one of your designated casters will end them. In Chapter 4, for the record, that's one hit. But by then you have the right characters and the right Quartz to be able to outmaneuver the AI.So I enjoyed Nightmare difficulty in the latter chapters, but not so in the earlier ones. I strongly urge to play Normal or Hard, and only in your second playthrough (New Game Plus) play on Nightmare, and with it import your Quartz and equipment. Without those high level Quartz that grant you access to key spells, I found it flatly impossible to win some encounters until after I lost a few times and their stats lowered.All in all, it is a very rich story, I laughed a *lot*, and it had me hooked all the way to its flabbergasting cliffhanger ending which is forcing me to consider ending my re-run and playing Trails in the Sky SC immediately. This is a *must* play for any JRPG fan, and I recommend it as a great way to introduce yourself to the JRPG medium for non-JRPG players.One last thing: It is best to inform you beforehand that there is something called BP, which is a reward for quests. Only *ten* or so dialogue choices in, I realized that I have been losing BP. This didn't really concern me, as I already failed some quests I didn't attend to in time, but it did annoy me as I thought dialogue choices were just a personality thing. For example, the first one that affects your BP is a choice between charging in alone or waiting for your team. I thought the realistic thing of a newbie girl is to just charge in bravely, but this apparently deducted BP from me.Additionally, the way you handle some parts of some quests is not clear and will reduce your BP if you are unaware of it. For example, a monster you are hunting might run away if you approach it from the front, and if it runs away you will lose BP.While I *strongly* urge to NOT use a walkthrough in your first playthrough as it is an abysmal thing that will ruin your experience if you ask me, I do urge finding some BP guide that will abstractly inform you of things you should avoid doing or make sure to do as you play through the game. I am now playing a second run to max out my BP. The reason this is important is because you gain notable benefits and NPC conversation changes if you finish certain quests (or fail to do so) and whether or not you hit max BP or not. So I'm replaying the game with a walkthrough before I continue on to SC.But again, I will strongly urge to avoid actual walkthroughs. Search online for some BP checklist, unless you're okay with not receiving these benefits in the next game (it comes down from what I've read to an important Quartz you can only otherwise gain in the late lategame) or you're fine with doing a second playthrough like me.

												Freaking awesome!!! So damn immersed in the story line, each character has their own personality, almost as if you are living in the world of Liberl~ Praise the scriptwriter and artist for character devepment, each line written are given deep thoughts and meaningful to the story progress. The side quests are very much interesting to do, i tried to do every quest but when i reach Zeiss, the story was so intense I'd forget to done any of them. The world of Liberl is not that big but it is fun to explore every inch of the world, speaking to every NPC which each have their own story and easter eggs. I am ery much impressed in the progression of the story line and the plot-twist, although this game has been out for quite a while already, it really is worth to buy it for the story line if you will. The only flaw I would like to complain is that the character usually miss their attack too much (Not sure just me or happen to everyone) If you like good story line with turn-base system and well done character art, this is the game for you. Definitely worth the money if you ask meEdit: with the condition that you have the patience to read all the dialogue, coz after seeing many negative review this seem to them to be a big problem. But if you are will to give some time into reading it, you will find the story to be more interesting.			"

												I'm going to get this out of the way now - The Trails series is NOT for everyone. HOWEVER - if you enjoy a game that takes its time, actually builds up all of the characters (even the NPCs) and has a world with rich lore/history behind it - this is the series for you. While Trails in the Sky is a MASSIVE slow burn (It really doesn't feel like it 'picks up' story wise until about 70% of the way through) - but after it's over, you'll realize that everything that happened in the game DID matter.While the graphics are nothing groundbreaking, i think they fit the game just fine (and the HD for the steam version is great compared to the PSP) - and the gameplay i feel is top notch.If you're intersted in a more traditional JRPG with a ton of dialogue, memorable characters and story, and fantastic world-building - you won't find better.

												I love this game! It has fun and snarky dialogue, cute characters, an actual plot and an ""epic"" quest. It reminds me of rune factory and maybe pokemon, except you get to ""kill"" the monsters and you don't have to do farm work (only 1 quest). Saving the game often is key to success, especially if you are an achievement junkie. All in all I like this game, and I will definitely try the sequel as well, however downside: - They make a huge deal out of introducing rest stops, where you can rest in dungeons and get all your health back. There are maybe 5 or 6 of these in the entire game o0 Totally worthless, better of with food and healing salves. - Supposedly the lamp posts along the road are for keeping monsters away, lies! monsters are in the road constantly. So if you are in a rush and don't want to fight every single thing in the forest zig zag!- If you don't sell sepiths you'll be broke for a long time. For the first couple of chapters the mira (money) rewards are really low, and buying gear takes a long time. - The prices for stuff is way out there, salves are hideously expensive and most of your reward money will probably be spent on healing. - The maps in the game are annoying and for the most part useless. You'll be getting lost a lot! - The quartz are really badly explained, even if you put the same quarts on each of your team members they'll not have the same art abilities or the same stats on their art abilities. - camera rotating, not a success. Upside:- The cooking in the game is cool, eating stuff gives you the recipe. And a lot of monsters drop ingredients. - Sit down meals are a cool concept making you feel like you are in SAO :P Heals your entire group. - You can finish a quest before picking it up, which is nice. If you kill a roadside monster, before you pick up the quest no problem. Pick up quest and turn it in straight away. - Most of the cut scenes are actually interesting.- A lot of different accessories and stuff- You can actually read the books  you pick up, which is always cool.- Unlimited bag space, you can carry anything around!- Quarts system and the battle system is well thought out.

So I am going to buy it today and i am going to play this and have fun doing so.It Has a Great story From what I played its assets are awsome and the combat is smooth but I only have on issue and that is some times I cannot find the missions for the guild and they end up being fails but notto worry i just reload or restart till i find them. If i was to rate this it would be 9/10 which is very high in my books for jut playing the game up to the second town; but it while worth it and deserves it.			"

												Take the thumbs up iwht a pinch of salt. The game is ok, but nothing special. I'm 6 hours in, but it feels like a lot longer than that, and not in a good way.The tediousness of play comes down to things like unnessesary back-tracking, forced into fights against weak enemies that can't even hurt you, and the cost of getting caught off-guard (as opposed to apre-emptive fight) is fighting more enemies. I only really get caught off-guard when I'm trying to rush through, because the fights are boring, so being made to fight more enemies exacerbates this problem.If you're a super hardcore JRPG fan, you might enjoy it more than me.

												This game starts off with a slow burn but gets really good later on. The cast is memorable with all their own quirks. The story will keep you coming back until you finish it. The characters are fleshed out and you get emotionally attached to them through their plight. The banter between Estelle and Joshua is hilarious.I was surprised at how good the story was. One of the best JRPG's in a very long time. The ""I'm not crying, there's something in my eye award"" sums it up nicely.			"

												One of the best RPG's i ever played. A bit outdated graphic, but very nice characters and storyline. You can literally play a whole day without even getting the slightest bit bored. Most of the Plot-Tiwsts aren't obvious and well included. And of course the time to finish this game can easily hit the 50 hour mark and that wihtout clearing all secrets.			"

												My first JRPG, and boy, what an experience. This single game has prompted me to not only buy the sequel, but also add tons of other JRPGs on my wishlist. If you're considering getting this, but not sure, here's what you will get with this game: Great story, memorable characters, excellent writing and dialogues, entertaining gameplay, nice music and many hours of your weekend lost in this un-put-downable game.

												Just started playing this game recently, and have been quite impressed with the in-depth storyline, gameplay, and one thing that makes or breaks a game for me, the music.  As a story-driven RPG game, I think that Trails in the Sky, although you follow a story, the freedom given to do other things is not unlike other games like Fable, etc., although I do not know if changing approaches to quests will change the outcome of the ending yet.  Gameplay is interesting, yet it makes sense, and I thought was easy to learn and catch on.  And for me, the background music of a game is extremely important, and as soon as I watched the first cutscene, I knew that the music would be good.  8.5/10 definitely recommended!			"

												This is a great jrpg with a huge map npc with dialogue that changes every certain points, empty chest jokes, all npc has different names, plot with good progression, oh and you can fish if i remember correctly there's a spot where i spent hours cause it's the only time in the story where you can fish, there's also lots of choices and secrets that encourage replay, i played the original jp pc release, the psp jp/en, and now this and still waiting for the later parts to be localized. Been waiting for this for a long time, thanks xseed (finally winter 2013 and summer 2014 is over, wonder when early 2017 will end). Looking forward to the third chapter and if possible the rest of the series.			"

												This was one of the best JRPGs on the PSP.The localization is incredibly witty and the story does a great job of stringing you along with a nice organic plot that isn't some ""you're the hero"" cliche.  The game does use plenty of tropes, but the writing keeps them feeling fresh all the way through.  It has turn-based combat, with a bit of positioning involvement.  And the CP system is a pretty neat way of making you choose whether to save your points for massive attacks or use them on smaller special attacks, when the big attacks would just be overkill.  Also, every character has a decent amount of customization of their spells and whatnot through the orb system.The PC version so far has some pretty glaring bugs, but looking at the Hub page, the developers seem to be updating to fix them as quickly as possible.  This game, also, is merely the first part of an overarching story, and ends on a bit of a cliffhanger.  I'm rebuying this game here, mostly so that I can help fund the localization of the second game, coming sometime next year.  There is apparently some added content also, but I haven't read too much about it yet.  And yes, I plowed through the game, and it did take a good 40+ hours.  I don't think I did everything, but I did as much side content as I noticed.  With the new achievements, that time could get stretched much further if you're into that sort of thing.			"

												A MUST have for fans of JRPGs, or RPGs in general. This game is the begining of the ""Trails"" series (or Kiseki in Japan), and having played each game up to date, I can say that this serves as the first step in one of the greatest stories I have ever seen in any medium. The story is the meat and potatoes of the game, but it also has an excellent battle system that will keep players engaged, and forcing them to come up with strategies on the fly. There is plenty to do and plenty to explore, with NPC dialog constatnly changing as the story moves forward. Going back to talk to NPCs is well worth your time. Music is top notch, as always when done by the Falcom Sound Team JDK.Be warned though, the game starts slow. If you can get by the start, you are in for one hell of a ride. Again, this is the first part of a fantastic series, take the dive into Trails in The Sky, and you will be happy you did.			"

												First Impressions are good. The cutscenes are a really tribute to JRPG style games and they do the game justice. I used to play a lot of games like Grandia, Suikoden etc when I was younger, and its a shame that Europe misses out on a great deal of these great titles.Ive had problems using an Xbox controller on this as the button config is rather limited. Also I had issues of crashing when buying from shops, or cutscenes not playing properly due to graphic settings. Solutions to these are on the discussion boards, and once you've got these settled the game runs fine.Combat is pretty straight forward, with a turn based action setting that pauses combat whilst you decide on what you want to do. Some cool elements include random power-ups throughout the battle, which can heal, or boost the attacking power of your characters. I will add further details as I find them			"

												Heyyo, I love this JRPG! The story is alright, the combat is good and the leveling system works great. It's not heavy on grinding... albeit there's enemies every 15 feet but the game keeps a steady pace on leveling so the effect of trying to grind for lots of extra exp starts to trail off if the game figures you're a good enough level to get through your current section. It's quite traditional in the way the turn-based combat works, but simplifies it for basic attacks which helps with pushing through some of the weaker enemies you'll fight.The music is very well done, the 3d backgrounds with 2d character sprites is a neat combination that works very well! The sound effects are alright and there isn't voice acting unless you count the few words used when casting spells or using craft attacks.Craft Points are is the limit-break system employed in this game. You gain CP by getting hit and dealing damage. After 100 CP you can activate your limit-break at any time, or you can use CP for boosts or attacks via the ""Craft"" menu during combat which uses varying amounts of CP... it's really handy when you're trying to reserve your EP (mana) for battles or for healing.The only big downside to this game that hopefully a patch fixes? Confusing camp menu... it highlights menus you were previously in, so it's buggy and if you leave the camp menu and return to it? It shows all the last menus you were in... kind of annoying... but it's a major bug that doesn't break the game at least.Anyways? If you're looking for a classic turn-based strategy RPG? The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a great game to add the collection. I'm happy they ported this one from the PSP... I'd love to see more ports from consoles to PC... Lost Odyssey, Tales of Vesperia and Star Ocean come to mind. (PLEASE!!!!)			"

												From the beginning to the very end, Trails in the Sky FC ( First Chapter ) is a mix of really warmful feelings with a tiny bit of darker elements. The main story itself is simple and has been seen quite a lot already.However, it is the entire cast of characters who make it such an enjoyment to fulfill the role of a couple of young bracers in the Kingdom of Liberl.Estelle and Joshua, the two main characters, works very well together. And that complicity,until the very end of FC, with each chapter introducing new characters to team up with, each playing an important part in the whole story, will bring you a great deal of good emotions !  But that's not all, FC standing for First Chapter, there is of course a second chapter coming, and it seems FC is just a prelude to emotionally prepare the player for the last minutes of the game and what is to come in SC. You'll have to play the game to understand.While FC truly shine thanks to its characters and their story, it is still a rpg, meaning a combat system. It is classic but quite good, thought some combats are a bit long and leveling is needed from time to time. The item and magic system ifsa bit unusual and feel underused. It is still rather simple an easy to use, but be aware of you spending, because you can quickly run out of money if you don't farm a bit.Add to all that the technical part, lovely visuals, graphims, cute chara design, and a great soundtrack. Yes it is now one of my favorite rpg.So in a few months hopefully; the second chapter of Trail in the Sky should be released, which is supposed to complete the main story. Feeling heartbroken by the end of FC, considering its ending, such a cliffhanger and all that has been left unexplored. So hopefully again. the wait shouldn't be too long before going back adventuring with my favorite bracers and their friends.			"

												Ok, so I have been nearing the finish line and have a better understanding of the game, and a decent understanding of the series itself.   Since this review might be long, I'll add a 'tl;dr' section at the bottom to sum it up roughly.BasicsLegend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, is your all-around RPG, or to be more exact, JRPG.  Like many RPGs, the gameplay has fights/battles that are in the form of turns, thus making it a turn-based game.  Aside from fighting, there is a massive and well written story to read and follow and the amount of detail, is absolutely amazing.  Just to put some perspective to this game though, the game was originally released in 2004, so when you play it, just remember that you are playing something that is 10+ years old, and for a game that old, it still holds up well, and is very pleasing in so many ways.   Of course the game was originally written in Japanese, but thanks to the translation, it can be read in english by those who do not understand Japanese.StoryThe game itself, is part of a story arc that takes place in an over-arching story that is much bigger than I can possibly explain.   This game, is the first of a 3-part series.   The story starts off with the two main characters Estelle and Joshua.   Through out the game, you play as these two characters, and on a quest to become a senior member of a guild called Bracers.   The Bracers are a group of people who help others through out the land by performing various tasks to help the people with whatever it is that they may need.   So, you start off by helping with retrievals and being a personal escort to escort someone to a location without them dying.   Naturally the difficulty of tasks increases as the game proceeds.As the story progresses, there are a lot of things that are going on, and often times, it can be very confusing to understand who is who, and whether that person is good or bad.   The story has a way of getting you to believe one thing, only to turn it around and show you how you were mislead in believing someone was good or bad.   There are so many other things in the story to say, but many of these things are that of which I can not speak of or else there will be plenty of spoilers.   In short, the story is massive, and when i say massive, I mean it.   I do not know right off top my head how many hours I have logged in, but as of now, I am finally on the final chapter (I think?) and it has been a very long yet enjoyable ride with various times where I simply skipped through certain dialogues, and yet I still have a lot of hours under my belt.GameplayAs I stated earlier, this is a JRPG and is a turn-based game.   The key for doing well in turn-based RPGs, is to always think ahead, and not just rush in and think you can take on anything with a few swings of the blade.   In this game, there are basic attacks, spells, crafts, and items.    Basic attacks are just what they say they are, which are attacks that use the character's main/basic weapon.   Spells and crafts will take a bit more time to explain.  Items, are simply healing items that can be used to heal, revive dead allies, potions to cure debuffs, potions to buff players, etc.  Now, between spells and crafts, Crafts are special abilities that can have various effects and can take time to get enough energy to use.   Regular Crafts are gained through out the game as you level up.   These types of crafts are usually tactical and some are able to deal damage while apply a debuff.  Regular Crafts only take up a small amount of energy.   Special Crafts, require a full bar of energy before they can be used, and nearly all Special Crafts, deal massive amounts of damage.  Some are singular targets, others are multiple targets.  Lastly, Spells are abilities that are channeled and can do various things, from dealing a type of elemental damage, to healing/buffing allies, to debuffing enemies.   Each playable character, has an item that is used to store different Quartz types.   Quartz can be best described as 'ability classes'.   There are quartz that deal with fire, water, earth, wind, time, mind, and another two I believe.   Each of these quartz gives off various abilities that can be used by only those who have selected those quartz.   This is where strategy pays off because if you have an enemy who is weak to water, but strong against fire, and you decide to go into battle with character that only deal fire damage, then you're screwed.   Same thing if you solely have one person be the damage-bringer, and one person being the healer/support.Art & SoundsTo save time/space, I'm going to lump these two together.   The art style of the game, is amazing.  For a game that was done in 2004, it looks amazing still and the animated parts are just as beautiful too.   Heck, even the minor animations seen that are not 'anime-styled' are simple enough to easily convey a point.   The sounds used, are great and make sense in their use.  The music, is great as well.   There are various themes that are used in places like Towns, peaceful villages, roads, dangerous places, towers, battles, surprise battles, etc.  Often times, these songs are simple but so dam catchy and can put you in the mood to do some serious battling, or to hurry and get some where.  Even as I progressed through the game, there always seemed to be a new song that I haven't heard before, so that was a pleasant surprise.OverallThe last time I played a RPG, was way back in the day when FF7 and FF8 were out, and while the music was great, and the visuals are stunning, the linear feel of it, just felt weird and the strategy aspect was confusing.   Playing this game, made me realize just how much I missed out on RPGs, and with a massive story like this, it is simply enjoyable on every level.  For people who have the patience and enjoy reading, all while having fights here and there, and not be too forced down a linear path, I highly recommend this.   If stories are not your thing, then this game might be more of an issue for you and should consider passing on it since there is a lot of reading to be done.   All in all, its a great game, its easy to pick and while tricky early on, it gets better as time moves on.   tl;dr versionPros:+ Impressive art style and music for something from 2004+ Very long and enjoyable story + Different side characters to play with, all of which are unique in their own way+ Turn-based fighting leads to great strategy fights and magic abilities+ Average play through, assuming that half of the extra side missions and stuff are attempted, is easily 30+ hours+ Flat out, enjoyable+ Not linear like other gamesCons- Story might be too big or sections with heavy reading might be boring for those who don't like to read- Once you gain the right number of skills/abilities, you are easily able to down anything, just takes time (typical for most games, especially in late-game phase)- Nothing much else to complain about			"

												One of the finest RPGs ever crafted with its only flaw being the extremely slow pacing mostly due to the fact that its story is much bigger than the game is letting you know right until the very end with a cliffhanger that plays with your emotions and only make you want XSEED to localize the sequel much faster. If my opinion ever meant anything to you, I strongly recommend this game even at full price for 40-60 hours of a phenomenal experience. Do note the game is 60% story and 40% gameplay.			"

												The best game on the PSP and the best JRPG of the last decade finally makes it's way officially to PC in English, instantly making it one of the best games on Steam.Trails in the Sky is a throwback to the PS1 era of JRPG's that cuts out the clutter, pacing problems, imbalance, inconsistent writing/localization, shallow mechanics, and general bs that age them so poorly. It is the first of a trilogy of JRPG's that have exceptional level of detail in its world building, yet tells a gripping, perfectly paced story. The massive undertaking of localizing this game into English was only accomplished through the blood, sweat, and tears shed by the XSEED staff. The localization is not just competent, it is one of the finest this medium has seen.But a perfect localization of a fantastic story in an RPG would ring hallow if the game was not worth the 50 hour investment. Thankfully, Trails has a brilliant battle system that both accomplishes simplicity and accessibility in its design and has a satisfying depth of customization and strategy. It features a swath of compelling and rewarding side quests, a fantastic soundtrack that lives up to the expectations of a Nihon Falcom title, a diverse and memorable cast of characters, and a fantastic story that follows Estelle and Joshua's journey across the kingdom of Liberl.Trails in the Sky is not just a great Japanese RPG, it's everything you could ever want out of a Japanese RPG.

												THIS GAME IS AWESOME! Like Sharknado, Enough said. But for those of you who need more convincing, think Final Fantasy Tactics meets Suikoden II. This game is basically the Avatar of video games, except it wasn't kept in theaters for a year just because its director has too much money to throw around, and games benefit from learning from other games. Anyway, my prejudice aside, The game is solid, intuitive, and mind blowing. The game isn't without flaws though, I strongly recommend using a controller and changing the controls. The games DID NOT port well. Also I have noticed some problems with changing resolution and making the game windowed. The game tends to crash when opening menus with these changes, Some of these problems might be fixed with patches but overall, once you get the game set up for you, it is AMAZEBALLS. In  my humble opinion this game rivals the giants of the JRPG industry, FF7, FF Tactics, Suikoden II, to name a few. BUY IT BUY IT NOW.			"

												i had a good time playing this. the story is not that great kinda cliche,  MC goes open world makes loooots of friends in the process , beat final boss and he just wants to redeem himself. But still the game is cool.  Dont like some of the chars also.. is like  for every chapter of the game you get different companions  and some of them i dont like really ... still, the game has lots of cool thing and collective stuff , many sidequests , boss fights are not that hard, you may die in some and have to re do but no biggy.. grinding system feels ok, you dont get bored by having to play over and over just to level up.. it goes with the story .... i liked the game really, i reccomend it, is funny as well			"

												Absolutely legit. Very handsome very swag.Seriously, this is a strong, heartwarming anime RPG.Has it all: decent story, treasure chest jokes, music, frames per second, good load times.The bad: that world map resolution quality, bad qual icons being blown up but still nice, 10-20% of textures will annoy. Some structure repetitiveness. It's an old game that has gotten nice HD treatment.What is strongest: The writing and dialogue! There's no non-battle voices so you're forced to read a lot. You play to read and learn. All the writing is so rich and fits the tone immensely.What is weakest: THE DIALOGUE. It goes on forever in such a way that you wish there was an auto advance (a well timed one) and that you could just sit back, eat and read for 20 mins. When's the action?			"

												not your typical you're the chosen one, you will save the world JRPG story, nope. the main story about this first chapter of the trilogy is about two youngster setting out to be a senior bracer (its like a hired professional to do odd jobs and things) and somehow they stumbled into a big conspiracy on their way. moving on, character development is great, pacing of the story is also good though sometimes it can be a bit slow. the very good thing about this game is the NPC line, its very different from all of JRPG i've ever played, most of the time every NPC will say the same thing over and over again no matter how many times you visit them, but this game has unique line for every NPC, after you finish a quest, their dialogue will be different and from what i've read, is what causing trouble for localizing this game from JP to EN, but hell, it works really nicethe plot for this game is well made, and ends on a cliffhanger, i really cant wait for the second chapter to be released, its supposed to be released this year, i highly recommend this for the story and the gameplay for those who loved old school rpg			"

Well they are monkey's throwing $%@% at the wall. SO heres how I found to fix it for all of you interested in this game if you are having this issue.Open steam - Go to Library and Choose the Configuration Mode by Right Clicking the game in the Library, and Click on Configuration Mode. Next go to SAVE FILE. From Save File, Delete the EXACT ""Folder"" you are in. Should be called Exec or something like that. Bam! Presto! Launch game. May need to resize, couple errors with 1080, would recommend above or below that setting. Laters.			"

												I wanted to see what the buzz was about, but found myself mostly disappointed. The game really drags for 20-30 hours in the middle, the dialogue is really long-winded and lacking. It's unfortunate because I loved the ending ( last 1.5 hours) - I just wished it happened about 10-15 hours into the game rather than 30+. It was good enough to almost tempt me to get the second game, but the journey to it just wasn't worth it. The details in the game are impressive, but not enough to compensate for the dragging story.Would not recommend for most of my friends.			"

												Your brother dresses up as a princess and you and your friend, who are girls, dress as knights for a play helping orphans whose orphanage was burnt down by some dudeCross Dressing Simulator 201510/10 IGN, its okayIf you want a serious review of the game, read on good viewer, for this is gonna get nerdy.This game is best described as the Developers kinda love letter to older JRPG's, while also having its own personality & flavour. You play as Estelle Bright, a 16year old girl whose father is a famous war hero and warrior, who as a character some people like, some people dislike, due to her personality being mostly her being confused about everything, asking questions and yelling, but is a good character is her own right, and i liked her as a character. Your main party member, who leaves you party once in the entire game, is your adopted brother Joshua, a calm and collected boy with a misterious past Estells age who was adopted by Estelels father after he was found in the forest one night.  There are other characters, a perverted bard called Olivier, a giant easterner called Zane, a bad-boy guy with a massive sword called Agate, a school girl(not what is sounds like) called Khloe, a little girl with a cannon(!) called Tita, and a female warrior called Schera. These are your main party members and will be with your party in some order or another throughout the game. Most of the games charm comes from the interactions the characters have between each other and the conversations. The game has amazing writing also, some of the best i have every seen. The gameplay for the game is best described as a combination of Final Fantasy esque turnbased combat, hexbased, with each cahracters ""special"" and ""arts"" like the Materia system in Final Fantasy VII. The gameplay is not the games strongest point, but i myself enjoyed it. The games story, while complicated, is best descrped as Estelle and Joshua travelling their country of Liberl, and discovering their true strenght and powers in the process. This brings me to a major gripe one would have with the game, the games cutscenes can sometimes last for over twenty minuetes of pure talking. While annoying, the writing is so superb that its at least servicable. The other major gripe is the last boss and ending, the last ""boss"" is more a boss rush, with the boss having a ""one hit kill"" attack, which is pretty annoying. The ending, and the events before it, is a MASSIVE cliffhanger that really comes out of no-where, and while it sets up the next game well, is pretty annoying. The ending and events before it really changes up the tone of the game, since it reveales a lot about Joshua and another character who was prevalent in the game, without spoiling the ending to much. Personally, i loved the game and think its one of the best games in the JRPG genre, but(!) its understandable that some people wouldn't like the combat and the long cut-scenes, and the entire Anime feeling the game has. The game is very Japanese if you catch my drift, a lot of things that are prevalent in Anime and Japanese Games, including character types, are prevalent in the game. All-in-all, i personally loved the game(as i said)and highly recommend the game.Sorry, have to stop writing the review, have to talk in the forums about when the next game is coming out, Have a Nice Day and Happy Gaming!

A little bit of a frustrating ending. Second chapter not on steam yet, and as far as i know, may not even be finished.

												What can be said that hasn't been said a hundred times about this game? I absolutely adore this game. I've never loved a game or it's characters so much. It's not the troupey anime-styled character development you might expect from a jrpg. It's gradual, very believable, and the dialogue that the characters use during their interactions really makes the characters feel real and charming. They have an honest personality to them.And ontop of all that, there's pleeeeenty of side things to do that really, reeeally flesh out the world and the people in it. Almost every single npc has a name and they're treated like actual people in the world. You can talk with them for hints about their problems or opinions with the other npcs, and then talk to the npc they mentioned to get even more of that little story. At nearly every stage of the game the dialogue with these characters changes. It was actually very entertaining just talking to the npcs and doing the side quests, just to experience more of the charming world. Fantastic characters and dialogue aside, I enjoyed the combat as well. It's turn-based with gride movement for positioning and skill targeting. The characters have their own skills and specials, but you can equip them with ""materia-esque"" items to give them magic as well. I feel like the combat was just the right balance of difficult and engaging. It wasn't frustrating to the point where it made me want to quit at any point. But it also wasn't so one sided that I wanted to kill myself. It kept me engaged and thinking. But don't get lazy, the game will throw unexpected difficulty at you to catch you off guard. Don't underestimate the enemies and you won't have a problem.All in all I absolutely adore this game. It's by far my favorite game. Don't pass it up! The second chapter is on steam as well, so when you finish this one I know you'll be wanting to get right back into the world and find out what happens next.			"

												Obviously won't be everybody's cup of tea. But if you have fond memories of playing games like Grandia, or Suikoden, or most any other Playstation-generation JRPG for hours on end, devoting entire weekends to them, and if you've been dying to play a game like those again, then I can pretty safely say that this is probably your kind of game to play. It might not stack up by itself so far (as I write this review, I'm only ten hours in and only just beat the prologue), but it's definitely doing its job and bringing back those fuzzy warm memories.

												Its probably a bit early to write a review for this game because i pretty much just started playing it XD ah but i can tell you once i started playing i was very addicted! Although the game seems to be quite simple, doing all the quests, helping others and fighting monsters on your way through, i personally think the story as a whole is very detailed and quite deep. i also like the main protagonist in the game :D (i think she is really funny XD) and how there is many different fighting skills and techniques you can use during the battle. I do recommend you to try it out! This is like the first game i ever played on my pc so i cant really compare it to other games but it is really fun and i do enjoy it very much :3			"

												Gets a little 'wordy' between battles but a fun romp, nonetheless.  Updates (patches), as of this review, are currently coming in daily and the game now runs solid on my system at 2560x1440.  Story is good but unfolds slowly due to the enormous amounts of text; but many people enjoy that type of thing.  Combat is turn-based and fun with a twist on the norm for this genre.  Highly recommended for all fans of JRPG games.			"

												When I first got a Playstation when I was seven years old, my first game was Lunar 2: Eternal Blue. Shortly thereafter I picked up a game called Grandia. Both centered around teenaged protagonists traveling the world with a group of friends, helping others, finding love and defeating evil with a lighthearted tone rarely seen in RPGs then or now. They were simplistic to be sure, but the joy and wonder of exploring a new world with characters you grow attached to was very romantic to a young kid at the time. As time went on those games, along with JRPGs as a whole, seemed to fall out of favor. JRPGs today rarely scratch the itch that those games scratched. Enter The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky.What Trails in the Sky does better than any recent JRPG is world building and characterization. There's a great sense of excitement as you wander the continent, wondering what new location will surprise you next. The world does a great job of feeling like a living, breathing place as well. Any time something major happens in the plotline, you can be sure the denizens of whatever city is currently your home base will have new and interesting things to say regarding it. The quality writing and translation extends to your party members as well. Estelle and Joshua are both enjoyable protagonists, able to seem familiar to anyone who's played a JRPG before while also avoiding any of the overly tropey character traits typical of a JRPG lead. They feel like real people and manage to carve out a niche in a genre that's become bogged down with samey characters.No one is going to confuse Trails in the Sky for a groundbreaking game that flips the genre on its head. What it does manage to do, however, is feel like a natural progression of the games I fell in love with as a kid. It has been far too long since I was able to feel that childlike wonder of exploring a brand new world within a JRPG. Things like meeting fun new characters and hoping they would eventually join my party, or scouring every corner of a dungeon for treasure chests, or simply going around town talking to people to see what interesting things they have to say. Trails in the Sky makes me feel like a kid again, and for that I can't possibly give it a higher recommendation.			"

												The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, is an amazing JRPG. It has all the necessary elements to make a JRPG; no, an RPG, awesome. You see, these days developers cling on to the notion that having amazing graphics is good enough to save them from being labeled as mediocres but we have all seen that it is not. You need a balanced mix between visuals, plot and a good gameplay to make a good game and this game excels in all three.Graphics:While it certainly isn't large at this aspect, this game never pretended to sell this aspect of the game. However, even though there's nothing much to say about its visuals, the few things I can say about it are all positive. Compared to other games that have this kind of interface this is actually topnotch. The characters are drawn well and you can really see their emotions in the frames everytime they speak. Character animations, while pixelized, are simple enough to be understood but complex enough to leave some wonder.Characters:This, I believe is the game's strong point. The team that handled this have outdone themselves. Each character in the game have their own personalities. Because of such, all the characters are memorable and everything that happens in the game have more weight. Even characters that you don't spend much time with feel alive. The main characters in the game were superb. If you're attentive enough, if you don't just rapidly press the mouse to get conversations over with, it's easy to sympathize with them as they develop. One can trully see how their characters mature into the legends they were born to be. This is true not only for the two heroes we always use but for the companions they meet and fought with.Plot:The story, while not unheard of, feels original because of how the team handled it. There's a certain level of mystery in the story that keeps it fresh. While some events were preditable, the team handled it in a way that keeps players thinking, keeps players in doubt and best of all; keeps players immersed. While I am mad that I have to wait for the sequels, I am sure the long wait will only make acquiring it later on sweeter.Gameplay:Not the game's strong point but it holds up perfectly. At first the fighting mechanics in this game seem so simple. However, after playing for a bit one woud notice its true depth. Sure in the first encounters simply mashing the attack command may work but not too long into the game you'd notice that this is a good way to get killed. Players will need to have a good balance of healing, offensive spells, defensive spells and utility spells to get through and they can do this through the orbnaments, which I want to discuss a bit. The orbnaments are amazing. Different combinations of orbs make for different spells, kinda like the invoker in dota 2.... I only wish I had more slots to put more orbs in but even with that restriction I still had fun tinkering with different combinations.Soundtrack:The songs and tunes in this game are top notch. They're the kind of songs you'd want to listen to with an earphone while relaxing in your private yacht... or in your bed. Each place has their own theme song which really compliments the background. Fighting too has its own theme and depending on your party's status, it changes to make everything more dramatic.Overall I believe this is a great game. I'll be too kind to it if I gave it a perfect score but I can give it a 9/10. That minus one is for the fact that you are not allowed to skip any of the cut scenes so if you forgot to save and it closed due to a system bug you're screwed. But other than that, this game is perfect for its price and I am sure to buy the sequels.			"

												A very good game. Story revolves around two 16 year old kids, a brawn-over-brains girl (the main character who you make decisions for) and a know-it-all donkan boy with an edgy-as-♥♥♥♥, mysterious backstory. A little bit of a frustrating ending. Second chapter not on steam yet, and as far as i know, may not even be finished. Translating the second chapter turned out to be very tasking for some reason, and the company with all the rights on the translation never even commited to translating the third chapter. While the second one may be released by the end of 2015, the third one may take many more years, if it's even gonna be translated at all. Prepare for treachery, hypnosis, grinding and lovable characters. 8/10 would recommend.			"

												""JRPG fans, will probably enjoy this title.""To be brutally honest. The screenshots don't do the graphics justice. They are apart of the game and all, but when you actually play it, it looks fairly terrible. That being said, I feel that the focus of this game was anything but the graphics. I've played up to the prologue, which to that point, I think I can justify any pros and cons I have with it.Firstly, I felt that at the very start, the information was being crammed down your throat. I know it's because they want you to start understanding what these characters are about, but still, it really bugged me. But about 10 minutes in, it lightens up to a much more comfortable feel. The main characters banter back and forth, ALMOST everyone has there own name and a minor amount of character backstory, and the world seems to interlock with everything very well. The setting is steampunk and magic is just this focus of these sources of power, which power anything mechanical. It's all fairly clever.Secondly, the controls and combat. The controls, bug me alittle. They are rebindable, so this is barely a complaint, but if you leave default on, its either aim with the mouse, or arrow keys, which was alittle jarring. Outside of combat though, the movement was fine and I didn't really have trouble moving at all. The combat, which is grid and turn based, is fairly nice. Everyone in the battle has a portait on the left in order of who's attacking next. Using arts, (magic) will take a turn to summon, using Crafts (Abilities) will take points out of another bar which will increase within taking and dealing damage, and it carries over battles. There's also a surprise attack system, where sneaking up to a monster and charging at them from behind gives you a massive advantage, and vice versa. Theres also npc's that get involved aswell, which won't fight and may or may not be targets to the monsters.So far, I've enjoyed the time I've been playing, which the prologue, I'd say is about 6-7 hours long, but this was me walking around, attacking alot of monsters and talking to alot of people. I've run into several crashes, which I think were related to having the aspect ratio uneven. The game seemingly needs to run in a square window, otherwise it may have problems. Aswell as I've managed to get stuck in a npc before, so I couldn't move but I got out of that without too much hassle. Really, In the end, this is not a shiny game. Theres 2D sprites, polygons, you name it. But so far, the characters are mildly interesting, the plot is typical, but still enjoyable, and the combat can get challenging depending on how much you grind, but theres so difficulty options. Otherwise, I personally am enjoying this game, mostly to see more things that are based around this universe and I've enjoyed a good portion of the game, when there not shoving too much information in one conversation. JRPG fans, will probably enjoy this title.8/10			"

												From what little I have played so far, about an hour, maybe a little more, this really is a nice JRPG entry (when/if you can get it to run).  More on that next paragraph.  For a modern JRPG release, the lack of voice acting is really the only complaint I have in gameplay.  If you don't mind a lot of reading and clicking after every sentence, and you're a fan of JRPGs, or even anime/manga, Trails in the Sky is definitely something that should be on your radar.  Whether or not you should purchase it now, just after release on Steam, is another matter entirely.  There was obviously no distributed alpha/beta stage to this development/conversion judging from the myriad fatal crash reporting.  Essentially, this means you are, currently, paying for a game that (in the current trend) is really an ""Early Access"", although feature complete, game.  With that said, IF you can get it to run stable, it's definitely worth the investment.As of the 2 hour mark, I had to run the game, which then minimized itself, and stayed minimized no matter how I tried to access it, for over half an hour on the 20th run try or so.  After that half hour it did let me switch to it and resolved to a black screen that then began playing the intro a few minutes later.  The game played normally after that, but on two other machines I still can't get it to run.  One of these exceeds system specs by only a bit (i3,4GB,256MB) and the game loads normally but crashes after a few minutes of play.  The other minimizes as the first machine described.  Both of those machines are WELL beyond system spec.  I'll update this review once I've gotten more play time in for myself and gotten it running on these other machines.  But my advice, unless you're able to stomach potential fatal bugs, is to wait until the forums stop reporting crash bugs.			"

												If you are looking for a classic RPG this is a good one. The battle system is turn based and has an interesting take on magic attacks (arts) in the form of the orbment system. The game discourages grinding as the experience gain drops exponentially as you reach a certain level. This makes you focus on the story and the quests involved. The story is great, though it  would appear cliched if you have played various RPGs already. But worry not, with its colorful and quirky cast all the reading will not bore you out. I hope the second chapter comes out soon.			"

												Yearning for that age of try-hard PSOne RPGs, before Final Fantasy came in and rendered them all bloaty CGI-fests for a couple of years? You could really do way, way worse than giving Trails in the Sky a look. In many ways it harkens back to the likes of Grandia, going for polygonal maps with 2D character sprites slapped ontop of it, though coming, even in it's original form, on more modern hardware, the fidelity is rather better here. It also throws out the random encounters and goes with having your opponents visible on the map, and sports a neat positional combat system in which player and opponent positioning play a significant part, particularly when you start throwing out Area of Effect magic and skills. There's a pretty decent degree of character customisation as well.The story, well, I guess it's charming. Again, it's pretty throwback - if you are the sort who gets annoyed at modern anime trappings, there's actually probably not too much for you to be worried about here. I mean, the protagonist is a young lady, but manage to avoid a lot of what are generally considered the more negative ""moe"" stereotypes. Honestly, if I had a major complaint about the writing, it's that most of the really exciting stuff happens right as the game is wrapping up, but I guess that's what the forthcoming sequel is for.The game runs like a charm on less-than-premuim hardware (I ran it at 1080p output to the telly from an HTPC running an A6 with no additional GPU, and it pulled a constant 60fps without a single hiccup), though there's a couple of places (and I stress ""couple"" here) where it shows that it was originally formatted as a 4:3 rather than a widescreen game - be amused as you can see characters standing on the edge of the screen, ready to make their dramatic entries! It just adds to the charm I guess. Gamepad support is pretty decent, too, although I say that about anything I can play using an older DirectInput-style device (in my case, a PS3 Neo-Geo pad).			"

												I'm not sure what i can say that others haven't already said. This is an excellent JRPG by Falcom that has been masterfully localized by the excellent people at xSeed. For those few of you who may not be familiar with Falcom they are a wonderful RPG developer (they also make Ys) on par with old school Square Soft before squenix went all stupid. About the only negative thing i can say about Falcom is that they dont do localization and have no interest (in truth its probably inability as they are small) in localizing their games. Thankfully we have xSeed who specializes in this, but they do ask that we buy their localized games if we want them to continue doing so. So if you like JRPGs, especially old school, then please buy this game so and enjoy so that xSeed will keep bringing us more. And remember; if your parents refuse to buy this for you then just wait till they are asleep and steal their credit card (not recomended) trust me you will all laugh about it later (probably not).

												*DISCLAIMER* This game has a few issues but they are getting patched out at light speed. When I first tried playing 1080p didn't work, nor did fullscreen. Now they do. Controller support was buggy, now it isn't. There are an odd couple graphic bugs left, like poor resizing due to the game being made for 4:3 ratio and playing on 16:9 but oh well.The story is fairly slow paced. If you like that is a matter of opinion. The battle and magic system is pretty cool. Every NPC says it's own text which changes after each event. Even item chests have their own custom dialog if you examine them after looting them. My issue with the game is the ending. Oh boy what an ending. I played this game for 42 hours for *that* ending. I am so very frustrated.			"

												I've played a lot of the standart RPG with this kind of graphic in my travels. The game is played with the mouse is very intuitive and easy to play. The battles are a tactical design with a fast and simple interface. THe magic system reminds me of the FFVII materia, but in this one you collect it from monsters and forge it into stuff you need, stacking different ones in certain ways will increase stats, damage and magical effects. Quest are stright forward with little in the way of meandering around not knowing what to do. Lastly you get item off monsters that can be used to make food for you to eat in and out of battle to keep you fighting fit.Mostly the story is on the long side when you wait for a bit to get the story moving but like all games in this style it more about the story that you play it not what you can do or when can you do it.Almost forgot the scroll wheel on the mouse rotates the map 360 degress so you can see the whole street and not be blind sided by a wall or tree.Game for the person who still want more FF			"

												If you have enjoyed games like Lunar, Chrono Trigger, Lufia, and FFVI then I think you will enjoy this game.  This JRPG which originally came out on the PC in Japan and later was released on the PSP is very good.   This release is a reworked version of the original PC release which includes the additions from the PSP version (though at the time of writing the monster book is still being implemented).  The game itself really excels in the story and the attention to detail in the characters themselves is really what has sucked me in.  If you are a fan of JRPGs and RPGs (especially the old school sprite kind) and enjoy a detailed story then I feel you will enjoy this game.  The game can currently run in high resolutions though it may seem a bit blurry compared to our high definition standards.

												Trails in the Sky, the first chapter of 3. It's a long journey, but you can cut it short by skipping most side quests, but would you? I don't think you will. It offers so many characters to love and so many little stories to be part of. You begin your little adventure as just rookies, not just the characters but you as well. The time you spend with them you'll see them mature just as you see yourself mature playing the game. It really helps as well that you'll find yourself become more knowledgeable about the battle system, because it can be a pain sometimes. But I personally enjoyed this to the fullest; I've been a Falcom fan for quite some while and I expected high, just not this high. And if you really need the push to play this game, I'll tell you this: Become part of the story and play to the end, you will not be disappointed. The only thing you will hate about this game is that you have to get the Second Chapter, it's so unfortunate that it's not as a whole.			"

												This game is perfect if you love character driven JRPGs that you really want to invest your time into. It took me about six hours to complete the prolouge and I loved every minute of it. The characters are deep & likeable, they may get a bit cliche however. And the sense of humor this game has really hits the mark.The combat is simple and fun. You move your characters around and whack the crap out of monsters. The character customisation is interesting also, as you only have a limited amount of slots to give to each character so you must choose which abilities you give to who carefully.It's safe to say that this game is well worth the $20, I can see myself becoming very invested in this game.

												I'm only about 6 hours into this game, but I've been finding that it's a lot of fun so far.  It has some flaws but mostly pros.The game is actually challenging at times, which is a plus for a JRPG.  Resource management seems like it's going to play a big part, especially right at the beginning.  You need to fight certain types of enemies to earn certain types of Sepith, selling the Sepith you don't need for gold so that you can buy healing items, because enemies in this game will do significant damage to you.The story seems fun so far although 6 hours into the game I still haven't left what the game is calling it's prologue.  For me this is a plus, but I could see this being a negative for some people.			"

												8/10 would play againwhoever translated this game is hilarioussurprisingly long game, surprisingly less grind than expected (though still lots of it), and pretty good universe. never played any other legend of heroes titles, so pretty decent experience overall. some characters are kinda annoying but overall solid cast when they're not jacking off to cassius bright.bad things include too much  walking, not being able to backtrack to previous chapters' main cities (points of no return), and too much walking.also (spoiler alert) the final boss has a one shot ability that he uses like every other turn which is stupid, then has like 3 other attacks that do 99% of your health or more. imo this is one of the major flaws in the game, too much artificial difficulty which makes enemies either ridiculously easy to kill or ridiculously hard to kill.anyway, solid jrpg overall. it's part 1 of a trilogy of a J (japanese) rpg, so expect a cliffhanger.

The combat isn't groundbreaking, but it is more involved than your standard ATK/MAG until the mob is dead. Character design, music, and art style are all quite nice as well.

												This game is a real gem. If you like games like... final fantasy, the tales series (""of the abyss"" being my personal favorite), mixed in with a little harvest moon graphics and humor, then you will truly appreciate this game. The story is great so far, it has me interested in the outcome of the characters and I want to know more about the world it takes place in. In it's current state it's a little buggy (crashes occasionally), but that hasn't made the game unplayable... plus they are patching it like crazy. The battle system can sometimes seem monotonous, but at higher levels you will have to implement some strategy or you'll be punished. Going to update as I continue to play, but so far it is definitely a worthwhile game... if not for the nostalgia alone.			"

												Firstly, for those of you who don't know what a ""JRPG"" is:  A world map, towns and caves and other places to visit, combat that involves you and the monsters taking turns - it's a formula that has been around for ages.  What hasn't been in that formula is a PC dedicated titel.  Always before it has been ports from consoles, for the most part.Having only briefly played this game now, after circling around the purchase for a few weeks after reading reviews, I will say this:This is the first I've tried that gets the PC formula right.  The graphics are beautiful, the sound is excellent, the interface makes sense for a mouse/keyboard combo.  To be blunt, you want to get this game.  The other reviews are accurate.  At this point I will say pick this one up and play it.   I will expand this review as my playtime increases.			"

												It looks funny when you run in circles.10/10Would run in circles again.EDIT:I finished the game after 45 hours so here is my real reviewThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a Turn Based JRPG.I haven't played many Turned Based JRPG's before and this one looked cool so I decided to pick it up.I'm glad I did it was well worth the $20.The story will make you laugh and cry I found the story verry interesting the whole way through.The combat system is pary based I guess you would say. There is many diferent abilities you can unlock and offers unique gameplay.The music is really catchy I found myself humming along a lot lol.I played with an Xbox 360 controller no problem but it also has support for keyboard and mouse.I never played the original version on the PSP but this is an outstanding port. I think on release there was a few problems but I got this game after patches already came out and I have not noticed any bugs at all and never had a crash or anything like that.I seriously couldn't put this game down until I was about to pass out at like 4am. Then the next day I continued.If you are a fan of these type of games this is a MUST buy.Also the more JRPG's you buy on steam I'm sure the more will come here!Let's hope part 2 of this game makes it way to steam as well!

												This game is old-fashioned but has an incredibly smart menu system to handle its many complexities regarding its ""orbment""/magic system.  A very addictive and challenging quest system keeps the story and side-stories chugging right along.  It has reams of well-written and well-translated, charming dialogue as well as characters and a story that slowly (too slowly for some) become fleshed out.  Nearly ten hours into the game, I'm still in the prologue and still learning the mechanics and strategies and drinking in the lore of the world.  It's also got a score that reminds me of the cheerful earworms from games like ""Lunar: Silver Star Story"" on Sega CD.  This is an instant favorite for JRPG fans (and RPG fans in general, really), and I cannot wait to see what the next (100?) hours hold.			"

												When I launched this game, I had problems with characters turning into large black boxes. To fix this issue, go to your library, click on games, then right click on ""The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky"". Click ""Run Configuration"". In Display, uncheck hardware vertex shading, and that issue is resolved. I also ran into a problem where my gamepad was not working. To fix this issue, ""Run Configuration"", click on Input, and click on Reset Default (or whatever it says). The issue should then be fixed.Onto the review:Awesome, AWESOME game! Do I recommend this game? Yes. Is it worth the current price? Yes. Is it THAT good? YES. This game reminds me of Grandia II, and Skies of Arcadia. It's a JRPG, and a good one at that. All of the NPCs have something to say, and after the plot changes, they say something different. The game is challenging, and there are lots to do. You have to be careful, or you might miss something.After my first walkthrough, I did not finish my recipe book, I did not collect all of the news, or complete all of the quests. Nonetheless, Estelle was Lvl 38 when I finished the game. The detail is amazing, the personalities are real, and the gameplay is engrossing. Turn-based combat works great for this game, especially since you are controlling a party of characters. Now, my challenge to you is: can you beat this game without using a guide or walkthrough? If you can do that through your first time through the game, I applaud you.Seeing that XSEED is going to release chapter 2 in December 2014, or in 2015, I recommend that you buy this game NOW. There is even a New Game+ available after you play the game, so what are you waiting for?P.S. After beating the game, if you cannot wait for Chapter 2 to come out, or want to play something else apart from New Game+, I recommend Ys Chronicles I+II. Falcom also made these two, as well as Ys: The Oath of Felghana. Check them out on Steam.			"

												This game has a fun combat system that isn't too complicated for anyone looking to get into this genre of games, but what really pulls this game is the side characters that fight with you along the way and how sometimes your even able to get attached to those characters. So when they have to go back to their everyday lives as you move to the next location. You feel kind of sad. Currently i'm playing in chapter 3 right now and when i had to let Kloe go, I really didn't want to.Expect a lot of reading, a lot of long cutscenes. If your all about the battle and not about the story than this game isn't for you.			"

												This game is perfect if you love character driven JRPGs that you really want to invest your time into. It took me about six hours to complete the prolouge and I loved every minute of it. The characters are deep & likeable, they may get a bit cliche however. And the sense of humor this game has really hits the mark.The combat is simple and fun. You move your characters around and whack the crap out of monsters. The character customisation is interesting also, as you only have a limited amount of slots to give to each character so you must choose which abilities you give to who carefully.It's safe to say that this game is well worth the $20, I can see myself becoming very invested in this game.

												I recently finished this game, which lasted around 30 hours.  I absolutely loved this game.This two largest stregnths of this game are its character developement and combat.  The encounters are similiar to paper mario, where you can see enemies and dodge them.  You can flee with 100% success so you never have to get bogged down and mash attack until fights are over as you explore.  This game was good enough that I immediately looked up the release date for the second chapter.   I played using an xbox 360 controller which worked flawlessly (though camera was back and start button which took a while to figure out).  Enjoy this awesome game			"

												Okay now i know you're wondering whether or not this game is worth the money and ill be completely honest with you. It is worth every single penny. This game is about 30-40 hours long with alot to offer for its price. Not in extra features or bonus boss fights but in story, yes story. It'll be safe to assume that the plot is modeled off the basic archetype/blueprint of adventure type animes targeted towards a teenage-mature crowd. So the plot is good being based off that blueprint but what makes it great is the characters, they are easy to connect with and understand as well as very colorful and make the story feel more alive. In short terms the story is superb on my scale. That being said the RPG elements in this game have some parts that feel old, but refrubished instead of raw usage if you understand. Certain ideas are old mechanics that are refubished to give combat that old yet quality feel that a good JRPG can give you. To make it simple it feels natural and adds a suitable challenge to players of all difficulty ranges. The difficulty isnt brutal at all its more trial and error at certain points. OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10			"

Posted: August 6, 2014
												This is a one of a kind game that you don't see come out often on the PC, so there will be some likes and dislikes obviously.First off this game does an excellent job with storyline. Although each individual NPC doesn't have a full back-story exactly, they do feel like they are talking about general things that a normal person would bring up in conversation given the chance, and due to this game's highly dialogue based nature, this is an excellent thing. Whether you choose to talk to them or not, this leaves the idea that the civilians aren't just placed there to fill up space and look pretty, and the interactions can be nice. If you don't want to talk to them that's always an option, but the fact that they aren't just there to be there is a bonus.Dialogue as mentioned before plays a heavy role in this game, so if you don't like reading you could skip through all of it... But you will end up missing a ton. Granted the dialogue isn’t boring either. I found myself chuckling at the interactions between the main characters and those they come across because the dialogue isn’t just filler with information before you go on your next mission. It's the development of character and throughout the game, you will definitely see this. Each mission has interactions and if you pay attention or not, you can see the gradual change in thought process of the main characters, giving them plenty of development throughout the story and making you feel more connected to them whereas other games take quests as a ""This is your objective, go to it"" approach. This game does an excellent job of providing the plot with useful amounts of development while still keeping it shrouded in mystery. Yes we do see things the main characters would not be able to see occasionally, but this still gives away nothing as to what is really going on, allowing us to figure things out along with the characters in the story (Though at some points it could be rather hilarious.. Such as later in the game when the main characters are shown a picture, and have about six lines of dialogue before noticing the obvious ship in the background). Next up is the battle system. This had some ups and downs with me, however; the overall flow of it is smooth and solid. The battle system is not overly complex, and some of the oddities in it (such as enemies being pushed back each time they're hit), adds an extra element of strategy, such as you can push an enemy with an attack into an AOE skill about to go off the next turn. I like the idea of special skills not using mana (EP), but instead using a new element called CP. This allows characters to use their ""ultimate"" move, along with other character specific skills that can't be obtained through the use of quartz. This brings me to my next fascination of the game. The skill system, although it can be complex to grasp at first, is very fascinating since the skills you obtain get better as you progress through the story and not simply through standard leveling. Meaning whether you rushed through the story, or stuck around for quite a bit, you will still be on the same level for skills since new cities give you the chance to get new abilities. The bracer notebook goes into better detail of how to set up your characters so that they obtain newer skills, but you will get the hang of it by around the second city you arrive at. The skills allow you to set up your character any way you want, and change it to something completely different to fit the situation at any time (Except in battle of course).Cons of this game. There aren't many and even though there are some, they are barely enough to even put a scratch on how good this game is. The dialogue is very heavy and you can find yourself in a cut scene for anywhere from five to ten minutes (If you actually read through everything), so anyone who is not a fan of reading will be turned away by this, but in the game's defense the dialogue is far from pointless babble, and actually serves to developing the plot and characters.The skill system. Although it is complex at first to grasp and you may have to look up something online to help you understand it (If the bracer notebook doesn't explain it well enough), it provides a skill style that I haven't seen before on the pc, and allows for a more tactical approach to the game other than, ""Is this skill better than this one? If yes only use this skill."" Once you get the grasp of it, it won't be a problem at all.The battle system. As many people are used to with turn based strategy games, the move option is normally used to set up a shot on something or move, then attack. In The Legend of Heroes, this is not the case; everything is a one turn only thing. Meaning that if you want to move, you can only move, and then your turn is up. I was thrown off myself by this style and found it a little annoying at first since I had been so used to being able to move into a certain position before carrying out my attack, rather than just rushing and slashing if you're going to attack. This however is still not a crippling factor that would ruin the battle system. This makes the player make that tough choice on whether it would be better to attack or move, such as if an area of effect skill is being cast on one character, would it be better to move him away to avoid having your other units hit, or would it be better to take the hit in order to get in extra damage? This may turn some players away, but to me it is just another factor that adds to more tactical decision making in the field of battle, and shouldn't be considered an overly negative thing. It is just a new battle factor that I found rather enjoyable after playing for a while.Overall: This is an excellent game. Everything flows together well, you feel like you're actually watching the progression of character as you play throughout the game, and the battle system is new and unique in its own way. Yes there are the small things mentioned above that could turn some people away, but that's more of an individual thing than just ""This isn't a shooter, so FPS guys shouldn't play this game if they don't like turn based strategy."" This game has more than enough play time and effort put into it to make it well worth what you would spend on it.Try it out for yourself and see how you like it! I certainly enjoyed it and I'm not even fully done with the game yet! Though the plot does kick up later in the game (Where I am currently at), so if you stick around to the end, I'm sure you won't be disappointed!-Zathium			"

												Very enjoyable game for what it's worth, especially if you like JRPGs. It has some interesting mechanics like the tatics system ( You can move characters to different position when in battle) and rune/upgrade tree (Not really a tree per se, as everyone has access to the same runes from your inventory and can combine them in order to have access to various spells and abilites). The plot and character build up is pretty good, with out spoiling any thing, I'll leave it at that. There are quite a few side missions and secret quests to keep you busy, if you don't feel like doing the main missions (Should note that some side quests and secret  quests are time sensitive and you can not do them once you go to a new region). There are 5 chapters or episodes depending what you call them. And each episode or chapter takes place in 1 of the 5 regions. Which is why once you leave you can't go back and do anything you missed. The world is average sized (Few town cities, multiple dungeons, muitiple roads in to and between) and places you can expolre are pretty decent sizes.   Some things I didn't like. You can't select party members, you just stuck with who ever you have. Party members come and go, only two members are really constant. It's the way the story is set up but it's still a bit disappointing. Another thing was the game is a tad bit short compared to most JRPGs standards (Maybe 10-30 hours worth), even shorter if you go through mutiple play throughs.  All in all, I'd recommend this game to any one looking to play a decent JRPG. I bought when it first came out but I'd say it's one of those games you'd buy on sale. Other then that, other things to note is that there is a sequel. Don't know if it will come on to Steam any time soon but somethign to keep in mind, especially if you enjoyed the game.			"

												Story was interesting through and through even if I did have some problems with a few things. Especially the development of a couple of characters, it felt like it would have been great and refreshing for the genre if some things stayed a certain way, but in the end the common JRPG trope won out. Nevertheless it was still an enjoyable journey and good gameplay complimented it fairly well.Music is good, though I wish they could have added a few more unique tracks for some of the different areas.Only crashed once unexpectedly, never really had a problem after that.Looking forward to SC and hopefully the last chapter will also be localized one day.

												This was a total impulse buy in that I hadn't heard of it before it appeared on the featured items of steam.   I was a bit leery to purchase it with some of the day 1 reviews talking about crashes and instability, but when I checked the community posts I saw people saying it had been patched multiple times in the first couple of days and that most of the problems were fixed. I'm very glad I took the risk.    I've had no issues so far and it's been thoroughly enjoyable.    Playing this game has been like finding a new classic jrpg from the snes era, only with HD graphics.     If you are a fan of jrpgs from the 16-bit era, then you really can't go wrong with this game for the price.			"

												*An excellent JRPG on a platform where you can count the number of games in this genre on one hand.*An engaging story with a lovable, sympathetic protagonist*Excellent dialogue, and a top-notch translation that puts the rest of the industry to shame.*A protagonist with a backstory that makes sense, and an actual personality that's not ""generic JRPG dude"", and on top of that she's *FEMALE*Honestly, even one or two of these would be enough for me to recommend this game, particularly since there are so few really good JRPGs released these days.It's simply a good game all around.

												Somehow this game makes me nostalgiac without ever having played it before.It's a very well put together JRPG which will remind you of earlier PS1-PS2 titles, specifically Grandia, Chrono Trigger, among others. A  lot of side quests, and great exploration. The story so far is 7/10 for me. It's not overly epic; you're more a private detective mercenary then a world saving hero.

I know there are alot of reported ""Crashes"" but i have yet to see a single issue. I run at 1080p, as admin and with an xbox 360 controler. The story keeps getting better and better, the combat is fun, and the the magic system is AWESOME. When you use spells not only does it use your EP (called MP in most games) it also uses the crystals you gather. Makes you think twice before you just spam spells over and over. Keep up the great work and I cant wait to play the rest of the series here on steam. Can you say AWESOME ART SYTLE!!!!!			"

												I'm giving this a thumbs up, but be warned it's very long. I have put in 60 hours and at about the 45 hour mark I just wanted it to end. Worst part was the final boss, or the fake final boss. After to beat him you fight the real final boss, but wait there's more! The Final boss isn't done when you defeat him, he transforms into an ever more powerful form. It's about a 90 minute fight for all 3 battles, and you can't save after each battle. I got tired of fighting and let him kill my party, I was doing 1k attacks and it was barely moving his health. I loved this game til the last 15 hours I put into it. I 100% Ni No Kuni and never once wanted that game to end. They just drag the story out too long in Legend of Heroes.			"

												Yearning for that age of try-hard PSOne RPGs, before Final Fantasy came in and rendered them all bloaty CGI-fests for a couple of years? You could really do way, way worse than giving Trails in the Sky a look. In many ways it harkens back to the likes of Grandia, going for polygonal maps with 2D character sprites slapped ontop of it, though coming, even in it's original form, on more modern hardware, the fidelity is rather better here. It also throws out the random encounters and goes with having your opponents visible on the map, and sports a neat positional combat system in which player and opponent positioning play a significant part, particularly when you start throwing out Area of Effect magic and skills. There's a pretty decent degree of character customisation as well.The story, well, I guess it's charming. Again, it's pretty throwback - if you are the sort who gets annoyed at modern anime trappings, there's actually probably not too much for you to be worried about here. I mean, the protagonist is a young lady, but manage to avoid a lot of what are generally considered the more negative ""moe"" stereotypes. Honestly, if I had a major complaint about the writing, it's that most of the really exciting stuff happens right as the game is wrapping up, but I guess that's what the forthcoming sequel is for.The game runs like a charm on less-than-premuim hardware (I ran it at 1080p output to the telly from an HTPC running an A6 with no additional GPU, and it pulled a constant 60fps without a single hiccup), though there's a couple of places (and I stress ""couple"" here) where it shows that it was originally formatted as a 4:3 rather than a widescreen game - be amused as you can see characters standing on the edge of the screen, ready to make their dramatic entries! It just adds to the charm I guess. Gamepad support is pretty decent, too, although I say that about anything I can play using an older DirectInput-style device (in my case, a PS3 Neo-Geo pad).			"

												I've played a lot of the standart RPG with this kind of graphic in my travels. The game is played with the mouse is very intuitive and easy to play. The battles are a tactical design with a fast and simple interface. THe magic system reminds me of the FFVII materia, but in this one you collect it from monsters and forge it into stuff you need, stacking different ones in certain ways will increase stats, damage and magical effects. Quest are stright forward with little in the way of meandering around not knowing what to do. Lastly you get item off monsters that can be used to make food for you to eat in and out of battle to keep you fighting fit.Mostly the story is on the long side when you wait for a bit to get the story moving but like all games in this style it more about the story that you play it not what you can do or when can you do it.Almost forgot the scroll wheel on the mouse rotates the map 360 degress so you can see the whole street and not be blind sided by a wall or tree.Game for the person who still want more FF			"

												A great game, though not without its faults of course. Specifics as follows: PROS:- Fascinating and engaging storyline with very little in the way of plot holes and the like.- Some of the best dialogue I've ever seen in a JRPG - period. I don't joke when I say the writing puts most of Square Enix's work to shame.- Outstanding characterization. This game has some of the best developed characters I've seen in an RPG. After about 15 hours of gameplay, you start to feel very close to the characters and you'll smile or feel saddened when they succeed or fail. And it's not just the main protoganists either, but also the supporting cast.- Gameplay is easy to get into and is fun to play around with.- Charming art styleCONS:- Though the dialogue is well written, sometimes conversations can go on a bit TOO long and wind up coming off as padding for the game's running time.- Occasionally buggy user interface. IE: Sometimes an item's description won't show up in the text box so you wind up wondering what the hell that item does. - Map design is a bit linear.- Not a whole lot in terms of extra things to do like mini games or what not. A small gripe.- The music (most of the time) is mediocre at best and flat out teeth grinding at worst. The tracks play on a very short loop and do not age well after the 20th time you've heard them. The game does have a FEW good tracks though.Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone, especially if you're a fan of old school style JRPG's. It includes all the tropes one would be used to with the genre and expands it to make something unique. I'm looking forward to starting the sequel, which I purchased immediately following the ending to this game.			"

												I played this game during a period when I didn't have much free time, so it took me 6 months to finish. I played it in sessions of 1-3 hours at a time and that worked very well for me. The game doesn't force you into sequences where you feel like you can't stop now.Also, the game has a calm, relaxing feeling to it. Most of the locations feel serene and immersive. For example, this game makes excellent use of it's in-town NPCs. They go about their daily lives with their own relationships, troubles and dreams. If you speak with them regularly as you are playing the game, you will find how their own stories evolve alongside yours and they often end in hilarity.Another good point about the world building is the game's sense of adventure. During the majority of the game there is no imminent evil that has to be defeated. The main characters just travel between different locations without having to chase a bad guy. This gives the feeling of a relaxing journey taken at a steady pace. This doesn't mean that there is no meaning to the characters actions and their travels. Over the course of the journey different events happen that foreshadow the main conflict and everything culminates satisfyingly at the end.However, there are no user choices that affect the main storyline. This game simply lets you follow the journey of the main characters. Thus, this game might not be for people that enjoy forging their own adventure.I'm not going to go into game mechanincs or other such specifics. This game has a very typical JRPG gameplay and is a well-crafted example of the genre. Unlike you might expect from a JRPG, there is not need for grinding sessions and I never felt the need for those.Overall, this game was a very pleasant experience for me. If you are looking for a relaxing game with a slower pace that you can pick and drop at any point, this is probably a good choice for you.			"

												UPDATE: Nominated for the reward thingy. Surely the best tearjerker in my library.I actually borrowed this game for the PSP last year (2013) and beat it days before the announcement that FC and SC were coming to steam. Once winter 2013 finally arrive in summer 2014 I bought multiple copies on steam to share the love. So obviously I loved it and I replayed it. I find this game to be very close to perfect. I won't compare it to other games because there is no need for that. It has everything I want in a RPG. Great characters, music, towns, NPCs, solid turn based combat with a nice touch of customization, and of course a great story. The pace of this game feels episodic to me because every quest has its own plot and every npc has their own thing going on. The gameplay is a bit old and it might scare away a lot of people but if you like slow paced (its really not that slow) games you should love this. Its pretty easy to rush forward and avoid battles but you will most likely get sidetracked by all the content and dialogue!			"

												 Truly, this game is the cream of the crop when it comes to JRPGs. The storyline and characters are fantastic, the battle system is fun, and the music is so catchy. This is an extremely text-heavy game, so if that's not your thing, this isn't the game for you. But as someone who loves rich storylines, Trails in the Sky is one of the best games in the genre that I've ever played. The world building and lore in this series is just amazing. Nearly every NPC in the game has a name, personality, and backstory. As you play through the game, you learn about the history of the country of LIberl, the relationships Liberl has with surrounding countries, and the current political situation that Liberl faces, as well as the factions that make Liberl function. The protagonists are part of one of these factions: The Bracer Guild, and even though you only see events in the game through their perspective, the game does a wonderful job of making it seem like there are many different perspectives of the story that you don't see. Put simply, this game almost comes alive. While I love this game to bits, there are couple of drawbacks.  Something I found occasionally annoying was the amount of walking in the game. Liberl has various regions that Estelle and Joshua travel through, and though there are some exceptions, you have to walk EVERYWHERE. There is no fast-travel mechanic, and when you add up the main storyline and the numerous quests, it's a lot of walking. Lastly, ALL of the sidequests in this game are on a time limit. If you happen to progress in the story too much and end up missing a request on the Guild board, either you reset or it's gone forever. And since these sidequests are the only way to move up in the Bracer Guild and get rewards, it's a pretty major loss to miss one. This is the case with some items as well, as some are region exclusive, and leaving a region means story progression which means the region you left is locked off. I would recommend that a guide be used with this game, as it is so incredibly easy to miss a lot of stuff. TL;DR:  amazing JRPG with killer plot, characters, lore, and gameplay, despite a couple drawbacks. It's worth every penny, and now that the second chapter is finally released, it's never been a better time to get this game.  "

												Amazing game. Storytelling, character development, classic turn-based combat, beautiful soundtrack, everything you would expect from a high quality JRPG. The graphics may be a little outdated, since it was first released in 2004 in Japan, but even so the artwork is gorgeous, the enviroments are highly detailed, and XSEED put a ton of effort to make it looks even better at 1080p.Also, I should mention the cliffhanger at the ending, so make sure to buy the second game before you finish your playthrough so you won't suffer waiting to know what happens next.

												After about chapter one or so there's no real combat advancement, and the game's loaded with combat.  You get access to all or nearly all the magic arts in the game, if you want them, early in chapter two.  There's a New Game + option but I can't see wanting to do it unless you wanted steam achievements.  Non combat gameplay situations are generally limited to exploration segments, which, although a nice idea, fall flat when the execution is to just have you drag Estelle around the perimeter looking for an (!) icon to open, inspecting it a few times, and then moving on.  You end up ""wardialing"" the event triggers.Dialog and characters have their moments, but can't save the storyline from being a disappointment.			"

												This game's combat system isn't very interesting and gets boring rather quickly. This game's story was uninteresting, the characters are almost never doing anything meaningful. The lack of an engaging story or a more complex battle-system leads me to question what other people actually like about this game. Sure this game was orginally released in 2004, but other games have aged better. I woudn't recommend spending time on this one.			"

												This game sucks, so lets start with it's redeeming qualities. The combat is kinda fine. I played on hard, and the areas you visist basicly level caps you, wich i like, becasue the game gets more challenging. However, on hard at least, almoste all major fight comes down to you spamming magic on the boss, becuase they have insanely high defence, so physical deal little to no damage on them. I even had the best equipment possible for every single region, but still wasen't able to deal much physical damage, wich maxed damage from orbments (this games ""materia system""). Apart from that, the battle is fine, even fun at times. The Orbments or ""materia (ff7)"" is sort of intresting, but the menuing makes it tedious trying to figure out what combos you need to get in order to get the magic you want. When you are in the Orbment menu, you have to press the exit button up to 3 times, then go to items, find the bracer guide book, enter it, search it's pages for the one that explains what combos you need to make to get what magic, then memorise it and go all the way back to the Orbment menu. The menu in general is pretty bad.After each battle you gain diffrently colored crystals wich you use to buy orbments to power up later. That system was fun, made each fight feel rewarding, more so then gaining som money and a random (often useless) item like most jrpg's do. The art and facial expressions then characters talk are pretty standard, so it gets a pass. The into and ending animations are well done.You are introduced to a big cast over the course of the game, wich is nice, so there should be a character you can like somewhere, although most characters are quite steriotypical. Now for the bad. Yeah i know, it's not much good...This game starts out instantly showing of what the rest of the game will be like, so if you like the first houer, you might like the rest of the game. It is extremly slow, there are tons of unneccisary dialouge that are supposed to emerse you into the world, but it missfires by a mile, only becoming tedious.Maybe it would be better if we could get some early intresting story that would drive us forward, but no, there is nothing for HOURS. You don't get a taste of the main plot until the end of chapter 2, wich for me was like 20h in, and then its just a tiny small bit of relevent story. If you like a LONG game, then this looks to be amazing, but it is long for all the wrong reasons.Speaking of slow. The battle animations are soooo slow. It's not a problem at the start of the game, but later on you will be forced to cast spells that have 20 second animations repeatedly on ridicolously tought bosses, becuase as i mentioned, quicker physical attacks have no effect on them.The mains story is very unintresting, with a villain that are supposed to be extremly cool and overly powerful, so the only reason in the end that you succed in doing anytihng is that you were manipulated all along. The game lays up big reveals wich are extremly obvious. The female main character is so stupid and naive it's sad. During the entire game people tell her that her father is a big warhero, she even get to see him preform amazing combat feats at one point. So in the last chapter, after we've heard over and over again how utterly amazing her father is, she is still totally surprised when someone mentions it. Maybe she suffers from memory loss.The developers are really proud over the character development, and how amazing personalities the charactes have. So proud in fact that they have to point it out several times, so that we know there have been character development. (As for any character development, the main character matures a tiny bit during the game, wich is not saying much since she is ridiculously clueless at the start and mid part of the game.)As for the quests, there are some that are ridiculously annoying, like you have to chase a cat pretty early on. You see the cat run into an alley, so you follow it and nothing happens. Run around the place and look everywhere, nothing happens. You have to enter the same street, but from a different direction for the cutscen to trigger..... But it gets worse.In chapter 3 the there is the worst quest in gaming history. You have to search the city for different things, based on clues, like you need to find a 3-eyed giant or something. What might that be? Well you dont know, because it is impossible to see what the game refers to as the ""3 eyes"" if you are scouting the city. When you press a really small lighthouse, the camera pans upwards, showing the lamp of the lighthouse, wich happen to have 3 sockets......... and then there are like 3 more clues to do, wich are almost as bad.There are tons of sidequest, and they are all quite generic. There are a few wich are okay.Overall, the game gets a 3/10.			"

												I originally played and finished this game on the PSP. Recommended for JRPG Fans. Fantastic story, awesome soundtrack (Jazz Fusion) and good characters. Very dialogue heavy, may not suit someone who wants constant action. I didn't find the game difficult, it is quite easy - I only ran into some issues when I was fighting monsters in an area I shouldn't be in yet. There are times where you will miss a sidequest (Not really important unless you want 100% bracer level at the end) because the storyline moves on and you can't go back. One of the quests only becomes available in a tower JUST before you move on to the next story arc (annoying!). There are also moments during quests where you need to make a decision, your choice will have an influence on your bracer score (if you care) and may alter enemy encounters. The magic system is pretty simple but some of the later AOE spells make other spells and melee redundant.			"

												This a is a Tried-and-True JRPG. BEAUTIFUL story that leaves you wanting for more. Classic turned based combat with plenty of insentive for strategy and not mindless attack,attack,attack every turn. Now with it's sequel lined up to be released Q1 2015 and the third installment in the works, the series looks like it will have a bright future for the american audience. You can easily have 100 plus hours of gameplay with the main story and plenty of side/hidden quests to boot.  I highly reccomend this game for anyone who is a fan of the JRPG genre and love for a story that will leave a lasting impression just like every extremely good anime you finished watching.			"

												Who Should Buy this Game?If like me you thoroughly enjoyed playing turn based JRPG’s before 3d gaming took off, then you will enjoy this title, you will get addicted. All of the characters are interesting, the plot is deep and interesting. While there is lot of dialog, very little of it is filler. Pros•	It will take a long time to complete both chapters, •	I was at a loss when I finished my 143 hour playthrough of first chapter and second  chapter, there’s not many companies producing games like this one•	Sadly, games are not made like this anymore. I wish more games had strong and likable cast of characters, good music and a fun and interesting plot with decent gameplay mechanics.•	You can retry battles, when you lose (Fights also get easier after each retry so you are              never stuck).•	Decent turn based strategy, with a variety of customizable skillsCons•	There is a ton of dialog, which can slow the pace of the game.•	There is no way of skipping or speeding-up battle animations.•	It’s easy to miss some quests. I missed some for the first guild before I got the hang of it.•	Agate (Though you will like him towards the end of SC)ConclusionTrails in the Sky has its problems, however they don’t ruin the experience. It is everything a decent JRPG should be. Many of these flaws can be overlooked depending on preference. Unlike the games mentioned above, Trails in the sky has an awesome story, that keeps getting better the deeper you get into the game.			"

												Great JRPG with some serious story/character development. Gonna start right out and say if you dislike dialoge heavy RPGs you'd best skip it, lolAnways, this is a turn-based JRPG with combat that involves a grid with players and enemies having a certain movement range and attack range - its not FF style where everyone lines up in a row and whacks each other. Spells are rather unique and vaguely similar to FF7's Materia in that each characater has an ""Orbment"" that they can slot ""Quartz"" into and depending on the color and amount of Quartz you'll aquire new spells for use - sorta confusing at first but it works out to allow you more character customization than most JRPGs.The game's story seems to be driven by the ""Bracer"" guild in which the main characters belong to. These Bracers take jobs at the guild job board and complete them. There are main Story jobs and then Minor jobs and quite a few at that! Its nice to have side quests more directed and meaningful, imo. The more jobs you complete the higher your guild rank increases and the better your rewards.All-in-all its a VERY solid JRPG with a great deal of humor but also isn't afraid to be serious. Most importantly, though, is its fun and addicting! This is most definitely one of the most in-depth and long JRPG stories you'll find, every NPC has many, many things to say as the story develops and you'll find yourself going back to them to see how they are responding to events and what changes they've undergone!

												I bought this game for my Vita a while back, taking a chance on a JRPG I had never heard of.  I was glad I did as it turned out to be one of the best experiences for the Vita.  Now, we have a PC version.I'll keep this simple for those who do not want to read a lot of text.  This game is very text heavy, so if that is a turn off for you, then you may want to skip this title.  For those who like to read text (like me) then this is highly recommended.   The battle system is turn based, but there is a movement grid involved which adds some variety to your typical old school JRPG.  Once again, if you like this style, then you should like this, if not, you may want to keep moving. The story starts off a little boring, but it gets better the more the game moves forward.  That is not the main draw for me as I kept playing to see the characters.  That is what makes the story so great is how much you want to see how they react to a given situation.I will leave it at that as you can look at the screenshots for the game to see the graphics.  Just know that I highly recommend it.			"

												Falcom is one of my favourite Japanese game developers.I have not found any crash, this digital version nor the physical Chinese version I bought many years back. So I can't really give comment on the game stability other than it works fine for me.The gameplay itself is simply the most traditional old school japanese RPG style gameplay.

												I'm only a little over an hour into this game and let me tell you my first impressions.First, as many have eloquently put, if you're a fan of JRPGs, this is for you. It's very much a JRPG and everything good that comes with it. The gameplay is great, battles promise a lot of diversity and the story offers just enough flexibility that you'll wonder, ""What if I didn't get Dad that paper?"" or ""What if I rushed in without Joshua?"" while still maintaining enough structure that you are experiencing a well thought out and developed experience. Such fluidity in the story and setting combined with excellent presentation allow you to feel that the world exists around you, which granted, may be preemptive of me to say, appears to be an accurate assessment of how the game is going to play out from here onward.But I do have some complaints in that it is a JRPG, and with that comes some grievances in dialogue and storytelling. It's great, don't get me wrong, the localization is of the highest grade and a clear amount of polish and love was put into not only translating the game from Japanese, but also adapting it so that nothing comes across as lost in translation. Of course, that being said, I couldn't help but twist my lips at how ""on point"" the characters appear at first glance. The retorts are sharp and witty, consistently, which to some may come across as scripted. Because they are. This may not bother you, as the dialogue is funny and witty and sophisticated, but it bothered me. This is a common trait of JRPGs and especially in the beginning of stories, and to this game's credit, it has a lot of story to establish in a short amount of time, so better to get it out of the way now. Hopefully the characters will humanize a little better later on.Also, keep in mind that this game is a port of a port of a game that was originally released on Japanese PC's way back in 2004, and while it has aged considerably well, if you're expecting the same kind of flashy graphics as in Agarest which embodies a similar art style, you'll get some of that, but just remember this game is over a decade old at this point. That isn't to say that, with that in consideration, the game isn't good looking and charming, because it is, but just keep that in mind.All in all, with just an hour into what is being toted as a 40-50 hour game, I'm looking forward to the remaining 39 hours. And at $16.99 at the time of writing, the price ain't half bad either.			"

												I would agree with other comments we all* want more JRPGs, this one is not bad with just a few hours I havent experienced the bugs that other are crying out. Regarding gameplay is easy, entertaining and most of all engaging. Somehow I find it hard to stop. Good enough for me and I am enjoying this game which is the important thing (for me at least).			"

												I can't say no to the actual game since it's a great game and it does run on windows 7. If you have issues running the game you need to set both config and the main exe as administrator rights. On Windows 8.1 however, which xseed says in compatible (and I have dual boot) it won't open at all. I've compatibilitied it, set it as admin rights, lowered the res, the textures and I have no idea what's up so if I were you I'd wait a little before buying it.			"

												Great JRPG with some serious story/character development. Gonna start right out and say if you dislike dialoge heavy RPGs you'd best skip it, lolAnways, this is a turn-based JRPG with combat that involves a grid with players and enemies having a certain movement range and attack range - its not FF style where everyone lines up in a row and whacks each other. Spells are rather unique and vaguely similar to FF7's Materia in that each characater has an ""Orbment"" that they can slot ""Quartz"" into and depending on the color and amount of Quartz you'll aquire new spells for use - sorta confusing at first but it works out to allow you more character customization than most JRPGs.The game's story seems to be driven by the ""Bracer"" guild in which the main characters belong to. These Bracers take jobs at the guild job board and complete them. There are main Story jobs and then Minor jobs and quite a few at that! Its nice to have side quests more directed and meaningful, imo. The more jobs you complete the higher your guild rank increases and the better your rewards.All-in-all its a VERY solid JRPG with a great deal of humor but also isn't afraid to be serious. Most importantly, though, is its fun and addicting! This is most definitely one of the most in-depth and long JRPG stories you'll find, every NPC has many, many things to say as the story develops and you'll find yourself going back to them to see how they are responding to events and what changes they've undergone!

												This a is a Tried-and-True JRPG. BEAUTIFUL story that leaves you wanting for more. Classic turned based combat with plenty of insentive for strategy and not mindless attack,attack,attack every turn. Now with it's sequel lined up to be released Q1 2015 and the third installment in the works, the series looks like it will have a bright future for the american audience. You can easily have 100 plus hours of gameplay with the main story and plenty of side/hidden quests to boot.  I highly reccomend this game for anyone who is a fan of the JRPG genre and love for a story that will leave a lasting impression just like every extremely good anime you finished watching.			"

												I remember playing this beauty years ago on the PSP & wishing that it had come to the console proper, I got my wish.  The game a stars teen siblings Estelle & Joshua Bright, who have just graduated from the Bracers Guild (a pseudo mercenary company).  Their father, a senior in this organization has been called away & they are expected to carry the weight of some responsibilities sooner then expected.  While the story is somewhat typical Jrpg fare,  one of the things to note is that NPCs do tend to say slightly different things depending on when you speak to them, there's seldom cookie cutter responses.  Combat, is both turn based & tactical. Once begun you can either move, attack, use Arts (magic), Crafts (special attacks), or trigger a unique & often powerful S-craft attack.  In the latter 3 cases there's a meter, magic costs a certain amount of points, while the Crafts meter is built up by either getting hit of hitting foes, S-Crafts have 2 tiers, at 100 you can do a certain amount of damage with it, but at 200 you can inflict a far more substantial amount of damage & is usually a 100% guaranteed hit on enemies.  While it's not necessarily one of those, ""easy to learn, tough to master"" type of things, there's a great deal of depth involved & no battle will be the same way twice simply based on how much you want to experiment in this. This also makes the inevitable level grinding less tedious then it otherwise would seem.  I'm still hoping that we get the other 2 chapters.   "

												I started playing this game back in PSP, and I must say, I don't regret re-buying it on Steam in the slightest. Nevertheless, my review shall cover things for those who haven't played the game yet.First, the story. If you don't mind slow-paced story in exchange for excellent world-building, then this game is for you. Why? Trails in the Sky takes it sweet time not only to develop its rich world and main characters, but also its truckload of NPCs. Each of them has their own story as well, making the game feels lively and vibrant.(Oh, and if you want stories with well-written female characters? Yes, this game is for you!)Second, the visual presentation. Falcom clearly put A LOT of love into the game's world and characters; see how detailed the character models are? The buildings? Those airships? The little road signs that you see along the way? One of the reasons why I don't regret replaying Trails in the Sky in PC is because of those small details, which help me to appreciate its world more.Next, the gameplay. The traditional turn-based/strategy mix fits the game's overall flow well; not too fast-paced, but also not to the point of being slow and boring. Also, despite its apparent simplicity, this game can easily kill you if you're tactless enough...which is something I learnt in REALLY hard way in a few of the boss fights. In addition, the sheer number of missable stuffs in this game gives good replay value.As for the soundtrack, I don't think there's anything to be said. It's Falcom, so it's bound to be awesome. ;)			"

												One of the sadder parts of video games is the lack of meeting games halfway and people putting their money where their mouths are. Trails in the Sky: First Chapter is one of those very special games that need both of those as, once you are one of those who can and will respectively, are rewarded very well.Trails FC is methodically paced, exacting, and defiantly true to its vision of the type of JRPG it is and is extremely strong for it. Dialog, world-building, characterization, theming, music, art paint the game splendidly as being as big as a nation yet as small as those little moments in Estelle and Joshua's journey. It's rare to get a writing crew that just lets characters talk and not only pull it off but use it to paint characters.The music is top-notch Soundteam_JDK quality, but more eclectic, experimental, and mellower than most are used to. Don't sleep on it!If you......want JRPGs ""like they used to be made""......like to rock out with JDK goodness......want your RPGs to have a believable, lived-in world to delve into......and lots of great characterization......you've found your next game(s).

												Hands down the best JRPG currently on Steam. The pacing is what some might consider slow, but that's because this game takes the time necessary to world build. The NPCs all have personality and history, and they interact with your party using dialogue that adjusts to changing conditions and updates after every single new plot point. This means that every character feels alive and the world really feels like a place, such that I was genuinely a bit sad to leave the first town because I'd miss all the NPCs I grew to know there. As seen in the screenshots, combat is a grid-based affair with free movement, magic, skills, and things similar to limit breaks. New spells and skills are unlocked by freely combining some gems together for each character, which means you customize much of what each character can do. This aspect, and the general feel of the combat, reminds me most of Grandia. There's also a cooking system where you learn recipes and gather ingredients to make restorative items if you want.			"

												I've never written a review for a Steam game. But I felt compelled to expound on how much I enjoyed this one. The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a great old-school JRPG with a well crafted world and characters that you'll come to know well, and hopefully enjoy as much as I did. The settings are bucolic, quaint and completely charming. The sky is always blue and your heroes are likeable, funny, and surprisingly realistic. It's just all so wholesome and fun. I ran through sixty hours of game time in about a week because I couldn't put this down.If you're a veteran of JRPGs, this will be very familiar territory. It's all a bit cliche, but the world building and story are so very well done that it's still enjoyable. Be warned that at least half of the game is simply spent reading dialog. Gameplay wise there isn't much to this. It's pretty basic JRPG style battles. The battle system is good though. I didn't feel like I had to grind to keep up. Enemies can sometimes be avoided when you just want to get on with it. There isn't anything revolutionary about the battles. I never found anything particularly challenging, but that wasn't what I was here for either.It was the charming characters and storyline that kept me coming back. There is always just enough foreshadowing to keep you hooked to see what happens next, even though you've probably guessed exactly what it will be. Going through the motions is still fun. I kept waiting for that moment, as there are in so many JRPGs, when the story would go from making sense to suddenly everything is wacky sci-fi-fantasy-weirdness. There are twists and turns, and of course heightened stakes, but things never go completely out of this world. It stays pretty grounded for the most part.If you're looking for just gameplay and action or difficult fights, you might find this a bit weak. But if you want a really well crafted world, fun characters and some solid enough JRPG fights to tie it all together check this out. I know this sounds like super high praise, but the closest thing I can think of to compare this to is Chrono Trigger. And it compares really favorably.I'll avoid spoilers, but will just say that I'm eagerly anticipating the sequel, which allegedly has been long promised, but is finally due for release in Summer 2015. Hope more people become aware of this little gem, and pick both it and the sequel up so that XSeed keeps releasing this series on Steam.			"

												Only have about an hour or so in the game. Graphics and Music are great. The best part was playing the first hour tutorial, then finally, Finally, get out into the world with all my new learned skills. WOOOT!! Die during the first area and get sent back to load screen. No problem, I'll give it another try. OH WTF!?!?! During my hour long tutorial I must have missed the part about having to MANUALLY SAVE somewhere in the main menu. Thanks a lot. That might be more important to know then where to place ♥♥♥♥ing jewels in my gear.....Other than that it's AWESOME!!			"

												Dat ending doe!Seriously speaking, I give the game about a 7/10. It's definitely worth a play through if you are a fan of 90s JPRGs. There were pacing issues throughout, and I wasn't always certain if/when I should explore each tower in a region, resulting in me missing one of the towers. :-/I really enjoyed the character development and the story, but I grew to hate having to scour a town upwards of 7 times just to hear unique dialog from a random townsperson. I liked the attention to detail, but my OCD and the fact that there are so many easily missed quests and items made me always doubting if I had missed something.			"

												Do I recommend this game? YES!!I am a fan of RPGs, especially if it is a turn-based JRPG. This game excelled at almost everything. Pros: - This game has a very rich story line which stretches out the storyline. (Which gives more room for character development).- Like I said above, there is tons of character devlopment.- AMAZING SOUNDTRACK!! The feel for the music fits perfectly with the setting. (I admit that I have sang the main theme countless times. If you're wondering, that's the song in the trailer). The composer for this game's soundtrack really did put a lot of effort into the music.- Very unique attack methods during a battle. For example, there is an Arts ability (magic) that you can achieve, that creates a tear in the space-time-continuum near your enemies.- Heart wrenching moments through out the game.- Hilarious moments through out the game.- Doesn't require any grinding to get through the game. (Well, you could if you wanted to overpower everything xD). Cons: - I experienced a glitch where sometimes I would open my Bracer Journal (basically a quest book), and there would be chuncks missing or the game would crash. - There isn't an auto-Save option so DO NOT FORGET TO SAVE! I learnt that the hard way.- The second chapter has not been released in English (yet)! D:Other than those minor cons, the game is AMAZING!!!  "

												I have just finished my first playthrough of the game after about 50 hours of play time. I think that I'm now qualified to give this gem the review it deserves!Games like The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky are certainly a rarity nowadays. Games that are story rich, character rich and driven by the characters as well as the story are very, very rare. This game's story is interesting, the characters are cool and very likable and they are BELIEVABLE. They aren't just NPCs along for the ride, they are dynamic, they change throughout the game. As for the gameplay itself, it's amazing. Haven't seen great handling like this since Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies. The graphics aren't the greatest, but the gameplay more than compensates for that.The battle sequences give me a good bit of nostalgia and remind me of all the great turn based JRPGs that I used to play on the Nintendo DS years ago. There are also main story quests as well as side quests. This game is no cake walk. You will die a lot if you aren't careful. Make sure you stock up on healing items! Also (for later in the game) make sure you buy EP Charges, as enemies later in the game have the ability to drain your EP.Grinding is not really a big part of the game, but I would certainly recommend it. When in a new area where the monsters are challenging and yield a good amount of XP or Sepith, I suggest you stay and fight them until you level up a few times. This is just to make sure that future boss battles are a ittle less of a kick in the pants.There are plenty of monsters in the game (not to mention a bestiary) and there's a good variety as well. There are also lots of items in the game, and some items are only attainable from certain areas, so make sure you look through an area loot up treasure chests!The boss monsters in the game are very well done! They are punishing, but not impossiblely difficult. There is ONE boss that I can think of that is pretty hard (not going to spoil it) but if you think about it, you'll know what to do when you come to it.The soundtrack is also very well done and it's unique to the game. THAT FINAL BOSS THEME THOUGH!Lastly, the final boss. The final boss is very, very difficult. Perhaps the most difficult final boss I've ever faced in any JRPG I've ever played. The only final boss in another game I can think of that measures up to it is Corvus from Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies. I died many times facing both if those bosses, so you can kind of understand where I'm coming from now.There's my review for one of the BEST JRPGs I have ever played. I highly recommend that you pick this title up, it is more than worth it!			"

												First off, I'm not a fan of turn based or strategy games and this game is a mix of both. I'm basically still at the beginning of the game so this review is likely to change as I get further in, but so far I have been enjoying the game quite a lot in story, characters, and combat. Like I said I'm only really at the beginning of the game so the real story hasn't kicked in yet but the dialogue between characters is interesting enough to keep me entertained. As far as the combat goes, I actually don't mind it at all and that's not something I can say about most turn based games and all strategy games. I've tried Final Fantasy, Fire Emblem, and many others but the only turn based games I can play are Earthbound and Undertale.Assuming this game will only get better once the story picks up, I assume and hope that this game will be the game that opens me up to turn based rpgs, then I can finally experience the plethora of turn based rpg games like I've always wanted. I will update this review as I play the game more, but so far I see a very bright future ahead of me as far as this game opening me up to a new world of rpgs. I can't wait to see what the genre has to offer. "

												I've never written a review for a Steam game. But I felt compelled to expound on how much I enjoyed this one. The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a great old-school JRPG with a well crafted world and characters that you'll come to know well, and hopefully enjoy as much as I did. The settings are bucolic, quaint and completely charming. The sky is always blue and your heroes are likeable, funny, and surprisingly realistic. It's just all so wholesome and fun. I ran through sixty hours of game time in about a week because I couldn't put this down.If you're a veteran of JRPGs, this will be very familiar territory. It's all a bit cliche, but the world building and story are so very well done that it's still enjoyable. Be warned that at least half of the game is simply spent reading dialog. Gameplay wise there isn't much to this. It's pretty basic JRPG style battles. The battle system is good though. I didn't feel like I had to grind to keep up. Enemies can sometimes be avoided when you just want to get on with it. There isn't anything revolutionary about the battles. I never found anything particularly challenging, but that wasn't what I was here for either.It was the charming characters and storyline that kept me coming back. There is always just enough foreshadowing to keep you hooked to see what happens next, even though you've probably guessed exactly what it will be. Going through the motions is still fun. I kept waiting for that moment, as there are in so many JRPGs, when the story would go from making sense to suddenly everything is wacky sci-fi-fantasy-weirdness. There are twists and turns, and of course heightened stakes, but things never go completely out of this world. It stays pretty grounded for the most part.If you're looking for just gameplay and action or difficult fights, you might find this a bit weak. But if you want a really well crafted world, fun characters and some solid enough JRPG fights to tie it all together check this out. I know this sounds like super high praise, but the closest thing I can think of to compare this to is Chrono Trigger. And it compares really favorably.I'll avoid spoilers, but will just say that I'm eagerly anticipating the sequel, which allegedly has been long promised, but is finally due for release in Summer 2015. Hope more people become aware of this little gem, and pick both it and the sequel up so that XSeed keeps releasing this series on Steam.			"

												Where to start? Trails in the sky is a gem of a JRPG. The characters are great and 3 dimensional and each gets their own share of the spotlight and character development. The combat, though a little strange at first, is easy to understand but harder to fully master. The game is broken up into five segments  each segment has their own little story with a bigger story unravaling as each segment becomes completed. This keeps the story from becoming stale and as mentioned before gives each character time to shine.If you are craving a big RPG like I sometimes do, then look no further than The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky. You will enjoy the ride and look forward to the english release of the second chapter scheduled to come sometime in 2015. "

												The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky - A Story Driven Tactics RPGSo I'm going to cut to the chase, I really love this game. If you enjoy a good story that evolves as it progresses and can handle somewhat basic battle systems, you will enjoy this game.This game originally came out back in 2006 and recently was moved to Steam. So its to be expected the graphics are not the best, but it was charming. However, the story told through these graphics is very awesome.At first you might see the story as fairly clean and friendly, but it becomes more and more rich as the game goes on. You meet new characters, unravel plenty of mysteries and the ending is a giant tease.As for gameplay, the game play much like any tactics style RPG. Though despite similarities, it still manages to stay refreshing. The biggest downside is that it pretty much relys on its elemental resistances and main attack vs magic attack and doesn't get any more challenging. They do however, use this system to create some fairly difficult battles in the later part of the game.I apologize for this review being much smaller than my others, but I was putting off writing this and decided I would just get it out there to let the world know how awesome this game is.Verdict (1 meaning the worst, 5 being par and 10 being the best): I give this game a 7. I wanted to give it a 9 because I personally enjoyed the game a lot, however, its an older game in a newer market. Awesome soundtrack too btw.			"

The combat system is also good, but also pretty brutal. There's no easy grind, and even in the starting areas you can get KO'ed easily. I like the leveling and magic system as well.

												Old School Jprg, with some decent mechanics. Combat does get a bit repetetive, and there are certain spells that are just so much better then anything else.Storyline in my opinion is pretty good, and altough there are no japanese voices, there are really very few voicefiles in the games, so you're not missing much there. Lots of text tough, but that's just the way i like it :)I can't comment much on the accuracy of the translation, but quality wise what's written feels like the game is originally english, so it's not just a direct translation, which in many\most cases would be bad.Now just waiting for the sequel to be translated and released :)			"

												Really enjoyed the nostalgic touch to the game! If you are looking for oldschool-feel RPGs that are more story-content/script driven and just an overall adventurous feel to it, this game is right up your alley! I loved the variety of characters involved.Pros:-Nostalgic feel/Has the adventurous and optimisticness-Impressive use of available graphic content to make believable dungeon/outdoor/indoor decors-Lots of scripting and attention to detail, even miniature side plots were taken into account-Graphics are great, leaves a little room for the imagination and the characters all look and feel unique-Story is compelling, makes you want more. Music is good as wellCons:-Battle system idea is great, however the tactical combat could use a bit of work to allow more complex battle strategies since it got a bit repetitive near the end-I was looking forward to more hidden rooms/quests, side quests, and aftermath content-I actually didn't use any food for the entire game, maybe items can be balanced more-While the quartz system is good, aside from S crafts I would probably give the characters their own unique quartz/spells and affinity/stats boost to certain elements "

												I had a really good time with this game so far, so much so that I don't want to finish it, yet!  I am towards the end, but if you are like me, sometimes you don't want a story to end and you sort of put off finishing it. There are some unique elements to this game I feel, and recapping, I don't know if I want to lay them all out in great detail just right now. Legend of Heroes sort of takes me back to feelings of Secret of Mana and some classic style RPG's, yet it has some modern integrations regarding menus and it's ""magic"" and battle options.  I don't know - it feels like a revamped classic style RPG.Anyway, I would pick this up for $10-15 if you catch it. I think it's going for a little more than that as I write this. Fun, nostalgic type gameplay that should scratch any JRPG itch you may be having.			"

												Amazing Game, let start simple on a few pointsCombat: its amazing the way it works and the field is spread out is good the turn counter on the side is well done and i have not once felt screwed by the buffs it can give through out the combat. The orbament system for the combat is amazing i can set up any character to be the way i want them to be to do different roles ontop of their already unique setup.Orbament system: sure there have been other games to use this and im very sure it may remind people of FF7 materia but its different in a good way, each orbament can synergize and if u do it right you can get amazingly powerful skills. its great because you can find them or just make them yourself with Septium shards which is a great way to let your characters progress.Cooking: master chef over here likes cooking everything and you know you can do that cooking is rewarding and you can save a lot of money in the game by just cooking foods.Chests: i always make jokes about chests after looting them, why is it that our heroes in these RPGS always loot everything, poor chests are just doing a job protecting what was put in them just for our heroes to take them, now they respond with comments and jokes, atleast they arent being mean about it.Story: story is great the pacing is nice but it is a little slow at the start , you fall in  love with the characters though they are great and its the character progression thats really nice within the story.Quests!: your quests in the bracer guild are nice the board and the timers to do it make it actually seem that someone needs your help and theres a timer ( where we can assume a different bracer took the job if you dont do it) that when its over you cant do it anymore, the mainstory quest is great but these side quests feel rewarding too.im sure its sequels are coming out eventually and to my dismay it wont be fast enough but either way amazingIn general a game i recommend to anyone who likes rpgs or jrpgs 15/10 .some slight bugs with chests for the achievement( i did a full run with guides to get every chest and i was still missing two by the end , this may be a case of chests repeating previous quotes and not giving new ones if you are unlucky)			"

												I have just finished my first playthrough of the game after about 50 hours of play time. I think that I'm now qualified to give this gem the review it deserves!Games like The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky are certainly a rarity nowadays. Games that are story rich, character rich and driven by the characters as well as the story are very, very rare. This game's story is interesting, the characters are cool and very likable and they are BELIEVABLE. They aren't just NPCs along for the ride, they are dynamic, they change throughout the game. As for the gameplay itself, it's amazing. Haven't seen great handling like this since Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies. The graphics aren't the greatest, but the gameplay more than compensates for that.The battle sequences give me a good bit of nostalgia and remind me of all the great turn based JRPGs that I used to play on the Nintendo DS years ago. There are also main story quests as well as side quests. This game is no cake walk. You will die a lot if you aren't careful. Make sure you stock up on healing items! Also (for later in the game) make sure you buy EP Charges, as enemies later in the game have the ability to drain your EP.Grinding is not really a big part of the game, but I would certainly recommend it. When in a new area where the monsters are challenging and yield a good amount of XP or Sepith, I suggest you stay and fight them until you level up a few times. This is just to make sure that future boss battles are a ittle less of a kick in the pants.There are plenty of monsters in the game (not to mention a bestiary) and there's a good variety as well. There are also lots of items in the game, and some items are only attainable from certain areas, so make sure you look through an area loot up treasure chests!The boss monsters in the game are very well done! They are punishing, but not impossiblely difficult. There is ONE boss that I can think of that is pretty hard (not going to spoil it) but if you think about it, you'll know what to do when you come to it.The soundtrack is also very well done and it's unique to the game. THAT FINAL BOSS THEME THOUGH!Lastly, the final boss. The final boss is very, very difficult. Perhaps the most difficult final boss I've ever faced in any JRPG I've ever played. The only final boss in another game I can think of that measures up to it is Corvus from Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies. I died many times facing both if those bosses, so you can kind of understand where I'm coming from now.There's my review for one of the BEST JRPGs I have ever played. I highly recommend that you pick this title up, it is more than worth it!			"

												Really enjoyed the nostalgic touch to the game! If you are looking for oldschool-feel RPGs that are more story-content/script driven and just an overall adventurous feel to it, this game is right up your alley! I loved the variety of characters involved.Pros:-Nostalgic feel/Has the adventurous and optimisticness-Impressive use of available graphic content to make believable dungeon/outdoor/indoor decors-Lots of scripting and attention to detail, even miniature side plots were taken into account-Graphics are great, leaves a little room for the imagination and the characters all look and feel unique-Story is compelling, makes you want more. Music is good as wellCons:-Battle system idea is great, however the tactical combat could use a bit of work to allow more complex battle strategies since it got a bit repetitive near the end-I was looking forward to more hidden rooms/quests, side quests, and aftermath content-I actually didn't use any food for the entire game, maybe items can be balanced more-While the quartz system is good, aside from S crafts I would probably give the characters their own unique quartz/spells and affinity/stats boost to certain elements "

												I had a really good time with this game so far, so much so that I don't want to finish it, yet!  I am towards the end, but if you are like me, sometimes you don't want a story to end and you sort of put off finishing it. There are some unique elements to this game I feel, and recapping, I don't know if I want to lay them all out in great detail just right now. Legend of Heroes sort of takes me back to feelings of Secret of Mana and some classic style RPG's, yet it has some modern integrations regarding menus and it's ""magic"" and battle options.  I don't know - it feels like a revamped classic style RPG.Anyway, I would pick this up for $10-15 if you catch it. I think it's going for a little more than that as I write this. Fun, nostalgic type gameplay that should scratch any JRPG itch you may be having.			"

												I really love this game. I prefer turn based games versus the more popular real time fighting styles, which makes it rather tricky to find a game that I like for pc, as I don't have a different gaming console. This game is much better than I thought it would be. I hadn't heard of it before, so didn't know its anime, or PSP renditions going in. The game is much more complicated than I anticipated (the prologue was a little confusing for me with the orbs, quartz, etc, when I was just reading through the explanations), but it quickly fell into place and was pretty straight forward. The heroine is a little annoying at times, but she is a sheltered, headstrong 16-year-old, and the other characters call her on it, and she is an interesting foil to Joshua, the male lead. As the game progresses, her behavior matures a bit, which is rather astonishing to have character development in a game like this.My only complaint about this game is to do with the conversations. THere are A LOT, and you can hold down a key to try and speed through the speech bubbles, but that doesn't help much. It gets annoying very fast, and very tedious, especially since there isn't a way to exit out of a conversation, and EVERY NPC has dialogue. In its sequels, I hope this is changed. Some chapters have so much dialogue, you have to take frequent breaks to not get frustrated (at least, I did). The game has replayability factor, is incredibly detailed, and the vernacular is great! There are allusions to sexuality, but it is not blatant, no boob armor, and the humor isn't overdone. It really is a very good game. I am tempted to get a console to play its sequels that have been released already in other mediums.			"

												First off, I'm not a fan of turn based or strategy games and this game is a mix of both. I'm basically still at the beginning of the game so this review is likely to change as I get further in, but so far I have been enjoying the game quite a lot in story, characters, and combat. Like I said I'm only really at the beginning of the game so the real story hasn't kicked in yet but the dialogue between characters is interesting enough to keep me entertained. As far as the combat goes, I actually don't mind it at all and that's not something I can say about most turn based games and all strategy games. I've tried Final Fantasy, Fire Emblem, and many others but the only turn based games I can play are Earthbound and Undertale.Assuming this game will only get better once the story picks up, I assume and hope that this game will be the game that opens me up to turn based rpgs, then I can finally experience the plethora of turn based rpg games like I've always wanted. I will update this review as I play the game more, but so far I see a very bright future ahead of me as far as this game opening me up to a new world of rpgs. I can't wait to see what the genre has to offer. "

Product received for free
												To start off with The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a perfectly decent stereotypical JRPG, with magic, machinery, and spunky young kids out on an adventure.But that's the problem, this game is stereotyped in every way. The plot is perfectly predictable, with a final act twist that a blind person could see coming, and really doesn't develop any original themes. The characters all fulfill the archetypal roles of hot-head female protagonist, perfectly normal protagonist with a mysterious past, hypersexual tag-along (there's more than one), cutesy genius who has no right to be fighting monsters, etc. This would also be forgivable, but there's very little character growth, sure there's enough development of each character's backstories to make them each feel like their own person, but aside from the two main protagonists, each of them ends up feeling like a one-note joke. It was difficult to develop any real attachment to the characters, especially as the game cycled them in and out of the party as story demanded.The most egregious part of the game however is the battle system. It's boring, slow, and punishing if you don't read the in-game manual about customizing your arts. The arts system is derivative of other past RPG systems. Think the materia system in Final Fantasy VII but with less materia. By the end game, some characters are clearly just better regardless of their stats or eqipment based purely on how flexible their own ""grid"" is. It seemed unnecessary to limit characters like that, and ultimately felt unbalanced.Now I've probably done a poor job of balancing my positive and negative comments here, these are just my observations. My criticisms above aren't game-breaking, but they do make it difficult to recommend this game to anyone other than a die-hard JRPG fan in need of their next fix. Because if that what you're looking for then this game will scratch that itch. But for anyone else, while this is a perfectly serviceable game, spare yourself the 20+ hours that could be spent elsewhere.			"

												Now I bought Trails some time ago and I’ve played a decent chunk of it. I’ve heard nothing but good things about the game and that its one of the finest examples of a JRPG. I haven’t touched it in some time, and while I had some fun playing it, glancing at it again in my Steam installed library made me realize that I have absolutely no desire to go back to it. One major reason is the writing. The game is quite text heavy, but I actually enjoy wordy games if they’re well written. (I love the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Planescape, Longest Journey, and Shadowrun HK for example) Trails does have a lot of attention to detail and it has its charm because of that, chests will always say something if you inspect them twice and townspeople will change their dialogue after pretty much each plot flag. The problem comes in that while Trails has a lot of dialogue it does nothing interesting with it. The main cast are all just bland anime clichés and the mountains of text do nothing to change them away from this. Like it’s cool that the protagonist, Estelle, is a girl, but she’s straight up your bog standard dumbass meathead shonen hero with the only difference being she’s not a dude. The game is glacially slow and while I don’t mind slow paced games at all, they need some hook to keep me going. All Trails had was just more stock anime shenanigans and really sloggy, grindy combat which is the biggest reason why I don’t want to go back to it.I’m mindful of how old the game actually is, but even that’s no excuse. Shadow Hearts Covenant came out the same year and it blows Trails completely out of the water in practically every way. Ultimately Trails is a really mediocre game. There are much more interesting RPGs you could be playing instead on Steam such as LISA, Witcher 3, and Undertale.			"

												Pros:There's a really cool skill system in this game - the orbment and quartz system allows for a ton of different skill buildouts, and gives you some significant flexibility despite having a small party. The battle system is interesting, and combined with the orbment system, there's a lot of different ways you can fight. You can have a party that is slow, but hits like a truck, or a party that dances around dropping status effects and delaying the enemy. Cons:The dialog is SOOOOOOOO tedious. The characters never stop talking, and very rarely have anything interesting to say - its like every conversation is 5 or 6 dialog boxes longer than it should be, and over the course of a game with dozens and dozens of quests - that gets super tedious. The game's quests are heavily structured, and don't allow you to shortcut anything - if someone asks you to nail two boards together,  you need to go find the npc with the hammer, go back to the quest giver npc, he'll tell you ""oh, you need a hammer"", go back to hammer-guy, get your hammer, then repeat all the same steps to get the nail. You can't just say ""I need a hammer and nail"" and go talk to the hammer guy, nail guy, and then come back with both. There's a ton of time just walking back and forth and that's not a lot of fun. The game has a 'bounty' system, and rewards you for doing these little bounty quests - they expire quickly as the story moves forward though, which always agravates me and reminds me that I'm playing a game, not involved in some sort of epic quest - Pirates are about to kill the mayor's daughter, but I'm gonna run halfway across the continent to fetch a magic lantern that some random wizard needs because the quest will be gone if I save the daughter - she's okay to wait. There's a really good 15-20 hr game in there somewhere, but the problem is that its going to take you 50+ hrs to play.

												I'm about 8 hours in and so far I have enjoyed it. I was a big fan of JRPG's back when I was a kid playing Super Nintendo and JRPG's were basically the only rpg's you could play on console. The story starts off slow as you do small tasks for a group called the Bracers. The Bracers are like the cops of the world, going around protecting people, killing monsters and performing all types of tasks to make the world a better place. The problem I have with JRPG's now uh day's is that they are usually too kiddie and cute for my 31 year old brain to handle and I was worried that this game would be no different considering that the two characters you play as are 16 years old but the story is pretty good and does have more adult oriented things going on that satisfy my need for a mature themed story. The combat is good and I like the inclusion of orbments in the game because they remind me of the matreia system in Final Fantasy 7. I was having trouble with the game crashing a lot when I first started playing which really was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off so I was saving every 2 minuets but there have been a few updates since and I have had no problems with crashing at all since then. So now I can definitely recommend this game to anyone into JRPG's for sure. I may come back with more thoughts after I complete the game but for now I will leave my review as is.			"

												Well... it's cute, I'll give it that. I'm not really sure what I was expecting when I pick this up, I've always had a thing for aviation and fantasy airships in particular so I guess the title just resonated with me. It's not what I was hoping for, but it's not like I dislike it either.Okay let me start by saying that if you're hoping for combat with any kind of significant depth you can slow your roll right now, this games combat isn't very challenging or fun. I get the feeling it's aimed at a younger crowd, so they simplified or removed the kind of options you'd expect from this kind of turn based combat, unfortunately in doing so they basically made it so that the only tactic is ""hit them faster and harder than they hit you"" which essentially amounts to spamming the attack option with the occasional skill or magic thrown in to deal with status effect enemies or bosses, and only because they're irritating not because they're a significant threat.If you're still reading this then there's still a chance you might like this game. As I said earlier, it's very cute. The stories pretty simple, the character designs are ""soft"" for lack of a better term, including the monsters and they have those always-sunny personalities you'd normally expect from an anime... actually just think of this as playing an anime, there's a manga and anime adaptation of it out and I'm not sure which came first. If the game did then it definitely adopts a bunch of tropes from the genre. The two main protagonists are young adventurers (probably early to mid teens, can't really remember) and as a result most of the side quests you end up doing are fairly small, like helping someone find a lost cat or helping out at a farm. While this may sound boring it's actually the bit of this game I look back on with the most fondness, there's something endearing about the characters and atmosphere so watching them interact naturally without trying to be serious was fun. In fact I'd go so far as to say that the stories really the only reason one would want to play this, it may be fairly simple but it's pretty long and the characters are likeable enough to carry it through despite the lacklustre combat.There are several sequences through the game that are rather small but I really enjoyed that involved investigating a crime. Basically you happen upon the various scenes and have to look for clues to piece together what happened. Not all of them are made obvious to you and you have to put in a bit of thought to connect the dots. I almost wish the entire game had been designed with this in mind over combat, finding all the clues and piecing the evidence together felt much more rewarding than any combat encounter had.The Tl;Dr is that even if it wasn't the most fun or exciting game I've played it was an enjoyable experience. The combat's boring as sin but the characters and a few interesting features are enough to keep you going assuming you don't mind anime-esque or cutesy stuff. It's the gaming equivalent of that contented feeling you get when you're curled up with a good book and a warm drink.			"

												I honestly really loved this game. It's a great PC Port, the mouse control is extremely welcome for moving your character. The story is brilliant, dialogue is funny and well written. The difficult is kind of meh, but the battle system is pretty enjoyable. It does sequel bait well where you feel satisfied but leaves enough plot threads that you want more. Took me 27 hours to beat and that was ignoring almost all the side-quests and optional dialogue. This is a bare minimum 50 hour 100% completion game. I don't know what the hell else you want in an RPG. Brilliant game, absolutely adored it.			"

												For a jrpg I found this reminding me of the old ultima and final fantasy games. Game play is easy to understand and use. Graphics are pretty amazing. Combat and level scaling are just right.You do have to grind for money however, but given the type of game it is expected.No real bugs or problems to report.The story line is top notch. The only shame is that the producers of the game don't plan on continuing the rest of the series, so you are kind of left hanging at the end. They did sc, and that's it. Apparently their translation team costs them too much, but given that it took them over two years just to do the translation makes me wonder what kind of rag tag team they actually have.Update: as of march there is hope for the third installment. Of course, we will all still be waiting to see if they ever convert the cold steel series to pc, which is still doubtful. It's vastly more positive than their previous statements that relayed there wouldn't be a conversion of the rest of the series. Hopefully it will actually be out by spring of 2017, the last one took them several years. . .			"

A standard RPG with nothing too fancy.When I say I don't recommend this game, it doesn't mean it's inherently bad. This is a standard RPG in the classic sense that will take you 30-50 hours depending how much you put in the game.The meat of the game is unfortunately reading. I didn't have a problem with this and read every bit without forgetting anything but to some it might be a bit much especially when there's no cutscenes/voice acting. The writting is decent although grating at times due to some of the characters' personality. Most times you'll be itching to fight due to long instances where there is a lot of talking.You get your basic RPG elements that doesn't surprise at all. You only get to upgrade your equipment once when you reach a new town which leaves not much options to deck out your character. Money is short in the game unless you do sidequests or sell your gems. The orbament system (how you get spells/bonus status) in the game is interesting but can take a long time to grind out the best gems and even then there's not a whole lot of different spells in the game to utilize.Fighting is what you expect, turn-based combat with its' own style. You'll face enemies that can be frustrating due to some constantly reviving, healing and calling for help. Enemies can be weak to certain elements but it's rare that you'll get to use it to your advantage. Bosses are of course resistant to everything with a few exceptions. Some fights are challenging and some are near impossible due to party members leaving and going. I had to skip a few optional quests because I had full party but then someone left because of story advancement.One thing I did love about the game was the graphics. I got a ""Super Mario RPG"" sort of feel which made Trails charming. The animations and sprites were great too and of course made you feel nostaglic. The steampunk elements was icing on the cake.If you're looking for a familar road with no surprises this is your game. If you're wondering if it's a game worth investing 50 hours in, I would reconsider.			"

												If you want more translations of JRPG in Steam, buy this game. The second part is annonced for End of 2014. This game is fun, if you like (easy) tactic JRPGI started it, and I couldn't stop playing it for 7 hours. After seven hours, I barely made it through the prelude. The fighting system is a light version of some tactical Atlus games like Chaos Wars, and the magic system has a little bit from FF7 Materia system, except that you insert the ""Quartz"" into your character.The story so far is lighthearted, guild mission based, almost like Atelier Iris, except that you have to wander through a ""real"" land, without a timelimit.This is a real JRPG, a translation from the PS3 and Vita. These game were normaly not translated.  And the developer almost gave up, would they have not translated Y's for Steam.The downside, however are bugs. I had to deactivate the highdefinition fonts, due crashes in the menues. After deactivating them, the game runs very stable.I can recommend this game, because I started to search this morning for more games of this serie. This is a sure sign for me, that I liked it so much, I wanted to play more parts of it.			"

												I'm going to be honest here.... I like the game but it was betrayed by the storyline - specifically the ending (which was spoiled for me). I went through the game with expectations the game did NOT live up to. I cant discuss this in greater detail without spoiling but the end completely and utterly ruined the storyline for me. I have to call BETRAYL on the ending and I doubt its for the reason you're expecting if you WANT to hear why I'll put in down the page a bit...-------Okay? Spoiler time!Joshua doesn't die. I went through the ENTIRE game hating this character but I was thinking they would kill him off or turn him into the villian. This kinda ruined the stroyline for me.... I couldn't take it... I know it's just me and if you can stand this guy you can have him and this series with my blessing. I'm out though... not gonna play any more or buy the sequel. Maybe other games in the series that don't include him.			"

												This is a great game.  It does have some issues though, but they are easy to overcome or work through.PRO:Camera can move to show any hidden areasThe story (so far) is not the normal ""someone died now you have to avenge them""Lots of side missionsMonsters come back, that makes it easy to grind if you need anything.Con:No fast travel that I can see and the monsters comeback after you leave the area.  this makes walking back to town long.You burn through your magic power fast and with not much money in the game it is hard to stay ontop of it. In the first mission there is a place to rest and refill everyting, but this doesn't exist any where else i can seeOne that is in both is that during battle the mouse auto moves to the last thing you selected.  If you are not careful and you click attack you can attack blank space, meaning your person moves to that location and you lose a turn. "

												I wrote a huge review here and realised that all I need to say is this.Everything in this game takes forever. Dialogues go on for ages explaining things you've heard tonnes of times already. Fights contain loads of unskippable animations that all take 30 or 40 seconds, the game often forces you to watch NPCs fighting one another and it all comes together to become a grinding horrendous process.I got to the final bosses and everything just takes so long that I can't be bothered any more. It's not fun and the story isn't engaging enough for me to want to know what happens next. I just want it to be over.There's so many interesting mechanics - like the orbment slots, the characters having their own special moves and the buffs you get in combat based on who is taking their turn at a paticular moment. But they're all meaningless, you haven't got enough control over them to actually plan around them. All that really matters is ""Does this attack have a huge AoE"" and it becomes more and more and more tedious.			"

												78 hours and I've finally finished this game. I played to the end, not necessarily because I wanted to, but so I could be as objective as possible in my review of it. This is a game that has a lot of rave reviews, but I think there should be more reviews that point out the real flaws in this game fairly.Trails in the Sky was released in 2004, so it has some interesting traits similar to the golden age of JRPGs, but it also has some modern gamer friendly mechanics. If you're a fan of 90s anime, there are a lot of aspects of the story you may enjoy, especially if you're a fan of Slayers or Bakuretsu Hunters. All encounters are visible on the screen, and you can run from just about all of them.The story is also text heavy, and while it is incredibly heavy on anime tropes, it at least tries to back up its tropes with some sober characterization. For instance, there's a bathouse scene (because of course there is), and while it ends in embarassment and high emotions, it isn't a beeline to wonton violence that's done over and over again.This is the best part, and the worst part, about Trails in the Sky FC. It's just so safe and generic, but it's slightly different enough to get people to give it a try, at least that's my theory.The main character Estelle is likable enough, but despite a few gender-specific themes that pop up in the last chapter, the game's themes are about growing up and getting stronger. Generally this story is told from the perspective of some young boy, so it's nice to see it from a woman's point of view. Having said that, Joshua her adopted brother plays an important role in the story as well, and the small interactions between the two can make up the most heartwarming aspects of the story.These are the things that people bring up when they talk about why they liked the game. And if what I wrote above interests you, and you've never played a JRPG before or never watched any anime made before 2001, then you'll most likely enjoy Trails in the Sky FC.But if not, you'll probably find the game just as grindy and mind numbingly boring as I did. The game plays it safe in every facet, only changing minor parts of the story or characters to come off as different. The game is four chapters long, but each chapter is padded with fetch quests that rely on an extensive use of backtracking. Further exacerbating the issue is the fact that combat drags on for far too long, with each little animation and spell taking 15-20 seconds per turn, and all enemies having inflated HP pools making it impossible to one hit kill most enemies. You can skip the extra-long S-Craft attacks, but everything else from spells to giving someone a healing item takes a glacial epoch compared to speedier games like Bravely Default, Persona or I am Setsuna.On top of that, there is a LOT of dialogue, not all of it necessary, and no option to increase the text speed, so you're forced to hit the B button quickly to get all of the text, but not soo quick as to skip over a line. And a lack of a chat log means if you miss a line of dialogue it's over. Not that any of the dialogue is really revolutionary or worthwhile to begin with.The trouble is The Legend of Heroes is in a class of games that includes Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest and Mother. These are heavyweight games with characters alive and enjoyable. Epic tales of adventure and drama. Trails in the Sky is like the kid in class who is comfortable only getting C's. Your companions are the busty sexy older girl with the stock haughty anime laugh, the egotistical sex-obsessed molest bro, the magic girl who may not be all she appears to be, the angry tough guy who thinks he's better than everyone and the big dumb fighter... Oh, and the little girl who joins you for a chapter and is exactly what you're picturing right now. In fact, you now know everything you need to know about the main cast.While each of these characters has a flimsy pretense for following lock-step into dated anime tropes, none of them fully pull of being genuine.Even the NPCs are exactly what they appear to be precisely when they show up on screen. Trails in the Sky is not a game that wants to surprise you. You will be able to guess exactly who is involved in the government conspiracy plot (because of course there is one) and how within the first five minutes of them being introduced. Every NPC also has a name and a continuing narrative that threads throughout each chapter, something this series is known for, but none of these stories are engaging or interesting. It's nice that the writers at Falcom sat down to make a world that's persistent, but they forgot to fill it with stories that anyone would care about.I really wanted to like this game after the praise, and it's not like there's a lot of good JRPGs around nowadays. But this is not THE game everyone makes it out to be. I think if you've only been playing JRPGs since 2005 and never got the chance to play the classic PSX and SNES titles then you'll get something out of this game, but do yourself a favor and buy an old school system and play one of those games. Or try some of the newer (post-2000) JRPGs, like Mother 3, Bravely Default or Tales of Vesperia.Or just pop in an old Record of Lodoss war VHS tape and down a bottle of Codeine. It'll have the same effect.			"

												If you're looking for a cute 2D JRPG with a mini-sphere grid-esque ability system, turn-based tile combat and goofy dialogue then Trails in the Sky is right up your alley.Personally I cannot bear myself to push through another minute of this game. The combat is pretty tedious due to the long animations, and more often than not you will just resort to letting the dimwitted AI pile into an AoE spell you set up in front of your characters.Despite the dialogue sometimes being genuinely funny and intriguing, the plot and main/minor characters are terribly cliche. The side characters in particular are boring archetypes vomitting out tired lines from any generic B-list anime you could think of.Unless you can find some way to get invested in the stagnant puddle deep plot, Trails is a complete and utter slog of a game.

												Why are you still down here reading reveiws? Go click that buy button.Still down here? You say you want an ACTUAL reveiw? Well, okay. The games good. Real good compared to the standard of most 2D JRPGs released these days (granted this is an older game, but if you've never played it before then it's new to you).What? You're STILL here? Fine. The music is very good with most of the town and important event scenes all different renditions of the same theme. You think that's boring? Well it's not. The battle music also changes depending on how well your doing. The art style still holds strong despite something called 3D graphics or some such other being all the rage these days. The game is challenging, but not too difficult, and you can increase the difficulty after you beat the game. The characters are genuinely interesting and make you want to keep playing to find out what happens to them. The story, well, it shares elements from other stories yes, but what story dosn't these days? Despite that, its still fun, keeps you guessing, has a good touch of humor, and a lot of emotion. A breath of fresh air from an industry inundated with shovelware and first person shooter/clubber/e'splore titles.			"

												Trails in the Sky is one of the best JRPGs for PC. It's an oldschool JRPG similar to the PS1 era but also comes with modern elements. It has good characters with unique personality, the story is interesting, the battle system allows you to move freely but that doesn't mean it's a strategy RPG, it's just a turn-based system that let you move your characters.This game is a must, if you love JRPG.+Characters+Story+Gameplay+Soundtracks+Replay value+Auto-save function-Control mapping (you may need a third party controller mapping software)-A lot of missable content (you need a good walktrought for 100% complete but the game is still fun without sidequests though)Score: 9.5/10			"

												Some of the reviewers in the ""positive"" section must be confusing ""story-heavy"" with ""dialog-heavy"". ""Story-heavy"" implies a deep scenario, with surprising events and/or deep characters. ""Dialog-heavy"" is...basically Trails in the Sky. An insane amount of dialogs, most of it pointless, useless and poorly written, a complete waste of time.Any cut-scene (and there are maaaaaany, and they are looooong), is just an opportunity to show that Estelle, the first protagonist, is a klutz, but it's OK because Joshua, the second protagonist, knows she means well and anyway he is in love with her and everybody can see it except her. And that kind of scenes will repeat over and over. Hints of deeper mysteries in the story are dropped...except i should say it's carpet bombed because hints are dropped that ""oh my god Joshua has a dark past"" and ""oh my god Estelle's Dad probably did stuff she doesn't know during the great War"" every 5 min, and in a way that is as unsubtle as what i just said. And theses few stories threads will repeat over and over again. (And they go on and on and on and on) (Oh and they repeat themselves) (like, they repeat themselves a lot...) (...and often)That all could be excused if the gameplay was interesting. But once again, Trails in the Sky is a massive disappointment. The combat is too easy, too repetitive, and overall uninteresting. The combat system is in a grid, which would suggest some deep tactical movements etc ? Nope, movements are automatic, you pick an enemy, and your character moves automatically toward them. Repositioning yourself is a waste of your time since it skips your turn and the enemy will be back on to you very soon anyway. So you are basically stuck with either basic weapon attacks, or a few different ways to do magic / special attacks, that mostly amounts to ""spam damage"" because the game is so easy it's not worth trying to be subtle in how you play.Not only are you overpowered, with the unique ability of being able to attack multiple times before the enemy but the AI is stupid, attacking your party at random (seriously, enemies will often decie to go around the party member in front of them with only 2 HP, and instead attack another of your characters that has tons of HP). So you get uninteresting, repetitive combat, all of that to get...boring dialogs, that goes on and on, repeating the same thing over and over again. (by the way Joshua is secretly in love with Estelle).The game frames itself as the apprenticeship of our 2 protagonists, who runs errands for others, getting their lost items, or fighting monsters...what a great opportunity to have fetch quests with mandatory steps along the way, lots of pointless backtracking, and others stupid decisions to pad unnecessarily the length of the game !...I mean that's what the devs must have been thinking. They must have done it on purpose. Nobody can write a quest that is ""first the player must talk to the village chief, go through 2 full screens of monsters, then they find their objective but the door of the mine is closed, so they must go back through the 2 screens full of monsters, talk to the village chief, have a long cutscene about something utterly irrelevant to the current situation, then the chief give them the key to the mine and they can go back to the 2 screens full of monsters and finally they reach and enter the mine"" and think ""I'm doing that because it's a sane way to do a quest, and not at all an excuse to pad the length of the game"". (hey I just saw Estelle saying something very stupid...She is a bit of a klutz isn't she ? hahaha, isn't she fun ?)There isn't much positive i can write about Trails, but at least if it has one redeeming quality, that's the graphics. Sure they now looks dated, but for its time, Trails was a large world full of very detailed graphics, that still hold their own to this day. So you will have the opportunity to notice all theses small details when a cutscene goes and on and on talking about things you already know and that many people have already told you and that you really need no reminder of but apparently if you keep adding more words to a text then that must mean that text is very deep and meaningful and it really explains better stuff that really needed no explanation in the first place.I will admit, I didn't finish this game. I gave up on Trails. This is not something I do lightly. I try as much as possible to finish the games I start, even the ones i don't like. But when I spend my time between skipping pointless dialogs, and utterly boring fights where i'm never in danger whatsoever, and all of that is to reach yet another very long cutscene which further the ""story"" of this game, usually in a way you already guessed far in advance because the whole thing is just a bunch of tropes and stereotypes....then it's just to much. After 18h, I'm giving up on Trails. And just to be sure I didn't miss some sort of deeper evolution, I checked a spoiler on the internet, i read the rest of the story...and it was pretty much what i guessed, because the hints are already so heavy, so obvious. I'm not gonna spoil it there but it is really not a good story. Yes i know Estelle is a klutz and Joshua loves her.I could go on and on, I could talk to you about the bad sountrack, the awful controle schemes (neiter keyboard nor gamepad are any good) or the fact this game is so poorly optimized it has several maps where its stuttter even on a recent computer....but i'm done wasting your time.If you thought this review was well written, full of humor, etc. maybe ""Trails in the Sky"" is for you. If you felt it was poorly written, repetitive, and not that interesting, then avoid the game, save 50h of your life, and sorry for wasting 5 min of it by consciously writing this review poorly.			"

												TLDR: Although it's not without its interesting features, I can't reccomend this game because its combat is boring, unrewarding, and at times, unfair. The story is also fairly generic and has too much needless dialogue.I'm playing it on hard. I'm an experienced RPG player, and I don't mind dying in a game when it's fair. In hard, there are fights that are plain unfair. The games combat turns works in a similar style to FF10, the turn order is displayed down the side of the screen, and if one character is fast enough, they can get two actions in the time someone else gets one. Using magic takes up two turns, but the time between those two turns is reduced.This is a small problem. You never know the turn order reliably, nor do you know more than one or two turns in advance.By far the most frustrating thing about this game is the levelling system. You start the game at level 3. Each enemy you kill gives you maybe 10 exp. By level 5, these enemies give you 1 exp. There is no reward for battling, and even though you are two levels higher than the enemy, they aren't THAT much easier to kill. You lose virtually all reward, but you may get hurt badly enough that you need to use some of your mana to heal, mana being a very limited and important resource. I understand why the game wants to limit the amount of experience you can get, but it ends up just making battles feel like a waste of time. I fought a boss in which my main character was 2-hit, obviously I tried desperately to revive her. I ran out of revives, so she ended the battle dead, meaning she would not get battle experience. The other party members got 7 exp each. 7 exp for a boss that could 2 hit me.Magic takes two turns, and your mana at the beginning is understandably limited. Unless an enemy is very weak to a specific type of magic, spells only do slightly less than double damage compared to basic attacks. Theorhetically, this would mean that there is no use for magic that isnt super effective against an enemy. The game devs must have thought of this, because they made basic attacks miss insultingly often, and made a few early enemies basically imune to physical damage. If you come against these kinds of enemies low on mana, you can't really do anything except run away.These are just two small issues. I would also like to highlight some cool aspects of the combat. After each fight, you get elemental gemstones. The element of the gemstones is determined by the enemy you fight, For example, a plant enemy may drop 2 water gems and two air gems. These gems can be either sold, collected into groups of 30, 50, etc to open new spell slots, or used to make new spells. This is fun and cool, but you are repeatedly fighting the same enemies, so I had about 240 earth gems, but only 7 fire gems. To open a new spell slot, you need 30, then 50, then 80 (continuously increasing amounts) of EACH KIND of gem. So to open the 3rd spell slot, I needed 50 earth and water and fire etc. It is exceedingly frustrating to have so many of one kind of gem, and so little of another, because it means you need to farm the first enemy you see over and over to get the fire gems.As for the story, many of the positive reviews state that the game has a great story and stuff like that. In the first 7-8 hours, the story is fairly generic, and I agree with one of the other negative reviews that say it isnt so much story heavy as it is dialogue heavy. You spend the first hour reading, but you learn very little from all of that time. There are also some very odd sequences of dialogue. For example, when a passed out kid is brought into your home, your father starts randomly talking about how ""auburn"" the passed out kids eyes are. Why do we need to know? We don't, and that sums up a fair bit of the early dialogue.This isn't an awful game, I've focused a lot on the negatives here, but those are the only things that really stand out. It's pretty generic, which is fine, but it isn't as good as it could be.			"

												Got as part of humble bundle and decided to try it out since it had such good ratings. I read a couple reviews saying it was heavily story based, and man they weren't kidding. Almost all of the first couple hours of gameplay was just story. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, however, unfortunately I found the story to be incredibly boring and slow. The combat is very dull as well, so if the story doesn't hook you then this game is probably not worth playing.			"

												I'm going to recommend this game not for what it is, but for what it allows you to do.  It allows you to live through the very first parts of Falcom's *new* Legend of Heores universe that spans 4 countries and  a long interesting backstory which one slowly explores through the (so far) 7 games of the franchise.   In this title you play as Estelle who is journeying around the Liberal kingdom to first become a bracer when the plot thickens and she is then  involved in a big movment concerning her and her newfound friends family.   It's all typical JRPG fare of leveling and grinding, reading alot of text, and inputing commands to do battle. We all know that part though, this is an old game which MANY sequel thus far, so how about we discuss the actual impression one gets whilst playing. THIS GAME IS BORINGMake no mistake in an any way about it, this game is the most boring JRPG you can imagine but you *have* to play through it to get alot of parts in Second Chapter, which is a very not boring game. The music is BORING, the characers are BORING, the dungeons are BORING, the skill system is BORING, the weapons are BORING.  If you want to play an exciting JRPG like Tales of or Wild Arms this is not for you at all.  It's just the primer to Legend of Heroes 6, 7, and 8.You'd expect me to talk about how good the port is at this point, but too bad.  This isn't a port- this was always a PC game and it made its way to PSP and back again through the mixed up world of loclization.  That being said it's smooth and easy to customize to your liking and optimized very well also. There's not too much else to say.  Get it if you want to exprience the first part of the new Legend of Heroes, but not if you want to have a blast.			"

												So, at first glance, the game looks and plays like something that would come out of an RPG Maker.  The combat is pretty simple and the characters are derivative (it is literally a who's who of Stock Japanese Character Tropes) but the setting is pretty good and you can feel that the devs put a lot of love into it.But then I did my research and I find out that the game was released back in 2004 and I was going to give it the benefit of the doubt.  Like I did the same thing with the John Carter movie where I initially dismissed it until I found out that it was based off of a book written a hundred years earlier.  That's not really fair.  We've come a long ways as far as story telling goes and you can't actually be accused of being derivative when you're the trope maker.But then I was like, wait, the PS2 was already out by then.  We'd already figured out how to make good RPG's.  Look back at what else was released in 2004: KOTOR 2, Vampire Bloodlines, Digital Devil Saga, Phantom Brave, Paper Mario: 1000yrDoor, Suikoden 4...  Those are some good♥♥♥♥♥games except for Suikoden 4, which was solidly mediocre but still better than Legend of Heroes.So, armed with the proper perspective with which to judge this game, I can calmly and confidently Not Recommend it.Unless you really want to play a game ridden with horrible japanese tropes and cliches.

I'll post the tl;dr right at the top, this might be lengthy.tl;dr: If you have the mindset and intelligence of a 12 year old with 8 year old humor then you will absolutely love this game. Let's put it this way, if you remember playing games like Dragon Quest as a kid, loved them, and then played this you would get a nice feeling of nostalgia followed by pure boredom and realization of how mediocre this game really is.Now that that is out of the way, and although I REALLY, and I mean REALLY wanted this game for a long time (over a year, was waiting for a nice sale) I would love to recommend this game but I just can't. Hear me out on this I tried to like this game, and there are several aspects of this game I do thoroughly enjoy and find innovative. Please keep in mind that I spent a long time coming up with this decision and thought it through the whole time I was playing this game, these are opinions and are subject to vary from person to person. Seeing as how this game got such a high rating on Steam I couldn't resist to get this game. Honestly, the high rating is extremely exaggerated and is not a 92/100 (in terms of 92% of people recommend it) by any means. Pros: Innovative gear system (orbments, augmentation essentially) - I haven't played any games (if I can recall correctly) that use this system. Essentially you can 'augment' what they call ""quartz"" onto your party members and they each have their own buffs/boons but they can also build up to unlock extra 'art' moves ('arts' are their form of saying spells). Sadly, they take about two full turns to cast, one to set up and one to actually cast it. Extremely innovative combat mechanics - I was surprised with how they handled what happens when your party wipes. Most games just have a load previous save thing or retry and thats about it. Even though this game has this too, the 'retry' option actually nerfs the enemies you face (this can be seen as a con too for those who look for difficulty or strategic ways of winning) over time. Say in the first case you face an enemy and get instantly wiped out, the next time you attempt to face them the battle order may have changed (maybe your teammates go first to get a chance to do something before they do), you may get those special buffs that are so critical to a kill or win (I will explain that next), the enemies' damage is reduced and so is their defence and in the end just makes it so you can get by the battle. Every subsequent 'wipe' results in another nerf on the enemy.Combat buffs - During the combat phases you can see the enemy/friendly order on the left hand side of the screen and you may see those buffs and who gets them. This buff system is very helpful in dire situations and can determine life or death, easily. Whether it's HP Heal, CP Gain, Str Up, or Critical, etc. they always help your party, or your enemy. It is always fun trying to set the enemy back to lose their buff so your party gets it instead, especially when it's something you're looking for.Music- This is self explanatory but the soundtrack for the game is very engaging and relaxing, it does a very good job of putting you in the mood of the story or whatever sequence is going on. Put simply, they nailed the music to match the atmosphere.Now on to the 'neither pro or con' section:Main Story - Seeing as how most JRPGs go, this storyline they have is not awful but its not good either. You start out as Estelle Bright and aspire (with your 'brother' Joshua) to become senior bracers and be as tough as your father, recognized and respectable. Along the way you uncover conspiracies and corruption and your job as a bracer is to stop such 'evil' in the world, for example stopping the Sky Bandits from ransoming innocent civilians and grand theft of an airliner, stopping thieves from stealing precious gems, solving mysteries of arson, thefts, burglaries, etc..Side Quests - Most games make side quests that have either little or no character interaction, progression or reason behind it. In this game the side quests seem very put in place to help you progress and buy more upgrades or ingredients, etc. your party may need. Moreover, another reason they have side quests is to level up (at least most of the time) as you'll find your party under-leveled often if you don't do them or just pursue the main story. However, these quests actually do have cutscenes and dialogue, and character progression which is very nice to see developers put lots of time into even the side quests; I haven't seen this done much in almost any game. One irritating point about side quests is that they expire if you progress a little too far in the story. This sucks if you forget about side quests, not really a gripe though, it's expected.Cons:Dialogue/Cutscenes - This game has awful, absolutely awful dialogues and cutscenes. Even though almost everything is voiced over the dialogue, (they have some parts that are pure text) it is as if the writers are 10 years old. Their humor is the most laughable thing ever and is the last thing from funny. I suppose if you're 8 you would actually laugh and find most of the humor funny, other than that it's laughably pathetic. This wasn't a con to me but this game has a LOT of talking in it, so if dialogue is a turn off for a game then avoid this game. The animations themselves in the cutscenes seem so forced and unsmooth it's awkward at times. It's like watching a poorly animated school project video made for art class at times; for example, seeing an airliner move frame by frame and seemingly float in the air, completely out of place. I understand this game is a port and somewhat old, but other games from this time had better animations than this. Characters - You may think this is a weird con but let me explain. This is one of the worst aspects of the games, absolute worst. Before I make any statements on it, think back to when you were 13 years old and had 'great' ideas for video games that were RPGs and thought of these great characters, that's how these writers were. Take any Schwarzenegger film and you can apply the characters to his movies. Estelle is a complete dumbass, and is clear through the dialogue that she is as smart as a 6 year old or at least is severely mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the age of 16; however, she inherents the skill of using a stave like from her father. Estelle will irritate you beyond belief with her stupidity, the writers just try too hard to create comedic effect with this stupidity, mind you. Furthermore, she cannot pick up on innuendos, at all, like any other 6 year old kid. Remember that one kid in your class that you wish would just shut the ♥♥♥♥ up and if they didn't you would freak out? That's Estelle in a nutshell. Her character is shallow and easily predictable, like every other character in the game. Moving on to Joshua, he's not nearly as bad; however, he is just as predictable. He comes off as a secretive and depressed kid, or at least traumatized as a child (which he is). He is smart (in terms of this game at least, considering everybody has the logic and thought process of a 10 year old) and quick-witted and can decipher a crime scene with ease and pick up on trends or piece things together like any normal adult. He has his moments of depression that generally goes into a romantic cutscene with Estelle, with a kidish twist of silly humor and 'cheer me up' laughs and giggles. These 'Bracers' are 16, not 12 and going through puberty like middle school kids; however, that's how their romance progresses and is actually cringe-worthy if you think about this enough. Those are the two main characters that actually matter. I have no more space to write and finish this review, but either way I rate this 5/10.			"

												I wanted this game to be so much better than it was.I'm no stranger to JRPGs, and I picked this one up on a whim after seeing a lot of good reviews.  And they're mostly right; the things this game does well, it does EXTREMELY well.  The sound and art design are excellent.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have it where it counts: the gameplay.Battles occur on a tiled field with you at one end and enemies at the other, and you converge to do battle over each individual unit's turn, which can be irregularly spaced depending on the number of units and their relative stats.  That's all well and good, but the game also insists on implementing a randomized bonus system, where on certain turns, whoever is currently acting gets a free boost, be it bonus damage or free healing.  The problem is, there's only one way for the player to influence who gets these bonuses, and it's situational at best.  On Normal difficulty, this is probably permissible, but I went straight to Hard (and there's another one above that) and the game balance just wasn't there. On top of that, there are certain enemies who can just straight up kill you on their own -- and these are random encounter enemies.  Healing items are too expensive to rely on and healing spells take too long to use (this can be mitigated later, but it's still a significant problem).  Couple that with a clunky upgrade system, always having too few party members to handle a situation, and an obtuse mission system, and I find that I don't have any compelling reason to play it anymore.  I forced myself to pick this game up again after putting it down multiple times, but ultimately, I can't finish it, and it's one of a handful of purchases I actually regret.  I bailed for Dragon Age.			"

												It was good enough for me to finish it but this game is too frustrating.The fight are slow and easy with tons of unskipable animation. I finished the game in 30 hours but the fights took at least 20 hours out of it. So slow it is a real pain.The story is also quite bad. You see the plot coming from miles away and cannot influence it.Why do all the boss I fight escape after they are defeated? The heroes were a bunch of incompetent.The characters are superficial. They act always the same which gets boring in the long run. "

												I bought this after seeing many lauding it as one of the greatest jrpgs in recent times.  It isn't.  If you want a great, modern JRPG, pick up Persona 3 or 4 if the biggest draw for you is the story, Dragon Quest IX or Bravely Default if you're in it for the combat.  This game doesn't come close in either category.The tactical rpg-lite combat misses the point of tactical combat systems.  Being forced to sacrifice a turn in order to control the location of your character beyond hoping that the attack command places you on a strategically beneficial tile makes the positioning element of combat meaningless.  Instead, the only thing gained by the movement grid in battle is that occasionally you won't be able to move far enough to attack an enemy on your turn which limits your choices to either using magic or moving as close as you can to the enemy you want to attack.  Well, that and battles take thrice as long as they should.The story is typical jprg fare, but everything that could be said in one or two lines of dialogue is said in 20.  Two kids set out to become adventurers.  It's the same two kids you've been playing as in every mediocre jrpg with generic characters released in the past two decades.  I played long enough to add two additional characters to my party.  They're even worse and manage to bring a bit of sexism and homophobia to the game's excruciatingly long dialogue sequences.  Yay.I've read a lot of reviews praising the game for how it fleshes out stories for every single character in the game.  It sounded good on paper, but imagine trying to feign interest while a co-worker tells you about the ongoing battle with their eight year old daughter's soccer coach who refuses to put her on the field as often your co-worker thinks she should be.  That's the kind of story you'll be hearing from the game's NPCs.  Sure, there's story there, but it has almost nothing to do with you.  And even if you do find that level of conversation interesting, it's still told with at least twice as much dialogue as is even remotely necessary.I'm pretty disappointed that I bought into the hype and picked this one up.  It was a debate between this and picking up one of the Dragon Quest games I missed over the years (V).  I made a terrible mistake.			"

												It's impossible to skip cutscenes and dialogue, even if you've seen/read them before. That in itself is enough to warrant a thumbs down. Additionally, the game is full of meaningless grinding and padding. Fairly early on in the game, you arrive at a mine. Inside said mine you get to ride in a minecart, the minecart takes you to a dead end where you have to talk to a chap in order to learn to flip a lever, only I'm fairly certain I clicked that lever before going into the minecart but whatever, so then you go back, flip the lever, arrive at the elevator only to find out that the elevator needs a key. Go back to the starting point, go back to the dead end, talk to the chap again, learn that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ knew about the elevator key yet neglected to mention it, get key, backtrack and finally go to the damn elevator! Now, this sounds like a fairly standard introduction to a boring rpg puzzle right? That's what I thought, yet on the next level of the mines, there are no minecart puzzles, let alone any minecarts, only a straightforward path. The whole section with the minecart was just a timesink to pad a lacking game. And pretty much every single side quest is like this too.And the difficulty level, now don't read this as something good, higher difficulty in this game does NOT mean, use strategies to prevail. No. The enemies just gets buffed way above their level, to the point where two hits will drain your life bar, and there's usually around 3-5 enemies in any given fight. You cannot play around this. Even on the lowest difficulty, grinding is unavoidable. Don't even bother choosing anything other than normal, it just increases the amount of grinding needed. I did, and I had to go back and suffer through the whole intro and yap yap yap non-stop dialogue one more time.Usually in rpgs you can avoid the vendor junk and hold out for the good loot in dungeons and secret chests. Not so here. There's no looting in town, I mean none. No secrets, plenty of dead ends though, but nothing, NOTHING, to justify such exploration. Really strange. And the loot found in dungeons are really, REALLY, sparse as well. So you grind to be able to buy the junk from the vendors, just so you can reach the next area, where your gear isn't so hot anymore anyways.The worst parts of jrpgs are all included in this game, if that's not your thing, stay away.

												Pros:- Well written dialogue that is believable and worth reading- If explored through NPCs, books, signs, etc, the player will find a fleshed out world - Rotating battle partners makes the game change pace periodically- Tactical-ish gameplay- An RPG story that is not cliche- No random battles. All enemies appear on screen ahead of time, most can be avoided, and some really difficult monster fights related to bracer guild requests will even warn you before you start the fight.The Bad:- The pacing of the story can be awkward and there are many sections filled with text bubble after text bubble- Slow battle animations. My play time would be way less if this game didn't load just about everything slowly. Movement in battle, attacks in battle, the battle splash screen, the victory screen, going from room to room, the story...- Unskippable animations and dialogue. This really bogs the game down, particularly if you have to replay a section or choose to during New Game+.- Grinding. Even with choosing to fight every monster I could find I still had to go back and grind a few times. Having the item that makes you invisible so you can get suprise attacks helps speed it up but grinding is still a big problem.- A very weak idea of what a ""tactical"" RPG is. All of the fights are in square arenas. If the player surprises the enemy or starts the battle normally the enemy will always be on one side and the heroes on the other. If the player is surprised the heroes are surrounded. Users can't move and act in the same turn so the ""tactics"" become picking which enemy to target with arts/magic in order to hit the maximum amount of enemies. I played this game until the very end. Despite the gameplay flaws I was compelled to finish it. It just isn't compelling enough to recommend.			"

												Cookie cutter characters, poor characterization, a plot that doesn't develop until the last hour of gameplay, a slow combat system, poor enemy designs, and generic locations. These are just a few of the complaints I noted while playing The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky.The game feels like a B anime show, with mountains of unnecessary dialogue and attempts at humor that never really hit the mark. Character development feels very forced, and usually devolves to one character listing off their personality traits in a conversation.Most of your time with the game will be spent moving from town to town, solving problems that have only a passing link to the primary conflict. The storyline quests that the characters pursue have little to no bearing on the actual plot. In short, the game is mostly filler material, with plot development only occuring in the first and last few hours.The combat system isn't bad, but does drag on in certain fights. Animations can't be skipped in any way, so when battling groups of enemies the fights tend to drag on. The monsters you will encounter have no coherency with the locales of the world, and aren't threatening in the slightest. Most of the game is spent fighting squirrels, sheep, and bugs. The game's inhabitants are terrified of these creatures.If you're a big fan of JRPG tropes, stereotypes, and story beats, this might be what you're looking for. It was all just a little too predictable for me.			"

												This game highlights everything I do not like about JRPGs. * Pointless grinding for resources* Widely variable difficulty - bonus boss enemies can completely shred you while normal enemies in the same are no threat at all. The game can too easily cease to be a challenge if you go off the plotted line and gain too many levels by exploring areas you weren't meant to go to yet.* Despite nominal freedom of exploration, you can't return to places you've been to before after certain threshold points.* All of the female characters are, to some extent, contemptible. I am bone-tired of the plucky-yet-hapless rookie, the overt seductress, and every other archetype used for the leading women in this game. * Terrible waste of space. Many ""dungeons""  and wilderness areas are nothing more than long hallways with monsters in them that serve no purpose other than to delay your progress between plot points. Add to that a mechanic I question of the purpose of: most NPCs in hub areas have something new to say after any plot event. Normally, I'd call that good worldbuilding, but going around to talk to everyone every time something happens is one more thing that makes the game's pacing intolerably slow. Those 10.7 hours on my record are mostly what it took to finish the PROLOGUE.			"

												This game is short and broken. Endless dialog boxes, with no real story, and it's only half the game. The second half is call Second chapter, even though it should be named Second volume because the game is broken up into chapters. And the game is only 4 chapters long! Hours upon hours of spamming your way through text boxes with no consequences, to play next to zero game play, and the game doesn't resolve anything, just creates plot threads for future installments. No challenge, barley any boss battles, and a fraction of a game compared to better RPGs, such as the Dated FF7, and the epic Tales of Symphonia.  A total miss.			"

												OVERPRICED!It's an okay series; however, I got this for about 10 dollars.  The second part is around 30.  It's not even worth 10.  The visuals are nice, but the gameplay is just okay, what you would expect from a FF type RPG.  The dialogs are a little too long and the missions are not very clear from the get-go.  It doesn't feel too much of an open world but linear.  Also, the music is not great.  The world music is fine but the battle music is a little boring.I'm a hardcore RPG old school gamer, and I play the game, will do so until I finish it; I just don't recommend it for the price, no way, and don't go paying 30 USD for the Second Chapter (SC) part.  I hear this is a trilogy.  Wait for the price to drop to less than 10; if you really like it buy the 2nd and 3rd Chapters for less than 10, though.  That's my opinion.			"

												Im just not to sure about what to say about this game, I don't want to be completely negative about it because there are some great things about this game. And while I love RPG's. I found this one to feel kinda like a over priced rip off... The whole game just felt like a large prologue to me. It felt like there was so much more to explore, see, and learn of this world and so many deep things. I just don't see what all the excitement and love is over this game is, I won't say its the worst rpg I have played but its not going to be one of my favorites for sure....I guess I expected this game to grow more and do more than it did, but in the end it didn't. Perhaps the purpose was just to set up for the second chapter which I have yet to play. But I guess as a fan of rpg's I just found the game small and lacking in the end... I guess I felt cheated by the tiny world as your limited to moving around in one tiny kingdom, and a world filled with so much wonder and mystery you never really get to get deep enough into.. the whole game kinda felt like a tease to me......

												monsters are not scaled properly. i hopew you saved because you can either be stuck in a loob of monsters one shotting your last party member or going to the title screen. the random encounters are not bad, but it gets old really quick. at the beginning of the game you are forced to sit through a huge amount of context. it is alright considering it is a JRPG but the initial cutscene goes on forever and you can't skip it. for now i wouldn't recommend this game, it may get better as it goes on, but on the easiest difficulty i still wipe on several occasions. you can run froma fight instantly but i shouldn't have to.

												I want to love this game - I really do - because it's clear a ton of effort has been put into it. Unfortunately, several flaws have driven me to a negative review:* Clunky, ultra-repetitive combat system* Very poor PC / monster power pacing - combat ranges from the trivially easy (opten ""quest bosses"") to the impossible (wandering monsters, for some reason). I repeatedly found myself having to run away from every wandering monster I saw only to find out that the boss of the very same quest wasn't even a challenge. My character power, meanwhile, never seemed to go up to any significant degree, even though the monsters got stronger - eventually I hit a wall where a specific plot quest encounter was literally impossible and decided I wasn't about to backfarm for hours just to get past it.  * Frustrating movement - it's not too bad if you're using the mouse, but if you're a keyboard mover like me, it's quite frustrating. If you're willing to look past these things - and willing to spend a lot of time grinding away at mobs just to level up - I'm sure you'll like this game. Unfortunately, I didn't.			"

As was stated in another review they put up road blocks to force you to grind out levels, where you fight a monster and do literally zero damage to it, go gain 1 or 2 levels and you are able to fight it normally.  I don't mind grinding out levels but the devs need to make the combat more flashy and interesting for the player if its going to be required.			"

												Only play it if you have a high tolerance for Anime Nonsense.The gameplay is fun, the combat is more interesting than the usual RPG turn based style, the visuals look nice and the setting and overall lore is pretty unique.But my god, the plot and characters are just awful. Every single chapter follows the same formula.-Explore region-Meet new person-Bad guy does bad thing to that person-Chase bad guy-Defeat bad guy-Bad guy escapes, only to get captured by someone else in the next scene-Leave regionThat in itself is annoying enough, but the characters filling that formula are just the worst kind of stereotypical everything you can imagine. The fiery girl who is all about fighting but isn't very observant or introspective. Her stoic and mysterious brother who is super smart and level-headed and knows just what to say at all the right times. The older woman (who is 26) who drinks too much and solves her problems by whipping and intimidating them. The bisexual effeminite man who hits on everything. The super angry guy who solves everything by hitting it and is an abusive jerk to everyone he meets but for some reason everyone just puts up with it because he's good at hitting things.And on. And on.So, like I said at the start, if you have a high tolerance for that sort of thing then by all means. The game surrounding it is fun to play, but I just couldn't take any more of its nonsense and gave up at the start of the final chapter. Not even with the end in sight could I put myself through any more of it.			"

Look, I got this in the Humble Monthly Bundle (ie. I didn't ask for it, but still paid for it), and dumped over an hour in it to give it a chance. By my measure, my opinion is valid enough. Plus I'm in the mood for a classic-ish RPG.The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is wayyyy too breathy and text-heavy (alot like its title, heh). The dialogue is generic and poorly written - towards the end I was literally nodding off. It took nearly an hour for me to even get a taste of combat, which is purely classic RPG battle stuff - to a fault. I've played RPG-maker games with more progressive takes on classic RPG battle-style, and I hate that I had to say that.I'm on the fence about the Playstation 1 era artwork. Sometimes I think it's cool in a quirky kind of way, and other times I just think it looks dated. The animations are horribly off, too. Just watch the main character run. Wayyy too many steps per unit distance traveled. I mean, you do have to look at that for dozens of hours, right? It would be worth getting the fundamentals right.Bottom line - I think this is a game for a niche crowd. I think this caters to people that loved Playstation 1 era RPGs. Don't get me wrong - I did, but then I grew up and so did my reading skills. Yeah, that probably sounds offensive, but hey, I call'em as I see'em. Peace,			"

												BEWARE! This is only half a game. It really does ask you to play the next chapter to get any real story out of this.Combat is repetitive and can randomly fluctuate between extremely difficult to insultingly easy. Walls of text can make it hard to keep you interested in the comings and goings of this world. You spend more time reading about random character nonsense than anything that can actually matter to this story.It takes a good 30 hours before any of the storyline really begins and starts to look interesting. It has one of the slowest starts of any JRPG I have ever played and I played a lot of them.Characters can get a bit grating on your nerves since they never seem to stop talking.The gameplay has you go from town to town randomly wandering into trouble and saving everything. It gets old fast.This is not a game for anyone who is not okay with a very slow RPG. Even when it ramps up to faster speeds with the storyline, talking and wandering around is still slow. And the game never even really finishes.3/10 overall.			"

												The game is OK. Nothing special. Same old same old. The problem I have with the game is the lack of game play in it. I like grinding. But wandering around aimlessly for hours at a time going from NPC to NPC to proceed the story is boring as♥♥♥♥♥♥ I am at 37 hours and just got to chapter 3. Of that 37 hours I've spent maybe 3 hours actually fighting monsters. Literally 4 hours tops...Including grinding and all the side quests. (which are no more than walk to an area. find an item or enemy and bring back or kill) there is not any real surprise or any life to the game. just endless walking. the map direction is the worst because the screen can swivel and when you bring up the mini map it looks like you have to go north when in fact north might be walking south on your screen. Stupid and confusing at times. there are a few decent boss fights. (3 challenging ones so far) but for 37 hours of game play the anti climactic tone of the whole game is getting annoying. The end of chapter 2 there is no final fight. just hours of dialogue that is very badly written and one can only hope to button mash ""B"" to end the suffering. I'll play on and finish the game but unless there are awsome boss battles and many more enemy fights it will be a disappointment. Im not sure why everyone seems to like the game. The story isnt that great. The only mini game is fishing and you dont get to partake in that till over half way through and its not very fun. the leveling system is there but you dont choose any perks when you level... you just hear a ""Ding"" sound and your hero grow a little stronger. The magic system is the only real thing in this game with substance. but its not enough to hold your attention unless your are USING magic. eg: fighting and grinding. which did i mention there is very little of in the game. I really want to like it but I cant. I found my self skipping dialogue and wishing for fights most of the game... Buy it if its on sale and dont expect anything great.UPDATE: Chapter 3 ... I have to watch all of the arena battles even if im not fighting??? OMFG!!!!!!!!!!! SO STUPID!!!			"

												Given the paucity of JRPGs available for the PC, I really wanted to like this game, but I am unable to reccommend it. TLDR the game is too steeped in JRPG tropes, and ultimately the story is a bit too by the numbers to my liking. It's possible that the coming Second Chapter will be a much better experience...I will wait and see.For reference, I enjoyed a lot of the SNES era JPRGS, as well as many of the PS1 era games. Some I played for the first time decades after thier release, so arguably nostalgia plays a lesser role in my enjoyment of the older JPRG games.pros:-massive amounts of interactive text: NPCs say lots of unique stuff, which changes before and after events. you can buy newpapers, read books. it's a pretty extensively realized world.-interesting battle/magic system: timing when and where spells and actions play out gives the game a nice layer of strategy to it. the orbment magic system lets you mix and match spells, which is slightly different for each character based on thier orbment grid.-reasonable difficulty/leveling progression: the enemies were never really too easy or too hard when I played through, which I thought was impressive.cons:-boring characters: all of the charaters adhered to anime tropes, with minimal depth to them. Estelle is the tomboy and determined genki girl. Joshua is the love interest with a dark past. Schera is the  MILF-y character who drinks and likes sadomasochism. and so on. Even the plot twists and backstory that's revealed were common anime trope twists and backstory.-smoldering and sluggish story: most of the reveals do not surface until very near the end of the game.-boring quests and sidequests: the gameplay in this regard boiled down too frequently to traditional MMORPG type quests, where you fetch me this item, and kill this one monster.-uninteresting art design: the game leans heavily on common fantasy anime style, the game fails to stand out from its predecessors and peers.-magic system progression is broken: for whatever reason, some (maybe most) high level magic spells would not scale sufficently to warrant thier use. I constantly relied on low level spells because they simply did more damage per MP use.			"

												What would have otherwise been a fairly good game is (for me) ruined by two things.DialogueI didn't expect this game to have great dialogue, but I was still disappointed. The conversations between characters are slow to the point of being annoying, and several times during the game you are required to go through 10-15 minutes of continuous talking, without being able to take any action at all. If the dialogue were good, this might have been acceptable, but since it isn't, it simply becomes frustrating. As if this wasn't bad enough, dialogue is routinely interspersed with instances where you wait perhaps 10 seconds for a character or two to walk to a certain place, with nothing else happening at all.CombatCombat - which is often fairly fun - has many redeeming qualities, but later in the game it becomes more frustrating. As the game progresses it gradually builds on the combat system by adding new abilities, attacks and rules, but at times it decides to completely undermine everything that it has build so far by letting certain bosses circumvent the rules you have been shown over the course of the game. Some of them are unexplicably immune to attacks or effects that look like they should work, while others have the ability to choose where they move before attacking, which you can't; you can either choose to move to a certain position or attack an enemy, but you cannot - for instance - move your ranged character to a favourable position and then attack, unlike a few bosses.Also, several creatues throughout the game use abilites that have a given chance of instantly killing your party members. You are given the same ability, but giving such a power to common enemies makes many battles almost only a matter of luck, which should never be the case in a game with tactical, turn-based battles.

												WARNING: Too Much Story, not enough gameplay...I do not recommend this game if you want to play something within the first hour of having downloaded it. If you are looking for STORY, probably get it, cause the first 45 minutes of the game was nothing but story story story and training you on the shops... You walked a bit too... Nothing else... I turned it off before I kept going and found I had ""played""(more like read...) too long to get a refund. Personally I love a game with good story, but this is too much for me to get into... I would like a game to have a good MIXTURE of gameplay AND story, not MOSTLY story and eventual gameplay... This is just me personally however and I am making this so anyone who also has issues with this doesn't waste their time.			"

												Fiercely dull, both narratively and mechanically.Conversations constantly circle back on themselves; characters say in pages what could be said (with no loss of information or emotional weight) in a couple lines. The events of the plot have no sense of urgency to them, and in general it feels like a whole lot of pointless stuff happens between isolated events of actual consequence. My understanding is that the plot gets interesting just in time for a shameless sequel hook, but the fact is that nothing about this game makes me want to see it through that far.The combat system feels underrealized. Abilities are generally uninteresting, and equipment is inexcusably simple. Nearly every weapon and armor is a direct upgrade of those that come before it. Accessories are few and far between, and the one system that actually allows customization--the Orbment--feels needlessly contrived and tends to link attributes together in a way that just isn't satisfying.

												I had been on the fence about getting this game for a long time, but finally decided to give the game a shot on sale. Simply put, it was still a waste of money. The game is dated, but that isn't the problem.First off it's just buggy, so have fun getting it to start, and even then, not randomly crash on you.After you jump that hurdle though...When you read the store page and the only highlights are""Featuring upgrades never before seen"" ""Support for all resolutions""""A complete bestiary""""one of the largest, longest and most meticulously detailed turn-based JRPG""Yes...it's exactly as bad as it reads.The game will be the longest visual novel you will probably play in your life. Interrupted by the most awkward combat sections ever created. Both combat and story are boring; Just pure, unoriginal, repetitive, repetitive, unoriginal, repetitive garbage.Unless you can sustain your interest in a game based purely on sprinkles of old one-liners and sterotypical tropes, do not buy please. Try to help gaming move forward instead of getting slogged in the past.			"

												Very overrated game. The dialogues are nice, but the combat system isn't really anything more than servicable, and the story doesn't even get going within the 40-50 hours it takes to finish the game. You mostly just run around doing side-quests, and then you find out that you have to play 2 more games to finish a story that isn't any more involving or complicated than any other JRPG. You just have to buy 3 games.Dragged out. Not worth the time investment.			"

												The fighting system is simple, yet interesting and engaging. The story line is somewhat generic (especially if you're an avid watcher of anime), but entertaining enough. The world itself is also interesting to explore, but because of its linearity you don't revisit earlier areas. The special weapons you discover in one area that you think are really cool and special quickly become second rate when you enter new areas. This devalues the whole idea of value for these things. There are too many houses to enter into, which just have boring NPCs talking about gossip. There's never any special loot to find in these houses either. Overall I enjoyed it for the £2 I paid for it (used a £10 voucher I was given for christmas for it), but I wouldn't particularly reccomend it. I played this once through starting in hard mode. It was challenging at parts but as with these types of games, just level up and figure out the fighting system and you won't have too many problems. The last battle was my favourite part and I hoped there would be more coming as it felt a bit like an unfinished game. Still I played it for about 80 hours so I guess I got my monies worth.  "

												I find this game to be extremely boring. The structure of Trails is cyclical and repetitive, move from one town to the next working for your guild, checking off quests on a billboard until you can move onto the next area which is locked behind a gate. Each area has the same features, a hub, a small village, an ancient tower, the previously mentioned checkpoint gate. The main story is not bad but it takes a very long time to set in, most of the time you're just ♥♥♥♥ing around doing side-quests and having lunch. From what I understand Trails in the Sky consists of several games in different chapters instead of one game and it shows here. This feels very much like an introduction than a fully fleshed out experience. Basically there's a deeper meaning behind whats going on but most of that happens in the background with nothing to do with the player, so immersion suffers and the game just feels like a slog you have to sit through. On and it is a slog, there's a neverending stream of dialogue to skip and cutscenes to sit through. I know this is typical for the genre but in Trails this is extra tedious, believe me.There are other aspects I really do not enjoy like the ""orbment"" system, the itemization is really bad, combat is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it takes a lot of grinding to get experience and sepith, and  and the achievements are insane. Collect every item? Every recipe? Open every chest? (apparently there are close to 200 of them!) They are impossible to complete without using a guide every step of the way, not fun. There's also a lot of side things you can just miss forever when I find irritating.What is good about Trails in the Sky though is the world-building, the setting is really alive. There's a lot of attention to detail in the environment. The actors always have their own things going on, their own little stories and personalities, and when events happen in the world they react. If you wanted to go around and experience every bit of new dialogue and action going around in the background it would certainly take a lot of effort. The writing is really well done which is extremely important for this title because dialogue is the majority of the game.			"

												Hasn't aged well. The game definitely still shows a lot of the limitations of the PSP, particularly in the realm of controls not mapping to the keyboard in a very intuitive manner. For its time, the mechanics probably had a respectable amount of depth, but by modern standards they're almost patronizingly simple. The story is quaint, but predictable as far as JRPGs go. I don't think it's by any means a bad game, but it just doesn't have that timeless spark that makes a game truly memorable. Let this one live out its twilight in dignity.			"

The other portions of the gameplay (mainly combat) were so incredibly tedious that I actually couldn't finish the game.

												*Minor Spoilers (Though, if any part of this story surprises you, you're probably to stupid to read.)According to the forums, this game is approximately 40-50 hours long, and after playing half of this game, conservatively, I've had enough.  This game can be summed up in two words, Idyllic ♥♥♥♥♥♥ry. While the actual game play, and combat system are marginally entertaining, the story and characters are puking-in-my-mouth trite.  Idyllic towns, filled with idyllic moppets, and idyllic problems that fail to engage a player in any sense of the word.  ""What's that?  Your guard post was overrun by man-sized, feral, wolves?  Luckily no one was hurt beyond minor cuts and bruises. Sandwiches for everyone!""  In a world frothing with monsters, and sky-pirates no-less, not one person has misfortune actually befallen.  This game attempts to deliver conflict without risk or danger.  It's like the game is written by twelve-year-old girls for twelve-year-old-girls.However, marginally entertaining combat still qualifies as entertaining.  Unfortunately, the only ""good"" parts of this game, it's combat, are only expressed during long hauls of boring grinding, and useless fights.  During one part, the characters are raiding a Sky-Pirate base.  After handing the bases defenders their asses, the leaders escape you with the usual JRPG contrivances, and you get to fight the entire damned base again.  WHY?!  What purpose did any of the last twenty to thirty minutes serve?  Literally every pirate and monster in that base just stands back up, and gives it another go for no conceivable reason.  And what do they get for it?  What did all that fighting and heroics accomplish? Nothing, not a damned thing.  The leaders are rounded up by a third party with a gunship, which the pirate knew was en-route anyway.Ultimately this game lacks any meaningful depth; in story, in characters, in game play.  Worst of all, you'll spend far more time reading useless crap than exploring, fighting, or doing anything that could be mistaken for playing a game.			"

												The last time I abondon a game part way through it was 2005 and that game was the original Fable. After nearly 20 hours and knowing I'm only half way through this game, I cannot continue. I have held out as long as I could. There's very little I like about Trails in the Sky. When I started playing this game I remember thinking, ""this is just the intro. Hang in there, it'll get better."" Sadly it never did.The game is around 80% story and 20% gameplay so let's start with the story. There is no urgency, no gripping plot. Everything just feels so rainbows and butterflies. The story also seems to be broken up into mini stories, each that get wrapped up before you start a new one. There are only a few small story lines which continue through the entire game. Now for the gameplay. You spend far too much time running between point A and point B. It's made worse by the fact that, at you level up, enemies give less and less XP. After a few levels, fighting enemies becomes a complete waste of time.The combat itself isn't that exciting. They call it turn based strategy but the strategy is limited. If you attack an enemy you don't get to choose where to attack from so there goes any strategic placement. Defending is also oddly missing.- Dragged out story with no urgency- Unexciting combat with very little strategy to it- Bad gameplay/story ratioPlaytime: ~ 20h4/10			"

												Listen I know you want a good jrpg but trust me on this. I waited till the I beat this (the game starts out strong) and I do have minor gripes but I am going to skip to the main one because this game did the most taboo thing you can do in a story focused game.  This is only the first half of the game. I kid you not the closing movie is an advertisement for the sequal and it's not semi-episodic like golden age was. They literally gave only a teaser to every development the game was working towards. In jrpg worlds where the big reveal shows its head and that's where other jrpgs actually starts to open up is where this one ends (think ending ffvii when you're about to leave midgaurd)Now for smaller gripes that can be called a bit more subjective (It's my review)-only have 2 real characters. The rest are simply on loan for that chapter and the ending. Don't bother upgrading their pocket watch;)-the game gives a mercenary vibe with it's side quests, which I love, but doesn't give you the freedom to do them. To be fair this only really became a problem for me in the machine city because i wanted to take my adorable mascot with me so she could level.-the side character barely get a chance to develop-the romance doesn't get to go anywhere unless you count the last lines of text that, again, lead to yet another cliffhanger.

												I'm really on the fence between yes or no on recommending this game as it depends on the person. Personally, I'm not a huge anime fan so the games dialogue kind of had me spamming my buttons to continue mid-end game. The game itself is definitely not worth $20 but if you catch it on a 50% off sale by all means go for it as it will consume a good 40+ hours. During the prologue and majority of chapter 1 the game is fun but it slowly turns into a story rather than a RPG. Overall the story is quite simple it's just dragged along with a plethora of side quests that are essentially you hunting down ""bosses"" that in reality are just regular mobs that you will run into in the next zone and aren't very challenging at all. The game also lacked a lot of custimization item wise there's approximately 15 different armors  and 45 weapons (total) along with orbs which had a significant gap between useful and useless ones that you'll figure out almost immediately. The Bracer job system was pretty cool although if it had more diversity in the side quests it would have made the game a lot more enjoyable. Combat was really subpar and not that enjoyable compared to the traditional JRPG turn based system.If you're into a very strong story driven game this is a great buy. I'd say it's about 90% dialogue and 10% gameplay. The ""orb"" system is a different outlook on skills/abilitys that is similar to Suikoden. The game follows the two main characters while on said journey they run into multiple snags along the way that introduces friendly companions and predictable opponents. All in all, the game has a lot more cons than pros but like I said before. If you can get this game 50% off I'd definitely buy it it is a decent time sink. I'd give it a fair 6/10 rating.			"

												I had high hopes because i crave a good story/JRPG tactics but ehh. The combat system in this game is the only thing worth while. To bad they didn't put fighting into the game..... Every single fight in this game aside from very few boss battles are 100% avoidable, not to mention VERY easy. The final boss was the ONLY challenge in this game and he did ZERO damage to me the entire fight because you can spam earth wall with 2x toons and you avoid 100% of damage the entire fight. Also earth wall can be obtained as early as a few mins into the game. Game's broken? The story is blan and boring, and just when it starts to peak your interest... it's over with a horrible cliffhanger. Also your going to be stuck in town reading for 90% of the time your playing this game. That might be stretching it. I would say on average this game offered about 10mins of run to the boss and own him easy then talk for an hour or 2, rinse and repeat. The characters are also about as boring as the game. They have little to no story to them aside from what is happening in the game and a few tidbits here and there. Even with those tidbits, it doesn't do much justice to the fact that the characters are just as boring and tasteless as the rest of the game. Unless your a first time rpger your going to walk through this game w/o an ounce of strife. There is no challenge to be had here.			"

												The game is terrible, the combat is slow and boring, the story and dialogue is childish, absurd, and boring, the skill and ability system is boring, the characters personalities and designs are boring.80's graphics aside this game is just incredibly boring, I don't care what happens to any of the characters or this world they live in, they could all be destroyed in the next chapter and I couldn't be happier because I would know this game is over and I would never think about it again.I tried so hard to give it a shot and like it, I really did, but everytime I force myself to progress I can only stand about 40 min of it before I start to feel depressed about how I'm spending my time playing this game.If you're the kind of person who likes to brag to their friends how they enjoy retro RPG's  and the classic nostalic feel then by all means, get the game, you wouldn't want to lose who you are.But if you're the kind of person that is able to look at any game from any point in history and actually judge it for what it is and how it's made then stay far away from this game.This game honestly can't appeal to anyone who can actually read and understand the dialogue, its so childish and down right stupid the only age group that could enjoy this game would be 3-5 and it would be too complicated for them.

												There are some good things about old-school RPG's, and some bad things. One of the bad things is not being able to progress the story line without having to fight monsters every few seconds. This game suffers from that. I don't know whether I have the patience to persist with it, in spite of the many positive reviews.			"

												I can't say I enjoyed this game. The level up system is unnecessarily complicated. The same is true for the fights as well: there are too many things you need to pay attnetion to, but they don't always matter. It's also hard to figure out who goes after whom during the battle, what makes fights a complete mess.The story isn't much better either. What i played felt like ages, but I didn't discover almost anything about the plot. The dialogues and characters are like taken straight from a mediocre anime. One thing I liked about this game is art, but it's not enough for the price.			"

												**edit** This is getting enough down votes that I feel the need to clarify. A mediocre JRPG with terrible writing, uninteresting characters, and a forgettable world. The game has a sleep inducing soundtrack that plays the same music during every event, changing only if you move to a new section of the game (EDIT: By this I mean major chapter. The music for the towns, fields, battles, and character encounters all share ONE music track through large sections). Combined with the obvious intent to make absolutely every task, from equipping an item to fighting a random encounter, take as infuriatingly long possible; this game sets out to waste your time instead of provide an engaging experience.EDIT: Let me give you an example how the game willfully wastes your time. As mentioned this is a jrpg so there is a lot of text. Text that has no speed setting, and appears on the screen in text boxes that only hold 5-6 words before you need to press a button. Conversations between 2 characters is painful, and scenes with 3+ are boring as hell. 2 minutes of reading turns into 15 minutes of five words appearing on screen, pressing a button, waiting for a small but noticeable bit of time for the press to register, then watching the animation for one characters text box to close and another to open. Followed by five more words flowing into the new textbox one letter at a time. ლ(ಠ╭╮ಠლ)   Another example, and the moment that the game completely lost me, was this mine cart. This cart, the only one in the mine, has only two paths on it. Both paths are so short that it would take less time for the character to walk these sections than to wait for the animations of the character getting in the cart, traveling, and then exiting the cart. Remember this as I describe the next part. 	One fork of the path leads to an elevator (where you need to go), the other leads to a single  random NPC. If you choose the correct path and get to the elevator you are not allowed to go on because the character stops you saying that you should check out the rest of the mine. So you double back to the cart, use it to go back, flip a switch, and then ride down the other path. You talk to the NPC that has nothing useful to say and repeat the traveling process to get back to the elevator. However, this time the character stops you saying you need a key. So you go back to the rando NPC and get a key from him, return to the elevator, and then you can go forward. After 9 trips on this needless mine cart. (ノಠ_ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻      (•̪●)=̿̿'̿'\̵͇̿̿\This perfectly encapsulates the design philosophy of the game.			"

Posted: October 29, 2015
												With the release of the Second Chapter and the possibility of others coming up and buying this I hope this Review will catch those eyes.This game is boring as hell. There is no way around this. If you like action and gameplay, if you like to have some sort of strategical forethought and challenges to push yourself, if you like to actually play a ♥♥♥♥ing game period then this is not the game for you.The best way I can explain this game to someone who hasn't played it is that it's basically a JRPG version of Gone Home before Gone Home but instead of 2 hours it's dragged on through bland text for about 20-80 ♥♥♥♥ing hours.Yes, you read that correctly, about 90% of your time WILL be spent reading text. Most of it mind you is completely irrelevant five minutes after the fact in the story which is hysterical and mindblowing that a story-centric game like this has more bickering and irrelevant trivia than actual ♥♥♥♥ing story/world building. Honestly I could get past this, I really could if it wasn't for the characters and ooooooooh boy the characters get old REAL fast.Let me explain to you those characters:The two you'll be stuck with:Estelle - Pretty much the only good character in the game and is actually pretty lovable. Unfortunately everything she does is either wrong or almost wrong when veiwed by the others in the game and it's honestly frustrating to see the only relatable character be abused so much.Joshua - Gary Stu the character. Dark mysterious past and love interest of literally everyone in the ♥♥♥♥ing game besides his adoptive father. I know that sounds like an exaggeration but it's not. Literally every women and even men he comes into contact and has dialogue with will compliment his looks or gush over him. At first it was funny, then it was annoying and by the time I hit the 15 hour mark and felt like every dialogue about him was just a rehash from the first description of him it was just pathetic. If you have any common sense and don't have an inferiority complex you will loath this ♥♥♥♥ing character.Side characters in the party:Scherazard - The sex appeal. She honestly had potential to be pretty interesting at first but this soon was washed down the drain when her dialogue was reduced to mentoring Estelle, complementing/hitting on Joshua and being annoyed with Olivier.Olivier - If I wrote this back when I finally ♥♥♥♥ing quit the game I would have called Olivier a lovable character as well but when you try to take his character apart for inspection you realize he has absolutely no depth to him whatsoever. Apparently he's some sort of spy or whatever but that plot point is literally dropped five minutes after it's mentioned.Agate - Honestly the only thing enjoyable about this character is the mental jog I do for him when he shows up. Literally everytime he comes up I just replace him with Knuckles and it becomes funny as♥♥♥♥♥♥since he literally is Knuckles the Edgidna with a sword. Nothing interesting comes out of him and he's just there to be there sometimes.Klose - Go online. Find a random drama anime about girls in highschool. Watch the first episode. Find the girl who's sensitive and kind and likes drama class. Congratulations you just found her. Again this sounds like an exaggeration but it's not. This is verbatim the extent of her character.I could go on to all the other characters but I'll end that segment here for the sake of keeping the reveiw as readable as possible.Speaking of which how is the gameplay?Well honestly this could have been a really fun game if the gameplay was polished a bit (actually a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton), had skippable cutscenes and if the animations weren't so slow. Since this is a JRPG you need to be grinding a lot however this isn't even fun for those who enjoy grinding like myself since a battle that would take less then a minute in literally any other game takes about 2-3 maybe even 4-5 minutes to finish since for some reason the stronger attacks and criticals play out longer and slower than the weaker ones. This is most likely a way to try and get them a more dramatic effect but again it falls flat because I don't want to see that same damn animation for the 500th damn time I just want to finish the battle.As for the other things such as graphics, soundtrack and artstyle:The graphics were good for a 2005 game for the PSP but they're nothing to be impressed with nowadays. It's actually pretty bland just by looking at the screenshots in the store page. The soundtrack is mostly forgettable but there are a few good songs. The main menu theme is pretty catchy and I enjoy it however the ♥♥♥♥ing battle theme in this game literally sounds like it's straight from an elevator. The art stlye is pretty much your typical anime style nothing too interesting.The biggest gripe I have with this game though is it's cult-following. They'll swear, vow and pray left and right that this is one of the greatest JRPG storys in existence but will literally refuse any sort of criticism towards any characters in the game or story. Almost all of their arguments boil down to ""YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED SC YET IT'LL REDEEM ALL THOSE FACTORS!"" or ""IT'S A JRPG GAME MADE IN 2005 STOP JUDGING IT SO HARSHLY!"" and my favorite one (and I kid you not this is one of the defense statements they'll use) ""IT'S JUST A GAME STOP THINKING ABOUT IT SO MUCH AND ENJOY IT!"" which is ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious because as I said earlier this game's actual gameplay isn't even considered a main feature of it.Honestly if you're THAT curious on playing it just pirate it. This isn't worth your money and you know it.			"

												Pros:I love this game's world, the clock-like artifacts that allow people to use magic and the Bracer's Guild are very interesting. As an anime fan I love the art style as well. The graphics convey a comfy feeling and attention to detail make the cities feel alive, every NPC have an unique dialogue.The first Final Fantasy Tactics is one of my favorite games of all time and I find great that this game have turn based grid combat too.You can control everything with mouse and the game performs very well on older computers or low end notebooks wich is great.Cons:The game seems to have been written by a twelve year old. You start with these two characters, the impulsive girl Estelle and her condescending brother Joshua and later on more characters join your team. 10 hours in the game and every scene with these two was the same, Estelle does something unthoughtful and Joshua makes fun of her or someone note that Joshua is mature and attractive and Estelle is childish and ugly and they fight, until you're sick of both. That's a death sentence for a dialogue heavy game like this.The combat is similar to games I like but it's way inferior. You cannot see the grid and it's not clear what's the range of each character. Many attacks knock back the enemies and you cannot tell in what direction, so many one of your characters attacks will take the enemy out of the rest of the team's reach.I would recommend the game if I could get over the terrible writing and annoying characters but I can't.

												I only saw the first two hours of the game before I got bored. The characters and writing seem fine for a JRPG, but I don't like how the combat is tuned. All the fights I had were either me tapping A to win because no actual thought was required or me running into things that were higher level than me which killed me in one hit and I was utterly unable to scratch. There doesn't seem to be a way to speed up or skip the combat animation stuff (nor for that matter is there a text speed option), so it seems like the rest of the game would be mindlessly grinding pathetically easy fights until I had bigger numbers to fight enemies with bigger numbers.Based on some of the other reviews it looks like the story goes to some good places, but I just don't find the game's combat system engaging enough to want to deal with it. A shame. :-(			"

												Wow, glad I got this on a Steam sale and not as full price. The game looks great but if you are a casual gamer more into the story than hard fights then skip this game. The starting area has regular mobs that will drop your primary fighter in two hits, meaning that if there are 3-4 mobs against your two starting party members you are done, and that is on normal difficulty!! A challange is fine but damn!!! Give a person a chance to build up a party or learn a few more ablilties first.If you are not into way steep learning curves give this a pass and find one of the J or K RPGs that does not expect you to be a master right out of the gate. I wish more reviewers had been clear about this.The story may be great but is is usless if you are not skilled enough to get to it. If you have mad skills then by all means have at, if not give this one a pass			"

												Review: A lot of dialogue but, mediocre story. After about 45 hours in, 80% of the game, I started just skimming all dialogue because it was quite uninteresting. Also mediocre were the battle mechanics, and nearly everything else. The soundtrack was not good.Summary: Instead of playing this game you should buy a good book. If you're wanting to play a game though,  buy a decent RPG with a good story, battle mechanics, soundtrack. There are plenty so no need to waste your time on this.			"

												I wonder why there are so many good reviews. Typical tsundere main personage who has nothing special about her is very annoying already from the beginning of the game. The game itself is boring, the dialogues go on forever. The first dialogue that hints this game is nothing special is right at the beginning, at a some kind of underground basement - it is literally too long, too boring and too predictable. The girl just wouldn't shut up and I remember losing patience just trying to skip the talk.After playing more I lost a will to keep up with the story because the dialogues are too long and they aren't even fun, they get tiring and annoying and you just want to skip the whole talk.They are literally too much and long and more often than not are just stupid, plain and dry.Not interesting fights, boring personages, too long and boring story that you get bored of soon enough, plain jokes that are not funny - nothing is epic about this game as people say.This game has nothing in common with such masterpieces as, for example, Chrono Trigger or Grandia 2. If something is labeled as JRPG don't think you expect a great game. Unless you want something to take your time off and not care for a good story development and fun times. This game wont give you any of this.TL;DR: If you want deeper and smarter JRPGs to play, avoid this one.I got this game as a gift and have to say, if I had to spend my own money for this, I would be just sad.

												I am going to briefly compare this game (I will be calling it LHTS) to the Nintendo 3DS game, Popolocrois: A Story of Seasons.Popolocrois has an engaging world where you are a prince and are uniquely treated as a celebrity. However, in LHTS, everyone talks way too damn long, and you're merely a bracer who is essentially a knight who just does fetch quests.Battles have shorter attack animations and grids in Popolocrois than LHTS. Also, there is no voice acting in LHTS unlike Popolocrois, though I suppose that would make the chatter even worse.To give an example of the biggest dealbreaker, it was the mine's backtracking that made me quit the game. I have to use the mine cart that goes 1 way to talk to a miner, then go back and flip the switch to use the elevator, which does not work until I get the key from that miner. So I have to use the mine cart 6 times (1 go to miner, backtrack, flip switch, go to elevator, backtrack, flip switch, go to miner and get key, which he needs to know it was broken rather than him give you the key the first time, backtrack, flip switch, and then go back to the elevator and use it). Then finally to get to the chief, you fight monsters and it takes like 5 mins of expositional dialogue just to get him to join you. Here is an example when he pulls out something shiny and Estelle runs in a circle with it, screaming, ""This is so fun."" That was my cue to quit the game and delete it.			"

												Honestly, the writing dragged the game down. In general it didn't hook me, and then the story between the two leads killed it for me. It was already pretty irritating the way everyone was ragging on the female lead for not being girly enough, but the second that it started trying to angle towards romantic feelings between her and her adopted brother, I was done. They were raised together from a young age, making them adopted siblings doesn't magically make it less skeevy. The game mechanics and broader plot weren't compelling enough to overcome the fact that I was going to be stuck with that stuff for the rest of the game.			"

												Fetch quests: the game.Extremely shallow combat system.  Don't listen to anyone comparing it to Final Fantasy Tactics or trying to suggest it's complex at all.  It's literally the traditional standard JRPG combat system, just requiring you to put more effort into it for no real meaningful payout.  It's just as monotonous.All quests are fundamentally the same: go to place, oh look a monster.The ""Materia""/""Job"" system is only complex in so far that it has any structure at all, otherwise it is also very shallow.And the whole thing is rounded out with completely cliche characters.I guess if you're a fan of the series (this being 4th), go for it, but otherwise prepare for a slouch fest where you watch movies while navigating the entire game with just the mouse because why bother.

												Pros: Nice graphics and scenery. Haven't run into a bug yet. Dialogue is rich. Cons: Where to start... I'm newer to RPG's but getting used to them. As someone who likes my camera locked in place, I can't do that. Every time I exit a building the camera is flipped at different angles making me have to readjust every single time. Second, I got stuck at a part and looked up how to get past it. Their character's level was 5 highers than mine, the drop rates from battles were much higher, the exp gained was much higher, and in effect it seemed much easier. I'm definitely struggling with this game... Possibly change my answer at a later date, but this struggle has really put a damper on my likings to this game. I'll let you know when I finally make it out of the first tower a month from now -_-			"

												I'm giving this game an honest try  and I'm still only in the first Chapter, but as is, I cannot recommend it unless you are severely in lack of JRPG. Believe me, I like me some JRPGs and tacky stories about elements and whatever. I can put up with those, that's fine, and the story here is more or less pretty original, but there's a few different issues: as of yet, this is an handheld import with unimplanted features (such as the Monster book). The protagonist is a girl which's main trait is being a ditz, which we are reminded of CONSTANTLY. The dialogue, which the game is nearly overloaded with, consists of doubtful jokes and a 'will they won't they' relationship between the protagonist and her adopted brother. The grid battle system, while functional, is a bit clunky, as you cannot decide from which facing some characters will hit the target. This results in the occasional issue where a character with reach and mobility will knock an enemy beyond the reach of a shorter ranged character, artificially lenghtening combat, which already is trivial. There's no real penalty to dying, either, as you can just press the 'retry' button and redo your battle from scratch. There is a lot of back-and-forth travelling in this game, which sincerely becomes redundant. You also HAVE to set the camera on free rotation, as the awkward 45 degree angle will otherwise block important features on the field. Only get this game if you're a hardcore fan of JRPGs, as it is average at best, and get it while it's on sale. For anyone else, you're free to pass this and play better games.			"

												Maybe I've been spoiled by my most recent jRPG experience being bravely default, which to me felt like a perfect refresh in a genre that either seems to try to go all action oriented and fails or, as is the case in this game, for me just go too old school.First of all the game starts off dreadfully slow, it did seem to pick up a bit after the prologue but that was already several hours in. What doesn't help with this is the grid-based combat system, while I don't think it's bad in general it does mean characters have to move to their target (sometimes needing another turn before being able to attack) slowing everything down, add to that (as far as I know) attack animations you can't turn off and unskipable special attacks and you're stuck with some very slow combat even for enemies you kill in a single hit.Other than that, there doesn't seem to be any pilaging around houses and other building and all the quests seem to at least have a centralised start. While convenient in a way it makes it feel like there is very little point in actually exploring unless you want that little bit of background information.Now as to why I don't recommend this game, it's really due to little things starting to stack up. Early on in the game there is a monster you have to beat for a quest, it's an enemy type you will not have encountered before (or at least unlikely to, not sure) after a fairly lengthy fight (felt like 5+ mins) it turned out this enemy type self destructs when killed. Which resulted in blowing up my party, while there is a retry option for the fight it did not feel fair in any way.On to the next thing, I like exploring so the first thing I did when leaving the first town was explore the area and I stumbled upon a chest and opened it. Only to find it was guarded by double the amount of enemies I'd fought up until that point while also being stronger versions of those enemies. Mind you I was having no trouble with the other enemies in the area and due to it being early on in the game I assume I was at the average level. This was btw an area you have to go through for the main quest at that point so I wasn't being overzealous in exploring.What finally did it for me were the timed side-quests, while not expecting a perfect 100% playthrough (I prefer not using guides from the start), I returned to town after a main quest only to discover that I failed not only a quest that I did complete but just hadn't turned in, but also 2 more side-quests I didn't even knew existed. Now I don't know exactly when those last 2 were triggered but for the main quest I was doing you are out of town for a while (only spot to pick up and hand in side-quests) and it almost feels like I would have had to backtrack during that main quest to be able to do these side-quests.All of this is resulting in me just feeling like the game is not only old school, it's old school in all the wrong ways. I can look past the graphics and the story actually seems to be pretty good, with characters that seem to surpass the spikey haired 15 year old for the most part. But there have just been too many frustrating things in the game for me to keep playing..			"

												Might be a fun game, if there weren't so many issues with graphics, corrupted save files and dozens of bugs. Looks a little bit like it's half finished.Basically the game keeps crashing every few minutes, making it unplayable.A real waste of money ...			"

												I take some things back after playing for awhile. Didn't realize how long the game would take to get to the actually damn story. I understand the writer might have wanted the characters to grow on people, but its just long and boring situations one after another. Gameplay is good, though quite repetitive.			"

												This game is a great disappointment. I expected something deep like old-style JRPGS I've played (Lufia, Secret of Mana, Terranigma), but this is just cutsie nonesense. The game does nothing to draw you in at all. Combat is lackluster as can be. It may start to become good once you've played 20 hours or so (who knows), but this one is definitely not one of the entertaining variety. Keep away if you don't like it shallow.			"

												Boredom in the SkyTo be fair as this is only the HD version of the game it shouldnt be bashed for the stereotypical ans predicatable characters and story, but to judge the technical part of the game you have to play atleast some hours of it.Unfortunately to get to some meat you have to endure a lot slow pacing boredom.To be clear: i finished the game since i dont like to waste money spend on games, but it was 40+ hours of boredom, fortunately without technical problems, aside from some too big fonts in the menus and cut off lists.No crashes, works in full-HD, altough many textures could have been provided with higher resolution versions.Some assets stayed in 4:3 instead of getting 16:9 updates, like some maps and effects (smoke in that tower...).The overall feeling is of HD-bait for a series that will get a sequel next year, but still is below mediocre compared to pretty much any RPG of the last decade.Recommended if you are curious how an HD treatment affects an old game on PC, else wait for it to drop to 5 bucks to be worth the buy.

												About four hours in there is a point of no return where item shops will be unavailable for the next 2-3 hours or so. Healing items don't drop in battle. Tried to play, with a lot of retrying battles and resetting, for the next five hours or so with  no healing items and no MP for spells. Impossible to proceed and I am not going to start the whole game over again and spend ten hours so I can take another try at it. Poor design.UPDATE/CLARIFICATION: the part I am refering to is after you travel to the lakeside lodge to investigate the sky pirates and then sneak aboard their ship. You end up stuck in their base. I didn't have enough resources to complete this (I lacked area of effect spells so fighting huge groups of mooks was a slog. this was actually the real problem that caused me to run out of resources) and tried so many times to complete the mission.   The final salt in the wounds moment came when after finally winning the boss fight (jesus christ) I was like ""finally it is over"" and then every single henchman you beat up on your way down returns to fight you on the way out. and they even throw in a snide little comment in the conversation tet  that is basically ""tough♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. No way for me to heal after the boss fight when I'm out of resources and I tried several times. Didn't have the decency to just let me go back to town after a fairly difficult boss fight.The time I put in to this game, while passably average for an rpg, turned into work for me when I reached this point, not entertainment. And I'm not putting in another eight hour shift of RPG work to try to get past it, not with so many other decent gaming options.			"

												You're an idiot.  Lol jk you're cool.  It's just that you once said your favorite color was seven.  Just kidding, I like you.  But seriously though, are you sure you can change that light bulb?  No really, you're going to ♥♥♥♥ that up.  Give that to me.  We're still cool, right?  What?  You think that light makes this room look pretty?  What a ♥♥♥♥ing ditz.Congratualtions.  You have now experienced the first two hours of this game.  Well I guess you'd have to also include a long, wordy, poorly implemented unskipable tutorial, but unlike the constant barrage of insults, it doesn't completely ruin the rest of the game.It seems like Falcom wanted to do a thing where you play the athletic but kind of dumb girl, and your companion is your booksmart but weaker brother, and the dialogue between the two would include a lot of banter about these things.  The problem is that the way they implemented it, it's more like you're the athletic but kind of dumb girl, and he's the smart, handsome guy that all the ladies desire and who constantly reminds you of how much you suck in comparison.  Gameplay wise, he's just better than you at everything, including hand to hand combat, to the point where your character almost feels unnecessary.  And for the first two hours, he just won't stop reminding you of how dumb your character is.  Any individual line about it would probably just look like normal banter between siblings, but it's pretty much unending in the early portion of the game, and your character rarely does more than pout about it and get annoyed.  The shear volume of it makes it come off as straight up bullying.  And it's not just in response to your character doing dumb things.  That light bulb thing and calling you a ditz just for commenting on how a room looks were me paraphrasing real things he says to you.And it gets worse with him.  A few missions in, you have a little cut scene between your character and a friend of hers.  The friend goes on and on about how handsome your brother is, how all the girls desire him, and how incredibly nice he is.  You know, the guy whose only interaction with you outside of business has been abuse.  I guess that's not fair.  In the first dungeon, he does tell your character that she was pretty good at what she did.  Of course, he finished it off by calling you stupid again, undercutting his whole point, but hey, it seemed like he actually gave a♥♥♥♥♥♥about you for a minute.  Oh, and this friend also points out how it would be totally OK for your character to hook up with him, since he was adopted.  Yeah.Anyway, at the end of that mission, he insists that he wants to kill these now defenseless creatures, and it takes a while to talk him out of it.  You head back inside, and he reveals to you that he doesn't feel compassion and still wants to kill those things.  So how does your character react to her abusive brother admitting he's a sociopath?  By reassuring him that he's totally not like that, and she would know since they bonded so well in the five years that happened off camera between him joining the family and the start of the game.  Then she says she's glad he finally opened up to her, since he usually hides his feelings.  It's not clear how she thinks she knows him if he never opened up over that period.So why am I going on about this one guy so much?  HE'S YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE INTEREST!  Yes, in order to appreciate this game's story, you have to be OK with a woman getting nasty with her abusive, sociopatic brother.  Even aside from that, the guy is an obvious Mary Sue, completely with a dark and mysterious past.  It's like what would happen if you found a 13 year old who was really into Final Fantasy games and had him come up with the protagonist for an RPG.  He's totally awesome and badass and gets to tell other people how much better he is without retaliation.  Oh, and he's totally the protagonist.  You play his love interest.But that's not the entire game, and I've heard that they cut down on the insults as the game goes on.  I've gotten to that point, and honestly, without many insults to get mad about and being unable to care about the protagonist of the game, it's mostly just kind of boring.  The writing tends to try way too hard to be witty and is needlessly wordy and repetitive.  I mean like there's one part where you find an elevator that doesn't work, so you find a guy 20 feet away who gives you a key and says you can use that and that the elevator goes down to your objective.  So you run 20 feet back and try to use it, and your brother then explains that you can use this key on the elevator, that it goes down, and that you should probably do so.  Why they didn't just have the elevator work when you have the key rather than give you 4 text boxes, I have no idea.Gameplay wise, I have mixed feelings.  The idea of initiative manipulation in combat is interesting, but I'm not sure if it always works.  There isn't much you can do to manipulate it aside from one special attack that you get once every few fights.  And the fact that spells don't always take effect right after your caster does them can be frustrating, mostly because you can't tell when they'll take effect until the caster's turn.  There've been a few occasions where I decided to attack with one character, then heal with another only to find that the enemy got a turn before I could heal.  Once this even happened when the enemy didn't get that turn for the same damn spell earlier in the battle.  This game doesn't have random encounters, but it might as well have had them.  You can only see enemies as you get close to them, and some enemies blend in on some backgrounds, anyway, so you'll still get surprise fights.  And this is one of those games where your whole party trails behind you as you move, and you get attacked if any of them are touched by the enemy.  And in a given area, it's often the same one or two groups of enemies that you fight over and over.  Once you figure out the best way to deal with them, all the battles there just become tedious.  At least Dragon Quest games let you mash A to get past the more repetitive battles.  The complexity of the combat system seems to make random encounters last longer and take more effort than it does to make anything fun.If there's anything positive to say about this game, it's the presentation.  This looks and sounds fantastic.  I highly recommend getting a copy of the soundtrack.  If someone made a mod of this game that removed all but the necessary, mission relevent dialogue, this game might have gotten a recommendation for these things alone.  But sadly, the mediocre gameplay and bad writing just make the whole thing an aesthetically pleasing slog.  There are far better JRPGs out there than this for almost any platform.			"

However, there is way too much dialogue for my taste and you will be at the very beginning of the game for about 10 minutes minimum and that includes the animation that plays for an EXTREMELY big amount of time. I swear, they shouldve made THAT their trailer for this game. in the end, there is way too much dialogue and information, and not enough gameplay. and by information, I mean they will tell you what to do, but then go into huge amounts of detail why and such, which eventually you forget. I only made it out of the beginning and gave up on this game. If you are into more story than game, then this is a good game. otherwise, this gets a 6/10 from me.			"

Repetitive. Grind. Grind. Dungeon. Tower. Strong monster. Boss. Rinse and repeat.  Story after 45h (Almost two whole ♥♥♥♥ing days - I could have gone to Paris for a wild weekend involving heavy drugs and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and possibly best baguette ever). Forgettable is all I can say. In other words. CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME REMEBER WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. Ask me about Chrono trigger or cross I've played years and years ago.

The game wants to be Hayao Miyazaki, if the opening cutscene is any indication; it really, profoundly /isn't/, and never will be, Hayao Miyazaki, if the rest of it is. But then, I bought it knowing perfectly well that it wasn't going to be brilliant; all I'm hoping for out of it is ""more human interest than /Hearts of Iron III/.""... On completing the tutorial and getting into the first quest, I've had enough of this. Combat is /slow/, full of loading screens and unnecessary animations -- I don't have the patience for this.			"

												I recommend this game if you like pretending its 2005…Remember those Gust/NIS games from the mid 2000’s? Games like Mana Khemia and Atelier Iris? You don’t?! Well count your lucky stars casanova! You dodged hundreds of hours of repetition, boredom and poor story telling. Unfortunately, I was not spared. I confess, mediocre JRPGs used to be my jam, my raison d’etre if you will. Prozac and alchemy school were the only things keeping me going in those pitch black days of loneliness and grinding. Eventually my mistress and I grew apart; I realised she was abusive, stealing my time and giving only poorly translated dialogue and unintelligible plots in return. We amicably separated and that was the last I heard of Miss JRPG. But then Trails in the Sky temps me like a vixen and alas, I invite her into my library, like a tedious, engrish spouting vampire into my home. Why did I buy it? Why did I break my fast?? Why go through the pain and suffering again and again like some Nietzscheian nightmare??? Was it the promise of “people, places, ideas, events and lore that rival in complexity those of even the most highly-regarded fantasy epics in literature” (lie)? Was it to play a “50+ hour masterpiece” (wrong)? Was it to “see what Japanese gamers have been raving about for over ten years” (Monster Hunter, tentai and panty vending machines)? My friends, don’t let yourself fall into the same pit of despair and agony I have. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice bad review.I give Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky 3 pieces of materia out of 10     "

												I have only played it for about 5 hours and still find the ""how you do stuff"" of the game to be difficult. The cutie kiddie look of the game is different but not appealing to me.  If you are looking for something that plays like Dragon Age or Skyrim, this is definetly not that. The approach to gaming is very different than the RPGs we are used to. That said, if you are willing to put in the time it can be rewarding.			"

												If you like reading mindless drivel then this game is for you!  I Had the game on for over 20 minutes before I could take control of a character then it was just more mindless drivel!Example ""What would you like for dinner""?. ""I'd Like some fish sauted with balsamic vinegar""! ""Well I'm not sure how to make that"". ""Only kidding, Ill have the usual fried fish and omlette"".   This kind of thing went on and on and on and on and on and on and on until I started to cry and quit the game as soon as possible and requested a refund!In all honesty I never got to play the game so I don't know about gameplay etc!

												Best $15 bucks ever spent in my life ( got it on sale )Would pay $30 with no regrets.[ TL;DR ] Buy this game if you're into JRPGs, you will NOT regret it.  Show support by buying this game so they will have more reason to bring more to Steam. [ /TL;DR ]I've always been a big fan of the Squaresoft/enix games ( such as Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, etc ) and this one was well worth the buy.  It's one of those things that you'll live to regret not ever experiencing if you are into JRPGs so do yourself a favor and get it NOW, stop reading this review, buy it, and play it.But if you want more... Character development was on par with some of the best I've seen in any game.  You really get to love each character no matter how much ( or little ) screen time they get.  I found myself wanting to do every single thing I could in the game, just to see more happen between the characters because after a while, they started growing on me.Game had lots of side things to do - missable items, quests, secret points, etc.  Difficulty was just right.  I never had much of a problem because I'm one of those people that leveled up whenever I could, to reach a good level before progressing with the story.The story kept me hooked, and of the 5 days I took to finish the first playthrough... my sense of time was extremely messed up. Talking to many NPCs more than once actually brings up interesting conversations, and some even give you leads on what to do.  I couldn't even see some of the plot twists and surprises coming, which is always a plus for me.The OST was amazing.  I don't really know any more I could say about it.  There were times when I would be playing and would just start whistling or humming the BGM of the place I was currently in, and I don't do that often.This is the first review I've written for any game for the public, because I feel that it'd be a crime not to write one after experiencing how good of a game it was.  If being the only game good enough for me to want to write a review for ( I'm a pretty hardcore gamer at that ) isn't enough to convince you to buy this game, then I don't really know what will.Absolutely can not wait for the second ( of three ) games in this trilogy.  Will definitely be buying it at the first chance I get.			"

												Although the game is good and I would recommend it there are few things I don't like... - It gets repetetive and there is a certain amount of backtracking... ( areas, getting to major city and doing guild quests... )- combat feels a bit cheap and you are stuck with default weapons for every character ( so basically you can't create your own style ). I hate combat because there is utterly no significance to ""Move"" command. In othere games you would have ""Move"" phase where u can get out of the AoE danger or to position yourself better so you can get critical hit etc. However in this game once you use one command then that's it... you either Move or Attack ( use arts etc. ) And criticals are all about stealing them from your enemies... by looking at the line up you can defeat or use special art skill to get in front of enemy action bar and steal their ""perks""... This system feels shallow and cheap at times... Thus said you are in for the story not for the combat. So is the story good ? Well its ok. Characters are a bit cliche but what I like in this game its that it starts slowly... its well written and it doesn't rush itself. You enjoy the conversations and sometimes you even have a choice what to say ( but does it affect the outcome of the conversation ? No. its linear. Characters will correct you if you goof around so yeah.... )Sometimes I was angry on main characters and their ""goody two shoes"" attitude and self-righteous actions. A lot of times I felt bad about the bandits and I would even stand in their defense but oh well game won't allow for that.So it's a solid turn based / tactical rpg that leans more on choosing skills, equipment and story rather than combat...I would recommended it regardless of its flaws and things I didn't like.

												this game is great! i put my time almost 45hrs playing this game and not even on chapter 2 yet lol. i like to explore(talking with each NPCs etc and sometimes theres funny things to it, i dont rush especially when somethings are hidden). there's not many jRPG available for PC and this game is really decent. for graphics, 2.5D(semi 3D) lot better than most jRPGs that are not MMO (Ys franchise, Recettear, Chantelise, etc). as for battle system, it is turn-based, use 2 types of skills, quartz magics and crafts (normal and special move, S-Crafts) the rare thing is most turn based game are more similar to the visual novel games(static image and ton of words) but it's not, you can move freely within maps and when you encountered a monster charge and battle! similar to Wakfu. what more? cooking, fishing, read books and news, side quest, etc and no you wont get any money from monsters but guild reward and sepith (which later can be convert as money but for achievement hunter, gonna be a liitle harder). i haven't finished the game yet but for most i enjoy the game more than ys and the other. 9/10			"

Motto: Genial things are simple.This is first game from three chapters . You are following story and life of Estelle Bright young bracer and her friends. Love, fear, ominous enemies twists in characters .  The graphic is simple, isometric resembles of Ragnarok online or Breath of fire IV. There is no search for hidden objects in towns and settlements, no walls of text during dialogues or dialogue options, no tough moral decisions,  character are sometimes a little shallow  . Combat can be challenging at higher difficulities ,even frustrating especially in second chapter but nothing inovative.So why for God sake I recommend it to You? Because this game has soul! Something that force you to follow the story, be fond of characters  simply sit down and enjoy the flow of narrative. Something that force you to write your first review after really huge amount games played . Not being distracted  by too many side things or huge lore, it let you simply enjoy the show. By simple doesn´t mean simplistic or not polished, on the contrary  Dialogues are usually short especially with commoners but... Every! character even a little one, every commoner will change his line after story progresses. Game is divided into chapters and after you ended  chapter  fighted the boss, you can (but don´t have to), visit everyone you get acquainted with and hear what more he or she  has to say or simply move on . It makes You feel that  this world is actually living its live, not waiting for you to appear play its role and then freeze in time.  You see that creators put lot of love in it and making things look simple requires lot of work and love.If u dont mind being guided through simple but interesting story with character twists In JRPG style, If You dont mind absence of open world this game is for You and is worth every penny. Just sit to your PC and enjoy your show.			"

The story was amazing, full of emotion; very well written. The music was exceptional and fit perfectly in each scene. The gameplay was engaging and fun and the various mechanics set in place just further enhanced the experience. Heres to hoping the second chapter for this game gets put on Steam soon. I fully recommend this game to anyone looking for a long and wonderful adventure in the land of Liberl.			"

												Overall a good game.  It's well translated, written, and witty.  The only issues are:1. The battle system which feels rather repetitive.  Some of the boss fights don't make any sense either.2. The AMOUNT of dialogue.  I have played 60+ hours.  I probably spent 30 of them reading.  It's not that the text is bad, it's just everywhere.  The shop people have 2, 3, 4 text boxes of speech.  It's nice that the world feels ""lived in"" but, at some point, you just want to get the important info and move on.  Oh by the way, don't skip, important info is scattered randomly within the jibba jabba.  3. The story is really slow for the first 20 hours.  Like ""real time"" ""slice of life"" slow.  The end and ending are brilliant, so stick with it.			"

The story was phenomenal, the combat and other mechanics were great. The difficulty was pretty tame, so it added to the story without being frustrating.

All of the PC's and important NPC's are introduced and developed nicely. However, for me, the greatest thing is the interaction between Estelle and Joshua which keeps you entertained the whole game.9/10nb: now where is the SC..........			"

												You start off as a couple of young adults training to be the police equivalent in a small industrializing nation, and end up being embroiled in a web of organized crime, political intrigue, international conspiracy, and forbidden technology. The ending both answers and raises a lot of questions, preparing the way for the very much anticipated sequel to be translated.There are some minor details lost in translation and some juvenille humour, but overall a very high quality and content filled RPG. The grid based tactical battles are easy to comprehend, and encounters are not random but engaged in a Chrono Trigger like fashion by running into them. The magic system is a little convoluted for my taste, but is very unique and allows for great character customization. Also has new game + if you're into that sort of thing.			"

												There are very few games where at the end of them I can stop and just say ""beautiful."" This is one of them. For a JRPG, this is on par with some of the greats like Chrono Trigger. The story is brilliant, the dialoge feels natural (I live streamed the entire game, and after getting comfortable doing voices, I can say that reading the dialoge out-loud felt natural and fluid), the characters are memorable, and the world building is rather nice, too. The game's music is alright, but I feel that sometimes it doesn't always fit. The combat starts out seeming very shallow, but as you progress, you discover more diverse ways of making characters unique in a similar manner to FF7's Materia setup. The story starts a bit slow, but does pick up quickly and is truely memorable. It does end on a cliffhanger, and the second game for this trilogy has yet to be translated for English audiances, so keep that in mind. For the current 20$ price, however; you get around 60hrs of a truely beautiful game. Most highly recommended.			"

												Good animation in this one.  Styalised character sprites of the chibi style (I believe), and an easily rotateable camera have everything looking nice from may angles (retation is required laster to see some paths).Not gotten that far in myself, but the story is well-written.  Not for people who don't want to sit and read, because everything out of combat involves lots of nattering with NPC'sNice and simple combat mechanics.  Maximum move/attack distance every turn, with chargable special attacks, and magical skills that can be swapped in and out depending on your choice and, to a degree, the character's specialisation.

Very few times did i need to use the internet to learn where to go, but i must also admit i can not beat what (appears to be) the final boss. He/she/it (no spoilers) is crazy strong and i just cant go on. So after 100 hours of doing every little thing, im ok with stopping at the final boss. This is only one chapter of a larger 3 part series but only part 1 is on Steam. I highly reccomend this game.			"

												You start off as a couple of young adults training to be the police equivalent in a small industrializing nation, and end up being embroiled in a web of organized crime, political intrigue, international conspiracy, and forbidden technology. The ending both answers and raises a lot of questions, preparing the way for the very much anticipated sequel to be translated.There are some minor details lost in translation and some juvenille humour, but overall a very high quality and content filled RPG. The grid based tactical battles are easy to comprehend, and encounters are not random but engaged in a Chrono Trigger like fashion by running into them. The magic system is a little convoluted for my taste, but is very unique and allows for great character customization. Also has new game + if you're into that sort of thing.			"

												I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of classic JRPGs in the vein of Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger, or Xenogears.  Its graphical presentation is most like Xenogears, with an isometric view of 3D environments and 2D sprites placed on top of it.  It looks very good on the PC, with very little aliasing.  Combat is turn-based.  There is a deep system of special attacks and magical attacks, somewhat similar to Finaly Fantasy 7's materia system in that you must ""slot"" special items called Quartz that you create from refining elemental materials called Sepith, but it is introduced gradually and very easy to manage once you understand it.  You'll find yourself whistling along with the music, which is quite good, and the dialog utilizes anime-style portraits to convey emotions alongside the text.  The writing and localization were excellently done, and there is a lot of it.  The story progresses in a linear fashion, and starts out with a stereotypical pretense, and a lot of attention is given to character relationships in dialog.  All of which are common to games in this genre, and for fans of it, will be seen as positive traits.  It's also quite long in the telling.			"

												Overall decent old school JRPG. I've long ago played secret of mana,FF tactic.Quite a lot of dialog/contemplating phase for digest so be aware, still remain fun,emotional,ect.Combat system similar to tactical rpg(FFVII,FF tactic). Difficulty is OK, it's not too hard/complex if you discovering, neither too easy since engaging combat combat without take account of monster behavor will usualy lead to game over( or run away when it's possible and that your not too proud for it ).Trail in the sky is a little journey worth trying to start, in the hope of future release of the second arc on PC.

												Kotaku has called this game the best JRPG of the decade (so far) this month.  I haven't played enough JRPGs lately to really say if I agree or not, but this game is easily one of the best I've ever played.I'm a person who loves a game with a rich story, and the world in Trails in the Sky is alive, with every character, no matter how minor, being given a name and a backstory.  Combat is interesting and plays a lot like chess.  Enemies are not randomly encountered, and instead work a lot like Earthbound:  they appear on the ouside world, and you can attack (or be attacked by) them for a surprise attack, in both directions.  Turn order is shown during battle, and the things you do can affect the way the turns are played out.  A nice amount of tactical play in an otherwise pretty standard JRPG.The world is large and very linear.  Doesn't bother me, but if you're looking for a more open world, while you're free to explore the area of the world you're in, each chapter on the game takes place in one of five areas and you are not allowed to visit any of the ones you're not currently in.This game will take a lot of time.  I did a standard, no-guide playthrough, and I was not even close to a 100% completion, and it still took 43 hours.  I'm currently working on a 100% save and at the time of this review have put 10 hours in and am only halfway through Chapter 1 (which is actually the second chapter).  The biggest thing I like about this game though is its save system:  While it is a very long game, you can save anywhere and at any time (except during battle).  Theres no checkpoint system, when you load your save, youre exactly where youre at.  If you die in battle, you dont go back to a checkpoint, you get an option to retry the battle again, no matter how many times you need it.  There is a huge amount of manual save files you can use, and every time you move through a room the game autosaves.  I lost power twice during my first playthrough, and was extremely pleased to see the autosaves each time meant I had only lost a few minutes of work rather than hours (I'm terrible at saving manually).Final thoughts:  To me, this is the quintessential JRPG.  It pulled at my nostalgia while also providing me with a new story, new characters, and a new battle system, that keeps me interested and playing.			"

												This game has quickly become my favorite JRPG game of all time. This game does everything right; it has a fanastic story, great battle mechanics, and lovable characters. The game took me about 50 hours to complete, and not a single minute of it felt boring or dull. This was because about a third of the game is spent on reading dialog between characters that really builds up a believable and enjoyable world for you to explore. If you are a fan of JRPGs, you must play this game!			"

												JRPGs have a reasonable following in the world at large, but it’s only in the last few years that they’ve become readily available on Steam. What was once a barren wasteland for JRPG fans has slowly blossomed, and gamers now find themselves with a decent catalogue to choose from whenever popping online. So now we found ourselves, over a year after Trails in the Sky’s Steam release date, investigating to see how it holds up to the competition.	In many ways, Trails in the Sky is standard fare for JRPGs. You have a coming of age story for the two protagonist siblings, Estelle and Joshua, a budding romance, and a seemingly small quest that expands to world-saving proportions as the game progresses. You could even fairly say that the story of the game isn’t particularly exciting, and doesn’t begin to move until you’re about thirty hours of the game. Instead, Trails in the Sky leans more heavily on the character interactions throughout the game to keep players interested. Of major note is the way your party changes as the game progresses. Unlike many JRPG titles, most party members in Trails of the Sky are not permanent additions. As a result, you have a rolling party roster instead of one that slowly grows throughout the game. Players get to know a new character throughout each chapter of the story. It’s a neat way to give players a chance to constantly get to know characters, but it’s not always for the best.	A distinct pattern sets in as the game progresses, with each chapter’s progress marked pretty similarly. You meet a new character. A small incident occurs requiring your attention, and you help them out. The trouble grows, and more about the new character is woven into the adventure. It’s not a bad way to write a story, but seeing it four times in the same game? It’s a little much. Thankfully, all these meetings do culminate into one impressive final chapter, but it’s a shame that the story takes so long to get off the ground as a result.	Luckily, Trails in the Sky’s combat is much less formulaic. The standard turn-based system players might expect is quite a bit different, and instead you’ll find yourself battling enemies on a small map. Characters can freely move around the map on their turns, and you must rely on your position and turn order to take advantage of your opponents. In fact, turn order might be the most crucial part of the battle. As the battle progresses, you can see bonuses that certains will acquire on their turns. If you time your magic spells correctly or insert yourself into one of those turns using a special attack, you can grab bonuses from your enemies for yourself. As a result, carefully managing your craft points (CP), which increase every time you deal or receive damage, is vital, as you need at least 100/200 to launch one of your “Special Breaks.” A large, screen-dominating attack that can be used any time during the battle at the cost of all your character’s CP points. As a result, battles rarely feel stale, even if some of them can drag on a little long.	Longer boss battles can be a lot of fun, but against your everyday grunts it starts to feel like a chore later in the game. This isn’t helped by cheery, yet repetitive battle music throughout the adventure. The same music persists outside of battle as well, and until the final chapter, you can expect to hear the same town, city, overworld, and dungeon themes no matter where you go. Thankfully, the themes we do have are quite well done. I only wish we could’ve had a few more of them. It’s to the composer’s credit that I didn’t ever dislike the music, but spend fifty hours with any song, and you’ll start to get bored.	For all my complaints though, I enjoyed Trails in the Sky. It’s a slow starter, but the ending was strong and left me anticipating the second chapter’s release on Steam. If you’re not a patient gamer, then Trails in the Sky might not be for you. If you enjoy getting to know a large cast, starting an epic, 3-game saga, and interesting combat, give it a shot! "

												Please ignore my lack of hours played, i already completed it before on PSP  & VitaIMHO, The story is very interesting, It is great but light-hearted and funny, which makes it is easy to follow through.I also really liked the battle music, which is somewhat different than any other JRPGs out there which gives a good vibe and doesn't makes you easily bored in normal battles.But, what really makes this game shines is the characters. All of the PC's and important NPC's are introduced and developed nicely. However, for me, the greatest thing is the interaction between Estelle and Joshua which keeps you entertained the whole game.9/10nb: now where is the SC..........			"

As of gameplay, I found the game difficulty adequate, bosses, dungeons and grinding were neither too easy or too hard.

												Good animation in this one.  Styalised character sprites of the chibi style (I believe), and an easily rotateable camera have everything looking nice from may angles (retation is required laster to see some paths).Not gotten that far in myself, but the story is well-written.  Not for people who don't want to sit and read, because everything out of combat involves lots of nattering with NPC'sNice and simple combat mechanics.  Maximum move/attack distance every turn, with chargable special attacks, and magical skills that can be swapped in and out depending on your choice and, to a degree, the character's specialisation.

												A tactical turn based JRPG? Hell yeah. I sat through the typical slow opening and i was very pleased with the direction of the game. Very few times did i need to use the internet to learn where to go, but i must also admit i can not beat what (appears to be) the final boss. He/she/it (no spoilers) is crazy strong and i just cant go on. So after 100 hours of doing every little thing, im ok with stopping at the final boss. This is only one chapter of a larger 3 part series but only part 1 is on Steam. I highly reccomend this game.			"

												One of the greatest JRPGs ever made makes its way to steam.  It is story heavy and has virtually no voice acting outside of battles.  It is originally a PSP game so don't expect pretty graphics although this games look does have its own charm.			"

												After playing this game i realy like it. The combatsystem is not super complicated but the charm of this game comes with the story. The game realy makes you feel for the characters, with some twits and turns. If you dont like textboxes then dont buy this game, as it has alot and i mean ALOT of text to read. The story starts of slow but after the second chapter things get realy, realy good. On a side note i am still waiting for the second game, so yeha if you like this game be prepared to have to wait a while for the next. :(			"

												3.5 hours in and I can say with confidence that this is a game wirth sinking your teeth into for a little while. It's definitely got that FF feel, but the theme is less overwhelming/all-encompassing. Definitely a fun bit to put some time into. However, if you're seeking something with some maturity and graphic action, this may not be the game for you. A little slow to start, but once you understand the characters and their lives, it's fun.			"

												    This game quickly became my favorite in my library. This is my first review so bare with me. I found it durring the anual steam sales and almost skipped it. I am so glad I did not.     First off this game is a jrpg on steam. If that is all you needed to hear to play this game then go on and buy this game now and stop reading this review. For those who do not recognize this term it stands for Japanese role playing games. The most famous series being Final Fantasy. Google would be a good resourse if you want more information. And now back to the review.      Graphics are very nostalgic. If the look of 16bit era games appeals to you then this game will be no exception. The asthetics in this game are very pretty. Character sprites are very well done. Nothing revolutionary, but whatever computer you are running should have no problems running this.     The combat is really fun. Please note this is a turn based combat system. For those of you who are use to more action based games this might be a downside. That being said this combat system is really well done. It is simple which makes it very easy to learn. However it has enough challlenge to it to engage you in the fights. The main quest line keeps you about at the level you need to be so grinding is not very necessary.         The writing of this game is exceptional. The characters in this game are wounderful. The dialoge is so well done that the characters just seem real. The plot is very well done. It details an adventure that never makes you question why any of the characters are involved with the story.      Now the most intriging part of this game, and something I was not expecting is how in depth the world is. The first major accomplishment is every character not only has a name, but their dialogue changes throughout the story. and when I say any character I mean every character. The shop keepers, quest givers, the people eating at the resteraunts, that little girl who is wating for her mother and every character that is in the game all have thier own name and changing dialogue. Also another wonderous thing is that the main characters are not the only travelers in this game. Minor npcs can be found in other towns and have thier own paths to travel in the game. The longer you spend in the game the more you realize how much work was out into it. The world feels very alive and natural. that takes a lot of attention to detail.      Now I hope that you are just as thriled about this game as I am. It is worth a lot more than twenty dollars and is very good. Go buy it and experence it for yourself. This is a masterpiece so go enjoy it. If I did not sell it to you read some of the other reviews. The only thing I can say is to reiterate that this game is a masterpiece.   "

												A very enjoyable and not too grindy JRPG. The gem system allows you to mix and match gems to obtain different spells and gain trait bonuses. The story is captivating (albeit it does have certain tropes involved) and sports some very interesting characters.The story unfurls in chapters, so back-tracking to previous world locations is not possible. This also occurs with other party members, so you do not get to pick and choose for most of the game. If you liked Final Fantasy 8 , you will find this game very enjoyable.			"

												just finshed the game, easy to play but with some nice customisations to gameplay make it overall fun and entertaining even if the excessive small talk dialogue is f***ing annoying at times.....BUT with joyous character quirks like a new age dominatix style alchoholic who's 'special move' is to run at the screen with her cleavage and then tell her opponents 'someones been naughty' and then proceeds to whip them vigourosly while she giggles, a dirty neu-romantic pervy poet that tries to sleaze on everyone even the teenagers and a somewhat incestuos sister-adopted brother romance plot make it all worth while!

												TL;DR : Money well spent! Adorable graphics, can run on a low spec laptop, GREAT GREAT storyline&music and characters, almost like a good book. 35 hours of playtime. But, I wouldn't recommend playing this game if you are not a fan of reading dialogues! The good portion of game involves reading but dialogues are not boring but if you are into 'SKIP SKIP QUEST SKIP SKIP' then the game is not for you.I was looking for a relaxing game that I could play on my laptop, sometimes playing competitive games or FPS can be tiring. I wanted a game that was playble with keyboard only (as I intended to play on my laptop) with a great story line. This game has an awesome storyline and great dialogues, it's almost like reading a novel! I even ended up playing this game on my desktop because I wanted to know what happens in the storyline. The game has great characters with different personalities, a great plot-twist at the end. I am going to start play the second chapter now and I can't wait.It took me like 35 hours to finish the game so the money well spent (though Steam says 64 hours, that's because I left the game running in the background)!Edited : THE SOUNDTRACKS ARE AMAZING			"

												The gameplay is solid and has some novel mechanics, while not being revolutionary in any particular regard.  There's orbment (i.e. magic) system frustrated me a little - Much of it goes unexplained outside of an in-game manual, and it's quite cumbersome to keep flicking between the manual and the menus to figure out which combinations of orbments will gain you access to which spells.  Around mid-game when I had access to most types of orbments, I slapped a ""good enough"" config into my characters and then never had the incentive or desire to delve back into it other than to replace orbments with higher level ones.Support and defensive orbments/abilities also seemed to be unnecessary throughout the entire game, other than in the final boss battle.  It all just boiled down to damage, damage, damage...What really kept me playing though were the game's story/writing, the music, and the attention to detail.  Unlike many JRPGs, the plot is engaging and coherent and the characters are interesting and relatable.  It's all quite trope-heavy, so don't expect stunning levels of originality - but it's pulled off with enough charm and intrigue to keep you nicely entertained.The music is catchy and pleasant - up there with Final Fantasy at times.  Sound effects are pretty standard / nothing special.  The attention to detail can be seen in the environments (particularly in the towns), enemies, dialog, etc...  It feels like a lot of care has been put into the game.I was happy to sink ~50 hours into it, and would recommend it to JRPG fans.			"

												I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of classic JRPGs in the vein of Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger, or Xenogears.  Its graphical presentation is most like Xenogears, with an isometric view of 3D environments and 2D sprites placed on top of it.  It looks very good on the PC, with very little aliasing.  Combat is turn-based.  There is a deep system of special attacks and magical attacks, somewhat similar to Finaly Fantasy 7's materia system in that you must ""slot"" special items called Quartz that you create from refining elemental materials called Sepith, but it is introduced gradually and very easy to manage once you understand it.  You'll find yourself whistling along with the music, which is quite good, and the dialog utilizes anime-style portraits to convey emotions alongside the text.  The writing and localization were excellently done, and there is a lot of it.  The story progresses in a linear fashion, and starts out with a stereotypical pretense, and a lot of attention is given to character relationships in dialog.  All of which are common to games in this genre, and for fans of it, will be seen as positive traits.  It's also quite long in the telling.			"

												This is the first game that I have played in a LONG time that actually made me feel like I did when I was 10 and played games like Breath of Fire on my SNES. It's a great game that feels like the old RPGs from the 90s. Music is cute and catchyBattle tends to range between SUPER easy and ""WTF?!"" Leveling is a bit of a grind, but I'm sure you know that already.The characters are a lot of fun and cover the entirety of anime tropes.I really think if you give this game a real chance you'll fall in love with it, or at the very least you'll fall in love with what the game is attempting to do.

												Barely recommending this game.Pros:*Excellent port to PC*Story, characters, and text dialogue are AAA and involving (so much so that I went hunting and found the old OVA, Yay!)*There is some actual strategy that goes into the turn-based fights along with pre-fight prep (though less so here involving gear which is limited, but rather with skill selection via ""orbments"" which are interesting). I'd call the game strategy lite in this regard.Cons:Just one, but it's really bringing me down here with 24 hours in... the game is on rails. It's on rails real bad actually. So much so that I am starting to wonder whether I should just go watch my anime. If Skyrim is OPEN world, then Trails here is most assuredly CLOSED. Heck you can't even zone if you haven't had a key interaction yet (one of your party members will suggest ""hey, we should go back..."". It's to the point where if I am not really doing anything in the world then I'm inclined to tell the game ""Well, you let the clutch out and I'll just sit here and watch. You clearly don't need me""We could use more JRPGs on Steam, especially ones of AAA quality like this one. But lets find some with MORE player choice and gameplay instead of gameWATCH.			"

												I've heard lots of good things about this game, so I finally caved in and bought it. Only about thirty minutes in and I was already enjoying it. The first couple chapters exceeded my expectations. The story is action-packed and the characters are loveable while not being cliche.Originally, I had a rant here about erratic difficulty, but I think I overexaggerated it a bit. There is still difference in difficulty between sidequests and story progression and sometimes required battles are quite difficult. My problem is that I forgot items even existed. Once I stocked up on items and started really using them, the difficulty dropped from impossible to challenging but manageable. Learn from my mistakes, readers: stock up on items and use them. You're gonna need them, especially once you hit Chapter 3. The retry offset function is there as well if you need it.Anyway, the story and characters are great and I highly recommend it to any RPG fans out there.			"

												8/10What I like:-Turn order is based on unit speed. If a unit is faster, it gets more turns. Nifty buff system tied to turn order. -No random battles. You can always avoid enemies.-Spells are ""built"" for each unit based on different combinations of skill gems.-Built in support for my fake snes controller. No profiler needed.-The art is good. Lots of different enemies with very little palette swapping happening.What I disliked:-Too much dialogue.-Watered down strategy. All battles take place on flat maps with no cover or barriers. All maps are the same size. Units can run right past enemies with no penalty. Unit placement only matters with respect to AOE skills.-Items, weapons, and armor are all very uninteresting. Each unit can only have one very specific weapon type and each weapon upgrade only ever increases damage (which is silly cause there are TONS of different stats).-Very little control over how your squad is set up. Even though there are lots of units, which ones are assigned to you is dependent on the story.-Too. Much. Dialogue.			"

												Great jrpg reminder of the ps1 era with art inspiration from the suikoden series.The combat system is a mix between classic turn based and grid system, it has its flaws but it's solid and works.The exploration is mostly linear and it's story related, meaning that after some events you won't be able to come back to the places you previously visited or even finishing quests you started.This is a really story intensive game, so be prepared with tons of dialog texts throughout the game. The plot is really good but the place where the game shines it's the character design, this game has seriously some of the best characters in video game history, really well done without becoming stereotypical and with amazing development through the game. It has also one hell of a finale introducing the second part of the story in the upcoming ""Trails in the sky : second chapter"". This game will bring you back to the jrpg 90's golden era, and it will keep you there for some solid 40/50 hours, we need more games like this.			"

The Good- An expansive world open that rewards exploration through world building and loot.Side quests that flow nicely (most of the time) into the main quests.A crazy amount of development with NPCs. Despite often having the same model, many NPCs get around a dozen new text boxes.Customizable character builds, no job system, instead the Orbment system allows characters to change spells and extra stats by swapping out orbs. Can be changed at any time as long as you can afford to make the Orbs.Female Protagonist that isn't a male in women's clothing or terribly incompetent. Estelle is not a great character in this game, but the game set her up in a good way to continue to develop in the second game. New game plus option. Great for hunting down those pesky achievements.The Bad- Battles take a long time. This is to be expected from a SRPG, but there were some times where I would be running around get into a random encounter and spend so long battling that by the time I was done I had forgotten where to go.Maybe it's just me, but I had a terrible time with the RNG in this game. Most statuses have a 10% chance of being applied on hit from basic attacks and crafts. The status effects are all extremely powerful and in a lot of cases I found being tagged with them could mean being locked up until death. Things like freeze, confuse, petrify, and one hit KO are hard to play around and be protected from. There is only one accessory that can block all the statuses and by endgame some enemies are almost entirely immune to statuses. The Gray- I think the plot is pretty hit or miss depending on how many stories you know that are similar, coupled with the fact this game mostly serves as set up for the next one. Some of the twists are really obvious, but the real strength of the plot is the world the characters inhabit.The battle system throws in a lot of random elements on purpose. This keeps battles a little more entertaining, but can result in some,  ""this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" moments. So much text. Characters talk a lot, NPCs have a ton to say, there is no English voice acting so all dialogue happens in text boxes. Some NPCs get updated dialogue after each development in the main plot, thus having dozens of optional conversations. You can play through the game completely ignoring most side NPCs, but I would recommend talking to some anyway because some side quests can only be gotten by initiating a conversation with NPCs. There is a sequel on the way. The game was released in 2006 in Japan for the PSP and localization has been slow due to the colossal amount of things to translate. The Second Chapter is expected to be released summer 2015. The First Chapter is about a 40 hours game and is pretty much all set up for the Second Chapter where (supposedly) the real meat of the series happens. Know that many plot points will not be resolved until the next game.The ConclusionThe pickings for the this type of game is slim on steam, but just because this is the case does not mean this game has gotten praise it does not deserve. Pick this game up if you are looking for a solid SRPG with a detailed world and pretty decent story.			"

The characters are all entertaining, and the music for the game is fantastic (Silver Will sends chills down my spine every time). Gameplay is well thought out with an interesting progression system and lots of strategy for party setups. The combat gets slightly repetitive towards the end.

Estelle and Joshua have a satisfying and deep relationship that spans multiple games. No bland ""hero"" stereotypes, which is refreshing.Totally worth it for the cost, even outside of sales. Pick up the sequel while you're at it.Only con? No third installment :(			"

												If you're looking for a classic JRPG with some modern conveniences, look no further. Plucky teenagers set out on an adventure that grows into a political conspiracy? Check. Beat up monsters, open treasure chests, take side-quests, and rest at inns? Check. Buy equipment and magic to make yourself feel uber, at least until the next dungeon? Check. You can save anywhere you want, the game helps you keep track of your quests, and there's a New Game +. Not that you'll want to play it, because after the shocking finale, you'll want to dive right into the sequel. Play this game.			"

												I normally stay away from JRPGs since the combat is normally too simple for my likes. However, I loved everything about Trails of the Sky. The rich story, the memorable soundtrack, the simple-yet-fun combat, the well-developed characters, the hilarious dialogue, the list goes on. It's definitely worth the money if you are looking for a more story-driven experience.			"

												A Legend of Heroes indeed!Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (AKA Eiyuu Densetsu: Sora no Kiseki) is actually the sixth entry to a larger series which, itself, is the sixth entry to a much larger and older franchise created by Nihon Falcom, A wonderful little group of developers whom I, frankly, just can't shut up about.In terms of story, gameplay, and graphics, Trails in the Sky FC (which is the official title) is the first title of the first trilogy arc in the entire Trails/Kiseki universe, with the second title and, hopefully, third title on its way here, in which all the characters, nations, politics, etc., are established. The gameplay resembles that of traditional RPGs such as Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, in which enemies are visible in the overworld, and at the same time, battles are very much like a simplistic version of RPGs, ala Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics. I should also note that a magic system is implamented very much like Final Fantasy VII's Materia system for complete character customization. As for the graphics, the engine was based on the graphics engine Falcom used on their previously released, and successful, PC game Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim, which also served as the back bone, with many tweeks and enhancedments, for not only the majority of Trails titles but also for later Ys titles such as Ys: The Oath in Felghana and Ys Origins.All in all, the gameplay and graphics will feel both old and new while the story will keep you on your toes with the anticipation of SC being released later this year, if all goes well.  If you're tired of some the later RPGs of this generation and want something with a bit of old and new, this one's for you!			"

												First of all, let me save you some time.  If you consider yourself a fan of JRPG's, buy this game immediately.  As a fan myself, I promise you won't be disapointed at all.  That said....very minor spoilers possible in the review (nothing big I promise)Pros:- It's long, I'd say 35-45 hours depending on how much side missions you do.- The music is great, if not exceptionally varied.- The story and characters are top notch, I enjoyed using every character in the game.- There are tons of side missions to do that reward you with dialogue and Mira (money)- Every person you meet in this game will have different dialogue just about every time you meet them.  You could spend dozens of hours reading all of it alone.- Combat is fun and kept me interested for almost 50 hours.- The Orbment system allows you to customize your characters skills and stats just about in any way you want.  Figuring out how to unlock different Artes is almost as fun as using them.  (The games Bracer Book will give you all possible combinations)- The story is light hearted and fun.  Most of this game doesn't involve you trying to stop anything evil and super powerful.  Most of the time you're just helping people out and the world reflects that.- The story and intrique really picks up near the end of the game.- Visually it looks nice for it's age.- The ending is fantastic.- The ending leads directly into a soon to be released second chapter of the game!Cons:- You don't get to pick your team almost the entire game.  The final dungeon is the only time you will get to use all of your characters.- Environments can be a bit stale, nothing really wow'ed me until the final dungeon.- It's not overly difficult.  The hardest fights in the game are chests containing monsters that guard the loot.  Boss fights are moderatley difficult but if you prepare you won't be taxed.- The game likes to use cheap ""instant kills"" and ""misses"" to make fights frustrating.  It's worse near the beginning of the game.All in all, the game was fantastic and probably one of the best JRPG's you will find on PC.  9/10Bring on Second Chapter! "

												Just Fantastic!Not trying to sound like some kind of annoying know-it-all but the most of plot twists are pretty easy to see through. But the ending and the cliffhanger they left made me cry like i just saw the opening to UP for the first time again. The combat is entertaining, flowed well, and didnt feel too monotonous. The skills and arts systems are kind of lacking and you will find yourself using the same handful of attacks in just about every battle but somehow it doesnt really get old.			"

												This is probably my first experience with this company, and I am now already playing Trails in the Sky SC, so it is beyond time for this review.  This rpg has a playstyle fairly similar to Chrono Trigger, with a story like none I have seen in a jrpg in a long time.  Even the smallest bit part side character has a personality and a name, and in the second game, all of those details are expounded upon.  I do not think I have ever truly remembered the shop keepers or the innkeepers in rpgs I have played before this one on a personal basis, so for me this game was a firts.  That said, the combat is crisp, the characters on your team have a personality and a playstyle all their own, and the magic system feels very much like a toned down materia system from FF7.  In short, it is all glorious.  Enemies present a clear and present danger at every stage of the game if you are not paying attention, and the exp curves to allow you to grind as little or as much as you want and not end up too over/underpowered for a boss encounter.   TLDR:  Great characters, great story, great combat machanics, great magic system, well thought out gameplay.   If you like JRPG's pick this one up,  you will not be disappointed.			"

												Wow... just wow... it's worth it at full price. I was kind-of interested in it, until I saw that it was made by Falcom. I had to get it once it was on sale for that reason aloneThis has got to be one of the best RPG storylines I have seen in a while. It's at the likes of Final Fantasy VI and Suikoden II. I do not say that lightlyThe game starts out very light-heartedly, but after you get through the prologue, you are in for a wonderful story. I'm not sure how far I want to go into the review, but it does many things rightThere's a few bugs, like the screen will go black all of the sudden, or UI text boxes won't get updated.

												5/5 This game is a classic feel but with a nice mix of a traditional rpg with some rather modern elements. However what sells this game is not only the seriousness of the game but the indepth value of the character and plot development. Although there are some misses here and there in my opinion. This game has the right feel so far from what I've played in it. There are times the characters will make you laugh, there are some sad notions, the soundtrack sells it. The Legend of Heroes is also a series for those who didn't know. Seeing this here made me happy. I picked it up and like other titles it doesn't disappoint, although I admit the series was continuations for some. This one I recommend for it takes a bit of time for you to get through some stuff. As well as you can miss a few things. Still I find that the game itself is entertaining and can take a while. Which is nice for any rpg fan however remember grinding does happen. Just when you play this game note it is very ""lengthy"" with some discussions. However there are moments that you will find throughout the game that have it's finer qualities in both comedy and seriousness. Although after a while you can kind of see a familiar plot set from here compared to others but it has it's own ""character"" I'd like to say.			"

It's definitely got that FF feel, but the theme is less overwhelming/all-encompassing. Definitely a fun bit to put some time into. However, if you're seeking something with some maturity and graphic action, this may not be the game for you. A little slow to start, but once you understand the characters and their lives, it's fun.			"

												    This game quickly became my favorite in my library. This is my first review so bare with me. I found it durring the anual steam sales and almost skipped it. I am so glad I did not.     First off this game is a jrpg on steam. If that is all you needed to hear to play this game then go on and buy this game now and stop reading this review. For those who do not recognize this term it stands for Japanese role playing games. The most famous series being Final Fantasy. Google would be a good resourse if you want more information. And now back to the review.      Graphics are very nostalgic. If the look of 16bit era games appeals to you then this game will be no exception. The asthetics in this game are very pretty. Character sprites are very well done. Nothing revolutionary, but whatever computer you are running should have no problems running this.     The combat is really fun. Please note this is a turn based combat system. For those of you who are use to more action based games this might be a downside. That being said this combat system is really well done. It is simple which makes it very easy to learn. However it has enough challlenge to it to engage you in the fights. The main quest line keeps you about at the level you need to be so grinding is not very necessary.         The writing of this game is exceptional. The characters in this game are wounderful. The dialoge is so well done that the characters just seem real. The plot is very well done. It details an adventure that never makes you question why any of the characters are involved with the story.      Now the most intriging part of this game, and something I was not expecting is how in depth the world is. The first major accomplishment is every character not only has a name, but their dialogue changes throughout the story. and when I say any character I mean every character. The shop keepers, quest givers, the people eating at the resteraunts, that little girl who is wating for her mother and every character that is in the game all have thier own name and changing dialogue. Also another wonderous thing is that the main characters are not the only travelers in this game. Minor npcs can be found in other towns and have thier own paths to travel in the game. The longer you spend in the game the more you realize how much work was out into it. The world feels very alive and natural. that takes a lot of attention to detail.      Now I hope that you are just as thriled about this game as I am. It is worth a lot more than twenty dollars and is very good. Go buy it and experence it for yourself. This is a masterpiece so go enjoy it. If I did not sell it to you read some of the other reviews. The only thing I can say is to reiterate that this game is a masterpiece.   "

												Trails is an excellent game.  Start with that.  As many JRPGs as I've played, I've never come across a more compelling story.  Sure the combat and graphics are antiquated (seeing as it was originally released in what, 2006?), but even in the earliest japanese role playing games, stories have been central to user enjoyment.  And Trails gets that perfectly.While there are some interesting gizmos to work with in the equipment and combat of LoH, it's not really about that.  The turn-based, element-based, mix-and-match-skills shenanigans won't impress anyone.  It's the charming, quirky story that drives you on, hour and hour, into the depths of the first chapter to what I hope is a long and fruitful franchise.Though, and this is just me being petty, but the main character girl is mostly annoying.  She is pretty prototypical of so many japanese stereotypes.  I guess the male main character is too, but he gets more interesting as the story goes, while she remains a typical meathead, act-first-then-talk-about-it type individual.  Yes, I know they're kids and kids are annoying and stupid, but since you're going to be sifting through massive amounts of dialogue, it's helpful to not have annoying characters.That's really my only gripe about the game.  That while the story is fantastic, and it never ends up being boring, sometimes I have to wonder what the game developers were thinking.  They KNEW that these two characters would receive the most screen-time, so why wouldn't they go to great pains to make them less annoying?  Ah, I'll never know.  Maybe it's just that budding romances between children are not interesting to me.  Okay, that's really off-topic.The best part of this game is the story, yes, I've said that already.  But the second best part is the atmopshere-building.  The npcs that wander around, the shopkeeps, the snippets of random dialogue, and the dialogue from the other companions are all masterful.  It all creates an atmophere that leaves you wanting to play more and more.  At one point you meet a bard/musician that has never said a non-risque thing in his life, and Schera who is a whip-weilding mentor.  Also some red-haired guy with a giant sword who just HAS to come off as a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in every context. Oh and don't forget that one girl with the cannon.  She's ehm...I despise this word....adorable.  She is, it's undeniable.Okay.  If you enjoy great stories, decent combat, acceptable graphics, acceptable interfaces, and excellent dialogue, then you are in luck.  Buy this game, and eagerly await Trails in the Sky: Second Chapter as I am.  Until next time, space traveler.			"

												This is a fantastic game for any JRPG lovers on Steam! Steam does not have a good variety of JRPGS, however, this one stands out as very excellent. The game is rather old so the graphics are not perfect, but for computers and laptops that can't run higher res. games, this is perfect. It runs perfectly on my laptop which was not made for gaming at all. There is an extensive amount of gameplay and it will last you a long time. The characters are fun and witty, and the world within the game is very fleshed out and immersive. The relationship between the main hero and heroine is also enjoyable to watch develop. It's also refreshing to play a JRPG where the playable character is a female who kicks butt! The combat system is also a lot of fun. It is a tactical grid-based setup. There is a line which shows the order of turns each character on the field is to go, and depending on the action the charcater takes, determines whether their next turn will come sooner or later. For example, using an item will make your next turn come sooner, but casting a spell will make your next turn come later because the spell needs time to be cast. I also enjoy that the game makes me feel like a contract worker. It's like being in the fighting guild for Elder Scroll games. Your characters are a part of the bracer guild and are contracted to do jobs in each city in order to earn money. In fact, it is the main way you earn money in the game because monsters do not drop money. You will earn money for the main storyline contract jobs, but if you check the board every so often then optional contract jobs will also appear (however they are time-limited because you cannot back-track from area to area in the story). What monsters do drop are gem-like things called sepith, which each have their own elements, and can be used to boost stats, give characters certain elemental magic or to be sold for extra money (mira). It is a good way to customize your characters magic-wise. All in all, this game has some original features that makes for an interesting JRPG exprience. I definitely recommend this game to JRPG players looking for something new to try out!7.5/10			"

												In short: A classic JRPG with little innovation, but done very well. One of the best JRPG's I've ever played.Combat is interesting, with random bonuses appearing at certian turns and you having to plan around position on battlefield, enemy weakness and what action to use depending on when you want your unit to act. Also party members come and go, and the only 2 that stay are the two main characters. The spell system works quite similarly to FF7's where you give your team different spells (through something the game calls ""orbs"") which allows them to cast different magic. Different combinations give different spells, and it's fun to play around with and try to find the best build. All the different combinations are given to you very early in the game, making it a lot easier to mix and match what you want.So combat's pretty good, but where this shines is the story. The characters are interesting and are often changed (every 5-6 hours that is), so you only have two constants in your party, and it really aids the story that the number of party members is limited so you can focus on the individual characters, without having to have all 8 in the same conversation. The story itself is interesting with a few twists here and there, though some of them are fairly foreseeable, especially for the players who get to watch cutscenes the protagonists don't. Played through the game once, and clocked in at around 38-40 hours, there is an episode 2 and 3 coming in english but I don't know when.			"

Motto: Genial things are simple.This is first game from three chapters . You are following story and life of Estelle Bright young bracer and her friends. Love, fear, ominous enemies twists in characters .  The graphic is simple, isometric resembles of Ragnarok online or Breath of fire IV. There is no search for hidden objects in towns and settlements, no walls of text during dialogues or dialogue options, no tough moral decisions,  character are sometimes a little shallow  . Combat can be challenging at higher difficulities ,even frustrating especially in second chapter but nothing inovative.So why for God sake I recommend it to You? Because this game has soul! Something that force you to follow the story, be fond of characters  simply sit down and enjoy the flow of narrative. Something that force you to write your first review after really huge amount games played . Not being distracted  by too many side things or huge lore, it let you simply enjoy the show. By simple doesn´t mean simplistic or not polished, on the contrary  Dialogues are usually short especially with commoners but... Every! character even a little one, every commoner will change his line after story progresses. Game is divided into chapters and after you ended  chapter  fighted the boss, you can (but don´t have to), visit everyone you get acquainted with and hear what more he or she  has to say or simply move on . It makes You feel that  this world is actually living its live, not waiting for you to appear play its role and then freeze in time.  You see that creators put lot of love in it and making things look simple requires lot of work and love.If u dont mind being guided through simple but interesting story with character twists In JRPG style, If You dont mind absence of open world this game is for You and is worth every penny. Just sit to your PC and enjoy your show.			"

												While this game is presented in a very different sylistic manner than the Final Fantasy games from the same release timeframe, I find it vastly superior in every way. The characters are fully fleshed out and interesting, there is a huge sense of freedom to explore, the plot is well-paced and plausible (as these things go), and you are punished for your mistakes. Greatly enjoy this game and will be cycling back to finish it soon.			"

												I have played this game long ago, and now I just bought it again on steam! IMHO, this is one of the best J-RPG games. I don't know when the sequels will come to Steam, but hopefully it wouldn't be long.Not only does the have an engaging story line, but it also does a very good job at telling the story. As the game progresses, the setting of game world slowly reveals piece by piece, as well as the plot behind the scene. It is epic, yet vivid.The game's system is also quite interesting. The combat system is still turn based, but no where the same as the old RPGs like Final Fantasy. More strategy can be taken into account. The magic system, which is my favorate, offers a lot of thinking and exploring opportunities.The only down side of the game is probably that there is little replay value once you cleared the game once. As the plot is mostly linear, the only reason you may want to play it again is probably to grind all achievement.			"

												This is a very good JRPG, in the spirit of the late '90s Final Fantasy games. Its strength is almost entirely in its plot and characterization - it tells an amazingly engaging story full of characters you really care about while avoiding a lot of the tired tropes of the genre. As a bonus, it's got a great female lead and is very progressive regarding gender and sexuality for a game of its type and original release date.The only real downside is that combat is just not that exciting or challenging for a veteran JRPG player. Yes, there are some very challenging fights, but if you're at level, you should mostly breeze through them. I didn't see this as a huge downside since it meant I could get back to the plot quickly (and the plot is very good) but if you're a big fan of complex combat systems you'll be disappointed.			"

												I reviewed this game for DieHard GameFAN. This is the short attention span summary of my review: The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is an updated port of the PSP game of the same name, which itself was an updated port of a Japanese PC game. The visuals have been enhanced with support for higher resolutions, plus the translation has been cleaned up in places to make it more consistent with its followup. The story is very engaging, even if it has something of a slow start, and battles have enough strategic nuance to them that they’re enjoyable throughout the entirety of the game. I can’t recommend a purchase enough. Especially since doing so is the only way we’ll see more of this franchise stateside. Bring on the Second Chapter!			"

												JRPGs have a reasonable following in the world at large, but it’s only in the last few years that they’ve become readily available on Steam. What was once a barren wasteland for JRPG fans has slowly blossomed, and gamers now find themselves with a decent catalogue to choose from whenever popping online. So now we found ourselves, over a year after Trails in the Sky’s Steam release date, investigating to see how it holds up to the competition.	In many ways, Trails in the Sky is standard fare for JRPGs. You have a coming of age story for the two protagonist siblings, Estelle and Joshua, a budding romance, and a seemingly small quest that expands to world-saving proportions as the game progresses. You could even fairly say that the story of the game isn’t particularly exciting, and doesn’t begin to move until you’re about thirty hours of the game. Instead, Trails in the Sky leans more heavily on the character interactions throughout the game to keep players interested. Of major note is the way your party changes as the game progresses. Unlike many JRPG titles, most party members in Trails of the Sky are not permanent additions. As a result, you have a rolling party roster instead of one that slowly grows throughout the game. Players get to know a new character throughout each chapter of the story. It’s a neat way to give players a chance to constantly get to know characters, but it’s not always for the best.	A distinct pattern sets in as the game progresses, with each chapter’s progress marked pretty similarly. You meet a new character. A small incident occurs requiring your attention, and you help them out. The trouble grows, and more about the new character is woven into the adventure. It’s not a bad way to write a story, but seeing it four times in the same game? It’s a little much. Thankfully, all these meetings do culminate into one impressive final chapter, but it’s a shame that the story takes so long to get off the ground as a result.	Luckily, Trails in the Sky’s combat is much less formulaic. The standard turn-based system players might expect is quite a bit different, and instead you’ll find yourself battling enemies on a small map. Characters can freely move around the map on their turns, and you must rely on your position and turn order to take advantage of your opponents. In fact, turn order might be the most crucial part of the battle. As the battle progresses, you can see bonuses that certains will acquire on their turns. If you time your magic spells correctly or insert yourself into one of those turns using a special attack, you can grab bonuses from your enemies for yourself. As a result, carefully managing your craft points (CP), which increase every time you deal or receive damage, is vital, as you need at least 100/200 to launch one of your “Special Breaks.” A large, screen-dominating attack that can be used any time during the battle at the cost of all your character’s CP points. As a result, battles rarely feel stale, even if some of them can drag on a little long.	Longer boss battles can be a lot of fun, but against your everyday grunts it starts to feel like a chore later in the game. This isn’t helped by cheery, yet repetitive battle music throughout the adventure. The same music persists outside of battle as well, and until the final chapter, you can expect to hear the same town, city, overworld, and dungeon themes no matter where you go. Thankfully, the themes we do have are quite well done. I only wish we could’ve had a few more of them. It’s to the composer’s credit that I didn’t ever dislike the music, but spend fifty hours with any song, and you’ll start to get bored.	For all my complaints though, I enjoyed Trails in the Sky. It’s a slow starter, but the ending was strong and left me anticipating the second chapter’s release on Steam. If you’re not a patient gamer, then Trails in the Sky might not be for you. If you enjoy getting to know a large cast, starting an epic, 3-game saga, and interesting combat, give it a shot! "

												TLDR: 7/10, this is more like a good book than a good RPG. A really unique game for the discerning crowd.The game has a pretty thin battle system, really slow pacing and it takes a long, long time for the mechanics to finally open up, but the writing is top notch, and there is a LOT of it. The story is not your typical ""saving the world"" affair, but instead a character piece that focuses on two young adventurers travelling through a fantasy world, occasionally running into adventures while the larger plot slooooowly builds up in the backround. The game's writing is just top notch, and there must be several novels worth of text here, and AND it's all really well translated. It's hard to explain in a few words, but basically all of the main characters have really strong characterization, well written dialogue, funny little quips every now and then, and the game pushes even more mini-stories and worlbuilding into the random NPCs and quests that litter the various carefully crafted (if super simple) environments. Basically, if you enjoy getting lost in annother world, and getting to know and care about the characters in it, this game is for you. Enjoyment of a slow-paced, light hearted fantasy novel is essential for enjoying the game itself. I also enjoy an anime-style game that doesn't pander to me with forced fanservice moments, especially with a female protagonist. A good JRPG, however, this is not. The battle-system is really simple, the character customzation takes a dozen hours to get interesting, your party is very restricted, and the side quests are often rather linear. Still, the systems are serviceable, and at least avoid being painful. You can also skip a lot of the combat, since there are no random encounters (enemies are visible on the map)I have a lot of problems with this game, but despite them, I'm enjoying it a lot. At first I couldn't stand to play for long periods due to the snail-like pacing of the opening chapter. The game hold your hand a lot, and spends an awful lot of time just doing inconsequential things before we've even gotten aqcuainted with the characters. It took, maybe seven hours for me to really get into the game, but once I did... well, I'd say I'll be finishing this game pretty soon.So overall, if you are the patient type, you will probably enjoy this game. The game sometimes takes it's time a bit too much, and the RPG part is only average, but if you want a good story, and an interesting, carefully crafted world to explore, this is the game for you.

												Loved it.  Generally not one into JRPGs and never really played the classics everyone raves about.  However I enjoyed the story, the combat while not super complex didn't bore me, the music was very good (and I am not musically inclined but it blended into being unnoticed but important for the tone and on occasion when I noticed it I enjoyed it- never got old in the 60+ hours for me).  Anyway sequal will likely be day one for me; I do recommend if dialogue heavy jrpg about a couple teens on an adventure with great sequal potential (if part III gets english release) interests you.

												The writing is outstanding. The translation team did a fantastic job, and the writing here is better than 99% of the (native) English games that I play. The characters are great. Usually characters like Estelle get on my nerves, but she's very fleshed out. Pros: Tons of customizationFun combatExcellent writingGreat charactersLocations are varied; you won't feel like you've been in a new dungeon beforeQuests don't feel like ""fetch me 10 pig wings"" that you see so often in RPGsCharacters have realistic motivesCons: Combat is far too easy. I found myself needing to skip areas and doing the hardest areas first, just to keep things entertaining. (No I didn't farm shining poms, or min/max, or read guides, it's just easy). There are some very annoying fanfare moments in the second chapter. Very annoying, as in completely unrealistic and uncharacteristic.Some of the orbments are very nice, while some are pretty awful (minor complaint). Overall: 9.1/10. I'm grading this as a story-primary RPG, and not as a combat driven RPG. If the story wasn't the main focus, I would still give it an ~82.			"

												this game is great! i put my time almost 45hrs playing this game and not even on chapter 2 yet lol. i like to explore(talking with each NPCs etc and sometimes theres funny things to it, i dont rush especially when somethings are hidden). there's not many jRPG available for PC and this game is really decent. for graphics, 2.5D(semi 3D) lot better than most jRPGs that are not MMO (Ys franchise, Recettear, Chantelise, etc). as for battle system, it is turn-based, use 2 types of skills, quartz magics and crafts (normal and special move, S-Crafts) the rare thing is most turn based game are more similar to the visual novel games(static image and ton of words) but it's not, you can move freely within maps and when you encountered a monster charge and battle! similar to Wakfu. what more? cooking, fishing, read books and news, side quest, etc and no you wont get any money from monsters but guild reward and sepith (which later can be convert as money but for achievement hunter, gonna be a liitle harder). i haven't finished the game yet but for most i enjoy the game more than ys and the other. 9/10			"

												I am very angry with Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky for one reason, and one reason only...I am too freaking impatient to wait ""x"" number of months for the sequel to one of the best RPGs I've ever played.Trails in the Sky is a fantastic, well-put-together game in every way. I was looking for a good RPG to fix me up, and this did the trick. In fact, it did it too well, and now I'm desprate to see the story continued. But, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me break down this little number for ya:STORY/CHARACTER:Trails is the simple story of a girl named Estelle Bright, and her adopted brother Joshua. They aspire to become Bracers, a freelance national assistance force that does everything from fighting monsters to saving kittens in trees. They're tasked with taking care of some odds and ends left behind by their father, Cassius, when he is called off to a major job. But things soon go awry, and Estelle and Joshua begin a trek across the kingdom to become Bracers and help their father.Trails has a great story; it's not anything very complicated or even super unique, but it has many facets, many twists, and few cliches. The world is deeply fleshed out, and the creators took special care to not only put numerous details in the background to be sought out and learned, but they also strived to give humorous and touching relatability to even the most fleeting NPCs. All (or nearly all) of the party members have different strengths and uses, and they all have their own tales to be known. You will surely find a favorite among all the major characters, and you'll find yourself coming to love Estelle and Joshua as you journey along with them.GAMEPLAY/BATTLES:Gameplay has you venturing around the countryside and major towns as you complete both storyline quests as well as many Bracer quests that give you cash and sweet loot. Many of them ask you to complete unique and sometimes strange tasks, and sometimes monsters and battles are involved. Speaking of which, battle and customization goes in a fresh direction, taking a cue from Final Fantasy 7 with its orbment system, where you equip quartz stones that both affect your stats and also dictate your available magic. Battles are represented by wandering monsters that you can take on when and as you choose, and battles take place on a grid with an active turn order dictated by speed, giving some strategy aspects to it, and feeling a little like Chrono Trigger at times. All in all, it takes bits and pieces from other things to make a unique and fun experience.SIGHTS/SOUNDS:The game looks pretty good; graphics can be a little plain or primitive in some places, but it all comes together in interesting and beautiful wholes. A few very distinct and memorable locales break up the monotony when you're feeling tired of grassland. The character models look perhaps a tad too cartoony, but the portraits and artwork have awesome detail, and a wide array of facial expressions to make conversations dynamic. The monster designs are probably the greatest artistic asset of them all, ranging from cute to scary to downright ugly. Regardless of the graphics, the music is top notch. There are no bad tracks in this game (unless you hate jazz). All of them are proper for where they are used, giving the world character, and a select few tracks will bring you to the edge of your seat or the verge of tears. This is a soundtrack you may want to own seperately.COMPLAINTS:Honestly, the only major complaint I have about the game is that there are few puzzles to be found. There are a couple of sleuthing situations, and one or two switches laying around that affect things, but besides that most of it is conversation-based, trying to make sure you say or do the right things to please your clinet as a Bracer and ger more experience. And there are two bosses in the game that have HUGE difficulty jumps; one is optional and fun, the other is not, and...not. But, this is all I can think to say.If you are in need of a sweet, witty, creative, fun, all-around enjoyable RPG, play Trails in the Sky. I can assure you, you will not regret it. And if you do love it, more will be just around the corner (hopefully) with the sequel, Second Chapter.			"

												I'm a fan of 2d top down RPGs and Anime so this was a spot on hit for me.  I enjoyed the story greatly, especially how the towns are 'alive'(the NPCs always have something new to say).  There are tons of hidden secrets - ala talking to NPCs you wouldn't think to talk to during VERY specific times.  There are Guides in steam - USE THEM if you are after 100% completion.  Chapter 2 isn't out(yet); and may or may not be great.  Still, great RPG and enjoyable story.  The last part left me going, WTF?! a bit, but the story is supposed to lead into another game so.... it makes sense.  If more of this universe come out I'd pick them up.			"

There aren't really fast battles, but there's also not a lot of backtracking, so that doesn't matter so much). The look and feel is good and I liked the music and sound effects. There's tons of side quests and what not, so a lot game hours to go through if you want to get all the badges (I think I spent like 40).All in all, I, an avid RPG fan, would have gladly spent the $20 Steam wanted for this. If you like RPGs and its on a Holiday sale, like I got it, jump on it!			"

												On my fourth play through at the moment looking for some elusive achievements along with just plain enjoying it still. I loved the story and characters, the constant reading of text can get rather tedious especially in longer cut scenes but after the first play through I remember what they say anyway so I just hold down skip. Arts and orbments were a little confusing at first but you get the hang of them quickly enough. Battle can be rather repetitive after a while, luckily after levelling up a bit you get certain attacks that can decimate large groups of enemies (Black Fang, Howling Bullet, etc) but you need CP charged up but that doesn't take too long. Basically, if you are a fan of the genre, or looking to get into the genre, you should love this game. I simply cannot wait for Second Chapter to come out.			"

												Here goes, a quick and dirty review of the game. I'll try to keep it short and concise for those looking to get the game.Trails in the sky is a somewhat traditional style RPG which is very story dense and driven, but with plenty of sidequests to keep you occupied.  That said though, the main story is rather slow paced, and it isn't until near the end of the game that things become a bit more interesting. So if you're looking for a fast-paced ride with action and twists every so often to keep things hyped, this might not be the game for you. It is a great story all the same, however this is only the first installment of the series with others to come some time in the future, so some things are left unresolved until at least the next game is released.In the end though I enjoyed the game. It does a good job of giving its narrative, and while somewhat slow, it does tell a compelling story in a well-thought out way. If you don't mind a game taking its time to get to where it's going, then I'd definitely suggest giving this game a try, especially if it's on sale.			"

												This game is deffinantly worth the money. I have nearly completed it and it has been suprisingly fun.The story is really good and all the charecters are really remmemberal, but there is somthing that lets the game down and that is the dialog. Now the dialog is really nice in all but there seems to be far to much and some times your just skipping it.All in all I will give this game a 8/10			"

												This game is the definition of average.  It's your typical anime-styled Japanese RPG.  It's got all your stereotypical anime character archetypes.  The story is about two ""siblings"", Estelle and Joshua Bright.  Joshua was found bloody and beaten by Elise's father 5 years earlier and adopted into the family.  Their father goes on a secret mission and vanishes.  The two siblings vow to unravel the mystery behind his disappearance. The issue with the plot being like that of an anime is that the pacing can get a little slow at times.  The last couple of chapters is when it REALLY picks up, but the first couple will really test your patience.  Your initial goal is to become Bracers, and join the Bracer Guild, just like your father had, but the story will (slowly) start to expand and the overall scope branches out.  There is apparently a 2nd game coming out this year in English, so I can tell you that they sequel-bait you with the ending.  It's pretty ballsy for such an average RPG to do that.  There is some good character development for just about every character though.  They won't remain the same throughout the game, luckily.  Some have a good depth to them, and others have secrets.  There are some twists in the story that you'll certainly enjoy too.  The voice-acting is above-average for English, which is also a plus, since a lot of the time, English voice-acting is crap.The battle system is your old-school turn-based jRPG with a small amount of ""strategy"" element thrown in.  You have your Attack, Move, Artes, Skill, and Item commands.  Unlike every turn-based strategy game made since the dawn of time, you can't choose to Move and then choose to Attack.  If you pick Move, your turn ends without being able to Attack.  Attack will attempt to beeline for a monster and hit them.  You'll be able to see your characters' range with the game's grid-based movement system highlighted around your character.  You'll learn new skills and limit breaks (not the actual term for it, but it's the same idea) as you level up.  Your Artes (or magic) work similar to Final Fantasy VII's materia system (minus the painstakingly boring task of having to level up each piece) with your characters having a max of 6 slots to place runes in.  You have to unlock the slots yourselves as well.  You do this by beating monsters.  Monsters don't drop gold, oh no.  They drop elements.  Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Space, Time, etc.  You can either sell them for gold, or keep them to exchange for runes or open up more slots.  You'll also still need gold to purchase everything else, unfortunately.  It's a bit of a convoluted system, honestly.On the plus side, you have TONS of customizability options for your characters with the runes.  You can tweak everything imaginable from hp to cast speed to offense.  ALL your magic comes from slotting runes, though.  So, if you unequip all your ruens, you can't cast jack.  Certain characters require specific types of runes in some of their slots.   For instance, Joshua requires Time runes in two of his slots.  That's ok though, because you'll be leaning on him heavily as the game progresses.  He's your good-at-everything main character.  Need an offensive juggernaut?  Slot a fire rune that raises his strength by 15%.  Want to pew-pew your enemies to death with spells?  Use his one of his time slots to stick a -%cast time rune in to get his spells out quicker.  Unfortunately, Estelle starts to become a bit of a burden near the end.  Her Skills are a bit lackluster, as is her damage.  She's still decent with spells, but for some reason, Joshua has more mp than she does.The game gives you ""subtle"" hints at what each character is good at though.  As you get new characters, they will come equipped with runes.  You don't have to be a genius to slot more magic into the guy with double Estelle's maximum mp.  Eventually (ie only the last dungeon) you'll be able to select your party of four from all the characters you've played with in the game.The music is appropriate, but don't expect A Thousand Words or anything.There are negatives to the game, however.  The story takes an awfully long time to come together.  Until that point in time you feel like you're just doing random missions until the game decides to give you something to grasp.  The clunky movement to the battle system, pigeon-holing your characters into specific roles, the need for AoE halfway through the game (both magic and skills), the rather average music and stereotypical animeness to all the characters and story hurt the game.  Also, sequel-baiting.  If you enjoy jRPGs and want a good time-waster, this is the game for you.  It took me 50 hours to finish all the story quests and side quests (although I missed 4 or 5 side quests).  If you can manage to stick through the first few chapters when the story starts to drag at times, you'll be rewarded.  I realize this has an 85 out of 100 on metacritic, but this game is not an 8.  It's just not.  They're lying to you.  If I had to give it a score I'd give it a 6.  Above-Average.  This is when comparing it to other jRPGs as a whole.  There are certainly a number of positives, but the negatives tend to bring down the score by a decent amount.			"

												My guess is that if you're reading reviews about this game you already like jrpg's and you just want to know if this one is worth your time. I think it is. I really enjoyed this game, I didn't do much with my free time besides play it until I beat it.As for what I liked about it I would start with the story. It isn't so much your average save the world and or kingdom, it more closely resembles ""slice of life"" (if you haven't heard of it, there's always google) in its story. It does build up to a climax, but mostly I felt like I was veiwing a piece of their lives, they just happen to lead fairly interesting lives.  I liked that, but I've seen some complaints about the story that sounded like that was their issue, so if you know that's going to frustrate you, it might not be the game for you. The combat is solid, if not groundbreaking. It gave enough layers and mixed up the enemies enough I never found myself avoiding combat except in areas I'd outleveled, and it gave me the items needed for avoiding unwelcome combat fairly early on, which was nice. Leveling never felt like a chore, I enjoyed seeking out the harder areas to do some extra leveling, and it was a quick enough process as to not get frustrating. I was usually about done leveling around the same time I was pretty sure I cleaned all the loot out of the side area anyway. Plus it was a nice feeling to afterwards avoid/ ignore enemies for a while because I knew they weren't worth fighting. Another plus for me that some people might not like was the graphics. Probably due mostly to psp limitations, the system it was created for, it was very reminiscent of classic jrpg's, and I really liked the nosalgia factor. I hope to see the second game make it to steam soon.			"

												This game's pretty alright.  It isn't really anything groundbreaking or amazing, but it plays well and remains pretty entertaining throughout.The gameplay is pretty sweet because instead of random battles, you can see enemies in the field and approach them from behind for a surprise preliminary attack...Or, avoid them altogether!  The orbment system is pretty enjoyable, not only boosting character stats but also allowing for the use of orbal arts -- the equivalent of magic spells.Story-wise, the game has plenty to tell.  There's no shortage of sub-plots and the like, but often I found them to be a little predictable.  Even so, the dialogue and storytelling in the game is pretty solid, and thoroughly enjoyable.If you want to have a good time casually playing an RPG, but still want to get a lot of hours out of it, I'd definitely recommend this.

It's different from other JRPGs in that the story doesn't focus so much on saving the world - but more about political intrigue. An amazing set of characters accompany the story to make for a good 60-70 hours of gameplay (if you go for all quests). Oh, and the music is so, so good.			"

												8/10What I like:-Turn order is based on unit speed. If a unit is faster, it gets more turns. Nifty buff system tied to turn order. -No random battles. You can always avoid enemies.-Spells are ""built"" for each unit based on different combinations of skill gems.-Built in support for my fake snes controller. No profiler needed.-The art is good. Lots of different enemies with very little palette swapping happening.What I disliked:-Too much dialogue.-Watered down strategy. All battles take place on flat maps with no cover or barriers. All maps are the same size. Units can run right past enemies with no penalty. Unit placement only matters with respect to AOE skills.-Items, weapons, and armor are all very uninteresting. Each unit can only have one very specific weapon type and each weapon upgrade only ever increases damage (which is silly cause there are TONS of different stats).-Very little control over how your squad is set up. Even though there are lots of units, which ones are assigned to you is dependent on the story.-Too. Much. Dialogue.			"

												Great jrpg reminder of the ps1 era with art inspiration from the suikoden series.The combat system is a mix between classic turn based and grid system, it has its flaws but it's solid and works.The exploration is mostly linear and it's story related, meaning that after some events you won't be able to come back to the places you previously visited or even finishing quests you started.This is a really story intensive game, so be prepared with tons of dialog texts throughout the game. The plot is really good but the place where the game shines it's the character design, this game has seriously some of the best characters in video game history, really well done without becoming stereotypical and with amazing development through the game. It has also one hell of a finale introducing the second part of the story in the upcoming ""Trails in the sky : second chapter"". This game will bring you back to the jrpg 90's golden era, and it will keep you there for some solid 40/50 hours, we need more games like this.			"

The Good- An expansive world open that rewards exploration through world building and loot.Side quests that flow nicely (most of the time) into the main quests.A crazy amount of development with NPCs. Despite often having the same model, many NPCs get around a dozen new text boxes.Customizable character builds, no job system, instead the Orbment system allows characters to change spells and extra stats by swapping out orbs. Can be changed at any time as long as you can afford to make the Orbs.Female Protagonist that isn't a male in women's clothing or terribly incompetent. Estelle is not a great character in this game, but the game set her up in a good way to continue to develop in the second game. New game plus option. Great for hunting down those pesky achievements.The Bad- Battles take a long time. This is to be expected from a SRPG, but there were some times where I would be running around get into a random encounter and spend so long battling that by the time I was done I had forgotten where to go.Maybe it's just me, but I had a terrible time with the RNG in this game. Most statuses have a 10% chance of being applied on hit from basic attacks and crafts. The status effects are all extremely powerful and in a lot of cases I found being tagged with them could mean being locked up until death. Things like freeze, confuse, petrify, and one hit KO are hard to play around and be protected from. There is only one accessory that can block all the statuses and by endgame some enemies are almost entirely immune to statuses. The Gray- I think the plot is pretty hit or miss depending on how many stories you know that are similar, coupled with the fact this game mostly serves as set up for the next one. Some of the twists are really obvious, but the real strength of the plot is the world the characters inhabit.The battle system throws in a lot of random elements on purpose. This keeps battles a little more entertaining, but can result in some,  ""this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" moments. So much text. Characters talk a lot, NPCs have a ton to say, there is no English voice acting so all dialogue happens in text boxes. Some NPCs get updated dialogue after each development in the main plot, thus having dozens of optional conversations. You can play through the game completely ignoring most side NPCs, but I would recommend talking to some anyway because some side quests can only be gotten by initiating a conversation with NPCs. There is a sequel on the way. The game was released in 2006 in Japan for the PSP and localization has been slow due to the colossal amount of things to translate. The Second Chapter is expected to be released summer 2015. The First Chapter is about a 40 hours game and is pretty much all set up for the Second Chapter where (supposedly) the real meat of the series happens. Know that many plot points will not be resolved until the next game.The ConclusionThe pickings for the this type of game is slim on steam, but just because this is the case does not mean this game has gotten praise it does not deserve. Pick this game up if you are looking for a solid SRPG with a detailed world and pretty decent story.			"

												This is a relaxing RPG that you don't get stuck. Some RPGs are too intense that you can't miss a single detail. Trails In The Sky isn't like that; it tells you exactly what to do, it keeps you in line, stops you from going to the wrong direction.The characters are enjoyable. Though the battle is a little too easy that I wish it was more strategic, I like it ok overall. So if you like RPG Turn-based strategy, you may want to give this one a try.Cheers! "

												If you are a fan of jrpg's you'll almost certainly love this game. It does have a bit of a twist in that the battle system is a little bit along the lines of a tactics based game, but that actually makes the game more fun, in my opinion. Great story, excellent battle system and I love the quests. One thing that is mentioned in other reviews is how this is a game where as you progress through the story, the npc's will actually continuously say different things based on what's going on. Also, if you play, always check a chest after you've looted it. I laughed multiple times from the empty chest jokes. Excellent game. I'd give it a 9.5/10, and the only reason i didn't give it a perfect score is because no game is perfect, lol. This one comes close though!			"

												A wonderful game well worth the money. Pretty much what you'd expect from the creators of Ys turning their hands to a traditional JRPG: The same art style, a great OST, a fantastic translation and a deep story. Most of the things that happen in the story are predictable - but the things that you don't see coming will throw you for such a loop that you'll just want to keep playing to see where things go next.It's not completely without flaws - the ending is an obvious setup to a sequel and the last few bosses are unreasonably painful to fight compared to what came before - but they are just a few small blemishes on an otherwise fantastic game.

												This is one of the best JRPGs I've played.The graphics sometimes leave much to be desired, but I think it's one of the game's charms.The interface almost reminds me of a mobile app.And the combat is repetitive and doesn't change much, but it is still enjoyable.If you can get past that you're in for a treat!The story is amazing, you can usually guess the ending by the middle of the game but throughout this leaves you wondering ""what's going to happen next?"" The characters all have their unique personalities and I think they all had a moment I lol'ed at. The side quests aren't boring or tedious, and there are plenty of them.Only real issue I had was having to install a codex pack to watch the opening and ending cut scenes, it didn't really effect gameplay since you can skip the first, but I couldn't save my finished game for newgame+ and get the ending achievement without doing so.

												Overall decent old school JRPG. I've long ago played secret of mana,FF tactic.Quite a lot of dialog/contemplating phase for digest so be aware, still remain fun,emotional,ect.Combat system similar to tactical rpg(FFVII,FF tactic). Difficulty is OK, it's not too hard/complex if you discovering, neither too easy since engaging combat combat without take account of monster behavor will usualy lead to game over( or run away when it's possible and that your not too proud for it ).Trail in the sky is a little journey worth trying to start, in the hope of future release of the second arc on PC.

												This is an excellent game with very strong characters, character development, story, and setting.  It has a good battle system and plenty of sidequests if you're interested.The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky series is famous for having games with some of the most dialog ever.  The translation was no small feat and the Second Chapter has even more.For those interested in the development process, more can be read on the forums: http://forum.marvelous-usa.com/index.php?showforum=252 "

												TLDR: 7/10, this is more like a good book than a good RPG. A really unique game for the discerning crowd.The game has a pretty thin battle system, really slow pacing and it takes a long, long time for the mechanics to finally open up, but the writing is top notch, and there is a LOT of it. The story is not your typical ""saving the world"" affair, but instead a character piece that focuses on two young adventurers travelling through a fantasy world, occasionally running into adventures while the larger plot slooooowly builds up in the backround. The game's writing is just top notch, and there must be several novels worth of text here, and AND it's all really well translated. It's hard to explain in a few words, but basically all of the main characters have really strong characterization, well written dialogue, funny little quips every now and then, and the game pushes even more mini-stories and worlbuilding into the random NPCs and quests that litter the various carefully crafted (if super simple) environments. Basically, if you enjoy getting lost in annother world, and getting to know and care about the characters in it, this game is for you. Enjoyment of a slow-paced, light hearted fantasy novel is essential for enjoying the game itself. I also enjoy an anime-style game that doesn't pander to me with forced fanservice moments, especially with a female protagonist. A good JRPG, however, this is not. The battle-system is really simple, the character customzation takes a dozen hours to get interesting, your party is very restricted, and the side quests are often rather linear. Still, the systems are serviceable, and at least avoid being painful. You can also skip a lot of the combat, since there are no random encounters (enemies are visible on the map)I have a lot of problems with this game, but despite them, I'm enjoying it a lot. At first I couldn't stand to play for long periods due to the snail-like pacing of the opening chapter. The game hold your hand a lot, and spends an awful lot of time just doing inconsequential things before we've even gotten aqcuainted with the characters. It took, maybe seven hours for me to really get into the game, but once I did... well, I'd say I'll be finishing this game pretty soon.So overall, if you are the patient type, you will probably enjoy this game. The game sometimes takes it's time a bit too much, and the RPG part is only average, but if you want a good story, and an interesting, carefully crafted world to explore, this is the game for you.

												Not the strongest writing or plot on the surface, but is forgiven beccause a ton of likeable characters and legitimate twists. If do come to a particularly weak spot can just hold down a button to skip through dialoge.Combat is a style I dreamed of. Fireemblem tiles meets chrono trigger style area affect moves.49 hours of playtime, but I did all the side quests, read almost every line, and left it on while cooked dinner a few times.Have hectic schedule? Save your game anywhere.Now for the bad in my opinion. HUGE difficulty spike in last chapter. Character sprites look dumb sometimes. Having clearer time units in battle would have made for better strategies.For every criticism there are a dozen praises. One of the few RPGs you can start and stop anytime and never lose track of what to do thanks to the notebook.			"

												This game is easily one of my favorites and I would recommend it to anyone who likes story-rich RPGs. However, I can't emphasize enough the story-rich part. If you like that kind of thing, I would suggest getting it, hands down, but if you're the kind of person that just wants to get to the action, this game probably isn't for you. It has a really good story, good gameplay, side quests, and some humor (try reading what the chests say after you loot them). Overall, awesome game if you like story-rich RPGs. I'd give it a 9.5 out 10.			"

												Trails in the Sky is one of my favourite RPGs.  It feels like a throwback to great old RPGs on the SNES or Megadrive and it concentrates on telling an intriguing story with flair, while oozing charm throughout.The writing is superb (always engaging and often hilarious - in particular, any scenes with Olivier) and the story progresses towards an excellent finale.  I can't wait to find out what happens in the second chapter.The battle system is functional but not too exciting.  The main reason you'd play this is for the story, so keep that in mind.Oh, and the music is catchy too.			"

												8/10What I like:-Turn order is based on unit speed. If a unit is faster, it gets more turns. Nifty buff system tied to turn order. -No random battles. You can always avoid enemies.-Spells are ""built"" for each unit based on different combinations of skill gems.-Built in support for my fake snes controller. No profiler needed.-The art is good. Lots of different enemies with very little palette swapping happening.What I disliked:-Too much dialogue.-Watered down strategy. All battles take place on flat maps with no cover or barriers. All maps are the same size. Units can run right past enemies with no penalty. Unit placement only matters with respect to AOE skills.-Items, weapons, and armor are all very uninteresting. Each unit can only have one very specific weapon type and each weapon upgrade only ever increases damage (which is silly cause there are TONS of different stats).-Very little control over how your squad is set up. Even though there are lots of units, which ones are assigned to you is dependent on the story.-Too. Much. Dialogue.			"

												This game consumed my life for weeks.Fun magic/combat system.  Some actually difficult boss fights.  Decent difficulty curve. Story takes a while to gear up but it becomes very interesting.In games like this they have a tendency to stick you with different characters at different points for story purposes and usually that's a drag but each character is strong and unique enough it never felt annoying to have to use anyone.  If anything by the end of the game I had a hard time choosing who to bring with me because I liked everyone so much.The only real weakness to this game that I noticed while playing it was how small the game world and towns can feel at times.

												Solid game.  Pretty much nails everything you'd expect from a JRPG.  Turn-based ombat system is good, storyline is engaging if a bit cliche'd, and all the various character archetypes you'd expect are present.I only had two big hangups.  One, this is the 'first chapter.'  So, without spoiling the ending, all I'll say is that it resolves virtually *none* of the plot points being built up over the course of your gameplay.  It even LITERALLY ends with a commercial for the next chapter.  I understand it's a multi-chapter game and that the plot has to extend through the next two chapters, but they seem to cross the line into a shameless ""Want to find out what happens next?  You've got to buy the next two games then!""  Left a sour taste in my mouth at the end of an otherwise solid game.There's is probably about 20-25 hours of gameplay here at most.  Which is plenty for the cost.  However, all these reviews keep mentioning 40 hours of gameplay (not to mention the steam description boasting 50 hours)  My 'hard' playthrough took me 17 hours, and that's WITH most of the sidequest.  I saw a review down here claiming 40 hours for a speedrun, so that's obviously just plain wrong.  Another FULL playthrough still wouldn't bring me up to 40 hours.I recommend the game, but if I could go back I would wait for all three chapters to be out so I could play them sequentially.  There's ""cliffhangers"" and then there's ""shamelessly failing to resolve anything so you are forced to buy the next game,"" and this game leans towards the latter.			"

												This game while new to PC and ""new"" as in having a English localization, is in fact over 10 years old and part of a series that gose back to 89. So when you play this game you get a massive retro feeling as it *IS* a retro game. Not one made ""like the originals"" .. it was made at the same time by the same developers who were at the very birth of the genre and as such it is a modern fossil. If you like jRPGs with massive worlds, tons of dialogue and character development, expansive equipment tweaking and a solid 60+ hours of gameplay but the modern games always make you think of that one game you played years ago that none of the new ones are as good as.... well this could be the game for you. As it is probably is exactly what you are looking for because it was in fact from the same era as that game you keep comparing everything to.I'm absolutely loving this, and the thought that it is part 1 of a trilogy and knowing there are 2 games to go.. games already made and released in japan.

												Fairly light hearted JRPG. This game is more like a prequel to a much grander adventure and as such there is a lot of world building and character development at the start and its gets more exciting at the end. Music and dialog are pretty good and the game play is enjoyable.  It took me about 38 hours to play through the game doing main quests only, but there are a lot of side quests and hidden quests to do as well. The game is a little on the easier side, but it still provides a challenge and once you beat the game you unlock newgame+ which you can set to higher difficulties. Only issue I had is that there seemed to be a lot of backtracking and walking at the start, but then I figured out that you could run, which made this no longer an issue because you go like 3x faster. Would buy again and will definitely buy the sequel.			"

												A Legend of Heroes indeed!Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (AKA Eiyuu Densetsu: Sora no Kiseki) is actually the sixth entry to a larger series which, itself, is the sixth entry to a much larger and older franchise created by Nihon Falcom, A wonderful little group of developers whom I, frankly, just can't shut up about.In terms of story, gameplay, and graphics, Trails in the Sky FC (which is the official title) is the first title of the first trilogy arc in the entire Trails/Kiseki universe, with the second title and, hopefully, third title on its way here, in which all the characters, nations, politics, etc., are established. The gameplay resembles that of traditional RPGs such as Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, in which enemies are visible in the overworld, and at the same time, battles are very much like a simplistic version of RPGs, ala Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics. I should also note that a magic system is implamented very much like Final Fantasy VII's Materia system for complete character customization. As for the graphics, the engine was based on the graphics engine Falcom used on their previously released, and successful, PC game Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim, which also served as the back bone, with many tweeks and enhancedments, for not only the majority of Trails titles but also for later Ys titles such as Ys: The Oath in Felghana and Ys Origins.All in all, the gameplay and graphics will feel both old and new while the story will keep you on your toes with the anticipation of SC being released later this year, if all goes well.  If you're tired of some the later RPGs of this generation and want something with a bit of old and new, this one's for you!			"

												This game is just great.  If you like JRPG's in the Final Fantasy style this is CLOSE.  I say close because there is significantly less grinding in this game needed than most JRPGs.  But we'll get to that soon...This game is all about story.  And it's massive.  The game holds the story of the 2 main characters Estelle and Joshua, who get 'swept away' into a world recovering from a 100 year war... and on the brink of another one.  Along the way you will meet TONS of other characters, and have a few join your group.  Groups are 4 characters maximum (not counting NPC rescue/protect missions).  You tend to get 2 new friends each chapter until they wrap it all up with everyone.The main characters are part of the 'Bracer Guild', which is sort of a local police/milita force who work for the common folk solving problems.  As they travel around the world, the story intertwines and unfolds.  The story is linear, so you generally have a main story mission and can pick up side quests from the Bracer Guild in each town.Combat is played on a grid map, and reminds me of Vandal Hearts from back when.  First, let me point out that the monsters are all right there on the map.  It's not Like FF, where each region has certain monsters assigned to it and you have a percent chance to encounter after a certain number of steps.  You can avoid if you like.I really only did a level grind once in the game during a tornament, but I wound up overpreparing anyway.  You can just relax and run the story and should be fine.The magic system is great.  Just think Materia from FF 7.  You get an orb (Quartz actually), put it in a slot that you have opened, and you gain access to different spells.  Each orb has a crystal rating to it, and if you have the right number and colors you gain access to different spells.  ANYONE can cast, and the variations are vast with this system.  Just unlock your slots ASAP for Josh and Estelle.The story is that good, the dialogue is FANTASTIC and the scenes are memorable.  The play at the royal academy and the tornament come to mind immediately...If you are JRPG OCD like me and need to do everything, go everywhere, and talk to everyone you will get over 100 hours out of this game.  I figure to be around 140-150 when I finish as I am on the last chapter now at 137 hrs. "

												First, let me say that this is a very enjoyable JRPG. I highly recommend it to anyone who has had past experience with the genre and its foibles. That said, I have a huge issue with the game. There is no way to go back and complete side quests you have missed. If you miss a single side quest, just because you want to progress the main story, you cannot complete 100% of the game's material. I'm a bit of a completionist, so this truly irks me.Overall, I do recommend it. The turn-based combat is well done and enjoyable. The story is excellent. The music is solid, and there are some downright humorous elements, as well. Thumbs up with the above reservation.			"

												A wonderful game well worth the money. Pretty much what you'd expect from the creators of Ys turning their hands to a traditional JRPG: The same art style, a great OST, a fantastic translation and a deep story. Most of the things that happen in the story are predictable - but the things that you don't see coming will throw you for such a loop that you'll just want to keep playing to see where things go next.It's not completely without flaws - the ending is an obvious setup to a sequel and the last few bosses are unreasonably painful to fight compared to what came before - but they are just a few small blemishes on an otherwise fantastic game.

												Please note that this is a review of a new player, only getting used to the game._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ To be quick and simple, the game works smoothly, very nice music, characters are not bland, and the combat, ooooh, the combat! I love it. I've played RPGs like Bravely Default and a more known one, pokemon, and after playing this, it's like a new leaf. It adds a little more oomph to movement in battle.Now my first time (sooo, now) playing was very nice, considering what I've said in the begining, though it seems kinda overwhelming, but don't worry about it, its simpler than you think and works fine in the begining (I don't know yet in the future). So, if you are a new or expert player at RPGs, it does not matter as much, I would greatly recomend this game. Now if you exuse me, I need to think why I made a review within 1 1/2 hours of gameplay.			"

												Absolutely loved this game. The story progresses nicely and is very touching. None of the game mechanics are particularly difficult nor particularly easy. It reminds me of the Final Fantasy series and I can't wait for the sequel (which I hope gets ported).			"

												This game is just great.  If you like JRPG's in the Final Fantasy style this is CLOSE.  I say close because there is significantly less grinding in this game needed than most JRPGs.  But we'll get to that soon...This game is all about story.  And it's massive.  The game holds the story of the 2 main characters Estelle and Joshua, who get 'swept away' into a world recovering from a 100 year war... and on the brink of another one.  Along the way you will meet TONS of other characters, and have a few join your group.  Groups are 4 characters maximum (not counting NPC rescue/protect missions).  You tend to get 2 new friends each chapter until they wrap it all up with everyone.The main characters are part of the 'Bracer Guild', which is sort of a local police/milita force who work for the common folk solving problems.  As they travel around the world, the story intertwines and unfolds.  The story is linear, so you generally have a main story mission and can pick up side quests from the Bracer Guild in each town.Combat is played on a grid map, and reminds me of Vandal Hearts from back when.  First, let me point out that the monsters are all right there on the map.  It's not Like FF, where each region has certain monsters assigned to it and you have a percent chance to encounter after a certain number of steps.  You can avoid if you like.I really only did a level grind once in the game during a tornament, but I wound up overpreparing anyway.  You can just relax and run the story and should be fine.The magic system is great.  Just think Materia from FF 7.  You get an orb (Quartz actually), put it in a slot that you have opened, and you gain access to different spells.  Each orb has a crystal rating to it, and if you have the right number and colors you gain access to different spells.  ANYONE can cast, and the variations are vast with this system.  Just unlock your slots ASAP for Josh and Estelle.The story is that good, the dialogue is FANTASTIC and the scenes are memorable.  The play at the royal academy and the tornament come to mind immediately...If you are JRPG OCD like me and need to do everything, go everywhere, and talk to everyone you will get over 100 hours out of this game.  I figure to be around 140-150 when I finish as I am on the last chapter now at 137 hrs. "

												*Bought this game**Watched the intro, learned who the main characters are**Started to enjoy the Characters*30 Hours inMain Character: We should find a way to sneak into the castle to stop the CorporalController (Me): Lol, wait, that's still a thing? Screw that, you guys are way more interesting than the story!Gist: Started the game, got way too into the characters that 30 Hours in, I started to ignore the story cause I loved the characters too much.If you are planning on getting this game, get ready, because the game has a lot to offer in terms of story, cast, character developement, quips and jokes, and dialogue. The story is amazing and well developed, and the world itself is full of life, secrets, and lore. The Characters are amazing, and lovable, and you get attached to them so much that it's wonderful.Gameplay is ok for a JRPG. For me, the gameplay is good, but I saw it really as a way to help you progress across the story, without it being a storybook game. The combat is fun, and there is an interesting Orbament System that allow you to customize your characters to your play style. These orbaments also give ways to different spells and enchantments you can use in battle, so you should test out different combinations to get the best one for certain situations.Pros:-Story is amazing, well written, and one of the best-Characters are amazing, fun, and well developed-Audio is enjoyable, and synchs with the areas they play in-Fun jokes, moments, and quips relieve tension from serious situations-Combat needs strategy, and you have to think in certain battles rather than go head on blindly if you want to winCons:-Too much dialogue (Honestly, i'm sure 15-20 hours of my gameplay time was just me reading through the dialogue). However, the dialogue is very important, and must not be ignored.-Side Quests have a lifespan, and should be finished before continuing the story, or they will be gone forever.-Treasure Chests mock you if you check them again after opening them and taking whatever was inside.All in all, the story is amazing, gameplay is fun, and the cast of characters are way too awesome to give up. If you enjoy JRPGS with an amazing story, and have the patience to read through so much dialogue, then get this game.			"

												It's a very detailed JRPG. Sure, a lot of it was pretty typical JRPG fare. I was little ahead of my characters in figuring things out the whole time...Until the gut-punch-jaw-drop ending. Wait, they're rolling the credits on THAT!?I'll be picking up Second Chapter as soon as it comes out... and me, I almost NEVER pay full price for games.To those considering this one - yes, it starts out a little slow, and probably a little predictable, but the ride is worth it.  Stick with it!			"

												To start out with I'd like to mention that I'm a sucker for the Final Fantasy series, but have been pretty terrible at getting my act together to try out other acclaimed JRPGs. I didn't know about this game until it's Steam release was announced and people seemed to get pretty psyched about it online, so I figured I had to try this. More than half a year later I got my act together and have just now finished it. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is one of the best games I've played in years.Is it a perfect game? No. First of all the combat system grew old and a little too repetetive on me quickly and there are pretty far between serious combat challenges. Mainly due to this, the game is fairly easy (there's a few really tough battles, but not that many).I think my main concern with the combat is also due to the ""battlegrounds"". They look different, but throught the entire game they're essentially the same. It's a fixed square area where characters and enemies can move around. The nature is a little different depending on where in the game you are, but there are no obstacles or interactive objects on the battlegrounds whatsoever, which is a shame as that would have added an additional element to the combat.That is pretty much my main gripe with the game, though. Well, that and the fact that it starts a bit slow, but I'm alright with that.What really makes this game phenomenal is the story. It's not just good. It's really, really good. It has everything - romance, tragedy, political intrigues, humor, war, betrayal, and I could keep going. And it's not just implementing these themes - it's implementing them together very, very well. The characters are also well-written and have some pretty good interaction. They're different both in personality and in their role in the story. I never found that any of the main characters felt out of place or unnecessary, which is pretty impressive with a fairly large character roster.There's also a ton of side stuff to do with varying difficulty. Standard monster-killing sidequests, take item from A to B-quests, escort quests, etc. Alongside all this, there's a lot of hidden stuff and collectibles, that are completely optional and a lot of it is pretty well-hidden. If you truly want a 100% completion then you have to extremely thorough and visit and revisit almost all areas - and you have to do it before progressing too far or some areas will be locked. Normally I hate this locked approach, but I actually find it works alright in this game, as there's always something new to do in whatever area you end up in next.Completing the game took me just under 50 hours - and I tried to be thorough in finding most collectibles and items (and failed...). If you're not into all these extras I reckon the main game can be completed in less than 30 hours without rushing anything. If you're into JRPGs you should definitely not miss out on this title! Be warned, though. Halfway through the game I learned that this is just the first of three chapters. It was originally released in 2004 and they're still not done with the localization of the second chapter, yet, so finishing the entire story is going to require some patience. Playing this game is still completely worth it, though!			"

												Was caught off guard how good this game was. A good story that could be a bit slow at times, but interesting enough to keep you playing to see what comes next. The ending has a great twist and is powerful enough to evoke strong emotions for the characters that you've spent the whole game traveling with. Many of the characters are likable and show growth as the story develops. It also has a great soundtrack that complements the story perfectly, creating memorable scenes throughout the game.Its full of quality of life changes to the genre such as the removal of random encounters, the ability to save the game anywhere at anytime and a retry feature when the party is defeated in battle. Would recommend this game to anyone who misses some of the charm that the older JRPGs had, but want some quality of life changes that make the game more accessible and have you focused more on the story and the characters, and less about grind.

												I just finished The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky. This game is fantastic.I spent a long time away from RPGs and had an itch to get back into them and this was the first to really hold my attention. I'll try to keep this short and to the point.The story is incredible. Upon researching the Steam release, I found out the entire script of the first localized version of the game on PSP was completely revised and props to XSEED for that. The writing is top notch. Every single character in this game is well written and dynamic, including NPCs such as townspeople. They always have something interesting to say that contributes to the overall story and world of the game. Many jaw dropping moments in the ending as well. What a cliff hanger. Luckily Part 2 has been localized at the time of writing this.The battle system is simple, yet intricate enough to hold your attention. Battles are turn-based and occur in a movable grid field. Strategy is importand and rewarded, but I never found it making or breaking the course of a battle until the last couple of fights. Another thing that keeps things fresh are Orbments, which basically control what spells characters can cast, so a lot of customization can go into your party. It's pretty neat, At first I didn't spend much time customizing, but by the end of the game I found myself making little tweaks here and there just for the hell of it.This game is also not too difficult. The only part of the game I had a problem with was the final showdown, but that's because I was an idiot and didn't realized that Cestial Balms could revive and restore max health. I had 15 of them the entire time. I'd honestly reccomend this game to people who either are like me and spent a long time away from the RPG genre, or people who have never picked one up all their life. It's also worth mentioning that this game doesn't have many of the typical JRPG tropes (you know what I'm talking about), so if the anime art style is turning you off, don't judge a book by its cover. With that said Kloe is definitely waifu material. TL;DR: The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is an accessable JRPG that will hook you with its story and somewhat fresh gameplay. If you have the least bit of interest in playing it, I highly reccomend you do so.			"

												The characters are all very charming and surprisingly deep, the writing itself is quality and endearing, and the world is just so comfy to be in. Don't go in expecting anything epic from the start. The game's a slow burn, but if you take the time, it's rewarding in all the ways it promises to be. The dungeons are fairly bland and side quests can become tedious at times, but they're forgiven due to the fact that they all serve to fully flesh out this wonderful world.			"

It is by no means the best game I have ever played but I have thoroughly enjoyed it.The characters all have personality and things about them that will make you either love or hate them.When they say this is story rich, what they really mean is there is a lot of reading to do. This can sometimes be a bad thing when all you want to do is go explore. However the story is a good one and worth the read in my opinion.The music in the game is beautiful and fits the world well.I am not looking forward to finishing this game, mostly because I am not yet ready to say goodbye to this world. I have enjoyed this game and I am sure if you give it a chance you will too.			"

												Fairly light hearted JRPG. This game is more like a prequel to a much grander adventure and as such there is a lot of world building and character development at the start and its gets more exciting at the end. Music and dialog are pretty good and the game play is enjoyable.  It took me about 38 hours to play through the game doing main quests only, but there are a lot of side quests and hidden quests to do as well. The game is a little on the easier side, but it still provides a challenge and once you beat the game you unlock newgame+ which you can set to higher difficulties. Only issue I had is that there seemed to be a lot of backtracking and walking at the start, but then I figured out that you could run, which made this no longer an issue because you go like 3x faster. Would buy again and will definitely buy the sequel.			"

												This is a fantastic game for any JRPG lovers on Steam! Steam does not have a good variety of JRPGS, however, this one stands out as very excellent. The game is rather old so the graphics are not perfect, but for computers and laptops that can't run higher res. games, this is perfect. It runs perfectly on my laptop which was not made for gaming at all. There is an extensive amount of gameplay and it will last you a long time. The characters are fun and witty, and the world within the game is very fleshed out and immersive. The relationship between the main hero and heroine is also enjoyable to watch develop. It's also refreshing to play a JRPG where the playable character is a female who kicks butt! The combat system is also a lot of fun. It is a tactical grid-based setup. There is a line which shows the order of turns each character on the field is to go, and depending on the action the charcater takes, determines whether their next turn will come sooner or later. For example, using an item will make your next turn come sooner, but casting a spell will make your next turn come later because the spell needs time to be cast. I also enjoy that the game makes me feel like a contract worker. It's like being in the fighting guild for Elder Scroll games. Your characters are a part of the bracer guild and are contracted to do jobs in each city in order to earn money. In fact, it is the main way you earn money in the game because monsters do not drop money. You will earn money for the main storyline contract jobs, but if you check the board every so often then optional contract jobs will also appear (however they are time-limited because you cannot back-track from area to area in the story). What monsters do drop are gem-like things called sepith, which each have their own elements, and can be used to boost stats, give characters certain elemental magic or to be sold for extra money (mira). It is a good way to customize your characters magic-wise. All in all, this game has some original features that makes for an interesting JRPG exprience. I definitely recommend this game to JRPG players looking for something new to try out!7.5/10			"

												This game is the definition of average.  It's your typical anime-styled Japanese RPG.  It's got all your stereotypical anime character archetypes.  The story is about two ""siblings"", Estelle and Joshua Bright.  Joshua was found bloody and beaten by Elise's father 5 years earlier and adopted into the family.  Their father goes on a secret mission and vanishes.  The two siblings vow to unravel the mystery behind his disappearance. The issue with the plot being like that of an anime is that the pacing can get a little slow at times.  The last couple of chapters is when it REALLY picks up, but the first couple will really test your patience.  Your initial goal is to become Bracers, and join the Bracer Guild, just like your father had, but the story will (slowly) start to expand and the overall scope branches out.  There is apparently a 2nd game coming out this year in English, so I can tell you that they sequel-bait you with the ending.  It's pretty ballsy for such an average RPG to do that.  There is some good character development for just about every character though.  They won't remain the same throughout the game, luckily.  Some have a good depth to them, and others have secrets.  There are some twists in the story that you'll certainly enjoy too.  The voice-acting is above-average for English, which is also a plus, since a lot of the time, English voice-acting is crap.The battle system is your old-school turn-based jRPG with a small amount of ""strategy"" element thrown in.  You have your Attack, Move, Artes, Skill, and Item commands.  Unlike every turn-based strategy game made since the dawn of time, you can't choose to Move and then choose to Attack.  If you pick Move, your turn ends without being able to Attack.  Attack will attempt to beeline for a monster and hit them.  You'll be able to see your characters' range with the game's grid-based movement system highlighted around your character.  You'll learn new skills and limit breaks (not the actual term for it, but it's the same idea) as you level up.  Your Artes (or magic) work similar to Final Fantasy VII's materia system (minus the painstakingly boring task of having to level up each piece) with your characters having a max of 6 slots to place runes in.  You have to unlock the slots yourselves as well.  You do this by beating monsters.  Monsters don't drop gold, oh no.  They drop elements.  Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Space, Time, etc.  You can either sell them for gold, or keep them to exchange for runes or open up more slots.  You'll also still need gold to purchase everything else, unfortunately.  It's a bit of a convoluted system, honestly.On the plus side, you have TONS of customizability options for your characters with the runes.  You can tweak everything imaginable from hp to cast speed to offense.  ALL your magic comes from slotting runes, though.  So, if you unequip all your ruens, you can't cast jack.  Certain characters require specific types of runes in some of their slots.   For instance, Joshua requires Time runes in two of his slots.  That's ok though, because you'll be leaning on him heavily as the game progresses.  He's your good-at-everything main character.  Need an offensive juggernaut?  Slot a fire rune that raises his strength by 15%.  Want to pew-pew your enemies to death with spells?  Use his one of his time slots to stick a -%cast time rune in to get his spells out quicker.  Unfortunately, Estelle starts to become a bit of a burden near the end.  Her Skills are a bit lackluster, as is her damage.  She's still decent with spells, but for some reason, Joshua has more mp than she does.The game gives you ""subtle"" hints at what each character is good at though.  As you get new characters, they will come equipped with runes.  You don't have to be a genius to slot more magic into the guy with double Estelle's maximum mp.  Eventually (ie only the last dungeon) you'll be able to select your party of four from all the characters you've played with in the game.The music is appropriate, but don't expect A Thousand Words or anything.There are negatives to the game, however.  The story takes an awfully long time to come together.  Until that point in time you feel like you're just doing random missions until the game decides to give you something to grasp.  The clunky movement to the battle system, pigeon-holing your characters into specific roles, the need for AoE halfway through the game (both magic and skills), the rather average music and stereotypical animeness to all the characters and story hurt the game.  Also, sequel-baiting.  If you enjoy jRPGs and want a good time-waster, this is the game for you.  It took me 50 hours to finish all the story quests and side quests (although I missed 4 or 5 side quests).  If you can manage to stick through the first few chapters when the story starts to drag at times, you'll be rewarded.  I realize this has an 85 out of 100 on metacritic, but this game is not an 8.  It's just not.  They're lying to you.  If I had to give it a score I'd give it a 6.  Above-Average.  This is when comparing it to other jRPGs as a whole.  There are certainly a number of positives, but the negatives tend to bring down the score by a decent amount.			"

												My guess is that if you're reading reviews about this game you already like jrpg's and you just want to know if this one is worth your time. I think it is. I really enjoyed this game, I didn't do much with my free time besides play it until I beat it.As for what I liked about it I would start with the story. It isn't so much your average save the world and or kingdom, it more closely resembles ""slice of life"" (if you haven't heard of it, there's always google) in its story. It does build up to a climax, but mostly I felt like I was veiwing a piece of their lives, they just happen to lead fairly interesting lives.  I liked that, but I've seen some complaints about the story that sounded like that was their issue, so if you know that's going to frustrate you, it might not be the game for you. The combat is solid, if not groundbreaking. It gave enough layers and mixed up the enemies enough I never found myself avoiding combat except in areas I'd outleveled, and it gave me the items needed for avoiding unwelcome combat fairly early on, which was nice. Leveling never felt like a chore, I enjoyed seeking out the harder areas to do some extra leveling, and it was a quick enough process as to not get frustrating. I was usually about done leveling around the same time I was pretty sure I cleaned all the loot out of the side area anyway. Plus it was a nice feeling to afterwards avoid/ ignore enemies for a while because I knew they weren't worth fighting. Another plus for me that some people might not like was the graphics. Probably due mostly to psp limitations, the system it was created for, it was very reminiscent of classic jrpg's, and I really liked the nosalgia factor. I hope to see the second game make it to steam soon.			"

												Classic JRPG with a very rich world. It reminds me a bit of the first Grandia or Lunar in the way the characters interact. The positional turn based combat is fun and strategic, and there's plenty to customize. The only reason I haven't beaten it is I'm waiting for a release date for the sequel so I'm sure its actually coming out to finish the story.			"

												This game while new to PC and ""new"" as in having a English localization, is in fact over 10 years old and part of a series that gose back to 89. So when you play this game you get a massive retro feeling as it *IS* a retro game. Not one made ""like the originals"" .. it was made at the same time by the same developers who were at the very birth of the genre and as such it is a modern fossil. If you like jRPGs with massive worlds, tons of dialogue and character development, expansive equipment tweaking and a solid 60+ hours of gameplay but the modern games always make you think of that one game you played years ago that none of the new ones are as good as.... well this could be the game for you. As it is probably is exactly what you are looking for because it was in fact from the same era as that game you keep comparing everything to.I'm absolutely loving this, and the thought that it is part 1 of a trilogy and knowing there are 2 games to go.. games already made and released in japan. Gives me great joy!Highly Recommeded			"

												Trails is an excellent game.  Start with that.  As many JRPGs as I've played, I've never come across a more compelling story.  Sure the combat and graphics are antiquated (seeing as it was originally released in what, 2006?), but even in the earliest japanese role playing games, stories have been central to user enjoyment.  And Trails gets that perfectly.While there are some interesting gizmos to work with in the equipment and combat of LoH, it's not really about that.  The turn-based, element-based, mix-and-match-skills shenanigans won't impress anyone.  It's the charming, quirky story that drives you on, hour and hour, into the depths of the first chapter to what I hope is a long and fruitful franchise.Though, and this is just me being petty, but the main character girl is mostly annoying.  She is pretty prototypical of so many japanese stereotypes.  I guess the male main character is too, but he gets more interesting as the story goes, while she remains a typical meathead, act-first-then-talk-about-it type individual.  Yes, I know they're kids and kids are annoying and stupid, but since you're going to be sifting through massive amounts of dialogue, it's helpful to not have annoying characters.That's really my only gripe about the game.  That while the story is fantastic, and it never ends up being boring, sometimes I have to wonder what the game developers were thinking.  They KNEW that these two characters would receive the most screen-time, so why wouldn't they go to great pains to make them less annoying?  Ah, I'll never know.  Maybe it's just that budding romances between children are not interesting to me.  Okay, that's really off-topic.The best part of this game is the story, yes, I've said that already.  But the second best part is the atmopshere-building.  The npcs that wander around, the shopkeeps, the snippets of random dialogue, and the dialogue from the other companions are all masterful.  It all creates an atmophere that leaves you wanting to play more and more.  At one point you meet a bard/musician that has never said a non-risque thing in his life, and Schera who is a whip-weilding mentor.  Also some red-haired guy with a giant sword who just HAS to come off as a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in every context. Oh and don't forget that one girl with the cannon.  She's ehm...I despise this word....adorable.  She is, it's undeniable.Okay.  If you enjoy great stories, decent combat, acceptable graphics, acceptable interfaces, and excellent dialogue, then you are in luck.  Buy this game, and eagerly await Trails in the Sky: Second Chapter as I am.  Until next time, space traveler.			"

												Excellent game. I highly recommend picking this title up if you are into story driven JRPGs. I was craving a good rpg and it feels like I've been playing nothing but westeren rpgs lately. I was scouring through all the titles on steam and came across this gem and figured I would give it a shot and I am glad I did.PROSExcellent Execution - This is a conversion from a Japanese PSP title if I am not mistaken, however the conversion to English PC game was flawless. The controls are great, the graphics are HD, the sound is spot on and I did not experience a single bug throughout my playthrough.Classic JRPG - If you are a fan of some of the older Final Fantasy games you will probably like this game. It has a rich story, great artistic design and many other elements that make the genre great.Interesting World - The world created in this game has a nice mix of science and magic that don't necessarily exclude one another. CONSSome Dialogue - Being that this game has been localized from Japan you will see some familiar patterns in character dialague. For example, everyone apologizes for every little thing, so much apologizing. Many of the characters fit into standard Japanese tropes like the cute little girl witha  big gun that just wants to help out and the badass with a heart of gold.Customization - There is not nearly enough of this for your characters. There are not enough weapons, not enough skills, not enough magic. Also some characters are doomed to be weaker than others. Ex. Joshua will always be stronger than Estelle no matter how you gear them or customize their quartz. She can get pretty good defense but after a while he will seriously outdamage her.Formulaic - Combat is pretty much the same all the time. If they had added to where you could attack after movng it would have added a whole new dimension. Everytime you get to a new area it is the same thing. Buy new gear, check job board etc			"

												To start out with I'd like to mention that I'm a sucker for the Final Fantasy series, but have been pretty terrible at getting my act together to try out other acclaimed JRPGs. I didn't know about this game until it's Steam release was announced and people seemed to get pretty psyched about it online, so I figured I had to try this. More than half a year later I got my act together and have just now finished it. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is one of the best games I've played in years.Is it a perfect game? No. First of all the combat system grew old and a little too repetetive on me quickly and there are pretty far between serious combat challenges. Mainly due to this, the game is fairly easy (there's a few really tough battles, but not that many).I think my main concern with the combat is also due to the ""battlegrounds"". They look different, but throught the entire game they're essentially the same. It's a fixed square area where characters and enemies can move around. The nature is a little different depending on where in the game you are, but there are no obstacles or interactive objects on the battlegrounds whatsoever, which is a shame as that would have added an additional element to the combat.That is pretty much my main gripe with the game, though. Well, that and the fact that it starts a bit slow, but I'm alright with that.What really makes this game phenomenal is the story. It's not just good. It's really, really good. It has everything - romance, tragedy, political intrigues, humor, war, betrayal, and I could keep going. And it's not just implementing these themes - it's implementing them together very, very well. The characters are also well-written and have some pretty good interaction. They're different both in personality and in their role in the story. I never found that any of the main characters felt out of place or unnecessary, which is pretty impressive with a fairly large character roster.There's also a ton of side stuff to do with varying difficulty. Standard monster-killing sidequests, take item from A to B-quests, escort quests, etc. Alongside all this, there's a lot of hidden stuff and collectibles, that are completely optional and a lot of it is pretty well-hidden. If you truly want a 100% completion then you have to extremely thorough and visit and revisit almost all areas - and you have to do it before progressing too far or some areas will be locked. Normally I hate this locked approach, but I actually find it works alright in this game, as there's always something new to do in whatever area you end up in next.Completing the game took me just under 50 hours - and I tried to be thorough in finding most collectibles and items (and failed...). If you're not into all these extras I reckon the main game can be completed in less than 30 hours without rushing anything. If you're into JRPGs you should definitely not miss out on this title! Be warned, though. Halfway through the game I learned that this is just the first of three chapters. It was originally released in 2004 and they're still not done with the localization of the second chapter, yet, so finishing the entire story is going to require some patience. Playing this game is still completely worth it, though!			"

I was irratated with having to wait for repeat story lines to go through cause I would back up and try some levels over.  For the most part there are a variety of things to do and people to talk to so I was determined to play through to the end.			"

												Finnally got around to finishing it. Awsome JRPG.Battle system is simple yet enjoyable and the music is great to boot. The Storyline is quite predictable but the characters are very well done and have all their own quirks that mesh together well. The story can seem to get a little stretched out at times but it is always amusing to see Estelle, Joshua and every other character with a portrait's reactions to different things that are going on. That and the amount of side quests means the game doesn't get dull.Looking for hidden sidequests would be a pain though if going for 100% perfect, personnaly idc so it isn't an issue for myself but if you do care for that sort of thing I suggest using a guide because you will likely miss somethings otherwise.My only real critism is the shops and the lack of thier usefulness except the ones that sell armour, weapons, accessories and trading to get quartz to upgrade arts/orbments (which don't even cost mira the currency just septims what monster's drop). All the food is pretty useless i found since 99% of my healing or curing i just used my healing (tear and curia) arts and had no need of them. I also never bought more than 5 of the different curing items that removed things like poison, sleep, mute etc and I almost  never needed any of them.Still though it is a fantastic JRPG though, looking forward to chapter 2 being translated to English at some point.

												Now, Normally I do not write reviews. I can be pretty bad at this kind of thing what with lack of detail. However, Given how I enjoyed this game so much, I could not back away from this laptop.I should start with the length of this game, I spent 60 hours, with about 12 to 15 hours a day, trying to beat this game. Not as long as skyrim mind you, but truthfully it would have been 70 had I continuosly spoke with every character in the game. Now this may be unecessary, but it was interesting(and sometimes boring) to see what other people would talk about after every main quest, sidequest or hiddenquest you have finished. Of course if you don't like reading, which is weird because you are reading right now, this game is not really for you. there are 1.8 millions texts, or so I am told, in this game. Heck I could finish moby♥♥♥♥♥♥in that time.Texts aside, as you start to control your character in game, there is going to be quite a bit of handholding. It is a little pointless, but given how they designed the gameplay in battles and healing I think it may have been neccesary to have kept it longer. I realized at the final chapter you could use arts(Spells) outside of battle to heal yourself. To be honest I do not really like the design of how you battle out the enemy. I have no good way of explaining it, but the game automatically moves your arrow to a button. The most annoying part is that the Arts you will have to scroll down to use against an enemy. I mean Seriously! Scroll down to find a spell after every round? That is incredibly annoying. Still the battles are good enough so that you won't get bored, unless you are constantly heckled by monsters. On to the characters of this game. I have just one complaint. There are no theme songs for any of these guys. I know it is knit picking, but there are too few songs in a game so big and a lot of times they do not match what is going on in the game. Besides that I find the characters to be quite enjoyable. Even the duke, (who is a slob, a drunkard, and possibly sexist) is a character I enjoy seeing because of his stupidity and drunkeness. My favorite character of this game would be Olivier. Olivier is an... unique person. I'd tell you more, but I would not want to spoil the fun. I can say that he has saved me from boredom from time to time as rpgs sometimes get to that in certain scenes. There are other comedic characters in this game too, and this is usually why I play anime games such as this. My final say is that at the end of the game, you will be blasted with an incredible and shocking ending. I cried through these scenes. Heck you'll be mindblown reaching the ending, course if yer perty smart, you may have a good idea what it is. I had an idea, but boy was I off on some points. That said, this game is great, do not buy it if you go to college and have 19 hours of school. You will not get any sleep... like ever. The game is way too addicting to close. in fact I lied about playing it 12 to 15 hours a day... yeah.... I've actually had only 3 hours of sleep until I finally finished it. So that is how addicting it is. Enjoy!			"

												The Legend Of Heroes: Trails In The Sky is an JRPG with a deep, rich world to explore. The protagonists, Estelle and Joshua embark on an adventure filled with lots of interesting characters with their unique personalities and abilities, It only took me 3 minutes to instantly be engaged to the story, grasping my complete attention that left me to forget there are other games to play, I wanted to experience this game exclusively until I reached the end. As you just read, the story is one of the best aspects of this title.The amazing soundtrack of Trails In The Sky will be in your mind, from the calm tunes, to the intense sounds of battle, it is almost impossible to not like it at all, it is extremly well done. The gameplay is a classic turn based battle system that lets you strategize your movements, going in for the kill on the various monsters you will face. Patience with the tougher enemies is key to a successful win.Is there anything bad to say? Trails In The Sky does have some cliche parts in the story, but it makes up for it with its extensive detail in character development, something you will see grow as you progress through the chapters. Depending on your taste for JRPGs, you may see a lot of good or a lot of bad, it is a title directly for the JRPG fans, but is also welcome for newcomers who want to try something different.Without a doubt Trails In The Sky is a hidden classic that many do not know about. I myself did not know about this game either, I am glad that I did. I highly recommend anyone who LOVES RPGs, no matter if WRPG or JRPGs. For those who haven't bothered trying out JRPGs, for those who haven't tried RPGs, The Legend Of Heroes: Trails In The Sky is the game to play.			"

												It is a great game, although it is not for everyone.If you dislike pixelated graphics, long battles, surpise bosses, talking to everyone, endings that leave off on a very emotional note for a sequal, possibly missing sidequests, not being able to make any money exept on sidequests, lots of costamization in your spells and equip then this game is probly not for you, and the inability to go back to previous areas in the game if you missed something you want to get.But if you like anime, jrpgs, games with a good story, games with loads of costomizing, games with new game plus modes, games with retro graphics, games with very flashy moves as well as super moves, games with tons of sidequests and exploration, games with fields of monsters, turn-based tile-based and energy(mana, magic, tp, what ever else you can think of calling them), games with a very good tutoral phase, a nice fun game, and a game with a ending and story that leaves you wanting more then this game is for you.And yes i recommend this game because theres way more good then bad, and it is a very fun story driven game with lots and lots of fun content.Btw if i missed anything good or bad about the game that you knowticed I am very sorry for forgeting it I only put in what i feel.

												The story starts off as a generic fantasy game with many cliche character archtypes but as my play time grew I found myself extremely fond of each character as they are all both likeable and unique as the game progressess. It is set in a fully immersive world that has a story that can keep you interested enough to play through the whole thing in just a few days. The combat system is a turnbased system that can get repetitive very fast; which Is why I would recommened playing this game on hard mode because it forces the player to employ well-thought out strategies with each battle(ranging from mobs on the side of the rode to big boss battles) and to prepare well in advance with switching what types of quartz players have, their positionings and surviving massive aoe attacks. It was both an extremely fun and rewarding experience with each vicory but not without just as many defeats.On normal difficulty, the combat was both boring and unfufilling because it was too onesided in the protoganists favor and would fail to keep me feeling engaged or interested. I didn't feel a sense of accomplishment in the first few hours on this difficulty which was changed completely on hardmode.			"

												To the fans of glorious and underrated JRPG genre - I do recommend this one. I didn't make much progress yet, but the spirit of JRPG is certainly there. Vivid and alive characters, that kind of emotionally connect you to them, make playing such games more like reading a book.The only minor complaint is game camera - it's orthographic, which is somewhat not much of a complaint, but its position is. It's too close on the characters, which makes you harder to navigate around and look about. Everything is too close.			"

												Although the game is good and I would recommend it there are few things I don't like... - It gets repetetive and there is a certain amount of backtracking... ( areas, getting to major city and doing guild quests... )- combat feels a bit cheap and you are stuck with default weapons for every character ( so basically you can't create your own style ). I hate combat because there is utterly no significance to ""Move"" command. In othere games you would have ""Move"" phase where u can get out of the AoE danger or to position yourself better so you can get critical hit etc. However in this game once you use one command then that's it... you either Move or Attack ( use arts etc. ) And criticals are all about stealing them from your enemies... by looking at the line up you can defeat or use special art skill to get in front of enemy action bar and steal their ""perks""... This system feels shallow and cheap at times... Thus said you are in for the story not for the combat. So is the story good ? Well its ok. Characters are a bit cliche but what I like in this game its that it starts slowly... its well written and it doesn't rush itself. You enjoy the conversations and sometimes you even have a choice what to say ( but does it affect the outcome of the conversation ? No. its linear. Characters will correct you if you goof around so yeah.... )Sometimes I was angry on main characters and their ""goody two shoes"" attitude and self-righteous actions. A lot of times I felt bad about the bandits and I would even stand in their defense but oh well game won't allow for that.So it's a solid turn based / tactical rpg that leans more on choosing skills, equipment and story rather than combat...I would recommended it regardless of its flaws and things I didn't like.

Motto: Genial things are simple.This is first game from three chapters . You are following story and life of Estelle Bright young bracer and her friends. Love, fear, ominous enemies twists in characters .  The graphic is simple, isometric resembles of Ragnarok online or Breath of fire IV. There is no search for hidden objects in towns and settlements, no walls of text during dialogues or dialogue options, no tough moral decisions,  character are sometimes a little shallow  . Combat can be challenging at higher difficulities ,even frustrating especially in second chapter but nothing inovative.So why for God sake I recommend it to You? Because this game has soul! Something that force you to follow the story, be fond of characters  simply sit down and enjoy the flow of narrative. Something that force you to write your first review after really huge amount games played . Not being distracted  by too many side things or huge lore, it let you simply enjoy the show. By simple doesn´t mean simplistic or not polished, on the contrary  Dialogues are usually short especially with commoners but... Every! character even a little one, every commoner will change his line after story progresses. Game is divided into chapters and after you ended  chapter  fighted the boss, you can (but don´t have to), visit everyone you get acquainted with and hear what more he or she  has to say or simply move on . It makes You feel that  this world is actually living its live, not waiting for you to appear play its role and then freeze in time.  You see that creators put lot of love in it and making things look simple requires lot of work and love.If u dont mind being guided through simple but interesting story with character twists In JRPG style, If You dont mind absence of open world this game is for You and is worth every penny. Just sit to your PC and enjoy your show.			"

												Loved it. If you enjoyed text heavy RPG's of the past this is wonderful. It's like they took what was best of the SNES and PSX rpgs and put them together. Tips: Fight the monsters that pop out of chests. I didn't realize they dropped good loot until later.Check the Bracer board often and do those before finishing story line quests as they expire. The guild quests will say whether they're short term (do those now) or long term. They give much needed game currency nothing else drops. "

												I reviewed this game for DieHard GameFAN. This is the short attention span summary of my review: The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is an updated port of the PSP game of the same name, which itself was an updated port of a Japanese PC game. The visuals have been enhanced with support for higher resolutions, plus the translation has been cleaned up in places to make it more consistent with its followup. The story is very engaging, even if it has something of a slow start, and battles have enough strategic nuance to them that they’re enjoyable throughout the entirety of the game. I can’t recommend a purchase enough. Especially since doing so is the only way we’ll see more of this franchise stateside. Bring on the Second Chapter!			"

												This game has quickly become my favorite JRPG game of all time. This game does everything right; it has a fanastic story, great battle mechanics, and lovable characters. The game took me about 50 hours to complete, and not a single minute of it felt boring or dull. This was because about a third of the game is spent on reading dialog between characters that really builds up a believable and enjoyable world for you to explore. If you are a fan of JRPGs, you must play this game!			"

												A tactical turn based JRPG? Hell yeah. I sat through the typical slow opening and i was very pleased with the direction of the game. Very few times did i need to use the internet to learn where to go, but i must also admit i can not beat what (appears to be) the final boss. He/she/it (no spoilers) is crazy strong and i just cant go on. So after 100 hours of doing every little thing, im ok with stopping at the final boss. This is only one chapter of a larger 3 part series but only part 1 is on Steam. I highly reccomend this game.			"

												This is one of the best JRPGs I've played.The graphics sometimes leave much to be desired, but I think it's one of the game's charms.The interface almost reminds me of a mobile app.And the combat is repetitive and doesn't change much, but it is still enjoyable.If you can get past that you're in for a treat!The story is amazing, you can usually guess the ending by the middle of the game but throughout this leaves you wondering ""what's going to happen next?"" The characters all have their unique personalities and I think they all had a moment I lol'ed at. The side quests aren't boring or tedious, and there are plenty of them.Only real issue I had was having to install a codex pack to watch the opening and ending cut scenes, it didn't really effect gameplay since you can skip the first, but I couldn't save my finished game for newgame+ and get the ending achievement without doing so.

The characters and the story are both strong points - the dialogue and interactions between the characters is fantastic. The combat is on par with what you'd expect with a turn based combat game, but really it's the characters that made this game a blast. I couldn't get past the first hour of FF 13..but this was hard simply to put down. 10/10			"

Wait, they're rolling the credits on THAT!?I'll be picking up Second Chapter as soon as it comes out... and me, I almost NEVER pay full price for games.To those considering this one - yes, it starts out a little slow, and probably a little predictable, but the ride is worth it.

												*Bought this game**Watched the intro, learned who the main characters are**Started to enjoy the Characters*30 Hours inMain Character: We should find a way to sneak into the castle to stop the CorporalController (Me): Lol, wait, that's still a thing? Screw that, you guys are way more interesting than the story!Gist: Started the game, got way too into the characters that 30 Hours in, I started to ignore the story cause I loved the characters too much.If you are planning on getting this game, get ready, because the game has a lot to offer in terms of story, cast, character developement, quips and jokes, and dialogue. The story is amazing and well developed, and the world itself is full of life, secrets, and lore. The Characters are amazing, and lovable, and you get attached to them so much that it's wonderful.Gameplay is ok for a JRPG. For me, the gameplay is good, but I saw it really as a way to help you progress across the story, without it being a storybook game. The combat is fun, and there is an interesting Orbament System that allow you to customize your characters to your play style. These orbaments also give ways to different spells and enchantments you can use in battle, so you should test out different combinations to get the best one for certain situations.Pros:-Story is amazing, well written, and one of the best-Characters are amazing, fun, and well developed-Audio is enjoyable, and synchs with the areas they play in-Fun jokes, moments, and quips relieve tension from serious situations-Combat needs strategy, and you have to think in certain battles rather than go head on blindly if you want to winCons:-Too much dialogue (Honestly, i'm sure 15-20 hours of my gameplay time was just me reading through the dialogue). However, the dialogue is very important, and must not be ignored.-Side Quests have a lifespan, and should be finished before continuing the story, or they will be gone forever.-Treasure Chests mock you if you check them again after opening them and taking whatever was inside.All in all, the story is amazing, gameplay is fun, and the cast of characters are way too awesome to give up. If you enjoy JRPGS with an amazing story, and have the patience to read through so much dialogue, then get this game.			"

												Let me start this out by saying this, I've never played a JRPG before this... unless you count Pokemon and let's be honest here, no-one counts Pokemon...Pros:Good characters and exellent character development - Olivier just makes the game amazing... crazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Olivier...Funny dialogue - I very rarely laugh out loud at a games dialogue but this one really did get meFun battles (in my opinion) - I've heard some people critisize the game for it's battle mechanics but I personally found them quite interesting, nothing new or groundbreaking but fun tactical battles nonetheless.Nice artstyle and graphics: I did like the use of the low-spec graphics style and I found it rather charmingInteresting ""orbament"" system: the fitting of the orbament outside of battles really has an impact on how well you can do.Interesting story - I usually quit a game after 5-10 hours of play, hence why I have over 400 games but this one really held my attention long enough for me to put a lot of time into it.Cons:Sometimes cringy dialogue - although funny the dialogue does sometimes have that ""anime"" kind of feeling, don't get me wrong I have nothing against anime and I love stuff like Death Note but this was just a bit cringy on occasion.Vague tutorials - some people may like having to figure this stuff out but personally I wasn't a massive fan, I spent a long time trying to grasp the intracasies of the orbament system and it really annoyed me... worth it though...Camera glitches - particularly a problem in Crafts where you can't edit the camera angles.Pet peeve - something that annoys me which isn't actually a game fault:Did you really have to call the magic ""arts"" and the talents ""crafts"" because ""arts and crafts"" sounds like something I'd see in a kid's TV programmeOverall it's a really fun JRPG with an engaging story and a fun battle mechanic. Could be made better with added replayability but I can understand why such a story-driven game would have trouble with that. Could also be made a hell of a lot better with a level editor to allow users to make custom levels or stories, the possibilities would be endless.			"

It wasn't a bad ending it just leaves me wanting the 2nd Installment:) Which I hope is in the works. I could play it again only slower and do more side quests but some of the side quests seem ""buggy"" since I could not complete some of them even after trying for 3 hrs on 1. That being said I rate this game 9 out of 10. It is worth evey dollar I paid and hope to see more from this company in the future.

It adds a little more oomph to movement in battle.Now my first time (sooo, now) playing was very nice, considering what I've said in the begining, though it seems kinda overwhelming, but don't worry about it, its simpler than you think and works fine in the begining (I don't know yet in the future). So, if you are a new or expert player at RPGs, it does not matter as much, I would greatly recomend this game.

												I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is into JRPG's. The game itself is a lot of fun. There's a lot detail put into the game in terms of NPC's and immersion. The Story is fairly straightforward, and the battle system is easy to use. The only complaint that I have is that the MC's are very generic for their archetypes.			"

												Beautifully written. This game brings together everything you need for a JRPG experience and couples it with a well-paced and intereting world. The combat gets steadily more difficult throughout the game and requires tactical decisions, although I wouldn't call the game difficult. While the chibi characters and slow pace at the beginning might deter some people from playing through the whole game, I can assure you it's wholly worth it in the end.			"

												This is a game with a pretty slow start. Lots of exposition dialogue at the beginning before the combat tutorial. If you like JRPGs, you will probably like this game.The combat system is a mix of turn-based and tactical RPG. There is a gem-type system which allows you to customize which magic skills you want. Magic in this game is called Arts. Special Attacks are called Crafts and are unique per  character. Standard attacks build up the Craft Points (CP) meter. You can choose to spend the Craft Points once you have enough OR build the meter up to max and unleash the S-Craft attack.There is a lot of depth to this RPG, but it does take some time investment up front to get to the action. I would recommend this to anyone interested in RPGs; with a bit of patience, you'll have fun with this game.			"

												I will give this game a 4 out of 5 stars this game is an amazing game I totally enjoyed every moment of it I just wish it wasn't as grindy. If you are looking for a good turn-based rpg this game is worth the price but keep in mind it is grindy I have around 30 to 40 hours in it so far and I am still enjoying it. If you have any questions just add me and ill try to answer them			"

												Just completed the game after a lengthy playthrough.Highly recommended. Good combat mechanics, excellent art, and a fantastic story that had me holding back tears on occasion. Very good value for the price tag.LoH is a JRPG from top to bottom. A few anime videos, enemies that range from cute rabbit-eared fauna to bizarre mechanical monsters, and there's a whole lot of inexplicable magic attacks and staves ripping through metal and what-have-you. You're not going to see anything genre-defining here, but LoH puts enough effort into being original that it doesn't get boring and brings enough polish that it doesn't need to be more original than that.The combat is turn-based and takes a fair shot at complexity, although this is probably the game's weakest point. That said, it isn't bad at all; but with a general lack of complaints about everything else, I have to say it could have been better. The combat field and the ability to move without attacking (essentially giving up that character's turn) creates and illusion of tactical depth that really doesn't go very deep once you start exploring it. The only point to having a field in which characters move around is to bunch up for area-affect abilities and stand out of reach of an attacker with a short range. And that's good - I like that we can do those things - but it could have easily been better. One simple addition would have been the addition of terrain, rather than a completely open grid. As it is the only difference between a gun-using character and a melee character is how far they have to run to get into range to attack someone (since the guns in this game shoot bullets about as far as I can throw a rock, apparently). The system where special effects are randomly assigned to a certain spot on the character order is fun, but it could have been better.The only other problem I had was completing some Bracer jobs: even with the ""short"" to ""long"" term note, it isn't obvious when the normal course of the game's story will suddenly cause them to register as failed, or why this is. I completed maybe two or three side-jobs in Weiss, just because all of the major story mission events were happening within short walking distance of each other and it didn't occur to me to put all of it on hold while I constantly checked the jobs board and did all of that first. Some jobs are also just plain hard to figure out, like when they give you the name of some tertiary character as a contact without giving a location, too. If that's some trick to pad out the completion time, seriously, you didn't need it.The only other complaints I can muster are rather petty, and come with a SPOILER WARNING: all those airships flying around constantly, and featuring extensively in the story lore and promo video, and you only get to fly in them twice... as cargo. More missed opportunities. Also: the fight against Lorence in the royal keep that you're supposed to lose? If you're going to put in a scripted loss, at least make it so the enemy wipes you out cleanly, so that it's obvious you can't win. Having an enemy that does impressive but manageable damage and only manages to fend you off because he can heal himself faster than you can damage him is a♥♥♥♥♥♥move. I used SO many good items on that fight!Anyway. Excellent game, recommend it to everyone, looking forward to the sequel!			"

												Intreging story! Steady game play! Grinding is kept to a minimal! I fell in love with this game the moment eye contact was made. The characters are colorful, and for the most part, the main characters all fight differently, so variaty is vast! The combat is fast, so the story never really feels like it comes to a halt. The only warning i have is the game is very long, but thats ok for most JRPG fans.			"

THAT's how good it is.One of the best RPG's I've ever played.			"

												A very enjoyable and not too grindy JRPG. The gem system allows you to mix and match gems to obtain different spells and gain trait bonuses. The story is captivating (albeit it does have certain tropes involved) and sports some very interesting characters.The story unfurls in chapters, so back-tracking to previous world locations is not possible. This also occurs with other party members, so you do not get to pick and choose for most of the game. If you liked Final Fantasy 8 , you will find this game very enjoyable.			"

												just finshed the game, easy to play but with some nice customisations to gameplay make it overall fun and entertaining even if the excessive small talk dialogue is f***ing annoying at times.....BUT with joyous character quirks like a new age dominatix style alchoholic who's 'special move' is to run at the screen with her cleavage and then tell her opponents 'someones been naughty' and then proceeds to whip them vigourosly while she giggles, a dirty neu-romantic pervy poet that tries to sleaze on everyone even the teenagers and a somewhat incestuos sister-adopted brother romance plot make it all worth while!

												This is a wonderful game with a great story! So many well written reviews on here about this game that I don't want to repeat what has already been said.  If you are into JRPGs, turn based combat, and most of all AMAZING stories with lots of laughs and maybe a couple tears, definitely pick this game up! Some of the best 60-80 hours I have spent on a PC.			"
