												Positives:- Very addictive gameplay.- Lots of levels and game modes.- Many weapons and powerups.- 4 Player Local Coop.- Nice graphics.What changed from original:- Few new weapons and powerups.- Few new game modes.- Perks can't be used in the main game now and are only available in Survival.- Interface feels less powerful and more like a mobile game. (I was told this is to keep the game looking consistent across all platforms).- New flame weapon is a lot more useful than the original two.Issues:- I had an odd bug where the game refused to start when I installed it. A simple restart of my computer fixed the issue.- You won't use a quarter of the weapons in the game due to them being underpowered compared to some of the bigger beasts.Overall:I've enjoyed the beta and had next to no issues with performance. I somewhat dislike the interface and the lack of perks in the main game but I can understand.Edit: A couple of things I noticed in the new update include:- New Crimsonland theme tunes (unless I just forgot the old ones)- Ion Cannon now explodes in various directions.

												Changing my review to positive because they deserve it.When this game was re-released on Steam, it was missing a lot of things that vets would be expecting to see there, like the perks in quest mode and the functionality of perks in survival mode. Some were removed entirely. The developer has added perks back into quest mode with their original functionalities. You can also opt into the beta client to test out other new perks before they make it into the final build. The UI and HUD still feels like a mobile game but whatever.I don't know what made them think those changes would be improvements in the first place, but I'm glad that they listened to community feedback and changed things back to how they use to be. If you somehow are still not happy with the new graphics and all that with the original gameplay, you can also play the original Crimsonland that's included in this purchase.			"

												This is simple game. No story, no cutscenes, only pure violence. You need to kill as many enemies as possible or they will kill you. But they have some advantage - they will kill you, no matter how hard you will try to survive. But with every death you will be better and better and you will want to try again and again.I remember playing that game about 10 years ago and it was a great experience. How is that now? As you can see, When I'm writing those words, I have 15 hours played and I still play it from time to time. Maybe it's not as good as it was long time ago, but it's still a good game, so I can recommend it without hesitation.But I have to warn you, this is not an easy game.VERDICT:If you're a pacifist, better stay away of this game.But if you love to slay monsters in bloody way, you'll have plenty of fun here.Like this review?

												Original Crimsonland (2004) is one of my most favourite games ever. But the Steam version is a serious step backwards. New graphics and not as pretty, new UI is bland and forgettable, and the worst crime of all - the Perks are gone from the quest mode. That's right, they only exist in Survival, which I know some people don't even play.You would be much better suited by playing the original version 1.9.8.			"

												This game has a lot going for it...but not enough.Lets start with the positives:I love the updated graphics, the new perks, the more streamlined leveling system, the ability to have four players at once, and many other details about this reboot of the classic crimsonland. Killing enemies is as fun as ever and almost every weapon is great and feels good for different situations (except you blowtorch!) and has a legitimate strategy. Perks are incredibly important and add a deep aspect of thought to the game (Do I get regeneration to keep my health up or choose fast reloader so I can kill enemies more?) and the sheer addictive nature of the gameplay will keep you hooked. Its a solid title...or should be...Which leads me to the negatives:Outside of the story mode this game isn't really as fun as it used to be. They took out a lot of things that made it fun. In solo survival the average player can expect to get to level 8-9 if they get a decent weapon before being absolutely annihilated by the hordes of enemies. If you add friends to the mix the difficulty ramps up even more and you will be lucky if you clear level 6. Its almost a broken level of hard. Theres no fighting it. No matter which perks you pick or which weapons you have the survival mode reaches a certain point early on that just immediately kills you. Your choices feel useless and it becomes kind of a drag when you get the perfect weapon combo with the perfect perks and then you just get slaughtered anyways by the sudden wave of splitting spiders and zombie lords that surround you out of thin air instead of coming out of the sides of the screen like they used to. The previous version of crimsonland slowly spiked the difficulty more and more making the survival last longer. It really felt like you were, you know, surviving? This version of crimsonland has no such subtlety or flair. They let you gain a couple levels and then just murder you outright with a frustrating amount of enemies that are impossible to fight. Let me put it to you this way. I was the 3rd highest ranking player IN THE WORLD in the previous crimsonland but in this one I can barely top level 10 in solo survival. They have taken one of the greatest and most fun modes of the game and just smashed it and made it unplayable. If they had a difficulty choice I think it could mitigate this. This is the only game I think actually NEEDS an easy mode.Another thing that is absolutely broken in this game is the enemy spawning system. In the previous crimsonland enemies came out of all 4 sides of the screen giving you a chance to plan ahead. You could see a horde of zombies and decide which way you want to bait them to try and get an opening to dive for that powerup or weapon. You can find the big monster that is spawning little ones and put that sucker down before he overwhelms you.This crimsonland has destroyed that too. It is quite common now to have enemies spawn on top of you and immediately kill you. Nothing sucks worse than to be 10 minutes into a boss battle and to be killed by a horde of tiny red aliens spawning right on top of you. Or to be doing a survival round with your favorite weapon and perks and to have a lizard king spawn right next to you and one shot you instantly. Its painfully frustrating and can make you want to chuck your keyboard across the room. It has happened to me in almost every mission of this game and is the most common way to die. Some enemies still come out of the sides of the screen, but more than half of them just appear with a flash wherever they feel like regardless of how inconvient it is for you.So in conclusion, the game is fun but ultimately frustrating and not worth your money. They could have had a solid remake of a fun arcade shooter on their hands but they've instead destroyed it by breaking the difficulty and spawning and made it virtually unplayable. If you do buy this game, you'll discover its fun palls rather quickly because of its major stumbling blocks. It is a shadow of its former self and if you want to play a fun arcade shooter, download the first one online someplace (a few places host it for free) and have yourself a grand old time.But skip this version. Its just not fun anymore.			"

Crimsonland is a fast-paced, very well thought-off and balanced top-down shooter. The game is clearly based on the classic with the same name from 2003 - with the most recent major update, the original game is even presented for free when you buy Crimsonland on Steam. Just as the original one, the new version is a no-nonsense game in which you get several different gamemodes which offer access to just the one thing that really counts: slaying monsters, aliens and zombies. And there are a TON of those, so you need some decent gear, don't you? Happily, Crimsonland offers exactly that: the number of weapons isn't overwhelmingly large, but they are very different from each other and most ask for an appropriate playstyle to make the most of them. You'd better stay out of the melee with the Ion Cannon and take on the mob from a distance, but a flamethrower just wants you to get in there are clear a small ring of safety around you.Thankfully, 10TonsLtd have also included a fairly large number of power-ups which appear during the fights and which come in most welcome when the crowds get bigger and bigger. Make no mistake: this is no easy-going game, and the going gets really tough towards the end of the different scenario's. Happily that's where the dozens of available perks come in: they offer a permanent of way of buffing your character, and allow for some degree of ever so slight character building, especially with regard to a playstyle which suits you best.Graphically, the game gets the job done, but not more than that. Some extra effort and more visual appeal would have been welcome. Sound is pretty good though, with all weapons having a very clear identity of their own. Steam cards and a bunch of interesting - and some quite difficult - achievements make sure this game offers quite some playtime.Recommended, even more so for everyone who fancies taking out the enemy hords from above "

												I never played the original Crimsonland. Well actually that's not true; I tried the demo once and the game didn't really seem like anything special. After reading some great impressions from a friend, I decided to check out this new and improved Crimsonland and I'm very glad I did. It's addictive, bloody, intense, and just one hell of a fun satisfying shooter.In terms of story and gameplay, Crimsonland is as simple as can be. You and hordes of hundreds and hundreds of creatures on the battlefield, kill them all. But while the actual mechanics are not complex, Crimsonland adds a layer of strategy underneath the run and gun gameplay, turning a game that might seem shallow from the screenshots into a compelling thrilling experience. Every moment consists of countless decisions. Which gun is best for the current situation? Should I rush for that power-up but risk having to run through a horde to reach it? Which order should I use power-ups? Which perks should I choose?I think the most interesting aspect is how the varied enemies require you to totally change your tactics and influences the weapons and perks you'd want to use. It's not like some shooters where you can just get the most powerful weapon and kill everything. If you're facing fast spiders that replicate when they die, then you're going to want a weapon that's accurate and precise but that fires and reloads fast enough that they won't close the gap, and power-ups that focus on crowd control and defense. Hordes of zombies? You'll want to go for the spray and pray type weapons or explosives and all-out offensive power-ups. Thankfully your arsenal is just as varied as the enemies you face. Weapons range from a simple pistol and shotgun to all manner of flamethrowers, plasma cannons, automatic weapons, and even more exotic weapons. Power-ups slow time, shield you from damage, restore health, imbue your weapon with devastating plasma energy. The RPG-esque perk system offers diverse ways to customize your playstyle. Sacrifice health for damage, move faster, have more ammo, poison enemies, gain a melee attack, and many more perks make each survival attempt feel fresh and excitingCrimsonland is a must play for top-down shooter fans. Besides the 60-mission campaign (and three difficulty levels), you can test your skills across several survival modes, all of which adds its own twist of the core gameplay. The visuals and effects are stylish, the gameplay is deeper than you'd might expect, and seeing the screen literally turn red with blood and gore as you mow down hundreds of creatures is very satisfying.

ImpressionIf you like twin-stick or arcade shooters, Crimsonland is one you'll want to check out. Lately, I've been on a shooter gaming kick, but FPS are not generally for me, and permadeath is also a feature that I tend to avoid. Crimsonland is a top-down shooter with responsive controls, full controller support, and the ability to begin or resume the game where you left off.GameplayThe game consists of 5 levels, each with numerous ""quests"" that serve more like levels than quests. The graphics and soundtrack have a more retro feel to them, and while appropriately understated, these really weren't the aspects of the game that impressed me. It was the gameplay itself that kept me playing all the way to the end.To start with, you have multiple difficulty levels, which make it a great game for casual gamers and also for hardcore gamers looking for a ""tough-as-nails"" challenge.  For a casual gamer like me, normal difficulty can be completed in 4 hours or less. During the game, a certain number of achievements are unlocked through gameplay, but it also includes achievements that are unlocked on greater difficulties, such as those for unlocking all perks, accuracy, or not taking damage. So, if you're a maniac achievement hunter looking for a real challenge, this game may be intriguing for you.There are a wide variety of weapon drops, power-ups, and perks that keep the game fun and make each playthrough unique. There are also many different monsters to kill, each with its own characteristics. In addition, there is a local co-op feature which makes it possible to game with friends.OverallI enjoyed it very much and would definitely recommend it to gamers looking for a similar experience.

												So let me just go ahead and start off saying this little bit: I'm going to be incredibly biased... I remember the day Crimsonland came out and remember quite well begging my mom to purchase it off 10ton's website. Violent as hell and they didn't try to hide it almost became my downfall until my mom realized she wasn't going to win.Sitting down and playing Crimsonland today makes me feel like I'm a kid again. It's prettier, more functional, and full of some damn fine content that would make any arcade lover melt. Honestly if you don't pick up this game I pity you. You're going to be missing out on one of my favorite childhood games and that's horrible!Do you like explosions?Do you like blood?Do you enjoy being a sickly green color and poisoning everything that touches you?If you said yes to any of the questions above YOU BETTER BUY THIS GAME!

												unfortunately not as good as the original. unlike the original, perks are not available in the questmode, unless you know the secret password ""grim"" to get to the secret options menu...WTF??? This is the lazy mans attempt on a newer version of Crimsonland, so the multiplayer is only local, which doesn't really work for most PC users.For those wondering:To unlock the secret options menu start a game and press Esc, then type ""grim"" and the menu will open.

												I remember when I was 8 years old and I won my first computer, together my father bought a small cd with ''100 games inside'' was one of the happiest days of my life, but a game caught my attention more Than all others... Crimsonland v1.3.0, the description said: Defend yourself from bloodstains with a spectacular nuclear weaponry, so yes I thought, I'll give it a try, when I double-clicked the crimson.exe A creepy song started playing on the loading screen, the last thing I remember was almost to have been paralyzed from so much fear of that song in the loading screen and in the scoreboard too, my dad and me spend HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS, day after day playing this! we were disputing which of us would be the best everytime, we gathered such good memories with this game and I only have to thank each one of you guys at 10Tons for never giving up this game and always improving it and always adding content during all this time, I wish you all success to all the games you produce from now on!Question: (1) The music that I was referring to in the text above was one called ''survo41'' and it was from the version v130 (made in 2002) in the sounds folder, and I've never heard of it in the newer versions of the game, was there any reason why it was not added to the final product?(2) Do you guys intend to make any extra content for this game in the future? Or something that explains the history and the cause of these soldiers being in that ♥♥♥♥ed up hellhole full of aliens?(3) Who the hell has the idea of making the Broodmother have a protective shield and the ability to bite you while she is protected?Anyway... thanks again for this game, you guys rock!

												Crimsonland is a fairly simple concept of top-down shooting and tonnes of mayhem - imagine Serious Sam from a top-down perspective. The three things I can guarantee you with Crimsonland: hoards of mobs, lashings of blood and a colossal arsenal at your disposal. Overall it is an incredibly enjoyable experience that I have no hesitation in recommending to anyone looking for a challenge and trip down memory lane. It won’t appeal to everyone due to its difficulty level and outdated design, but the gameplay is satisfying overall. I personally couldn’t play too many lengthened sessions as it does become repetitive after some time, however the variety in weapons and mobs, not to mention the addition of the various survival modes helps to keep things fresh.

Posted: June 11, 2014
												Pretty disappointed by this ""remake""... if you could even call it that. This game has some new perks and a few new game modes, but that's about all that is new.  All of the sound effects and music, for example, are 100% reused from the original-- in 2003, this kind of audio quality was acceptable, but in 2014, it feels tinny and underwhelming, especially with regards to the music, which sounds like it was saved and then resaved as lossy 64kbps mp3s. The graphics are pretty much the same as well, just barely updated for wide screen resolutions. This is such a non-remake, in fact, that the flavor text for perks is exactly the same, poor English included! In 2003, coming from a tiny indie dev, this was acceptable. But to have this in 2014, from what is now a well established, modestly successful casual PC and mobile developer...that's just shameful and embarassing. (If you've played any of 10tons' games on iPhone or Android, that is the kind of quality I expected.)Now for the new gameplay-- for some reason, someone thought that it would be a good idea to remove perks entirely from the Quest mode. This is such a poor decision. A major part of the 2003 game's charm was getting to make choices and develop your character gradually over the course of each level, with a clear progression in your power as the enemies became stronger and more numerous. Now the quest mode is just a boring grindfest in which the only interesting choices are when to pick up a powerup, and whether to use a shotgun or a plasma rifle. What's worse is that the game forces you play through this quest mode in order to unlock the guns and perks for use in survival mode, which does let you choose perks and develop your character. It's a poor design choice to force your players to trudge through a boring mode so that they can better succeed in the more fun game mode. Please change this back to the way it was!Perhaps the biggest feature of this ""remake"" is the introduction of achievements, but half of them are predictable, ""complete chapter 1 of quest mode"", ""complete chapter 2"", type achievements. There's also one achievement which is particularly irritating for completionists like myself-- the ""no damage"" achievement. You now earn a star for each Quest mode level you complete without taking damage, and you have to collect one from every level to get the achievement. Sounds simple, right? Not when your character now moves at 80% of the speed they used to, your success on a level is heavily dependent upon which gun drops from the first monster, and the poor level design is such that monsters sometimes spawn right on top of you (this was rarely an issue in the original). This achievement also goes against everything the original was about: wading into mobs of aliens like a badass, and shrugging them off as you blow them away. To actually get every star for this achievement, you would have to restart your game hundreds, if not thousands of times. Meanwhile, you have to play the game as a super perfectionist SHMUP where you die instantly, rather than the messy, Smash TV style slaughterfest it is meant to be.Lastly, the UI...I don't know why they decided to change this. In the 2003 game, your health and ammo were shown in the top left corner, in a bar with a black background. You could clearly see how much health you had, and how much ammo you had remaining in your clip. In this remake, they moved it to the aiming reticle, converting the health to a very small blue circle around you, and the ammo to a blue number next to the crosshair. While this does mean you don't have to shift your eyes away from the battle to see your stats, the tiny graphics and the light blue coloring are a pain to read, and they often blend right into the scenery or your enemies.Unless they patch this game to make it more interesting and closer to the original, I can't recommend it. You will have much more fun with the 2003 version, believe me! And it costs almost the same. I was SO excited about this remake. I wanted badly to love it, and I was looking forward to improvements to the original. Instead, I got a product that is actually worse, and that feels like it was rushed in a month or two for the sake of a money grab.Edit: The devs have made a post in the Steam discussion forums about how they did include a hidden option to unlock perks in the main Quest mode by typing ""grim"" at the menu. However, this doesn't solve the deeper underlying issue, which is the super short Quest levels (and to a lesser extent, the poor level design). The original Crimsonland was about starting weak then growing in power over time. The length of these levels is so short that this feeling of progression has been greatly diminished.  So while it's a band-aid, it doesn't fix the actual cause.  This feature (one that shouldn't be hidden, btw) also doesn't make up for the generally poor production values and other issues, such as the unclear UI.Edit 2: typos			"

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  CrimsonlandDeveloper:  10tons Ltd.Publisher:  10tons Ltd.Genre:  Top-down ShooterGeneral ImpressionCrimsonland is a 2014 reboot of a very good arcade game released 11 years prior. The top-down shooting mechanics are complemented by pleasant graphics and a surprisingly large arsenal. So you will never complain that this title got boring fast. It actually provides enough fun and diversity, that even its “story mode” is enjoyable. The titular sanguinary gore is as always, a sight to behold. The only flaw I could find to this game, is the difficulty which scales wildly and can push towards rage quitting even a Buddhist monk.  Throw in a co-op mode plus a complex perk system and you have yourself one of the best top-down shooters in recent memory. Strong Points+ Interesting graphics and gameplay mechanics.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Unbalanced difficulty.Rating 8/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways and Kool Kids Klub.

												I played quite a lot of the original Crimsonland and while the updated graphics and new perks are appreciated, for me the main reason to play was always the survival mode. And in this revamped version it just isn't that much fun because the usual game lasts only around 6 level-ups. This is not enough to work towards any consistent perk+weapon set-up. In the original you could always try new combinations and you felt like they really mattered, but here? After reaching level 6 or 7 I am always overwhelmed no matter what I try and my only hope is to keep on hitting power-ups like plasma overload or fire bullets.This is another problem, fire bullets used to enhance the weapon you use but now they are almost like a weapon of their own. The same goes for the plasma power-up that is new. This means that in the end it doesn't matter much which weapon you use, because it will soon be too weak anyway and your only hope are the power-ups that replace your weapon.The Quests felt like good old Crimsonland (once I enabled perks in the menu) but the Survival mode is really inferior to the original one.

												I did play the original and I really like the fact that the game has been moved to HD format. I played a hell out of it and I think it is safe to say that story only begins after the campaign has been finished. Survival is addicting as it only can be.Before you'll read the rest of the review please bare in mind, that I like this game, so don't get too negative image from upcoming sentences. It's just thera are some problems that will start bothering you after 15+ hours in the agme. If you don't intend to play that long, stop reading and just buy it, especially for local coop.Unfortunately game tends to be a bit annoying. After a while, I know which guns and perks will work and which will not. Since it is all random it may (and it repeatedly will!) screw you over. I'd like to explore more exotic guns and perks combinations, but the game simpli will not let me - because it is all random.In the end I was hoping for a little bit more - like a mode with a bit of control over gun drop, or mechanic (perk?) that would allow it. Also, I think there should be sandbox mode since a lot of perks are not well described and also a lot of stuff doesn't work together at all (e.g. rockets don't seem to apply the poison bullet effect).Overall, I think the game is great, but longevity is crippled by lack of improvements compared to the original game.

												Crimsonland was originally released back in 2003 and despite not being overly popular, was well loved by those who played it. And now, more than ten years later it is once again hitting the metaphorical shelves and coming to steam and PS4.Crimsonland offers several ‘survival’ modes and a whole bunch of quests to play through. Quests are short challenges where you will need to kill all enemies without dying. Despite being so simple in their rules, quests vary a whole bunch due to the weapons you are given and the enemy types you need to defeat. Monsters vary from zombies to spiders, lizard-men to aliens but all want to eat your face equally as much. Enemy movements, speed and attack patterns are all different and have unique abilities.Also you have a whole bunch of weapons at your disposal which are gradually unlocked as you proceed through the main quests. A lot of the time you start off with just the pistol and can collect new weapons dropped by enemies, but some quests give you additional firepower to begin with.Power-ups and perks play a large part in your survival. Perks are – like weapons – unlocked through completing quests and grant you many different effects such as increased evasion of enemy attack, faster shooting, more power, and more experience points that in effect give you more perks. There are some very interesting perks that make your choice very difficult, like a 50/50 perk that either gives you a whole bunch of experience points, or just kills you outright.After a short while the battlefield will become coated in blood and littered with monster corpses; hence the title. Depending on how good you are at dodging and how quick you are at killing, your screen very slowly becomes more crowded until you have nowhere left to run and get swarmed by various species of monsters. Crimsonland is one of those very simple games that is very easy to pick up and play, but extremely difficult to master. Everyone who plays it will have their own idea of the best perks to pick, their favourite weapons and their own tactics in how to deal with certain enemies. Crimsonland may have roots in a 10 year old game, but this remake proves itself a worthy successor.			"

												Important notice: contrary to what people think, there is an option to play the game on quest mode with perks. Just pause the game while playing a mission on quest mode and type the word ""grim"" (without quotes). This must be repeated everytime you launch the game.I've played this game for many hours on my phone (there the perks option is not hidden) and had lots of fun, and I had an even better experience on my pc, as it is a lot easier to play the game with a controller. This is a really nice top-down shooter with very cool perks, great weapon variety and different game modes that you unlock as you play the quests.			"

												Here's all the bad things about Crimsonland HD:- You still have to play the campaign to unlock all the fun toys in Survival mode- The campaign is pretty much an extended tutorial that goes on way too long. If you can still grab a saved game off the Internet and plug it into your copy, not only will you get to play the real Crimsonland but you all get all those mad cheevos.- The game itself has been slightly changed, so that enemies spawn outside the map, the game has you choose a perk on the spot rather than let you choose one at the time you want, no perks in the campaign... seemingly minor changes, but they affect the game in subtle ways. I don't mind it so much, but hardcore veterans might not like these changes.- No Typ'o' Shooter mode. Booooooooo.Despite all these flaws, I love this new iteration. This is the top-down murder simulator that's been rocking people's faces since its freeware and retail releases in the early 00's. This is the game where you run slowly with big guns and destroy as many monsters in as gory a fashion as you can manage before you get murdered to death by the never-ending horde.Get this and get your ♥♥♥♥ing face rocked like it's 2003 all over again.

Updated and definitely more majestic rëvjúCrimsonland, now actually Crimsonland, with perks in Quest Mode! \o/Once upon a time, before we had Nation Red, the jolliest ""run around topdown and kill stuff"" video game known to humanity was Crimsonland. Then came Steam, and it brought with it Nation Red in 2009, and it was jolly, but what truly would have been jollier... Crimsonland.Fast-forward to the year 2014, and our cries were heard. The Lord GabeN (or rather the dreadful Greenlight system) brought us Crimsonland on Steam. However, as you can read below, not everything was well in this newfound land of milk and honey... it wasn't the Crimsonland we wanted, nor was it the Crimsonland we deserved. It wasn't even the Crimsonland we needed. In this limbo we suffered, admittedly with enough other games to play in the meantime.With a bang, March 2016 brought with it much-needed game design adjustments, as well as the free addition of 2003's Crimsonland. All the inhabitants of Earth rejoiced, and a time of serenity arrived, such as was not known to them before. And 10tons did this mighty act, that there might be no more evil upon Earth. Now go forth and play this game, dear reader, so that all the alien opponents in it get turned about like pottage in a cauldron. And die. Make sure they die.P.S.: Online coop, please? Please? PLEASE?!-------Previous June 28, 2014 review; FOR HISTORICAL PURPOSES ONLY-------First of all, let me say that indeed the quest mode is LESS JOLLY than it was in the original game. There's no perks there so it's way more of a boring grind than it needs to be. Also, the way the game handles 'reference resolutions' and whatnot is pretty odd.However, there's still arousing Crimsonland gameplay to be found in this 'HD' upgrade.P.S.:  is damn good, play it.P.P.S.: Online coop, please? Please?			"

 Mow down enemies with a variety of weapons and perks A new UI and gameplay update to a top-down classic. I've played countless hours off steam and this game is a must-have for the genre. The new UI is slick and ads cool features like an indicator around your cursor. The gameplay update is probably a good thing and not too different from the original but ultimately disappointing from a nostalgic perspective.  If you lost your copy or you've never played before this game is a good pick up. I'd look on sale though because the currently listed $13.99 seems a little steep.			"

												1. No perks in quest mode? Seriously?Even with the  GRIM  code unlocking perks in quest mode, the length of each level still makes perks very useless. The point of whole game for me is to shoot monsters, gain EXP and grow stronger with perks.2. Telekinisis pulls unwanted weapons. Have you ever seen such a badass guy chased by a small blowtorch and have no where to run before?3. Saving perks such as bandage or breathing room for emergency usage in survival mode is no longer a valid strategy.4. Nests are spawned randomly in survival mode now, which makes the game even more unpredictable. 5. The old version had a larger view range, even larger than this new version with the eagle eye perk (or whatever name the perk is called, i can't remember exactly).Sorry 10tons, but playing the new Crimsonland just make me wanna play the old version more and more.(sorry for my poor english, it is a second language for me.)

												These kind of games are admittadly my guilty pleasure games. Yeah, they are fairly simple and dumb, but they are really fun.I do recommend Crimsonland, but if you don't already have Neon Chrome, just go get that instead/first. It's from the same devs and it's like they took Crimsonland and built a roguelite around it. Totally addicting.Essentially, with Crimsonland, you are simply fighting off waves of enemies. There are tons of perks and powerups and guns and one-off weapons. It all feels really satisfying, and has good controller support. All the right options are there too. I was like 'I don't feel like holding the shoot button down anymore', and I went into options, and *boom* they had a solution for that problem.Do I think it's worth full price? Not so much. I finished the game on easy in less than four hours. I got my fill, and although there is still a bunch more content, it's starting to get pretty difficult. It was fun, though.			"

												Its hard to thumbs down this game as its still a good game.Its just that for an update to a classic its terrible. The original didnt look as good, but this update just ruins several key gameplay mechanics, while slapping a fresh coat of paint on it.The reason everyone liked the original was because of the gameplay, even at its release the original was a pretty ugly looking game that played beautifully which is ultimately what matters.Its pretty obvious that it has been dumbed down for a controller friendly playstyleWhile this still has enough of the original in it to be a pretty good, fun game, honestly just play the original instead of this watered down version.If the developers just added a ""classic mode"" toggle in the options which reverted the changes to the perks (specifically telekinesis), put perks back in campaign, basically an option to play a 100% faithful port of the real game with the new improved graphics (which I'm ambivalent on, its not really important for me.), I would gladly give it a thumbs up.Edit (March 2016):Well the devs delivered. They fixed every single thing I had a problem with.Also they gave me what I really wanted all along: The original Crimsonland on Steam. And they gave it away for free as part of the deal along with the remake. I can finally play the original on steam, to add to the couple of hundred hours I have put into it over the years.Now I can heartily recommend this game.			"

If you did not, you should still play this!Top-down shooter with main quest mode and several other game modes (including one hidden game mode). Multiple weapons to choose from, various powerups, and a roguelike element of levelling and 'perks' - playthroughs of levels are very short, so can be played even if you only have a few minutes to spare (as opposed to dedicating several hours just to progress, like some other games).Only downside is that if you want to play multiplayer, its local co-op,Would be 10/10 if included steam-based multiplayer.

												Every bit as fun as the old tech demo I loved ten years ago.  Now in a new and improved form.  Lots of action, lots of guns, lots of enemies, lots of blood on the sand, Crimsonland is a wonderful top-down shooter in the old ""Smash TV"" play style.  Waves of enemies trying to overrun your defenses.Obviously this game has changed a lot since the early versions.  New game mode, different enemies, more weapons, perks, etc. have only enhanced the experience for me.  There's a lot to do.  My biggest complaint would be that the four-player multi-player is local co-op only.  Given that this version is on the Steam platform, it would be amazing if you could hook up with players on your friends list to really go at it.That doesn't make the single player any less exciting however.  There's a lot of things to unlock through the missions (and they appear to have added leveling to the missions, unlike when I was playing it on Steam earlier, which does make the missions a lot more fun as well), as well as several extra modes to choose from.The price IS a bit high for my liking.  I'd probably recommend it more when it goes on sale.  If you do get a chance to pick it up them, don't let it pass you by!			"

CrimsonlandRating: 6/10This game is about destroying aliens, critters and other vermin. You move around the map, which is basically your screen, and have to shoot lots and lots of enemies while picking up perks, weapons, ammo, upgrades and dodging your enemies and bullets. Graphics and sound is ok, controls are ok and tuned well to this kind of gameplay. Levels and missions are a bit dull.The game strongly reminds me of Red Nation, which has zombies instead of these guys and is imo slightly better tuned and balanced. In the end the game is fun to play and keeps you busy for a while.			"

												I came into this having never played the original Crimsonland, and I’ve got to say it’s grown on me. I wasn’t into it at first. You have to unlock everything by playing the quests, which start off pretty easy, pretty slow. The maps are just flat, and all you do is shoot waves of enemies. The graphics have a very strong old Windows game vibe to them and the soundtrack is cheesy as hell. I didn’t think this had anything more to offer.But things start to pick up after the first chapter of the quests. By this point I have a good arsenal under my belt, the quests are more challenging and varied, and I’ve forgotten about my complaints about the flat maps. It’s all about spreading the crimson. Plus the various survival modes start unlocking, which is really the meat of the game. This is an endless mode where you level up and get perks as time goes on. It’s a basic top-down shooter but fun all the same. Good support for both mouse + keyboard or gamepad. You can have up to three friends easily jump in for co-op, so it’s nice to have in your pocket when you need a quick local multiplayer game. Recommend for fans of the genre.			"

												I am 100% about this game...... Which is ironic because I really wasn't sure if I'd like it or not. I'm pretty positive that I got this from a bundle of some sort (HumbleBundle, I'm looking at you), and so kind of tossed it in my never ending backlog pile.  It was buried so deeply, in fact, that I can't even tell you how long ago I added it to my library. What I can tell you is not playing this game sooner was a total mistake.  Although Crimsonland might look like your stereotypical top down shooter, it's far from it.  10tons LTD puts their own spin on Doom-inspired mechanics and themes, and really takes the top-down genre to a whole new level.  Sure, Crimsonland might not be the most graphically impressive game, but trust me - this literally does not matter whatsoever.  The mechanics of the game run as smoothly as a hooker covered in lube.  Or blood. Or something ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)The basis of the game is simple - you start with a pistol (and yes, it totally packs a punch!), and in the early levels you encounter only handfuls of enemies.   As you play, powerups and different guns are dropped (which, by the way, you unlock a wide variety of new ones as you play through levels).  I'm not going to lie - the powerups in this game are absolutely amazing, and range from freezing enemies in ice to freezing time. A certain amount of tactical prowess has to be applied to each different level, as this isn't any simple top down bullet hell.Last but not least, the game modes must be mentioned.  There's a ""quest"" mode in which you unlock all the available powerups, guns, etc.  Annnnnd then there's the ""survival"" modes, which offer a bunch of different and unique flavors of the game.  Amongst these are a typing mode, an actual survival mode, a powerup-only mode, an AK-47 only mode, and a limited ammo mode, as well as a la mode. Wait, no, I lied about the last one. That's for pie and ice cream or something.Gory, gritty, and intense, Crimsonland draws you in with its fast pace, delicious mechanics, and lots of zombies.  If you enjoy top down shooters and don't own Crimsonland, you should.  If you do own Crimsonland, then stop hesitating. It's worth the time investment, I promise.			"

												CRIMSONLAND is the ultimate brainless videogame, a pinnacle in time wasting engineering. Buy the developers of this a beer.Its a top-down, plotless shooter in which you gun down hordes of zombies, spiders and reptilians. You start out with an awful pistol but killing enemies will randomly dropped unlocked weapons with different effects, power, range and accuracy. Some of these weapons require some semblance of thought but there are others like ION LASER CANNONs and HOMING MISSILES and ION LASER HOMING MISSLES where you can just click wherever you see movement and BOOM! Everything dies.To make things even funnier (read: easier) there are also a bunch of powerups that drop, which can do things like make your gun faster and more explode-y, or freeze everything on screen in ice cubes, and- my personal favorite- generate a nuke aoe that just kills everything around you. The killing power of the drops effectively incentivizes throwing strategy to the wind and running in guns blazing to a mob of well over 100 enemies to set off a chain reaction of random projectiles and explosions, killing everything en masse. There is NO strategy involved, and barely any skill at that, but HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥its so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun! Like a triple layer enchilada full of meat, cheese and cheese-stuffed meat, CRIMSONLAND adds even more chaos with ""perks"" that tie into a leveling system. Having fun generating large aoe windmill projectiles? Well, you can also have a perk that randomly shoots bullets in all directions every time you reload! Things getting a little close for comfort? You can make your body poisonous so that any monster that attacks you dies!The developers were courteous enough to add extra modes and such, like a mode where you rely only on powerups and a regular survival mode. There's also probably the closest thing to skill-based gameplay in the mode where you're only alllowed a shotgun and then swamped with an enormous horde on either side. Holla @ my high score on the leader boards (its somewhere in the 4000s!!)This is a really fun game overall. Hours of replayability in the campaign alone (two unlockable difficulties) and tons of different ways to play it. Video games do not actually need to be thought provoking to be fun. Score one for FUN and THE SECOND AMENDMENT, you liberal arts school hipster trash!			"

												Crimsonland is an awesome game, and so are the devs.I've been playing Crimsonland since it came out in 2003 (over 10 years ago!) and it is still as much fun today as it was back then. This HD remake has everything I loved about the original Crimsonland and more.Yes, there are changes from the original version, but I feel that these were in good taste. One of the biggest changes I've noticed is that telekinesis no longer lets you selectively pick up powerups. Instead, it pulls all nearby powerups to you.Additionally, Typ'o'Shooter is nowhere to be found. This was one of my favorite modes and I REALLY hope that it gets brought back in an update.The gameplay is as insane as it was in 2003, if not moreso. There are so many enemies on the screen sometimes that it's hard to comprehend, and yet the game never skips a beat. The monsters now gib when you kill them, and this effect looks really great.Although online multiplayer would propel Crimsonland to new levels of awesomeness, the couch co-op is a ton of fun. I just tried it for the first time with a couple friends and we had a blast. The game scales the difficulty based on how many players there are, so be prepared for even more carnage.All in all, this is mostly the same game it was back in 2003 but with updated graphics and a few (good) tweaks here and there. As a player of the original Crimonsland, I highly recommend this game to fans and newcomers alike. Speaking of which; if you've never played Crimsonland, do youself a favor and buy this game right now.			"

												I've been playing Crimsonland pretty much since its original release, and it was a total time killer at the time. Obviously, I was quite hyped when I heard about the updated version on Steam. And I have to say that I am quite disappointed with it. The HD graphics are just... meh. Sure, it is in high resolution, and new level backgrounds look nice, but everything else looks like garbage from year 2000. Really, the old version just had better overall design. The new monster graphics are ugly, the weapon icons are beyond any recognition, and the new UI is not just ugly, but it is also less usable. It is virtually impossible to determine how much of your Shield is left when surrounded by enemies, and it is also very hard to determine the exact time left in reloading (why not just leave the clear and accurate ""clock"" from the old version?).The game is now released on many platforms. Usually, there is nothing wrong with that, but for Crimsonland it meant that some content was removed because it was unusable on consoles. I really miss the Typ'o'Shooter mode, and some perks like Pyrokinetic and Evil Eyes. Speaking of perks: the new Telekinetic is just garbage. Instead of allowing you to hover the crosshair over the powerup and wait for a few seconds, ALL powerups are now gravitated towards you even when you really don't need that. Ever wanted to lose the game because a mysterious force made you pick up the Blowtorch? Well, now you can. Say thanks for consoles for one more butchered PC game.I was also really disappointed by having perks disabled in Quests mode by default. Sure, one can say it is more challenging that way, but I've always perceived Quests as an extended tutorial for Survival mode, where player unlocks the perks and tries them out. Without the perks, the difficulty becomes just absurd on Grim, and the luck factor starts to account on your success way more that your skill. Why not just make an achievement for finishing the game without the perks? I believe that'd have been the best of both worlds for both hardcore and usual gamers. Some quite significant changes to the game balance were also made. And while I appreciate the new way Fire Bullets powerup works, I will never understand why rockets weapons are THAT powerful now, and why the almighty Splitter Gun is reduced to a useless garbage when compared to the old one. Still, the balance is better than it was in general, I think.I really dislike new Survival mode. You can barely get 6-9 levels if you are really good (and lucky), and that really limits your chances of survival. The game session is also much shorter now, as monsters gain power and health much quicker than before. I miss the old epic 1+ hour battles.Online highscores are implemented really well and provide a lot of additional info that helps to identify cheaters.In conclusion, Crimsonland is still a fun game. Not as fun as the old version for me, but if you are new to Crimsonland - just wait for the sale and go grab it.			"

												One of my favourite childhood gaming memories, when I found out this was on steam I wept with joy. Pro's-Remake is faithfull to the original in terms of the (excelent) level design in quest mode and all the guns and perks are the same.-I personally love the soundtrack, and the SFX such as gun sounds are excellent. -Gameplay is fun and challenge ramps up at a good pace. Con's-Only one I could find really was that I prefer some of the older models of enemies. But the old version of the game is included so can't complain about the game at all. In short: One of the most underated top down shooters ever. GG.			"

												Crimsonland have like 60-stages campaign, stages that are repetitive, but not mindlessly. Cruising through each almost identical looking level are teaches you the finer points of Crimsonland's brutal risk and reward centric combat, which can in turn be parlayed into its many score based challenges. At the end of each level, you'll unlock a new perk or weapon that can be used while chasing high scores on the leaderboards. You might want to jump right to the leaderboards from the word go, but that'd be a mistake. Everything you need to learn and earn rests in a campaign. This is awesome, since there's a reason to play everything.			"

												In my last two (negative) reviews, I felt like I was endlessly banging on about repetitive gameplay. Thank you then, 10tons, for proving that repetition doesn't need to result in monotonous, stale gameplay. Just monotonous, stale writing from me.Crimsonland is a simple game. A topdown arcade shooter fending off hordes of enemies with all the old-school trimmings: weapon pickups, score modifiers, bonus powerups, and generally being pretty bloody difficult. I assumed that I'd pick it up for a few hours, get bored fairly swiftly and face a bit of a grind to reach the end of the game. Surprisingly, despite my general disdain for wave-based shooters and zombies, this didn't happen.There are two chief game modes - Quest is the 'story' mode, with sixty missions varying in difficulty and enemy types, and the progression through the game felt fairly natural. It's worth saying that this mode DOES have perks; in all game modes, you unlock perks within each level as you gain experience via slaying and wanton destruction. In earlier versions of the game, they weren't present, but have since been patched in. The perks and weapons that you unlock are varied and random, which lends plenty of replayability to each mission. One run you might open up with a Gauss Shotgun and absolutely massacre the opposition, and the next you'll be sprinting away wielding your piddly Blowtorch. Add in different enemy types, three different difficulties and the added lure of completing each mission without being hit, and there's plenty of content there.Survival Mode is the other chief enterprise, and other modes come under this banner too, as you unlock them. This is a true arcade experience - you're just out to live as long as you can, and take as many abominations as possible with you. It gets very difficult very quickly, and you'll need to be more than just a decent shot to survive. Strategically strafing around the compact map towards powerups is a must, otherwise you'll be cornered and devoured before you know it.Ultimately, the visceral gameplay is what underpins everything, glues it together. The visuals and audio are bland, dull, functional; the story nonexistent,  But it's damn fun to use all the different weapons, to repeatedly (but not mindlessly) butcher wave after wave of meatbags. I found myself wanting to come back to play a few more rounds, just for the satisfying feedback I got from using the weapons - I feel like the sound effects must have played a decent role in this.It isn't perfect, and it won't be for everyone, but Crimsonland is as fun as hell. Hardcore and Grim difficulties await you beyond the main quest, and you even get the original Crimsonland (dated, but still fun) to boot. Pick it up at 75% off or better, and you're golden.			"

												#####35.3 hours playtime as of release of review. This review is for game version 1.2.0, and may not accurately reflect the current state of the game.##### Overview Crimsonland is an action-packed top-down twin-stick shoot-em-up. You, a single human (or more if playing co-op, which is even more fun),  must face off against thousands of bloodthirsty enemies at once. With the aid of game-changing perks and screen-shaking weapons, you will conquer the levels, only to do it all again on the next difficulty up. And after that, there's an impressive variety of unique survival modes to hone your skills. Crimsonland is one of those games where a level may take 5 minutes, but a gaming sessions last hours. Components Visuals - Crimsonland 2014 (which has been updated so it's now a 2016 version) is an impressive overhaul of the freeware game Crimsonland. The graphics are scrumptiously HD and there's delicious new graphical effects. Killing the hordes of the enemies results in juicy crimson splatters, which permanently stain the environment. The permanent splatter and corpses allow for an incredible aftermath experience that most games can't even fathom. The glowing plasma is splendid and the ion weapons are stunning. The glows and explosions and colourful effects all add up to make a visually pleasing experience. Amidst all the effects, the actual graphics quality though is fairly mediocre to today's gaming standards. The background environments are vast but bare and bland, and the enemies are uninspired and indistinctive. The visuals of Crimsonland play a vital role for the action, providing a colourful experience, but still lacks in quality.Audio - The audio in Crimsonland is awesome. As soon as you start the game, you're greeted with the rock (I don't know genres, but I'm sure it's rock) music in the main-menu. The music is intense and gets the blood pumping, puting you in the mood for the massive hectic slaughtering of the impending onslaught. The sound effects provie solid feedback, from the gunshots to the projectile impacts. All guns sound unique, which makes them all stand out. However, the explosions lack proper oomf and the avatar's death sound is hilarious. Enemy deaths are appropriately satisfying and do a good job of letting you know you've killed your foe. Overral, the audio aspect of Crimsonland is pretty good.Gameplay - Crimsonland is gameplay-centric. There are many different guns ranging from blowtorches and shotguns to plasma miniguns and missile swarmers. Bonuses drop during gameplay, and these temporarily buff you with speed or fire bullets among others. Beating levels in the campaign unlocks perks and weapons which can drop in any game mode. Contrary to the store page description, there is actually 6 survival modes (the Typoshooter gamemode added in version 1.1.0). Having 6 different forms of survival really improves this game's longevity. However, the classic survival mode is probably the one you will play the most. Crimsonland also includes global leaderboards so you can show off your skills (or your hacks) to the world. This game's massive variety of survival modes is really awesome, and more games should follow in the vein of Crimsonland for this aspect. Survival mode is arguably the prominant feature of Crimsonland, however I believe the campaign is the best bit. The manually crafted levels offer unique scenarios for you to battle through, but even the same level will be a unique experience for different plathroughs. This is due to randomized weapon and bonus drops, and the almighty perk system. Kill enough enemies and you get to pick from 3 perks. They can improve and massively alter the gameplay but they only last for that level. Perks range from standard fire rate increase and reloading time speed, to bearing a contagious disease that slowly kills off enemies. You can get multiple perks per level and there's a massive amount of perks that allow for unique game experiences. Some perks are even multi-tiered, so that means you can get a seperate perk that improves a previous perk. The amount of perks and perk combos means you will be always experiencing new and exciting gameplay styles. Overral, the gameplay of Crimsonland is hell of a lot of fun, and local co-op opens up opportunities for even more fun!Story - N/aFunctionality - Crimsonland has a couple of graphical settings and minimal options. This game is highly optimized and runs very smoothly even with thousands of enemies on screen at once. I am glad to see this game still receive attention even after its initial release in 2014. Overral, Crimsonland is a perfectly functional game. Pros  Perk system allows for unique and interesting combos and abilites A fully fleshed out campaign that can last 20+ hours (especially if you try to beat every level on the hardest difficulty without a scratch, which I succeeded in eventually) 6 unique survival game modes, like the typoshooter where you are required to type the specified words to kill enemies. Stunning visual effects Sound effects for every moment in the game, plus some nice rocking music. Hectic action Cons  Mediocre graphics Fairly repetitive Nothing truly innovative Flat, bland environments Most enemies are identical or similar in behaviour Conclusion If you're looking for crazy top-down shooter that you can play with your friends, then I highly suggest Crimsonland. This game will give you plently of fun and offers many gamemodes for different playstyles.I give Crimsonland a 6.5/10, great hectic fun, but offers nothing substantial or innovative.			"

												I did play the original and I really like the fact that the game has been moved to HD format. I played a hell out of it and I think it is safe to say that story only begins after the campaign has been finished. Survival is addicting as it only can be.Before you'll read the rest of the review please bare in mind, that I like this game, so don't get too negative image from upcoming sentences. It's just thera are some problems that will start bothering you after 15+ hours in the agme. If you don't intend to play that long, stop reading and just buy it, especially for local coop. Unfortunately game tends to be a bit annoying. After a while, I know which guns and perks will work and which will not. Since it is all random it may (and it repeatedly will!) screw you over. I'd like to explore more exotic guns and perks combinations, but the game simpli will not let me - because it is all random.In the end I was hoping for a little bit more - like a mode with a bit of control over gun drop, or mechanic (perk?) that would allow it. Also, I think there should be sandbox mode since a lot of perks are not well described and also a lot of stuff doesn't work together at all (e.g. rockets don't seem to apply the poison bullet effect).Overall, I think the game is great, but longevity is crippled by lack of improvements compared to the original game.

												It's ok but... why?Crimsonland was originally released in 2003. It's cool that it's getting re-worked and distributed on Steam, but srsly, 14 dollars for what amounts to a few new perks and a slight graphical update? Really?! I like that they added an online network mode, but I don't intend on ever playing this with someone else. They have actual games for that. I play this game to relax and kill time while listening to audiobooks. Crimsonland isn't a bad game, it's just... the same as it was in 2003, when so much of gaming has moved on. Risk of Rain and, to a lesser extent, Binding of Isaac feed the same high with much more content and better action, for less money. Maybe Crimsonland will update with some new content, but until then, I'm going to stop playing. Also, their unlock system is terrible.Buy it if you have to to satisfy your nostalgia, I guess. Otherwise, wait until it's a humble bundle or less than $5.			"

												If you're hardcore fan of the old crimson land avoid this remake as plague.New UI just plain sucks, it feels so blunt and useless it's not fun at all.The overburdened cross-hair is not usable, no common place for timers. Digits to figure remaining time. And all for sake of useless hot-seat multiplayer.Not recommended until old interface is brought back at least as the ""GRIM"" option. Oh and i'm not buying Crimsonland 2 until this mess is fixed.UPDATE:Survival mode is now completely wasted. It's possible to get only like 6-7 perks, while  gameplay still relies on bonuses. So if you weren't lucky to get Bonus Magent and Bonus Economist just restart. In old CL bad random perks were affecting you in like 10% of games, now they do in 99% as most of them are worhless. This game is pathetic.			"

												The game itself is good as everyone saying on their reviews, if you got it from cheap bundles (this game is too often included in them). But I have one thing on my mind which overwrote all those good things.On releasing this new version at Steam, the devs removed ""Perks"" - powerful abilities which you can obtain by killing enemies - from main quest mode. Of course this is just a challenging move which every developers wanna try, and this time it made quest mode standing in another good balance. Yeah it's great.But the problem is, the dev have left an option to enable those perks, while you can achieve any achievements with it on. And hid it like a cheat command, but wrote its method by themselves on forum.Now, one player tried to achieve something difficult without perks, but didn't make it by his own and searched threads for tips.Then he found many people saying:""Nah it's too easy""""This perk is useful: ~~~""""The other stage was much difficult, since I couldn't use perks""He even found some people saying ""Woohoo! I got this achievement by using these perks!"".I wonder why the dev hid it like a cheat while saying it is ""an option""? And why allowed to unlock achievements saying ""without perks are balanced and recommended""? You should get noticed if it is a fair option to enjoy the game, and if the game is balanced without perks and enabling it would be like cheating, the results should be separated from normal play.Now, no one is talking about without-perks playing on forum and achievements become worthless, though newcomers trying to achieve them without perks.

We are dispatching you and up to three other patriots into the fray. Rest assured, you will die. But fret not, for we have decided in our infinite wisdom to give you a pistol with almost unlimited ammo. How much ammo you ask? Well we don't expect you to live past five minutes so about that much ammo. We understand pistols are not really great for murdering anything beyond tiny children and the mentally handicapped, so we've abducted several of those unamerican ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and performed surgery on them, implanting marginally better weapons and useful gadgets to aid you in your mission. Why the hell didn't we give you those in the first place? Do you hate freedom and want this great nation to fall prey to those who would do us harm and force everything we have worked for to be destroyed because you wanted to ask questions instead of go out there and murder the crap out of them?     If you love your country you will buy this game and proceed to murder until all you can think about is how you can stop the unstoppable tide of freedom haters from taking over our country.

												NOTE: I have not played the original and am not comparing them accordingly.The Good: Unique challenges, very stable, very responsive, many unique perks, many weapons, challenging but not to the point of being absurd, top down works well for it.The Bad: By default perks aren't given to you in story mode as implied, weopons can be luck of the draw which sometimes shafts you.Top down horde shooter that's made very well and provides a great experience			"

												Crimsonland is a very classic top-down arena survival shooter from late 90's (I seem to have a faint memory of playing the game back then) so it has come a long way since then.I am reviewing the Linux version of the game as this is the one I played. the hardware requirements are ridiculously low, I played this on an old Acer AspireOne D150 netbook (1.60GHz Atom, 1½GB RAM, Intel GMA945) and it ran like a charm, even on a weird 1024x600 resolution.The gameplay is simple. You control a guy from a top-down perspective and you have a crosshair you aim at different enemies and you shoot them before they overrun you. The game can get very hectic at times but there are weapon pickups and perks that give you a fighting chance against the onslaught of monsters.The weapons are pretty standard, with some sci-fi ones added in to the mix, ranging from a sub-machine gun to a swarm missile launchers and plasma cannons. They do a good job in being varied while still being simple and useful.The perks are pretty fun, there is a wide variety from faster experience gain to faster reload or having a poison cloud around you that damages enemies and other quirky things. You get a choice of a few random perks every time you ""level up"".This game is deceptively addictive. It is easy to pick up and  play and it will keep you entertained for a little while. It is also good game for an older machine or a netbook to pass a few minutes on a break.The €6.99 asking price is a bit steep, but If you can get this during a sale, get it. You will not regret it, it is well worth picking up for a couple of euros.			"

												Great game! Get it!!! I haven't tried the Local CoOp yet, will update the review once I am done.First of all, this game isn't Serious Sam or an equivalent to it. Its old-school arcade top-down shooter. If you have played Alien Shooter (1 or 2), and you liked it. Then you will LOVE this one!Its such a great time-killer. I am sure that it will be twice as fun with Local CoOp. Can't wait to try it out on CoOp.Pros-* Many game modes- Quest Mode (10 levels in 6 worlds), Survival Mode (has 5 sub-types).* Great Sound track* Many many many Weapons to kill enemies with* Many many many types of aliens (Spiders, Beetles, Zombies and many more!)Cons-* No story. Well who cares? Its a twin-stick top-down shooter! Not really a con.* You can't use Perks in the game, unless you circumvent it. (more at bottom..)* Can't choose the weapon that you wish to youCircumventing to enable Perks in Quest Mode:Press Escape key, once in menu trype ""GRIM"" and you should get a dialog box, just tick ""Enable Perks in Quest Mode"" and you are done.Everytime you level-up you will get to choose a perk!In its current state, I'd say 8/10! Buy it!			"

												I absoloutley LOVE this game! Here are the reasons why. For starters, as you probably know this is a top-down shooter, and I am not normally in to those, but this game is far more. It has bigger difficulties that you actually give a crap about doing (becasue of new weapons and perks). Also, A crapload of weapons and perks you can unlock during the course of the story which is super long! Plus there are like six modes of survival, which are all uber fun. In all if you like top down shooters... get this, if you don't like top down shooters... get this. If you don't like Crimsonland... you and me got a problem. ******Spoiler for a easter egg****** When you are in the pause menu during a story mission type *grim* and activate perks.			"

												First of All, if you ever played the old Crimsonland and even kind of like buy this game. The remake lost nothing of the past game but improved here and there. New modes, a much more fun typ-o-shooter, better graphics....For all the newcomers, you like Zombie genre? Interested in Alliens who want to rip you apart? Haunted by Giant Spiders? Well you got 'em all in Crimsonland. In a top down look, you run around, shoot in every direction, get some bonuses, grab some weapons... Basicly this game ideal to blow some steam. I regularly open the game spend half an hour and forget about it for a week. Because my roommate had the top score in type-o-shooter I learned to type with 10 fingers. This is a game mode where you kill monsters coming at you by typing the text above the monsters. (Remember astrotit ;))I bought the game because I spend so many hours in the old version. If you get it below 5$ buy it			"

												Nostalgia driven purchase. still as fun as the old game (y)I'll just list out all the things that can be improved for future update (Played with Mac OSX) :- the perk popup window that show up everytime player level up is really breaking the immersive. it's better to use right click to open perk window like the old game so people can upgrade the perk anytime without feeling forced to upgrade everytime player level up- maybe it's better to put the powerup timer not in the cursor but in static place like in upper left of screen like the old game. it looks pretty but it's hard to follow the number because the cursor moving around so quickly- the killer wave you get from when you level up, I don't remember if it exist in the old game, I think it's unnecessary and it's kinda ruined the level design of some level that need some strategic shooting . Like that one level which you get gauss gun as starter and the enemies are queueing linearly around you, they got killed by the level up wave and I can easily complete the level. I remember this was one of that hard level which you need precision because the enemy can one hit kill you- please enable windowed modestill love it nevertheless (y)			"

												Beside being a nice twin stick shooter with balancing issues, Crimsonland is first and foremost a serious statement about the opportunity of ripping audio samples out of pornographic material.Seriously, the player's death screams (plural, as they made more than one!): they would make John Holms blush! After 20 times of hearing your character ""deeply enjoying"" his death, you become a master of ""Esc pressing and restarting"", just to avoid that part.Putting the more erotic aspects of the game aside, it's a very enjoyable shooter with a lot of replayability, coop mode, and a number of modes. It doesn't properly ""shine"" in anything, but everything is from adequate (music, graphics) to very good (gameplay, weapons).The only major complaint that takes the 5th star out of the title, is balancing: there is one single level that literally *ruins* the game (2.10, Spiderdroids) and is so difficult, that finishing it in normal mode is more difficult than all other levels on all difficulty settings combined (and let's not even speak about the possibility of getting the ""no scratch"" achievement...). Very recommended, especially for the price tag.OOooouuuuuaaaarrrrhhhhggghhhhhhhhh....aaaaahhh.... I'm dead.			"

												If you enjoy playing top-down heavy action packed games that require very little effort to play, but are still loads of fun, then this is the game for you.The game doesn't really have a story line, other than progressively going deeper into an alien infested world until finally completely destroying them. In short, the game focuses more on the gameplay than the engaging story. To give a short summary of the game: begin level; kill monster for first weapon; kill more monsters for pickups such as more weapons and boosters; kill enough to level up and upgrade permanent perks; repeat process until level is completed (unless you play survival mode).This version is a bit different to the original. One of the differences being the installment of achievements which if I might add is really difficult to get at times, but I managed to do it. The playability in my opinion is very high as games don't usually last very long but is still fun enough in order to come back and improve on your last score. Also, the game offers a multiplayer feature which I haven't tried out yet, but I understand it only works on LAN, so don't bother buying it for a buddy in hopes you can play online.Because I love these kinds of games, I definitely recommend this to anyone that enjoys the same kinds of games, or who is willing to give this game a shot.

												Crimsonland is a frantic top-down twin-stick shooter with multiple modes and dozens of unlockable weapons and perks. I found many of the weapons unbalanced, on both ends of the spectrum; I loved using some of them and relied on them whenever I could, and others I avoided at all costs because they felt worthless. On several occasions, I nearly ragequit because some of the levels seemed cheap and impossible to clear without the right (lucky) weapon drop. (To be fair, it's also possible I'm just bad.) Regardless, that didn't stop me from putting in 16 hours, completing all six chapters of the quest mode, and unlocking all of the perks. It was frustrating at times, but more often than not, Crimsonland hit that sweet spot between challenging and frustrating that kept me coming back and giving each level ""just one more try.""			"

 Crimsonland; A cult classic, now better than ever The review turned out longer than I expected, so I will include a summary of my thoughts at the bottom.Like alot of people, I remember Crimsonland from back in the day. I first encountered it on a demo disk that came with a magazine I used to buy. With only the first chapter of the Quests mode being playable, I remember replaying it over and over again. Some years later, I discovered the Internet and what it had to offer, so I managed to obtain the full version of the game, finally being able to play through the entire thing. Rediscovering it again on Steam was quite a surprise, with a new look and a tempting price tag. However, having found out that perks are no longer present in the Quests mode, I decided against buying it. Forward a year later, and what do you know: Crimsonland is on sale, 80% off. Not only have re-added Perks into the Quests mode, but the game now comes with the classic version from 2003. It was a steal at the discounted price and I immediately bought it. A few weeks have passed since then and after playing through the game and going for some of the achievements, I'm happy to say that Crimsonland has not only retained everything that made it great (and a tiny bit frustrating at times), but has also managed to slightly improve upon it with a couple of new weapons, perks and game modes. The game has two main game modes, Quests and Survival, both with their own gameplay elements. Quests mode is separated into 6 chapters, each one having 10 levels. There is no story that follows these, but they're all thematically different from one another. They also have replay value as you unlock difficulty levels and achievements. You start each level with a pistol, and pick up different weapons and powerups as the level goes on. You can't however switch between weapons you've picked up, but are instead stuck with the last one you did. Kills earn you XP which can be used to select perks that can help you through the current level, as they reset at the end of each one. Beating a level will unlock a new Survival game mode, weapon or perk. Everything you unlock will then be present in Survival mode, as well as future Quests levels.Speaking of the Survival mode, it is devided into 6 other modes, each with its own set of rules. For example, Blitz is just like Survival, but sped up, with an increased number of monsters and powerups. Nukefism on the other hand has leveling and weapons disabled, allowing you to only use powerups if you want to survive. All  game modes provide a good challenge. The powerups and perks feel usefull and make a notable difference. Some weapons may seem underpowered, but each has its benefits in a specific situation. However, the randomess of it all, accompanied by some difficulty spikes may give the feeling that the game relies more on luck rather than on skill.Even though all of the game modes are playable co-op with up to three other players, and each survival mode having its own leaderboard, there is no online play. The sound and graphics present the game well, but are lacking in some departments.The game has a very clean look to it, so you'll be able to tell whats happening at any given time. Over a hundred monsters can be on the screen, with particles from your weapons, perks and powerups flying all over the place, the bits and blood of the monsters you killed clearly visible on the terrain for the remainder of the level. All this while the game manages to run smoothly all the way through.Although the graphical update of the new version boasts has plently of advantages, I feel as they didn't go as far as they could in some, and at the same time, could have toned it down in other places. The only purpose for the maps may be to provide a background for all the carnage to happen on, but they could have greatly benefited from a bit more detail, which would add to the atmosphere as well . Something I feel the classic version did better, as it had more robust visuals and a muter color palette . All of the weapons unfortunately still share the same model, something worth changing that carries over from the classic version. I also cosnider the look of menus in the classic version superior to those in this one, which look bland and generic, as if they were ripped straight out of a mobile game.  You can take a look and see for yourself , as you get the classic version as well with your purchase. The soundtrack isn't that memorable for the most part, but some of the songs, like the menu theme and some of the level music, are badass to say the least. Thankfully, the soundtrack also comes separate from the game so you can listen to it at your leisure. In conclusion:  Despite some slight missteps and wasted opportunities in remastering the visuals, Crimsonland retains its best qualities and adds onto them with new game modes, weapons and perks. It still looks and sounds good, while running and playing out with no issues. Some difficulty spikes and randomness in weapon drops and perk selection can make certain levels frustrating, but other than that the game is a blast to play and tempts you into getting all of the achievements. You can play co-op with up to 3 other people locally, as opposed to just 2 in the classic version.There are leaderboards for the Survival portion, but the games lacks online multiplayer. Thankfully. 10tons has announced that they are currently working on three new top down shooters, so we can hope that Crimsonland 2 is one of them. The time for a sequel is high, just as the score and the recommendation.  I rate Crimsonland an 8.5/10  "

												I've only played a minute and I already know I like it.It's one of those games where the movements and commands are so smooth that you would still play, at least for a bit, even if there were no enemies and no challenge - just exploration. The core mechanics are well done.Now add guns, shooting still feels super smooth. Then add enemies and you get a great game.Good for laptops too by the way, easy to run.I'm not a ""graphics are so important!"" type of guy but the graphics look great and really help with immersing you in the game. Sound effects as well. Animations are smoothI love those types of top down shooters but there aren't many that are good. This one is very good.			"

Almost 12 years later they should have fixed that ^_^However, the price is a ripoff. Just wait until it is reduced more than -50%. Then recommended :)			"

												You've probably already played a hundred different top down horde shooters for free on various flash game websites already. Or at least you have if you were in middle school when I was. So paying the full price for this game would just be silly. It doesn't do anything new or exciting enough to justify a full purchase and is mindless entertainment at best. That said, given I just stumbled across this in my library after purchasing some bundle or other, I had a lot of fun with it for a while. It's nothing revolutionary but it has tons of levels, guns, and powerups and is just dumb and satisfying. There's local coop and online leaderboards and generally a lot of features, plus the list of weapons is huge and inventive. All in all I consider it the best version I've played of that shooty thing I used to play on my middleschool lunch breaks, but not one I would recommend shelling out for directly.			"

												I love twin stick shooters, but this one has a really annoying way of interrupting the action to let you pick from perks. Now perks are fine, and fun, but they continually interrupt the action, and in a game like this it is very jarring. For example you are shooting and moving and thinking ""I'll get these guys up there, then I'll head up and left shooting down at..."" and STOP, up pops a choice of perks, you pick one, it goes away and ""where was I?"". If they were less frequent it would be less annoying, but I've had them pop up seconds apart. Other than that it seems like a competent, but not great shooter.			"

												Paint the ground red.With murder.Amazingtitle, it took a LONG TIME for it to reach steam, but it is totally worth all that wait for that. And it goes on bundles pretty often.There are other titles similar to it, like the 3d  Nation Red, but this is the best of its type. There is also an android version, but honestly it controlls pretty badly with the virtual sticks. Also, a ps vita version, I have not tried that. I  should probably also get it there when it is on sale one day.It is old. It is not particularly pretty, but damn if it is not satisfying to mow down the endless waves.			"

Basic InfosGameplay lengh: 7 hours to finish the 120 main quests but otherwise as long as you want - It doesn't have a story, or even any purpose other than to rack up points during late game. It's much more of an arcade focused game akin to very early 90's arcade games of this kind.Required skill level: mediumSPECIAL WARNING: As already shown in the screenshots on the storepage this game includes Spiders and a lot of them in various sizes and shapes and from there it even get worse. You should refrain from playing this game if you suffer from arachnophobia.About this gameThere we have it, the amazing game Crimsonland. I still remember this game as a Freeware title in 2001 before it turned into shareware. And wow, the game inproved massively over the course of 13 years. This game was inspired by the, back then, famous game ""Phobia II"" in 1998, which in turn is very similar to the game Threat in 1995 and Smash TV in 1990, but Crimsonland made this subgenre of frantic top down shooting popular and very well deserved so. Unfortunatly I forgot about it after 2007 and thought it would never see the light of day again. Until recently...So what is it all about? It's really simple to explain. You are a Manly Space Marine with the important mission to kill various types of Aliens, Zombies and Bugs. It sounds like childish fun on paper and thats exactly what it is. It's called Crimsonland because you basically paint the ground blood-red from pulverizing anything that shows up on screen. That basically sums up everything you need to know.GameplayThe core gameplay for this game is very simple. You control a soldier from a very retro-esque top down perspective via the WASD layout and aim and shoot monsters for score. Sometimes, monsters drop power-ups, which you can choose to pick up, or not as you need to conserve them while they're on the ground in order to get the fullest potential out of any of them. Having a strategy on how to progress properly is essential in this game so besides blasting Aliens it requires some forsight and mental preperation of things to come. Often your chances of survival your way to the power-up itself so you can pick it up isn't even big as the ever coming monster waves keep you occupied otherwise.Two of the basic main game modes are a Quest mode, which provides the Player with a set of ""Missions"" where the term only is used in the loosest of senses as the only thing you have to do in each mission is to kill a specific set of monsters until the bar of the upper side of the screen is filled out. It gets interesting however if you like to survive the round without taking a hit since the game at least acknowledges it so you can honor your skills with this game.Being good at Crimsonland gets rewarded with a star and an achievement for survivng all normal missions and this game has some of the most difficult to get achievements I've seen yet, apart from Dustforce. As it requires a lot of partience to be rewarding, only the most hardcore of players may ever see one of the more difficult to get achievements. By completing missions you can unlock new Weapons, perks and Game Modes.The other mode is something that gets unlocked during the first few missions and that is the Survival Mode. Survival mode is the Flesh and Bones of this entire game as this is the game mode where you can get level ups to attain the perks you previously unlocked in the Quest Mode. There is a very well structured On-Line Scoreboard so if you feel competitive you can always try to reach the Top 100. Graphics and SoundTo get straight to the point the graphics feel a little bit dated but I do believe that in this case it seem appropriate given the age of the game of it and how fluid the gameplay is. In terms of art direction I say that it all feels very pleasant to the eyes, as you can already tell from the pictures on the Steamstore for this game.In terms of sound effects this game feels a little bit lackluster and is the worst thing this game has to offer regarding everything else Crimsonland as to offer. Shooting your guns doesn't feel as strong as it should in my opinion and even launching a nuke doesn't feel as good as it should be. However I believe that the Music is pretty spot on given the gameplay as shooting up monsters and Metal seem to go hand in hand with carnage-themed games since Doom 1.VerdictI believe that this game is a fine example on how gameplay throughout the simplier ages of video game design (think about Smash TV or Robotron) can still be this refreshing. Sometimes you just want to shoot some monsters and rack up points with not much else. So if you believe that it's the game for you I hereby highly recommend that you should pick it up even if it isn't on a sale right now, as this is one of the genres finest.Recommended food while playingThe hottest Chili that you can find in order to fire yourself up for the madness that is this game.

												I have been playing this game for about 10 years now, since I first discovered it in maybe 2004-2005. I've completed all 3 difficulties with full hp remaining, solo, of course without cheats.+ Now you can play co-op with 4 players, but only 1 person can play with keyboard & mouse.+ Nice arsenal of weapons. Of course there are many tiers of weapons, but no gun is super weak, just some are more powerful to certain enemies. The new Splitter Gun is difficult to use but it's super overpowered in the right maps.+ Nice diversities of monsters+ Nice perk system. A few are missing from the classic game but it's not that big of a deal.If you are a fan of the top-down shooter genre, get this game, this has been an inspiration for A LOT of newer games.The only negative thing, this game is way too overpriced on Steam.8.5/10			"

(from memory 2 wwas old max) Co-op is local only unfortuantely but this game did right what so many games do wrong 10 years ago and games still are missing the mark.Make the lands crimson, and then even more crimson again, and be amazed at your ability to run on the dead, it top down casually addictive murderathon that is still fun as hell and with the updates, very cool to see. If you like geometry wars, or dual stick shooters, survival games, rpg elements,♥♥♥♥♥♥loads of guns, or call yourself a gamer, you owe it to yourself to play this gem *actual time played, probably hundreds of hours* So glad to see it out on steam too, kudos to the devs :)			"

												This is one of the best top-down shooters I have ever played.A couple of months ago I've learned that 10tons, the developers of the original Crimsonland, are making an enhanced version of the game and are bringing it to Steam (and also PS4). Needless to say, I was very excited. I have played it way back in 2004, and at the time I didn't even have the opportunity to obtain it legally (I live in Russia, and back in 2004 the digital distribution model was unknown to an average Russian gamer). And now, 10 years later, it's a perfect chance for me to thank the developers by buying a copy of a game I really love.The gameplay is self-explanatory and very fun. You've got a gun and countless hordes of monsters on the screen - the rest is up to you. By using different weapons and perks you shoot your way through till you're the last man standing.The highlight of the game for me is the Survival mode. In this mode, you fight against infinite waves of enemies, using perks and weapons unlocked in the main campaign.This edition of the game has revamped UI - personally, I love it - it's nice, clean, and suits the game pretty well.All this also comes with the support of HD resolutions, it's great to finally enjoy the game in 1080p instead of the original 800x600.All in all, it's a classic, modernised and refined for the current generation of gamers and those, who like me, have nostalgic memories of playing this game as a kid :3			"

												Crimsonland probably will not win a price for originality. The main formula of the game is simple: Massacre all the bugs, aliens, zombies and other creatures of the map and while you're at it destroy their hives aswell. It's a formula that has been done in dozens of games. Everytime you beat a level, you either earn a new weapon (30 in total) or a new perk (50 in total) which are suppose to help you ofcourse. Most of the weapons are fun to play with but obviously some are better than others. I did not really care much about the perks, the dev could've just made the creatures more difficult to kill but instead gave you these perks. In my experience the difficulty in Crimsonland was mostly based on sheer luck. Every level you start of with your pistol. The first creature you kill drops a better gun, if you're lucky you gain one of the better weapons which already makes the level a lot easier. Crimsonland also relies heavily on powerups, since they often make the difference of surviving a level. Powerups like: slowmo, frozen enemies, plasma ammo and even a nuke will make the game much easier, sometimes even too easy, especially if you get 6+ powerups next to each other. Graphically, the game looks pretty good for a top-down game, killing hundreds of creatures is satisfying and the game really makes you feel like you're a total badass, even if you're not.Overall, Crimsonland is a solid top-down shooter, It's probably the best game of it's sort right now. Although I believe the game is more about luck than about skill, it's still fun and enjoyable.			"

												Played a lot of the original Crimsonland and indeed there's some nice updates here. But also some things went from good to worse... And for those that are not familiar with the original : If you like killing monsters - a lot of them.. Then this is a game for you :D Go the story mode trough once -> move to Survival and see how loooooooooooong you last.+ Graphics look nice.+ Few new perks & guns.+ Stats.. You got to love the stats.+ More survival game modes.+ Weapon & Perk menus- No powerup menu- Perks menu isn't hover over but open annoying box.- I'd really love to see more stuff (no resolution change option).- No level ups in story mode.- Forced level change perk choosing (used to be : use/pick when you like [TAB]).- Walking feels more sluggish then it used to.- Telekinetic ""nerf"" sucks (the fact that it's grabbing the closest instead where you point).And correct if I'm wrong, but the powerups used to work side by side with the weapons.Fex if you had Ion something, you'd get the boost +the Ion weapons zap effect.Or with a flamethrower you'd get the fire +powerups effect. Oooor Pulse guns pushback effect with fire ammo powerup..			"

That is how you beat the rounds, respawn over and over and wait until you get a gun that isn't useless. That's it, that is all there is to this game.

Simple, bloody and brutal.If you're here because it you played the older version, this one is just as good. Some people brought up 'no perks in quest mode', but that can be changed by typing G-R-I-M in the Esc menu to bring up the option to turn it on,Good stuff..			"

												Saw it on steam. Finger itched, bought without thinking in less than 5 seconds. Then remembered I already have the non-steam version.Doom + Gauntlet (or the action part of Diablo) = Crimsonland. Just must have!(Bought and reviewed on Steam Release day! Yay!!! XD~~~)			"

												It could have been a good game but you'll find that this game has, as we say in the business, a ""difficulty wall"", meaning that all the game is more or less simple untill, out of the blue, you'll encounter a nearly impossible-frustrating level that will lock you there. I'm not talking about a very difficult level, I'm talking about a level that reaquires all the planets to be alinged in order for you to beat it. It's not SKILL hard, it's tedious and frustrating so much that after 500 attemps you are wondering ""what the hell am I doing here?"". It has the same thing in Survival Mode, basicaly impossible to get to level 7 (3, maybe 4 minutes of gameplay). You just can't, the amount of enemies and the lack of firepower will make it just mathematicaly impossible to go beyond level 6 unless, of course, the planets alling and you get the PERFECT combo of weapon/perks/powerups.Another aspect that goes beyond reason is the fact that ALL the monsters (zombies included) have the best targeting system in the world and could easily be integrated in the AA missile for jet fighters, let me explain: the monsters will not point AT you, they will point at your vector, meaning they will go where you WILL BE calculating your speed and their ones, therefor you'll be ALLWAYS surrounded by monsters. What's that? A wonderful life-saving powerup? Let's go get it... but you can't because all the monsters will create a BLOCKADE in front of you because of the aforementioned targeting system, even the zombies, the quintessential STUPID being can collimate with you like the best soldier with Direct Hit.Sorry but no, not worth the money, if it was free I would gladly suggest it to you worning you of the game killing problems... but PAYING for this? No, sorry, no.			"

Short version: 88%Maybe some old fans dislike the changes implemented in the past years, but the fact remains: Crimsonland is still one of the best top-down arcade style shooter games ever released.Long version:Crimsonland was originally released in 2003 on the now-defunct Reflexive Arcade, where it quickly raised to fame and glory among the indie game players. With good reason. It features constant action against a horde of aliens in several game modes (chief among them are the campaign and survival) with a plethora of weapons and special player perks– both which have been expanded over and over throughout the years.Yeah, there is no story, no voice acting, and only a handful of music tracks, but, frankly, they aren’t needed even in the least bit.This version has some controversy among the older players though. Crimsonland started as a simple 2D top-down shooter, but between its original release and the 2014 debut on Steam, the whole engine was remade, along with most of the game modes. Perks and weapons received an overhaul (new ones added, some powerful ones removed or rebalanced), the typing shooter game mode was replaced with some not so original ones, and campaign mode now lacks perks completely.But even though if you miss the über-powerful old telekinesis ability and dislike the number of barely useful new weapons, Crimsonland is still a damn good and fun game to play, one that will probably won’t be replaced for at least another decade.

												I have been playing this game since 2003, it is AWESOME. It's simple, but very fast paced. It is a good ""Trainer"" for many other games. If you can pass this game on the highest levels, you can be good at any other game. It forces you to strategize, think on your feet, split second decisions which can be the difference between a good time and a fast death. I honestly do not understand the negative reviews, this is a must get game. Maybe not at the 15$ CAD price, because it is much over a decade old, but when it's on sale, yes. GET IT.			"

												I first got this game in 2003, and it is the same timeless classic it was then, as it is now. Top-down shooting action, with a highly addictive atmosphere and gameplay style; very reminiscent of Smash TV and Gauntlet.If you enjoyed either of those games from those eras, you'll enjoy this. It's everything Smash TV always wanted to be and more.			"

												The cult classic is back. This time with updated graphics, weapons, perks, and game modes.I was a huge fan of the original and was ecstatic to see it get rereleased on Linux.When it comes to top down shooters, Crimsonland is by far the best out there. Controls are very percise and mappable. The graphics update is beautiful when compared to the original and quite nice for being a 2D game. The interface also got a face lift. Orignially, your ammo count was an image on the top that showed you how many shots you had left. Now, it is a counter above the mouse. I prefer this seeing as I'm mostly looking at the mouse. In the original, any bonus you picked up would give you a count down in the upper left. Now, if the bonus affects your gun (firing rate, fire bullets, etc.) you get a yellow countdown around your mouse. If the bonus affects your character (shield) you get a clock like counter around your health bar (which is also now around the character instead of in the upper left hand corner). There are no countdowns for 2x, Freeze, or Speed bonuses. Some indication would be helpful, especially for the Speed bonus. But, I won't fault them too much on those. Lastly, the perk selector was overhauled as well. Originally, a window would pop up that listed the perks in a vertical list with a discription on the bottom. Now, they are images listed horizontally with the name under it when the mouse is hovered over it and the discription on the bottom and the biggest difference is that in the original you would hit Tab to open the perk selector. In the new version it appears automatically and you are forced to pick something to continue.Some of the weapons updates are nice but I feel that there are too many. While they are nice, since the weapon drops are completely at random you might never get the gun you really need for late game. Also, before the 1.9 patch of the original there was a trick to using the Pulse Gun and using the Angry Reloader perk that just made you dominate the map early on. This was ""fixed"" in 1.9 which was a huge let down in my opinion.I can't really say much about the perk other than telekenisis. This perk was changed heavily. Originally, you would hover your mouse over a bonus for a full second and you would pick it up. This made you have to be looking in its direction, which made it hard if you had enemies behind you. You basically had to stop shooting at them to pick up the bonus or time it so you could position them between you and the bonus to shot them. Now, the closest bonus will move towards you. I actually prefer this new method over the previous. Lets you focus more on the fight and less about trying to pick up the bonus. My only complaint is that I think the longer the bonus is traveling, the faster it should move. If you are running backwards, the bonus will never reach you because you can out run it. Still a better approach, though.They also added a new game mode. Nukefism gives you no weapons and only bonuses to pick up. Very hard game mode which is why the achievement is unlocked when you get 75,000 points in it. Unfortunately, they removed the Typ'o'Shooter game mode which was my favorite. An enemy would appear with a word over it and you would have to type it out to shoot at that enemy. Not only was that a great mode to teach typing but like all things Crimsonland would get progressively harder the longer you lasted. It really made you learn the layout of the keyboard. Typ'o'Shooter is greatly missed.With all of this being said, I feel that the price may be a little bit high considering that the original was only 10 dollars USD in 2004. By no means do I consider this a 14 dollar title, especially when they removed a great game mode and didn't really add anything of a story. When Survival mode will last, at best, 10 minutes before you get overwhelmed by enemies, these quick matches, I feel, makes the 14 dollar USD price tag a little bit much. However, on sale, this is a great buy.The biggest drawback to Crimsonland is that it relies a bit too rmuch on the random factor. I would have loved to see a game mode like Survival but where you can remove, say, 10 weapons and 15 perks from the pool. This would let someone get rid of some of the bad weapons and perks (like the Blowtorch... seriously, the Blowtorch? Why? I'd rather take the Pulse gun over the Blowtorch).Lastly, the Linux port was amazingly done. Performance was as expected. Some reports of reversed X axis on game pads which I believe are fixed as of this writing (or will be fixed soon). I did experience 1 random crash but I think that was caused by something else happening at the same time.If you are a fan of quick match top down shooters, storyless and senseless violence, or simple time killer games, I highly recommend this game. If you were a fan of the original, you might be left with a bad taste, but I wasn't.			"

												What a dissapointment!1- The game balance has changed so badly, it is not enjoyable anymore. The balance of the game has been destroyed and it is not similar to the original, even remotely.2- You can not pick the time when to use your upgrades. This is a huge setback for strategic users of the ""Bandage"". You can not leave it in the list and use it at the time you need it the most. What a let down coming from the coder. What was he thinking?3- In sake of increasing the number of power-ups, the screen resolution has became a ""power up"", so you can see better only if it ends up in your power-up list.There are also some bugs like, right after the ""reflex boost"" if you have a slow fire rate weapon and the fast shoot option is still available, the fire rate is not consistent. This is distracting the focus and you immediately think that you have to seek another fast shooting bonus. As a summary, he made a big mess out of a beautiful game. How things can go horribly wrong for the sake of ""forced improvements""			"

												If you like twin stick shooters, I wholeheartedly reccomend this game. There are a ton of weapons to pick from (albeit some much better than others), perks that change up the gameplay, and 4 player local support. Although the quest mode is short (my first run-through took me about 2 and a half hours), it may as well be the tutorial as it introduces you to every enemy type over time and unlocks all of the weapons/perks for use in survival mode. My particular favorite mode is blitz, which is basically normal survial mode on fast forward.			"

												This game is action packed.  Every level, you shoot giant spiders, aliens, monsters, zombies, lizard... things.While its fun earlier on, you'll quickly begin mashing your controller/keyboard.From the old game to this new updated game, many enemy AIs are more... smarter.  They move in the direction you move, so it becomes difficult, and even impossible to dodge and escape enemies.  An example is 2.10 spideroids.  Spiders keep dividing as you shoot them, and they seem to get faster over time.  Unless you have the Perks enabled cheat on, you'll never beat it without taking damage.Overall, it's a good game... but they should have really done more play-testing to make sure there was a proper balance.  They should have also left the Perks system in the campaign mode, as the game feels like it was designed around it, and by removing it and having it only in Survival mode, it makes campaign mode impossible to win later in harder difficulties.

The three things I can guarantee you with Crimsonland: hoards of mobs, lashings of blood and a colossal arsenal at your disposal. Overall it is an incredibly enjoyable experience that I have no hesitation in recommending to anyone looking for a challenge and trip down memory lane. It won’t appeal to everyone due to its difficulty level and outdated design, but the gameplay is satisfying overall. I personally couldn’t play too many lengthened sessions as it does become repetitive after some time, however the variety in weapons and mobs, not to mention the addition of the various survival modes helps to keep things fresh.

												If you're like me and loved the original Crimsonland (from 2002), then I would NOT recommend this game. Sadly, it is nothing more than a watered down version of the old game. Several key features that made the game great are now missing.- No perks in quest mode. This is HUGE! For some reason 10tons removed perks from main campaign mode. Which basically took all the fun out of the core gameplay. - No weapon switching. You are now only able to have one weapon at a time, which not only limits your fun, but also your ability to win.- No choosing when to take your next perk. There used to be a button for leveling up, which was very handy. It is now gone and instead the player simply levels up immediately via a pop-up menu. Not only does this detract from the overall strategy of the game, but it's also horribly disruptive. It will cause you to lose focus on the action, make mistakes, or even worse: accidentally pick the wrong perk. Because you have only one second to stop clicking before the perk menu pops up, you risk clicking on a random perk if you don't stop shooting. - No timer on powerups. It's a small thing, but again, it takes away from the subtle strategy of the game. There used to be a small timer for each individual powerup off to the side of the screen. That has been replaced with a generic circle icon surrounding the player character. You won't know how much time is left on any of your powerups except the most recent one. Without these features the game is, as one user said, butchered. It simply isn't as fun and doesn't contain the depth of strategy it used to. I'd recommend going online and finding a freeware version of the 2002 Crimsonland.			"

												I loved this game so much in it's own age, and I was very glad to see it making a return on steam, but even if unrealisticly overpriced, it's the type of game you can wait any long time for to go on sale.

The price. It's unreasonably high for a game that is about 15 year old, and adds nothing to the original other than an uncomfortibly huge UI and steam achievements.However, as I mentioned I picked up the game in Humble Bundle, and it also came with it's android version.

I remember spending days, added together easily weeks at work (yeah... well, we had nothing to do for hours a day quite often those times...) and having so much fun with it. The touchscreen controls and the higher difficulty levels together really create an extremely challanging gameplay and obviously the new UI is designed to work well there.Pick up the android version, and just remember the old PC version as something you had fun with as a kid, and let it be remembered that way instead of ruining it with this new PC version. If you haven't played it, ever, still recommended for phones / tablets, but you are better off spending your money on a similar but better arena survival game on PC.			"

												This game is a very solid twin stick shooter. It has a ton of weapons  that all feel very satisfying to use, a massive amount of perks, a good variety of enemy types, a whole bunch of different game modes, a ton of replay value, and a fair challenge, with escalating difficulties. It's great to jump in for a short burst as well as for long marathons. It also has jump-in co-op for up to 4 players, and it's just as fun solo as with friends, every attempt being unique and hilarious in some way. This really is a good ""one size fits all"" sort of game, compatible with whatever playstyle you prefer.Crimsonland is a simply fantastic and fanastically simple game to just kill time with, with a very rewarding pace and progression. As rudimentarily simple and formulaic and derivative it is, it stays engaging and has an addictive quality to it. I have put a good deal of time into Crimsonland on PC, PS4, PS Vita, and PS3, (cross-buy!) and it plays very well on all these platforms. It has a strange pricetag, but if you do buy it, the hours will add up.As an aside, there ARE perks in quest mode, despite what some are saying. I still found quest mode very fun to play without perks (that's what I did the first time with no issues), but they are there if you must have them. Also, I never knew of the original game until after this version came out. Seeing some of the negative reviews saying that the original version was better, I have now played the original and I'd have to say I disagree. The UI and graphics are absolutely superior in this new version, and I have had no issues regarding the finer details of the difficulty/progression.			"

												     Crimsonland only knows one trick, but it is a very good trick. You are... some guy with a gun, standing in the middle of a completely flat plain somewhere presumably not on Earth. You are surrounded by perpetually spawning monsters- aliens, zombies, giant spiders, giant beetles, giant spider that gradually split up into hordes and hordes of smaller spiders as you shoot them, etc. Shoot them until they die. Collect better weapons and power-ups they leave behind. Level up. Kill more of them with your bigger, shootier weapons until they overrun and kill you. Rinse. Repeat.      Yes, there are quests, but they only exist to give you more stuff with which to kill monsters in the Survival modes. Each quest you complete unlocks a new weapon or Perk (perks are specific character benefits you choose when you kill enough monsters to level up; like exploding when you die, shooting fireballs when you reload, shooting smaller fireball every few seconds, shooting one big fireball every few seconds... you get the idea). These facilitate your blowing up of stuff in subsequent games. No story or dialogue at all, but this game really doesn't need any. Crimsonland is about the simple joy of holding down the left mouse button, emptying your Rocket Minigun's 16-round magazine in three-odd seconds, and watching critters explode like blood-and-meat-filled balloons.

Nothing new or exciting that hasn't been done before from Shadowgrounds to Geometry Wars to Alien / Zombie Shooter.  This game reminds me of those mobile twin stick shooters, after a while, there isn't really much there.			"

												Restarting a quest level 1000 times, just to get the one gun with which you have a snowballs chance in hell of getting through the level without taking a hit: priceless.Extra bonus: think you're getting through a level when you've got a great weapon? Nope, an enemy spawns on your location and instantly hits you, nullifying your perfect round. Now throw a coin to decide whether to restart the round or finally just uninstall the game.			"

												Nice game until the last level, where you can't win. Seriously, you can't. No matter which weapons you choose, you can't win. Those damn spiders keep coming from any direction. I managed to kill every enemy until the last four big spiders using the Gauss Shotgun, which becomes useless when you have to fight with hundreds of enemies. So the game decides not to spawn anymore weapons or poweups, just to ♥♥♥♥ up a little.Perks and weapons cannot be uses as wished, so you just have to be lucky to actually win. Wait, are you a ""pro"" and have almost completed a level without being hit a single time? Let me just spawn that enemy right where you are now...The thing I like the most about this game is that I bought it with the Humble Bundle, giving the money to charity and not to developers.			"

												     Crimsonland only knows one trick, but it is a very good trick. You are... some guy with a gun, standing in the middle of a completely flat plain somewhere presumably not on Earth. You are surrounded by perpetually spawning monsters- aliens, zombies, giant spiders, giant beetles, giant spider that gradually split up into hordes and hordes of smaller spiders as you shoot them, etc. Shoot them until they die. Collect better weapons and power-ups they leave behind. Level up. Kill more of them with your bigger, shootier weapons until they overrun and kill you. Rinse. Repeat.      Yes, there are quests, but they only exist to give you more stuff with which to kill monsters in the Survival modes. Each quest you complete unlocks a new weapon or Perk (perks are specific character benefits you choose when you kill enough monsters to level up; like exploding when you die, shooting fireballs when you reload, shooting smaller fireball every few seconds, shooting one big fireball every few seconds... you get the idea). These facilitate your blowing up of stuff in subsequent games. No story or dialogue at all, but this game really doesn't need any. Crimsonland is about the simple joy of holding down the left mouse button, emptying your Rocket Minigun's 16-round magazine in three-odd seconds, and watching critters explode like blood-and-meat-filled balloons.

												When the original Crimsonland came out, it was a fun overhead shooter.  But the original Crimsonland came out over ten years ago, and a ton of overhead shooters have been released over that period.  The genre has moved forward, while this new release of Crimsonland has either stayed stuck in the past or even regressed.Character movement is sluggish and balance isn't even a concept.  Luck is a major factor in surviving, both in the form of getting the right weapon drop and in the battle-reversing power of certain random power-ups.You can play Quest mode or Survival.  You can unlock weapons and perks as you progress, but both only randomly appear as you play and perks only appear in Survival.Quest Mode has you facing preset monster waves.  Defeat a wave without taking a hit in order to gold star it.  This pretty much makes your lifebar pointless, as there is little point in beating a stage without getting the gold star.  Further, as said earlier, luck is a major factor.  The starting pistol doesn't do enough damage to control some waves, and bad luck could see weapon drops appearing in groups that you cannot navigate without taking damage (and thus losing that gold star).  On the other hand, getting the right weapon means you can stay ahead of enemy hordes even with poor play/aim.Survival Mode has you facing screen-filling waves of enemies that have just been thrown together.  You level up as you kill enemies, and leveling up allows you to choose a new perk from a random selection.  The problem here is that Survival mode is simply boring.  You mindlessly mow down colorful bullet sponges, triggering power-ups as they appear, hoping to grab and maintain the best crowd control gun for your style.  Eventually you get overwhelmed and die.The game lacks ""oomph"".  Weapons are boring, and most don't feel like they have impact. Movement feels sluggish. Unlocks are largely meaningless, when the game gives them randomly anyway.  There isn't any variety to play.  There is no excitement, and plenty of games have since done the graphical trick of gradually bathing the area in blood.There is nothing else to Crimsonland.  It may be (based on) a classic, but it is a relatively expensive and fairly mediocre entry in a crowded field.  It has Steam Trading Cards, but the game isn't interesting enough to earn more than one card legitimately (through actually playing the game) versus just idling for cards.			"

Seems legit and convinient at first, but no, those are the worst distraction, there is no option to alther it either.For that, I dont recommand this revived version, go somewhere else and get the old verion.

I didn't know before I bought it but you can play 2014 AND 2003 versions of Crimsonland by buying the 2014 version. Because of this, I still couldn't start the 2014 version.I started 2014 version and noticed one huge thing was missing: Ice ground in the chapter 4. Turning the white floor to red by spilling blood like there's no tomorrow was a pretty good thing about this game. I wish they still had it but 2014 version is still very much recommendable nonetheless.			"

												Crimsonland is a top-down arena shooter. That's about it. I mean, really. Things come from all sides and you shoot them.And it feels pretty damn satisfying! I've got to say, this is a game that I'm in 2 minds about. On one hand, it has a pretty bad design, in the places where it counts. On the other hand, it's glorious to paint the field red with the blood of your enemies!The game has a ton of different weapons, which is great on survival mode! On the survival modes, you also have a ton of perks that alter your play a bit, almost like modern rogue-lites. The game has no bosses, no maps, no levels, nor anything else of that sort. It does have quite a bit of enemy variety, although the differences between the types are very subtle.The game also has a ""campaign"" of sorts, with different levels. The campaign is dreadful. If you read the reviews, you can see most people calling the game out as ""randomness instead of skill"", and it's absolutely true. On these levels, you have to rely on the ""right"" weapon dropping for you to beat a level. Sometimes that being insufficient, requiring additional power-ups at the right moments. Beating it on ""Normal"" is fine, but on Hardcore, there's one particular level that requires astronomical luck. It's called Spideroids and it's dreadful. It features these Spider enemies that work as follows: big, slow spider -> kill it, you get 2 smaller, but faster spider -> kill it, get another 2, smaller and faster -> this happens like 8 times or something ridiculous like that. Your character doesn't run faster than the small spiders, and to add insult to injury, they actually gain speed overtime, so you'll be overrun after a while.Unless you get a very specific set of drops, it's impossible to win.The AI in this game is both great and bad. It's more intelligent than to run directly at you. On Spideroids, though, it makes things impossible. I'm not even sure if the game was actually playtested (as in, without cheats -- without choosing weapons and powerups at will, making sure that it is possible, regardless of the chance of those conditions happening)... Some enemies run at you, while others observe where you're going, and they adjust their direction to meet you at that point. Each type of enemy also has different characteristic that are quite interesting! For example, zombies are slower and then to flock, while spiders are quick and unpredictable. That sort of thing. They all try to get to you in a swarm, but they have different details that are very much appreciated!Overall, the campaign is very situational. Fortunately, where the game shines is one its Survival Modes. There are 4 or 5 different ones that you can choose from. The game and your character are rather slow, which is boring. There is one mode, though, called Blitz, where things are a bit faster, and it's freakin' awesome! I really enjoyed that mode. The sound design is solid, but the music was very uninsteresting to me. The weapons' sounds are very distinct from one another, but I feel that they lack a bit of power, in general. Nothing too important, as the game still feels great to play!There isn't much to say at all, here. It's a very old-school type of game. It's like the analog of Painkiller and Hard Reset in 2D. While 3D shooters have the great advantage of a fully fleshed physics and first person perspective to make things visceral (God, bolt weapons in Bioshock felt so good!), Crimsonland swarm you with enemies from all sides, each hit splashing blood on the floor and leaving bodyparts behind. Ones that don't actually vanish! There's something fantastic about these mindless games that really appeal to me! And if this sounds like your cup of tea, go for it! As I said, the campaign isn't very good (beat it once to unlock all of the weapons and perks), but the core game is great! Oh, also... I've never played the original game, so I can't compare it to that.			"

												What a nice experience. Doesn't offer a windowed mode (or any other options beside controls, for that matter)? Great. Default controls are unusable on a French keyboard -- how hard is it to adapt to Azerty, Qwertz and other non-Qwerty keyboards? My X360 controller doesn't work: I can navigate the menus with it, but not play the game itself. Remapping the key-mouse controls to use the controller only resulted in launching a co-op game for me (wot?!). Still no control. Had to use the keyboard after manually remapping the A and W keys.Yet, after 20 minutes I gave up, this game's programming, graphics and gameplay were just too amateurish, and the music and gameplay were flat-out unpleasant. I usually like that kind of game, and I was drawn to its apparently 'cult' status, so I guess there's nostalgia involved, and I let it go.So I left it running in the background so I could at least get trading cards (and a few cents) out of it, and after 7.5 hours of idling it still refuses me to give its final card, which is a new record to me.I guess Crimsonland hates me.<EDIT> Got my final TC drop after 8.4 hours. Worst offender ever.			"

												It's not terrible, but not very good either and definitely not worth full price. I think the biggest issue is the lack of terrain and the way the questing mode is structured. It's not cool that you have to do the ""normal"" levels first because they are too easy and boring. It's a shame because gun variety and the sound design are on point. Shooting feels good, especially the way gun sounds and joy rumble works together. The music is kinda meh though. The optional old version is actually better, but that doesn't seem to work with modern gamepads and resolutions without external tools and it's not that good either to be worth the effort...I thought this would be a good game to play while listening to podcasts, but in the end all it did was to sap my will with it's utter mediocrity.

												It's no secret that Steam has been re-releasing a ton of crapware lately.  This is an exception to the rule.Crimsonland was amazing when it was new, over 10 years ago.  It was amazing when I still played it off and on 5 years ago.  It has been remade for its Steam debut.  This is still the same old Crimsonland we know and love, however there have been some minor tweaks to some of the game modes, as well the addition of a few new ones.This game really deserves more credit, as Crimsonland was made in a time before Kickstarter, in a time before even Steam existed, and yet it outshines the majority of indie titles out there.  If you played Crimsonland in the past, this version will not disappoint.  If you have never played Crimsonland, get ready for some mindless fun ""twinstick"" shooting done right.Recommend use of keyboard & mouse for most accurate aiming experience.			"

												While it takes a little bit to get going, Crimsonland does things right in allowing for a lot of powerups as well as weapons, and enemy variety can really change things up in terms of the chaos. Co-Op just adds another level of reasonable gameplay. For more first Impressions:

												Meta review: Every time I play this game I think of something new bad to say about it.I first got hip to CL 4-5 versions ago and the devs have basically made it worse every single one.Because of the new leveling system, this new steam edition is more RNG-based than ever.When devs screw their own game up so much every time they revise it, you wonder ""did they even know what they did right in the first place?""There are enough twin stick shooters in the world nowadays that you don't really have to bother with this one.(I'll try to put some time in on Nation Red sometime soon and if I can think of anything that game /doesn't/ do better, I'll post back. :P)			"

												I personally liked the old game much better, however this is a great HD remake. Jackhammer got a major nerf, and quests don't have perks on by default. Graphics are nice, updated soundtrack, a new weapon. It's worth it if you're a fan. Still no online-coop, and the devs claimed they do not plan on adding that.			"

												Disapointed.. The game has all the elements to be a good twinstick shooter, but it's just lacking balance. The game itself is split up into questmode where you have to earn all your perks and guns.. Somewhat of a lazy way of lengthening the game lifetime, instead of actually focusing on the game modes themselves.Once you've got all the guns and perks, you're all set! ..right? No..The survival mode is much like the quest mode, in that there's an red thread going through most of the game. Being that there are hives spawning all across the board, and you've got to clear them out, else you'll be swarmed and die..And the guns are just a major lackluster.. There's so many useless weapons, as in slow as **** to reload, or not a big enough clip.  So what this basically forces you to do is to start whichever level and gamemode you're on, until you get a gun that's decent enough.But the red thread is impossible to avoid, and it'll catch up to you no matter what. And that's fine! It's just not fine when it happens in a matter of 5-7 mins.. No matter what! The hives constantly pour out more and more mobs, and eventually they overrun your pathetic little person.. and then you die. And this happens over and over again, really not differentiating the way in which you die. You always die of being overrun, about 5-7 mins into a game.It almost feels like the game is forcing you to play it with 1 to 3 other people, completely killing the singleplayer experience.So the AI mechanics are disapointing, the weapons are mostly disapointing.. What about the perks then? Surely they are the saving grace? Nope..The perks are plentiful and very helpful (obviously), but they're as cryptic as hell. They pretty much all have lengthy descriptions and tryhard humor on them, and doesn't really help you get the right upgrade in the heat of battle.. Instead you have to pause, break immersion and ponder WTF this actually does to your character. And a lot of them are just plain stupid, like instantkilling you for a better ""score""... Yeah, that's helpful! ""Gotta get those points!"" :PAll in all, the game isn't horrible, as it's got all the right elements and the right idea.. The execution just doesn't seem that well thought out. It doesn't seem tested enough somehow. It's very short lived and anticlimactic when you've died for the 30th time to the same damn problem.It just makes me want to play Nation Red instead.. Maybe not a fair comparison as this is an indie dev and all, but that's like saying ""don't judge an Early Access game as a complete game"". It's in the same genre, so I'm gonna.So yeah, if you want a real solid twinstick shooter, try Nation Red.. Atleast they got it right and let's you play for more than 5 mins at a time. The game has a lot going for it, but it doesn't seem like it's ever going to change. Can't really recommend it at all, for more than a 3-4 hr fun time-killer. It doens't really have much replayability once you've gotten all the unlocks really.. hard difficulty is fine, but impossible is not. Buy at your own risk.			"

Though, UI and mouse controls lack in this version in terms of preference, the new 4-player local Co-op, as well as additional guns, perks and gamemodes really cheers things up. Simple and addictive gameplay makes this package original, fun and easy to get a hold on to. Any new players should experience the madness of Crimsonland!!			"

												This game is a top-down shooter without a story. Every single mission will place you on a flat map without any obstacles or anything else but monsters that keep spawning.Each mission will spawn different combinations of enemies, but in each mission your goal is the same and that is to kill everything on screen.Now can a game without a story and map design be fun? Absolutely! Unfortunately this is not one of those games that managed to pull that off and it's just not fun.So what's wrong with it? Well you'd expect this kind of game to be fast paced action-filled shooter right? Well that's not really what this game is. Your character is very slow and that really ruins the gameplay in my opinion.Another issue I have with the game is that weapons aren't balanced. A lot of them are simply underpowered and not worth using. Also the way you get weapons in this game is random. When you kill enemies they sometimes drop weapons or power-ups.The first enemy you kill in a mission will almost always drop a weapon. So what you'll probably end up doing is keep restarting the mission until your first drop ends up being a good weapon so you have a better chance of beating the mission. You might do that even in easier missions because beating a mission without taking damage will give you a star on that mission.When it comes to beating missions without taking damage in order to get stars, picking up power-ups is important. However due to your character moving very slowly and enemies moving at your speed or faster and in packs, picking up power-ups without taking damage can be very tricky or near-impossible in certain missions.Usually in challenging games I feel good when I finally beat a hard level, it feels like an achievement. In this game however that's not the case. I don't end up feeling good, nor that I achieved something. I just end up being glad I got that mission over with and ask myself do I really want to go for another mission or should I just close the game.I wouldn't recommend this game even if it were freeware as it's just not enjoyable. I really don't know why they think their game is worth 14€.			"

												It's finaly nice to have this legend in Steam also. However there are some features in this new remake version which I have ...even despise.- First of all, why on earth it is not any longer possible to level-up and use perks in the quests!?- The Progress bar in the quests is pretty annoying. In my opinion it should be much smaller.- The new healthbar and reload system doesn't look very pretty although I understand the point behind it: the player doesn't need to take his eyes off of the player when there is alot of action.- In the survival, it is absolutely horrible when you can't no longer deside yourself when to pick a perk after leveling. There is usually very much action going on and therefore sudden pop-up windows can really ruin the game session.- I mainly play the game by myself, so the ""Press fire to join"" infos in each corner are very irritating.After all that complaining, there are also good new features.- It is nice how you must unlock the weapons and perks in the quests to be able to use them in the Survival.- The menus are more graphical, although somewhat crude-looking. (And some menus lack some buttons I'd presume to be there; like replay after winning a level)- Now it is possible to see each wepon's individual specs.- The star ranking in in each level (for beating it without taking a hit) adds playability a bit more. However I would like to have even more achieavables (stars) per level, like for instance >40% accuracy or complete the level under par time.- Four player co-op is nice! (hopefully in the future it will be possible over the net)All in all it is close to the good old legendary Crimsonland, but I don't completely agree with the new change choises the 10ton team has made. Alse the 14€ price is somewhat steep (at least in my and my wallet's oppinion). "

												I enjoy this style of game, so, overall, I've had fun with Crimsonland. However, there were some really badly missed opportunities with this game. For example, can somebody please explain why in the hell you earn buffs (faster reload, faster running speed, increased damage, increased xp gain, increased power-up drops etc.) if you can never activate any of them in the quest game mode. Who cares if you can use them in survival mode, I want to beat all the levels on every difficulty setting, but, quite frankly, without being able to use a buff or two, beating many of those levels once you get to Hardcore and beyond depends entirely on what your first weapon drop is. By the time a second weapon drops so many baddies have spawned that getting to a specific spot is next to impossible, you're just in full on kite mode. Not only that but your character moves slower than many of the enemies and is slowed briefly by taking damage, meaning one hit equals death in most cases because the brief pause allows the hoard to overtake you. Perfect time to activate the faster run buff you unlocked, but no, it's worthless. C'mon guys, with a few minor adjustments, this could be a real good time.***WOOT!!! Thanks for putting the buffs in the quest mode. That was my one complaint. Also I really enjoy the type mode.			"

												I purchased this game years ago, and have played it on and off for the last 5+ years, it has always been fun for a mindless shoot-em-up arcade style game, They have improved the local co-op, unfortunately I have been unable to get my controller recognized as of yet, but as I am the only person at the computer, that is no real issue, yet. The one thing I miss from the old version is the ability to gain perks while going through the quest mode.			"

Still as fun as ever!I didn't know the game was even being remade, but saw it in the store by accident and bought it straight away and despite my doubts, still love it after playing the original all those years ago. It's not the same game as back then but it's bigger and better than ever.A must buy for any fan of brainless shooting and digital massacre. 10/10.			"

												Significantly harder than the previous versions. Aliens are smarter, levels are gained less often (and not in quests), perks are reworked (telekinetic is near useless now), new weapons, new powerups, better graphic.It is still the old cool crimsonland, but now it has the steam convenience factor.

												If you've played Crimsonland before, this is essentially the same game from a decade ago with some minor changes. The graphics and UI have been (slightly) updated, and some great new weapons, perks, and powerups have been added. The most notable changes are the removal of perks from the campaign mode and the addition of monster spawners/nests in survival mode, both of which make the game more challenging (in a good way).If you're new to Crimsonland, this is a fairly straightforward top-town shooter in which you use outlandish weapons and powerups to...well, paint the map crimson. The gameplay is similar to Serious Sam's, in the sense that you'll be constantly circle-strafing around enemies to avoid getting overrun. Don't think to hard, and you'll have a great time. The original game was always a guilty pleasure of mine, and I'm glad that Greenlight has made this subtlely remastered version possible.			"

												This will be as short and sweet as possible. In its current state this is 'mostly' the Crimsonland you may remember and love with changes that seem to add a finer level of polish to what could be said to be a progenitor of 'Arena Shooters. To boil Crimsonland's experience down to single word ""cathartic"" will suffice. You can begrudge differences from past versions or claim there is not enough change at all... but any game that has stood the test of time this well against a veritable mountain of copycats is worthy of your time and at half the price this title originally sold for.

												This game takes me back, waaay back to the old days. Crimsonland has always been a favorite among many of my towndown shooters, but what really makes this interesting and something i favor over the others, the weapons, the style and its glorious levels getting splattered with gore and blood. In sense of what it features compared to the rest, i can't say much but it is a classical gem which has been revived, enhanced, updates to get the 2014 feel. While there are some things i like and some things i dislike. This includes:Positive:- New HD game assets- New sixth chapter- Still very addicting- A few new weapons and perks- Body part splat from enemies- New and shiny UI- Widescreen resolution support- Replayability is HIGHNegative:- The UI is very tablet like (constrained)- Game options are more or less non existant (can be altered much more in .xml).- Perks has been removed for quest (secret has been revealed that it is possible to enable)It is still a fantastic and addicting game and if you don't care much for how many game options are available and the perk aspect being disabled for now, then you should definitely pick this up!

												Are you a fan of top down arena shooters? Then this game gives you a great bang for the buck.The low price and high replayability makes it a really solid mini-game to pick up and play when you need a break from quest dialogue or crafting in <insert some other game>I especially like the Survival mode where you gain xp and activate new perks that drastically change your playstyle. Said perks are unlocked through the story mode (by story, apparently they mean the name of the level can SOMETIMES be linked to the stuff you'll face in the level :p )I have an xbox 360 controller plugged in and ""hey presto"" I can play local multiplayer with a friend (or 3)... Great fun :)So yeah, if you have a few bucks/euros/quid burning a hole in your pocket, this could be the game for you :)ps. my Bullguard antivirus was a bit silly and decided to quarantine the game.exe file, if that happens, just go into advanced settings of your antivirus and make an exception so your AV program doesnt freak out, its perfectly safe to play, or it wouldnt be on steam :) ... I hope :P			"

												Getting our clique together and taking turns playing the survival mode in Crimsonland is one of my better memories of middle school. 12 years later it still plays and feels great, though obviously there's a lot of nostalgia talking here. The change to the Telekinesis perk is unfortunate, but I kinda understand it (gamepad support). Some of the achievements are unreasonable, which is disappointing.			"

												To start, I'd like to say that I got this game as part of the Humble Android Bundle (some number), and that I only got the bundle for Neverending Nightmares, so this was like a bonus.I decided to try this game out this week while waiting for my card drops on it. Started the ""campaign"" (which is basically just some levels with different enemy placements and different enemy and weapon selection for it), finished it in like 3 hours or something. I don't really know if there was a story because I really didn't care, I just wanted to shoot some stuff and see some blood. And it worked. Starts slow with♥♥♥♥♥♥weapons and normal enemies, and gradually introduces new enemies, new enemy types, new weapons and perks (which are useable on the Survival gamemode). So yeah, it starts slow and builds up into something cooler quite fast.Gameplay: Normal top-down, twin-stick shooter, with quite a lot of weapons and different perks. Not many enemy types, but they work in ""races"", like, aliens, giant spiders, etc. Enemy design is quite okay for a game like this, and the shooting is really solid. Campaign was fun but the Survival gamemode is what really shines here. Lost another 4 hours playing the different survival modes to try to get a highscore. The game IS fun.Graphics: Well, it was a 200mb download if I remember correctly. There aren't many different scenarios (they are just like a board of dust and sometimes some grass or some urban hangar stuff), which is something I didn't like that much. Enemies have cool designs, wouldn't say ""original"" but they're cool, you can see the difference from each one. Your character is quite simple and the animations are just fine. Overall, acceptable, though could have some more stuff in scenarios.Sounds: The menu song made me instantly turn all sounds off because I didn't like the mixing in it (quite low quality), but won't say anything about game effects because I just wanted to kill stuff listening to some prog/death metal.Story: heh.Overall: 6/10. Cool game, can easily get you to waste some time of your life playing it and it is fun. Get it for the gameplay if there's a discount and you think this might be for you. Was quite a surprise for me.			"

												Top down shooter like Smash TV, Dead Frontier, Bunch of Heroes, GTA (1 and 2).  The graphics are okay for this type of game, but there is no music/sound if you just walk and aren't shooting.The gameplay is too slow for me.  There isn't an option to skip through to the harder levels.  You are forced to play through the easy levels.  The game controls are simple, WASD to move and click to shoot.  Aside from the slow gameplay, the biggest problem for me was that mobs can spawn anywhere.  They do not come in off of the screen, so it's possible to die with full health because they spawn where you are standing.  You literally have no chance to move or defend yourself (this is the only way I was killed twice in the 30 minutes I played.  Level 2 - 8).  The levels appear to be static, so you can learn where they spawn and stay away from those areas, but I didn't like this aspect of the game.The power ups appear where you kill a mob.  If you are skilled and kill mobs across the screen, due to your slow movement, there's a good chance the power up will disappear before you can loot it.  When a nuke drop (destroys all mobs close to you), you sometimes have to kill the mobs that are close to you to get to it.  By the time you can get it, there are no mobs to destroy with the power up.There are spawners that pop up (think Gauntlet) which the mobs also spawn from.  I think the game could be a lot better if it had random spawning (off screen) or if they had pure spawners.  The only time I've had a slower runner was in Parasite Eve. :)			"

												I was informed about some update of the game, so I get back and have a try again.First I appreciate the improvement of some UI, includes the remaining time of buffs.And the Telekinesis also works as mouse over, though I still think making the bounous moving towards player is unnecessary.The perks is enabled in the Quest in default, that's much better.And again I found the 2003 version is ensembled.Therefore I change my vote for all the update above.below is the old comment#######As a Crimsonland old player, I prefer the old UI and hope the perks could be used in Quest.Perk Telepicks instead of picking the bonous by mouse, the bonous would move to the player, prefering the old one.Edit:Found a way to enable PERK in QUEST mode:--------------------------During the QUEST, press ""ESC"" and type ""grim"", and tick ""Enable PERK in QUEST"".---------------------------			"

												Meant to write a review of this ages ago, but steam didn't play ball and deleted it before I could post it. In short - AMAZING FUN GAME!!!Slightly longer - I have been playing this game casually for years, from the original days. Great concept, challenging and the randomness keeps it interesting. The only slight criticism I have, is that the only way to get the random powerups is to enter some obscure ""cheat code"", which i always felt was a massive part of the game originally. However outside of that, I cannot fault the gameplay. Nation red tried to copy this somewhat, but crimsonland is much better executed in my humble opinion.			"

												I reviewed this game a long time ago after putting about 8-10 hours into it. At the time I thought it was pretty decent, but not worth the price. My complaints at the time were that there was too much based on random chance, and that it wasn't as good as the original Crimsonland.Well, there's still a lot of randomness involved. Every level or match you get random weapons and pickups. However, the developers just released an update which pretty much buffed everything in the game, making it a lot more accessible. They've also added several new game modes and made various quality of life improvements. Finally, the original Crimsonland is now included.I'm impressed, this game has been out for a while but it's still being updated and improved. I'm changing my review to a thumbs up.If you're in the mood for some mindless top-down shooter action, with a huge variety of weapons, perks, and pickups, you can't go wrong with this one. Kudos to the devs for making it so much better!			"

												Old game that has been remade and brought back in 2014.Never played the first one but picked this up after seeing a Giantbomb quicklook and can say that this game is addictive.If you are after a easy to pickup game but take effort that can give you endless fun with survival trying to out do your own high score or beat your friends score then pick this up. There is a quest mode that prove challenging and you will no doubt get better the more you play learning the tactis against certain mob types.			"

												Are you a fan of top down arena shooters? Then this game gives you a great bang for the buck.The low price and high replayability makes it a really solid mini-game to pick up and play when you need a break from quest dialogue or crafting in <insert some other game>I especially like the Survival mode where you gain xp and activate new perks that drastically change your playstyle. Said perks are unlocked through the story mode (by story, apparently they mean the name of the level can SOMETIMES be linked to the stuff you'll face in the level :p )I have an xbox 360 controller plugged in and ""hey presto"" I can play local multiplayer with a friend (or 3)... Great fun :)So yeah, if you have a few bucks/euros/quid burning a hole in your pocket, this could be the game for you :)ps. my Bullguard antivirus was a bit silly and decided to quarantine the game.exe file, if that happens, just go into advanced settings of your antivirus and make an exception so your AV program doesnt freak out, its perfectly safe to play, or it wouldnt be on steam :) ...

												It's time now for the tcr of Crimsonland!What's the tcr you ask?  Well its the Trading Card Review, where I play a game for as long as it takes to acquire all trading cards, and then decide if it's worth playing beyond that point.Let me start by saying that I've logged over five hours playing Crimsonland thus far and still have one card left to drop. Bug, glitch, or smart move by devs to keep you playing?  Who knows! What I do know is that it is completely unnecessary! Crimsonland is awesome!An intense bloodbath of alien slaughter!  No story, no explanation, just mayhem!  Some games, especially ones in this genre can kill themselves with trying to explain themselves.  Sometimes it just best to throw the player in and let them make it up on their own, and that's pretty much what Crimsonland does.Crimsonland takes the top-down shooter genre and shows it how it's supposed to be. More guns, more enemies, more carnage.And its all well rounded out with the achievements and trading cards for the complete Steam experience.			"

												Although I enjoyed this game for a while, I can't recommend it. I played similar games in which you had to act strategically, for example by picking the right weapons, but in this game you just run in circle, relying on random weapon drops and hoping that enemies don't spawn right inside you. If you want to ace each stage (which means: don't get hit), you'll find yourself in endless trial & error.You also unlock LOTS of perks (about 50 in total) but you can only use them in survival mode, which is quite pointless because you only unlock stuff in the campaign.

												I should start with a couple of things: 1) I do recommend this game. But it's not a very strong recommendation. 2) My decision to purchase was largely nostalgia-driven. Those two caveats disclosed, my review is relatively simple. This is a fun top-down shooter that is a bit stuck in the past. It's a game that for me, back in 2003, was a pretty big deal for something that today would fall into a much more competitive indie genre. The basic premise is: you're a guy, you run around in circles, you shoot things and they bleed. Eventually you're going to die, but along the way you can level up to gain perks which propels the arcadey gameplay.The game is effectively untouched except in superficial, and relatively inconsequential ways. It really needs much more than that to be anything but a game people like me are willing to purchase because they have fond memories of playing. You can use modern resolutions now! The UI is updated (but it's bland)! But that's about it. Effectively, this is a PC game from 2003 ported to a PC platform of 2014.The gameplay is still fun. But the asking price, and the lack of change and balance to the game over the course of a decade is unlikely to bring in much of an audience beyond people who played Crimsonland prior to its launch on Steam.I wanted very much to see some new game modes, some new weapons, some new perks, some new something. But really, I have the same game on a new computer with a new UI. Pretty unimpressive.On sale, this game is worth the time and money I think. Though it's very hard to make the case for something old that isn't doing much to take advantage of a huge sea change in what a game can be, and what the PC platform is able to do. I was happy to buy the game hoping against hope that maybe some additional content will be added, or Steam Workshop integration will come along. Though I doubt that is likely, and I doubt you'll feel as nicely as I do about this game, I think you can still have a good weekend's worth of fun if you give it a shot.			"

												I've played hours of this previously, but only just acquired the game on Steam, which I'm enjoying giving a second run-through. Surprisingly solid gameplay wrapped in a very simple package. The basic mechanic revolves around top-down shooting with increasingly unreasonable hordes of enemies and a variety of weapon and power-up pickups. All the gameplay modes have a very smoothly ascending difficulty curve that transitions you from plucking off modest mobs with a pistol all the way up to surviving one second to the next in the very heart of seething legions of enemies. The gunplay is clean, responsive, and strangely satisfying. Crimsonland uses its simplicity and satisfying sense of momentum to creep up on that ""just one more level"" tease many of us know all too well.			"

												Old game that has been remade and brought back in 2014.Never played the first one but picked this up after seeing a Giantbomb quicklook and can say that this game is addictive.If you are after a easy to pickup game but take effort that can give you endless fun with survival trying to out do your own high score or beat your friends score then pick this up. There is a quest mode that prove challenging and you will no doubt get better the more you play learning the tactis against certain mob types.			"

												Basic idea of this 2D Arcade Top-Down Shooter, is, you run from baddies & shoot at them for as long as you can, then, they eat you alive.You have good arsenal of weaponry at you disposal. Different mods of firearms, flamethrowers, plasma-ion-gauss toys, rocket launchers and some other weirdness. Most of them are quite playable and offer unique experience, but, some just really bad and get you killed very quickly :)Enemies are not too diverse in form and even less then that in essence, but hey, they come in different colors !!! Nevertheless, while number of enemies will usually be your biggest concern, towards some of them you'll develop quite special feelings ...And also there are powerups, popping-up all over the place. Not too important at first, but later, picking them up in right order (or just being lucky) is pretty much the only way to finish a campaign level.Oh yeah, different play modes, campaign, survival, co-op and some other joyful ways to experience inevitable death ... Survival is arguably most interesting one, though, honestly, I've enjoyed it more in original game. Now, 6 to 7 perks per game is not too much to go by.There isn't much to say about graphics or sounds (thanks god days when those were important are gone), but overall gameplay is awesome, game is addictive as hell !!!Enjoy, don't forget to order a T-shirt ;)			"

												In a word: forgettable. Crimsonland is a top-down arcade shooter from 10tons Ltd. Let’s get rocking.The GoodHahahahahahahahahahahaha. Okay, moving on.The BadEverything about this game has been done before and is, as I said above, forgettable. The setting, the guns, the gameplay; it’s all boring. You’d find a better use for your time by going to the nearest body of water, attaching 14 dollars to a brick (or a  rock; your choice), and throwing it as far out as you can into aforementioned body of water. On that note, how in the hell do the developers have the gall to charge 14 dollars for this?The MehSee the above, but, I will reiterate one thing: how can any sound mind consider this game worth 14 dollars? Thank the dark lord Cthulhu I got it through Humble Bundle.Verdict: NayIf you really want to spend 14 dollars on something, go buy yourself something good to eat and rest easy knowing that some other poor fool spent that same amount on a terrible a game known as Crimsonland. As always, thanks for reading.			"

												You know exactly what this game is. What you might not realize is just how great a version of that thing it is. Crimsonland is super simple and a joy to play. Shoot things, grab powerups, and stay alive. Gameplay just feels good. Originally released on PC in 2003, Crimsonland's formula proves to be timeless, now even better with the addition of new monsters/levels, Steam leaderboards, and controller support (though I still prefer KB+M for this game). Don't let the simplicity or basic art style of Crimsonland fool you; You will sit down to play for 10 minutes and have an hour of non-stop fun.			"

												Tough call to recommend or not. this is a great game and it is loads of fun, and ultimately the survival modes and easter eggs are why i give it a thumbs up. the campaign mode is loads of fun the first time through although can be finished in less than an hour. the problem is when you start playing on the harder difficulties that unlock after beating it the first time. on the harder settings the game stops being fun for the most part. levels can not be beaten with any level of skill and rely solely on how lucky you get with perks and power ups. the game is not 'impossible' as some suggest, i have beaten all 3 difficulties. its just insanely hard.the survival modes are a blast though, they have a creative variety and local co-op which is tons of fun.there are also some easter eggs strewn about in the menus ( type ""grim"" while in the pause menu for example ) overall this game was worth the purchase			"

												This is the original Crimesonland!There have been some issues like disabling perks in the quests, but it seems that the developers have removed the limitations. Furthermore, they have added local co op to this game which makes it super fun! (mouse&keboard+3joystcks or 4 joysticks) I used to play the original game and had finished it. I have it here on steam again and have already finished the quests with perks enabled and I can say that the game is not much different. Some perks have changed but not in a negative way; just they have been replaced with another perk.Also, while there was not any SteamOS tag on this game, I installed this on Linux and played a lot! The port is completely solid and stable. The graphics are much better than the original game and you can see the difference in slow motions. It seems that they have added some fun modes to the game as well, mainly in the survival area.All in all, I recommend it.			"

												I should start with a couple of things: 1) I do recommend this game. But it's not a very strong recommendation. 2) My decision to purchase was largely nostalgia-driven. Those two caveats disclosed, my review is relatively simple. This is a fun top-down shooter that is a bit stuck in the past. It's a game that for me, back in 2003, was a pretty big deal for something that today would fall into a much more competitive indie genre. The basic premise is: you're a guy, you run around in circles, you shoot things and they bleed. Eventually you're going to die, but along the way you can level up to gain perks which propels the arcadey gameplay.The game is effectively untouched except in superficial, and relatively inconsequential ways. It really needs much more than that to be anything but a game people like me are willing to purchase because they have fond memories of playing. You can use modern resolutions now! The UI is updated (but it's bland)! But that's about it. Effectively, this is a PC game from 2003 ported to a PC platform of 2014.The gameplay is still fun. But the asking price, and the lack of change and balance to the game over the course of a decade is unlikely to bring in much of an audience beyond people who played Crimsonland prior to its launch on Steam.I wanted very much to see some new game modes, some new weapons, some new perks, some new something. But really, I have the same game on a new computer with a new UI. Pretty unimpressive.On sale, this game is worth the time and money I think. Though it's very hard to make the case for something old that isn't doing much to take advantage of a huge sea change in what a game can be, and what the PC platform is able to do. I was happy to buy the game hoping against hope that maybe some additional content will be added, or Steam Workshop integration will come along. Though I doubt that is likely, and I doubt you'll feel as nicely as I do about this game, I think you can still have a good weekend's worth of fun if you give it a shot.			"

												I changed my mind with what I said before. One of my favorite parts of Crimsonland was the whole leveling up system on the quest mode, when I found out that it ""has been removed"" I flipped and instantly disliked it. BUT there is an overcome frome that, press escape when in a quest level and type ""GRIM"" (without the apstraphe) I like the fact that some of the enemys and guns look slighlty different while keeping the same great soundtrack and noises. P.S If you use the perk ""regression bullets"" you would pretty much be unsopable, it is made for survival, it makes it so you can shoot while reloading, but of course while you are in quest mode there isn't any points.

												If you enjoy mindless top down action, this is the game for you.  Currently ranked 71 on Blitz mode, I feel I've spent enough time with the game to recommend it.  The game starts out relatively easy, with quest mode - you simply kill everything on the map.  Power ups pop up during gameplay to enhance your weapon, endurance and health - you simply run/walk over them and they are crucial to reaching the later levels.  As you beat quest levels on different difficulties, you open up survival mode.  What separates quest and survival is that you can open up perks in survival mode. Once you reach your first 8,000 points, you can choose from a small assortment of permanent upgrades that are essential to keeping up with the endless horde of monsters and bugs.  Once you get a feel for the weapons' strengths and weaknesses, you can find the right combination of perks to get the most out of your gun and your overall gameplay.  Overall, a fun game.  The only negatives are the music sucks and an update with new monsters and weapons is needed.			"

												First top-down shooter I can remember playing way too much of more than a decade ago. Not much has changed under the hood of the game, it retains most if not all of the mechanics the original contained. Its a big visual refresh that the Steam release offers, and it's pretty good. The gameplay is as I remember. Pretty fun, but maybe a little more banal now that I'm older and have nearly 1k hours in Nuclear Throne, but it still stands the test of time as a rather competent title.			"

												I played this game back in 2003 when it was originally released and for me it was an instant favorite.  I had forgotten about it until I picked it up on GOG when the HD remaster was released and it's been my goto de-stressing game ever since.  I picked it up on Steam a couple months ago as part of a bundle and I've been having lots of fun playing it on the go.  This game is a pretty basic top down shooter with in-game powerups and weapons.  The game gets pretty challenging as the hardness level increases,  but for most it shouldn't be too hard to get 3 stars on each of the missions on normal play.    I definitely recommend this game for anyone that likes a run, shoot, don't think too much type of game.  The monsters offer a nice variety of challenge.  The spiders add plenty of creepiness factor.  Definitely worth a sale price purchase of around $5 or less.			"

												This is a short, simple and straightforward 360 shooter, where you are tasked with eliminating swarms of lizards, monsters and a variety of bugs with a fantastically varied arsenal of weaponary and special powers. It has that ""just one more go"" thing about it.My only bugbear is that the game seems to get easier as you progress into the later levels, which dilutes the satisfaction of completing the game. No matter though, it's still great fun. The developers seem like a great bunch, as evidenced by their generous inclusion of new features into the game that they could have sold as DLC. Look forward to what they have to offer next. A nice little indie gem.			"

 Ver. 1.2.3: Survival is back This game is a remake/improved verison of the original Crimsonland game, which I absolutely loved and spent hours trying to get a decent score in Survival Mode. I instantly bought this one when it was released, and while I liked it at first, I had to give it a thumb down after couple of dozens runs in Survival. My main issues with the game were:1) Low camera altitude: can't see the field of battle clearly2) New perk and experience system: no perks in quests (kinda), leveling up is extremely slow, some important perks altered for worse.3) Interface: power-ups are displayed on crosshair, hp and shield are displayed on player model.4) Survival Mode: added monster-spawners, average game longevity is ~3 times shorter than in original game, harder to get a weapon you want.After update 1.1.0, review was changed to positive, mostly because of the inclusion of original Crimslonland game for free. Changes to he game were good, but not good enough, since it didn't fix the main issue with survival mode: toned down exp gains in comparison to the old game, which resulted in very short survival matches, without any feel of buliding up your character.But now with update 1.2.3 I can totally recommend this one. Increased exp gains and some changes to perks made the game as enjoyable as the original. While in previous versions you died on level 6-7 (my personal highscore was around 350k points), now level 30 is not even impressive (50+ million points is pretty much a real thing). Of course, you're still pretty much screwed, unless you get at least few of the vital perks in first ten levels, but overall, now this game wrecks you with RNG (in terms of obtaining perks, weapons and power-ups) even less than the original did.Final thoughts:A great top-down shooter, with the potential to suck you in for dozens of hours, if you're into getting the high scores. The ""story"" mode (i.e. quests) is more of a training ground before survival, so I don't think it's worth to buy the game if you don't plan on playing survival. But if you do, prepare for absolute carnage, because Crimsonland is finally back.P.S. Took more than 2.5 years though.			"

												Let's start with the most important thing. This IS FINALLY CRIMSONLAND.I wrote a review of this game a year and a half ago about this game being a bad update of the original. It took them a while, but the developers have finally fixed my issues with the game, and so I can say, with 100% certainty, this is the game I wanted (and thought I was buying in the first place.) Great job, guys. This makes me happy.			"

												The gritty battle continues with a random russian roulette style pick of weapons and perks with boosts dropping on the battlefield.

The difficulty ramps up which will kickstart puberty and turn any boy into a man capable of building a motorcycle from AK-47 parts. The complimentary hard rock and masculine appeal is suiting.

I give up.It was already a goddman hard level in the original game but at least you could get lucky with Unstoppable, Long Distance Runner, Plaguebearer, Veins of Poison, or of course Telekinetic perksThere's also an area of maybe 50 pixels around the screen border that you can't walk on, which is really frustrating when it's your only escape route			"

												Crimsonland is a zero-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t top-down shooter with no plot and no waiting, just you, a bunch of guns and perks, and a metric ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of aliens, zombies, lizardmen, bugs and spiders trying to eat your face. I heard it compared at least once to Smash TV, and that's probably the best comparison. Run, shoot, reload, pick up some powerups like smart bombs, incendiary rounds, bullet time and arcing electrical blasts, and hopefully not die. There's a lengthy quest mode, as well as a bunch of survival modes, all of which have up to four player, same-screen local coop, a rarity for PC games. The graphics are minimal but sufficient, and the music is completely appropriate cheesy buttrock. A great party game.			"

More importantly, can we get cloud saves or at least permanently unlock the survival modes? Survival with a pulse rifle is a lot more fun than the missions, and every time I have to reinstall Windows, my save with all the unlocks gets wiped, so I have to re-do the missions.			"

												A solid top-down single screen twin-stick shooter.  Enemies spawn, you shoot them.  Sometimes they drop power ups or new weapons to let you kill them faster.  6 worlds each with 10 levels.  You unlock new weapons as you go, and the enemy types are interesting enough that it stays fun for those 60 levels.  You also unlock perks but you only use them in survival mode, which I didn't really get in to.  Took me a little over 3 hrs to beat the 60 levels and I had fun with it.			"

												This game relies heavily on three points.1. Guns.2. Perks.3. Swarms.These three points as well as the randomness of the pickups and perks made this game the best pastime for topdown shooters.  Except they removed the perk system for the quest line for some godforsaken reason.  I bet it was some corperate hooha who thought that the quest mode shouldn't have perks since you have to play quest mode to unlock the perks/guns.  So cudos to you, you buttmunch.  If you enjoy playing an insanely difficult topdown where you have to rely on pickups to barely survive let alone beat a level, then go right ahead and play this game.  Otherwise just play the original instead of this disapointment of a remake.			"

												This is just really a fun gem of a game. A nice stress reliever. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for the game because it will never be talked about for it's great writing, social commentary, nor will it be an insane competitve play game or a good game to bond with by playing co-op. But it's a nice break inbetween other games. It's nice to play a few rounds of survival or rush before heading to bed or into work. I keep it installed for when i want to play it. Sometimes I go months between plays, other times ill do hours in a single day. It's a good game to pick up and set down at any time.The game itself is fairly straight forward from the trailer with 3 main modes (i think there's 1 more i don't play), story, survival, and rush (more extreme survivial). Use story to unlock weapons that will drop. There is a ranking board for score and the best part of the game is earning Perks which just help you kill more aliens and stay alive longer.			"

												First of all, this steam version of the game really needs a cloud or profile-based save storage. Losing all the progress on different computers is a bit of frustrating. Actually the worst part is, you cannot play Survival Mode at the very beginning of the game. I can understand unlocking features via achievement progression but at least keep track of them and do not obligate player to complete quests on different computers.Zooming out the camera with a specific perk every different stage is okay, acceptable. However, removing the good ol' perks from the quests... That's a huge deficiency when you consider you have to complete quest mode to achieve other stuff like rush and survival.I hope the developer company care about these reviews in the future and fill the missing gaps of this legend.Edit: So they did actually add a Steam Cloud support. :3			"

It really is a great game, but nothing much has changed since the 2011 version, which cost me just under 6 quid. As with all games that make a move to steam, I also feel cheated I have to buy it again for the updates. The download link for the original installer I have no longer works. Fortunately I do still have the original installer on a backup drive, but I would feel seriously annoyed if I didn't and couldn't download a product I already paid for. It simply isn't worth the current asking price, although I'm sure the engine changes took some time to implement.			"

												I hadn't played Crimsonland for quite some time, and I didn't know it was on Steam up until a few days ago.Given a lot of the negative reviews I was a bit hesitant to buy it, but given a lot of the postives I decided to give it ago.I think a lot of the negative reviews are justified, in the way that they're old (Prior current patch), and some of the drawbacks they mentioned would also have had a significant effect on my game experience.Having said that, perks are now available without using ""cheats"", and typoshooter is back!Furthermore the 2003 version is added. I haven't tried the old version yet, since I'm more than satisfied with the new version, but I bet I'll sink some hours into that one as well.I've spent most of the day blasting away at enemies in quest mode, typing away like a mad man in typoshooter.. and I'm not done yet!If you've tried the old version, you just might like this newer version. If not, the old version is still available for you to enjoy.			"

 Ver. 1.2.3: Survival is back This game is a remake/improved verison of the original Crimsonland game, which I absolutely loved and spent hours trying to get a decent score in Survival Mode. I instantly bought this one when it was released, and while I liked it at first, I had to give it a thumb down after couple of dozens runs in Survival. My main issues with the game were:1) Low camera altitude: can't see the field of battle clearly2) New perk and experience system: no perks in quests (kinda), leveling up is extremely slow, some important perks altered for worse.3) Interface: power-ups are displayed on crosshair, hp and shield are displayed on player model.4) Survival Mode: added monster-spawners, average game longevity is ~3 times shorter than in original game, harder to get a weapon you want.After update 1.1.0, review was changed to positive, mostly because of the inclusion of original Crimslonland game for free. Changes to he game were good, but not good enough, since it didn't fix the main issue with survival mode: toned down exp gains in comparison to the old game, which resulted in very short survival matches, without any feel of buliding up your character.But now with update 1.2.3 I can totally recommend this one. Increased exp gains and some changes to perks made the game as enjoyable as the original. While in previous versions you died on level 6-7 (my personal highscore was around 350k points), now level 30 is not even impressive (50+ million points is pretty much a real thing). Of course, you're still pretty much screwed, unless you get at least few of the vital perks in first ten levels, but overall, now this game wrecks you with RNG (in terms of obtaining perks, weapons and power-ups) even less than the original did.Final thoughts:A great top-down shooter, with the potential to suck you in for dozens of hours, if you're into getting the high scores. The ""story"" mode (i.e. quests) is more of a training ground before survival, so I don't think it's worth to buy the game if you don't plan on playing survival. But if you do, prepare for absolute carnage, because Crimsonland is finally back.P.S. Took more than 2.5 years though.			"

												A game which I've been missing for 8 years now and now I am happy to see it on Linux. The game has a timeless graphics so there is no pain for the eyes.That is the game the CoD BlackOps Arcade mode could have been, if they were clever and copied some of the ideas from this game.But is it the crimsonland? It is, and I am happy to see it that way. The Ui has been changed a bit, but to the goods in my opinion. Perks are now better explained and there are even some new perks.			"

												I played this game years ago with my brothers and liked it, so when it came up in a steam sale I didn't have to think much before buying it. It is a fun, fast paced top-down shooter with plenty of weapons, perks and masses of aliens. If you bought the old version, all you need is a proof of perchase and this enhanced version is yours for free.			"

												Amazing blast from the past!Had a great time going through the motions of killing and dodging my way to an inevitable death by snake-spider-alien beasts. The additional unlocks of perks and weapons gave the quest mode some progression and levelling up style but the need to unlock the extra survival modes was slightly annoying. Overall great remake.

												What a disappointment. I lost weeks and weeks and failed many exams because of how fun and addictive the original was.And I wanted to have this on Steam, so I picked it up. You don't wanna do that.First of all, the style of the game is changed - I assume they wanted to give it a more modern look, but it just looks like an amateur designed it. Menus, ilustrations of weapons, even sprites of your player and the enemies, they all look so ugly and plastic. Sure, they made the terrain more detailed, but who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about that?Gameplay is basically the same, and many people will think that it is enough - perhapse before they play the game. Important part of the first game was perk selecting (there are still powerups that you can pick up in the game, they appear after you destroy a random enemy) you could basically level your player in every part of the quest, and start over in the next chapter. It was so fun to choose perks while playing, you had to make the choice between those offered and sometimes it was really choosing the lesser evil. Now, you want to choose perks in a quest mode? ♥♥♥♥ you. You can't.Energy bar is shown in a circle around your player, this is another annoying thing because it draws your attention from enemies and the level. It's bright blue, yeah, seems like someone at 10tons has a bright blue fetish. A HUGE miss is the fact that your ammo count isn't in the corner or at the top of the screen - it's NEXT TO YOUR CROSSHAIR. How are you supposed to aim if often you aren't sure what your crosshair is? I really can not understand what were they thinking while redesigning this game.I was really eager to get this on Steam, and I am so sorry now. Someone mentioned in their review that you can get the original Crimsonland on GOG, but I just checked, all screenshots are taken from this version of the game.My advice - try finding the original game on torrents or somewhere, I know I'll be playing it that way.

												A fun time killing top-view run and kill type of game. It stands out from other similar games by its massive enemy counts and tons of blood. -= About the game itself =-Game's campaign consist of 6 chapters and each of them have 10 levels. Depending on your skills and guns you pick up each level takes no longer than 10 minutes, but with every new level your enemies become harder to kill same as their count on map grows. By completing levels like in any other game you unlock new perks and guns.Campaign kept me busy for around 3,5 hour, while after the finish game still offers you a replay in harder difficulties. If you feel that you don't want to start it all over again, you always can choose one of 5 different survivals. Each new survival unlocks as you progress in a game's campaign.  On top of that you can play this game with up to 4 friends in co-op which makes it to be even more fun and later compare your highscores with the rest of the world.Personally I don't have nothing to say bad about games mechanics and or gameplay, it is really entertaining, but one thing kind of bothers me and it is that when you pick up a gun your previous gun disappears and there are no possible way to scroll between weapons, so you have to kill with a gun you take. At some point, accidentally picking up a worse gun can cost you a restart, so you have to be careful on what gun you are about to take. After all it is totally worth to have this game in your library.			"

												Crimsonland is a top down shooter that i recommend 100% if the price is right. the original 14 euros is maybe asking a bit too much but you can usualy find the game for much much cheaper. There are lots of weapons to unlock and there are also a good amount of perks that you can get and a fair amount of power ups.  the progression is quite nice and keeps you wanting to play more and more of the game. there are also leaderboards for various game modes so you can compete against freinds or just anyone that have played the game really.  all in all there is alot to do with various difficulities, game modes and weapons/powerups/perks to unlock. very good game for how simple the genre is.

												Crimsonland is a timeless game.  I've been playing it since the original 2003 release and have thoroughly enjoyed the 2014 update.   The moving/shooting dynamics change with every weapon and every level as you add perks to your character.  Exploring this dynamic has been fun and compelling for over a decade.  I am showing no signs of getting tired of this game.			"

Alone, I am beset on all sides...not by evil, as some claim, but by things that just view me as a food source...and they don't care about my well-being in the slightest. The comparison to how Americans treat each other is inevitable. Overall, I find Crimsonland to be highly cathartic. I use it for meditation; it assists in finding my Beta state in much the same way as the Lotus position helps yoga pratitioners. Play this game. It will change your life, forever, for the better.

												This is my all time favorite twin-stick shooter! I have played the original back in 2003 (which is included) as well as the re-release.There are several game modes, the main mode is called Quest Mode and it offers 3 difficulties. You are placed in the middle of the map while enemies are storming at you in waves and you have to defend yourself from a top down perspective. Weapons (shotguns, rocket launchers, plasma rifles and many more) and powerups (for example bullet time, fire bullets, shields) are randomly dropped by dead enemies. While you shoot your opponents you will gain experience points and level up. Those levels offer special perks you can pick and they range from faster reload times to poison bullets. Each stage in Quest Mode has a distinct layout and starting weapon and by completing them you unlock new perks and weapons. The more you progress the more difficult the stages become.Of course there is a Survival Mode, where you have to survive as long as you can as waves of enemies come after you. It features all perks and weapons that have been unlocked in Quest Mode. Or you try the Typ’o’Shooter or Rush mode. The game also offers local multiplayer of two players on the original and up to 4 on the re-release.Crimsonland's Quest Mode and multiple side modes offer enough content to have you entertained for hours. Each round feels different, depending on the perks you pick and the random weapon drops. I tend to play the game in short bursts, you can easily drop in and out. It controls fine with both mouse and keyboard or gamepad. Tech-wise Crimsonland only shows age in terms of graphic options, the overall look and mechanics have aged well.The price tag is a bit high, but it's not spectacular overpriced. If you like action games with light RPG mechanics, give this one a go!			"

												Played through normal mode + no scratch in about 4 hours, playing the game on side of another game.Pros:+ Solo gameplay is quite fun. Fun to see how far you can get and a lot of weapons to choose from.+ Many perks to choose from whenever you gain levels in a map.+ KB + Mouse works well.+ 3 Difficulties to choose from + extra game modes after beating normal mode.+ Bunch of anchievements to unlock.Cons: - You will need good RNG to get through Chapter 2 Stage 10, c4s10, c5s6 and c6s10 without taking damage (for achievement + star rating) if playing alone.- Would have liked to see better weapon balance. No point in using a movement speed slowing inaccurate minigun when you can use any shotgun to clear much more.- Levels are pretty simple in design. Some levels with walls (or whatever) would be nice.- You can't see where enemies spawn and they can spawn under you, making you take damage.- Sometimes the enemy is just too overwhelming even if not going for star rating.- All but the typing minigame feel unbalanced - enemies overwhelm you too easily most of the time.7.5/10			"

												Update: Changed the review from 'Not recommended' to 'Recommended' because of the new patch. See also the comments.I really wanted to like this game. I played the original version in 2003 and loved it. Now 80% of the time I spend playing Crimsonland I am angry or frustrated or both.I don't know exactly what changed (aside fromt the obvious nerf to the Telekinesis-Perk). Maybe I as a player have a different approach to games now. Back then it might have been less important to me to finish a game 100% before playing something else.Now I mostly strife for completion or at least getting as close as I can. And in the case of Crimsonland that turned out to be  an incredible pain in the behind.So maybe it's due to my attitude and not to questionable gamedesign but my experience with this new iteration of Crimsonland was mostly unpleasant.What bugged me most was the random factor when it comes to your weaponry. In most levels and Survival runs you start with the pistol and one of the first 3 or 4 monsters you slay will drop another gun. This game has alot of weapons. Most of those are way underpowered. If they were better balanced or if I as a player had at least some kind of influence over which drops I see and which I won't see, that would make a huge difference. Restarting a level over and over again until finally one of those 5 or 6 viable weapons pop up is NOT fun. In most levels that is not necessary but trying to complete the harder ones with a suboptimal gun is just a waste of time.I have to say though, the carnage and frenzy of the original are still there. The soundtrack is awesome and if you get one of those (sadly) rare runs where everything falls into place and you get the right weapons, perks and drops in the right moment then it is indeed a wonderful experience. Full of bloody gore, splattered enemy-corpses and agonized screams.			"

												Updated review as of April 2017: Very good game, lots of improvements have made this game really fun (again). Recommended. Original review below.-----------------------------------Original review: Inferior to the original. The survival mode isn't as fun anymore. They disabled levelling and perks in the campaign, so now its just boring. ""Hardcore"" mode feels much too easy - I've beaten several levels without even trying, whereas in the original I struggled even playing on Normal mode.I used to sink hours into the original just playing the survival mode and trying out different combinations of perks and weapons. But in the steam version? I have only made it up to around level 7 in survival, then some OP enemies come along and I die every single time - no matter what weapon, or the perks I choose. They ruined the majority of the fun the original had. Its not the same at all, and that makes me sad.Avoid this version. Buy the original somewhere off the internet instead.			"
