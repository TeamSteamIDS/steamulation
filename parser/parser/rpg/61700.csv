												9/10OK, let's get this out of the way: You match 3 thingsJust like with fruits, or gems, or candy, right?Surprisingly enough, NOThe system is simple. If you match 3 units in a row horizontally, you build a wall. match 3 vertically, you build an attack. (let's ignore some specials for now.) The real game comes outside these ""Puzzle Battles"" with a decently plotted and scripted journey through the worlds of M & M (note: NOT Eminem...) collecting and selecting the tools for your army.Once the campaign is out of the way, try some surprisingly tense turn based multiplay.Summing upIf you like puzzles, and you like Might & Magic then WHY don't you have this already?If you don't like either of those things then WHY are you here?If you like one or the other WHY NOT at that price?

												All the following comments are based on my 3k hours and 6k plays on xbox and PC:1. If you like puzzle game, this is one of the best.2. If you like PVP, this is one of the best.3. If you think you are smart enough, you may enjoy the PVP a lot. Otherwise, play with your friends.4. Game is well balanced but there are still few tactics overpowered. As a newbee, don't feel shame to use those OP tactics.5. Luck is not a factor deciding the win or lose during most plays if two players are not at the same skill level.6. The only way to refine your skill is to lose to a good player and lose wisely.7. After 200+ plays, if you think you learned all the tactics, please play with me. I will show you some tactics most people won't use. 8. The players pool is quite small now. That's why I have time now to write all those above:) "

												I enjoyed the challenge of the battle system. Not a conventional match-3 system; it took a while to get the hang of the battle system. Campaign playthrough took 20-24 hours. I enjoyed the Campaign play-through; I don't expect to replay it.Even after getting the hang of the battle system, the randomness inherent in the battle system resulted in fairly frequent bad luck for me and sometimes very good luck for my opponent. Some of the set battles are rough, even with leveled units.I needed to fight side battles and do bounties to level my units up enough to complete the Campaign. Some of the set battles are rough, even with leveled units. Just gotta be persistent in retrying. The Campaign mostly doesn't punish you for death or retreating. Even when it did, I just lost a bit of my excess currency-- no big deal.I like the art style. Very stylistic. No blood or gore. I felt that the females were clothed tastefully, certainly better than most games treat female characters these days. Kid-safe.			"

												Might & Magic: Clash Of Heroes is a match 3 turn-based strategy R.P.G. developed by Capybara Games and published by Ubisoft. As an avid fan of all four of those genres, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this gem of a title from start to finish. The game takes place in the beautifully crafted fantasy world of Ashan which has been a staple of all the Might & Magic titles released over the last couple of years. During a meeting between a group of powerful elven and human families of importance and nobility, the serene setting of this peaceful gathering is horribly interrupted by a suprise demon attack. Taken completely off-guard, the adults are swiftly overwhelmed and slaughtered but not before one of the mages quickly opens a portal whisping the families surviving children away from the deadly carnage. Though successful in it's execution, the magical portal is extremely unstable and sends each of the five kids to a different part of Ashan and this unfortunate series of events is what sets the stage for the fascinating story of Might & Magic: Clash Of Heroes. Down but definitely not out, you take control of five of the childhood heroes Anwen, Godric, Fiona, Aidan and Nadia. Scattered across five different regions of Ashan, the heroes must travel their own dangerous paths to grow in strength, unravel a demonic plot, and ultimately save the world from Chaos.Unlike other Might & Magic titles, the battles in this game take place in match 3 turn-based format. Each hero can command an army with up to five different types of units. Each unit comes in a variety of different colors and in order to charge them up for battle you must match three units of the same color. This may sound easy enough but like the old saying goes...""Easy to learn...hard to master."". Once charged, your unit will execute it's particular method of attack against your opponent with the goal being to defeat your enemy before they in turn defeat you. Besides the fun match 3 play, there is also a heavy element of strategy involved as you decide which soldiers on the battlefield to send into attack and which to sacrifice for the greater good. You also have the chance to increase the potency of your attacks through a method called ""linking"". This is done by matching multiple groups of units of the same color laterally on the battlefield instantly providing an immediate boost to their attack power. Like with any particular R.P.G. worth it's salt, you of course earn experience points as you win battles and complete challenges thus allowing your hero to level up. Also besides the regular battles, you will face challenging boss fights, have the opportunity to take optional sidequests to complete bounties and solve a number of highly complex yet extremely fun puzzle battles that task you with finding the right combination of moves to solve them. I'm definitely not a very smart person but I have to say that some of those puzzle battles were very very tough to solve but the satisfaction that you received after finally completing them was well worth the frustration and time spent. There is also loot to be acquired in the form of various artifacts and trinkets that you receive either through exploration, defeating foes or by completing tasks. These items will provide your hero with new abilities that will greatly help you on the battlefield. Graphically, Might & Magic: Clash Of Heroes is a gorgeous game to behold. The cutscene artwork has a beautiful manga-inspired look to it that is just a joy to watch as the story unfolds. The various regions of Ashan that you traverse during the course of the game are vibrantly detailed and each area has a unique look and culture of it's own. From the majestic woodelves of heavily forested Irollan, to the elite knights of the Holy Griffon Empire and the arcane necromancers of Heresh and beyond...you definitely will not feel like you've visited the same place twice with this title. The battlefields have a wonderful visual style to them as well but the pinnacle of the graphics in this game would without a doubt be the units themselves. They are just so wonderfully stylized and animated to the point where it looks less like a videogame and more like a cartoon or anime....they are indeed that beautiful. It becomes a treat to watch them initiate their attacks after charging them up just to see what they will do. The music and sound effects also do a fine job of capturing intense moments during the story and battles as well as adding to the variety of the different environments that you visit throughout Ashan. All of this is wonderfully presented in full HD as well.To summarize, I was very shocked at how great this game was when I first started playing it because I had always assumed that the Puzzle Quest series, which I adore, was the pinnacle of match 3 puzzle based R.P.G.'s...until now. To me this title definitely gives Puzzle Quest a run for the money in those genres and I would love to see other Might & Magic match 3 titles like this one yet sadly it seems as though that may never happen. There have been other Might & Magic games released since this one but they have all returned to the tried and true formula of turn based strategy minus the match 3 of this particular title. Despite that, I really enjoyed this game and will continue to play for years to come and would highly recommend this title to any fan of match 3, puzzle, strategy, R.P.G. or any combination of the four. Might & Magic: Clash Of Heroes is a title that any Steam user would be proud to have in their library.			"

												A great treasure for casual gamers. If you like puzzle quest series, this one is even better. It sets in Might and Magic Universe. It is a really easy game based on combining same color soldiers to attack enemy or defend yourself. Simple but fun. Different soldiers creates a variety and tactical play. This system is better than just combining gems and stuff. Every character have different special units and artifacts which adds diversity to gameplay. Graphics are smooth and easy on the eyes. Story is a little cliche but not boring. This is a casual-puzzle game. You shouldn't expect a complicated story. :) If you catch it on a sale, don't miss it.			"

												Where Puzzle Quest gives you abstract ""mana"" for matching 3, Clash of Heroes turns your board into a tangible, tactical place. Where you match is just as important as What you match and How you match. This makes the game one of the most thoughtful, tactical puzzle games in existence.It is a port of a Nintendo DS game, though, so be aware of minor UI nuisances  and graphics that don't quite hold up under the close scrutiny of a giant 1920*1080 monitor.

												It's such a surprising game. We always are afraid of spinoffs: not living up to franchises fame, riding the name for some cash and things like that. But sometimes we get jewels in such piles of disappointments. And Clash of Heroes is such a jewel. No, it's nothing like any M&M game, but in this case it's not a bad thing, as CoH is an original and interesting game, giving us fresh gameplay and some nods to M&M there and here. It doesn't overstay its welcome and is well paced, by dividing a game in parts that take place in different worlds and offer different perspectives. Basic gameplay remains the same, but units, strategies, enemies and puzzles are new in each world.Recommended to all M&M fans and not fans. It's just that good.			"

												One of two games I've played start to finish. The game balance is well-done, providing some battles that were morale-boosting with their ease, but others that were right down to the draw. Even though the gameplay is the same throughout, the variance in Hero abilities and unit abilities keeps the game from feeling too repetitive. The story is simple and easy-to-follow, enough to provide a context to your progress, but not too much that you want to click through without reading.Having finished the single-player campaign, I've tried a few multiplayer games -- and gotten my hat handed to me. I'm a level one multiplayer player, and the others are level 10 and 11. This is likely because I'm a late-comer to the game, and those who continue to play multiplayer are veterans (and much better than I am.) Still, I'm willing to try to gain experience via multiplayer, provided I luck out with an occasional win. Being an achievement junkie, this game's multiplayer achievements are what will likely keep me playing, to try to collect 'em all. "

												I have one good question for you: Are you colorblind? If not, and you want a good puzzle-fighter, it should be right up your alley. Clean, expressive sprites, fun match-3 puzzle and combo system, and a fun little story. If you're colorblind? Forget it. Just don't bother. It's a going to be a matter of squinting, doubting, and kicking yourself for messing up. There's no options for swapping palettes, or differentiating sprites, and one or two of the ""races"" are impossible to sort out and plan around without being able to distinguish between units.			"

												In this game, which, by the way, quickly became one of my favorite in Heroes francise, player takes control of common M&M races and fights in huge fantasy world, crafted with colorful and beautiful graphics.What certainly makes to enjoy this game are battles. It`s not exactly a turn based strategy like Heroes series, more like a tactical puzzle game with simple RPG elements and without typical town management from others Heroes games. Battles itself are original and have a lot of depth, but at the same time they are quick and very easy to pick up and play. Nevertheless, later levels and multiplayer matches require a lot of planning and knowledge about various units and races. One problem, though, is the lack of information about tactics and unit's abilities in mid game. Plot follows a group of young heroes, who tries to save the world of Ashan from the mystical enemy, as it killed their parents, rulers of Ashan. Story is fairly interesting, but personally I didn't liked it as much as similar, episodic story from Heroes VI.Music is always terrific in Heroes games, but I liked this one the most, soundtrack equally shines in both: battles and story cutscenes.Online mode doesn't require to level up, as special units and artifacts can only be unlocked in campaign. The result is balanced and skill dependent battles, without long, off-putting grind.Overall, M&M: Clash of Heroes doesn't lose originality or depth despite it's simplicity and for such a tiny price I can't remember another game, which offers so many hours of gameplay... Bloody fun gameplay.ReDiR's rating: 9.4 "

												I've previously played the DS version of this game and enjoyed it quite a bit. Even after completing the main campaign the quick battles offered plenty of entertainment. For the lack of any specific term, Clash of Heroes is turn based block matching/puzzle strategy. The game is very pretty and not too hard once you get the hang of it. The story is nothing spectacular. I personally can't remember any of it, but you get to play several characters who all have their upgradeable units, special abilities and mini campaigns that match their theme. The elf dudes have their unicorns and necromancers have their skeletal dragons, you get the idea.Addendum: The PC version is more balanced than the DS version when it comes to damage dealt by special attacks.

												Might and Magic Clash of Heroes is mainly one of those match 3 games, but shines as being more by mixing in so many different ways to build up your ultimate strategy to win. The campaign is pretty long and can be beat with 100% of everything in around 30 hours. The multiplayer still holds people surprisingly and I only have to wait a couple minutes if I have to wait at all if I try to find a game. Allthough things tend to be me vs that one nolifer at level 3 billion that magically plays so ridicoulously well that he basically has endless everything.Is it a lot like heroes of might and magic? Nah, you can buy units yes and find awesome stuff on the map as well as ressources but really all of that is just side stuff and the game is mainly battle after battle after battle. The campaign does a pretty sweet job of not becoming boring by contantly bringing in new things, be it units or challenging bosses.All in all I can reccomend even at full price.			"

												This is a nifty little title that blends together Match-3 dynamics with a tactical combat layer.  You form columns of like-colored creatures to form an attack or rows of like-colored creatures to create a wall.  Different creatures have different characteristics (e.g., Elven Archers attack very quickly but do modest damage, while Human Swordsmen attack much more slowly but hit harder).   Heroes level up to gain HP and stronger walls, and each hero has one unique ability (plus a second unique ability that can come from any particular magic item you find along the way).It's not one of the deepest Match games I've ever played (nowhere near as deep as Ironcast, say), but it's a fun little game.  It's also GREAT to share with small kids whom you want to play games with.  I played it with my 5-year old son and we completed the whole campaign together!  The story is cute and entertaining, but unlikely to win a Nobel Prize for Literature.The tie to Might and Magic is very loose, but it's still a fun little title.			"

												This is a good, but oddly overlooked puzzle fighter. Beyond the basic rules of putting three units of the same colour in a line to launch an attack or build defensive walls, there's a decent amount of strategy involved. Each of the 40-odd units in the game has a different attack power, special ability, and takes a different amount of time to prepare their attack - during which your opponent can try to defend or counter it. You can also power up your attacks by setting them to launch on the same turn or stacking one right on top of another. And of course, this wouldn't be a Heroes game if you weren't playing a hero, with their own, potentially game-changing ability.The single-player campaign is quite long, and offers a mild progression and resource management element (as in, you'll have to buy special units if you get them killed in combat) in addition to unique boss encounters. There's also a story, of course, somehow related to Heroes 5, but cartoony so kids might like it, maybe? I don't know, I've lost interest in HoMM around 3, and in cartoons around 12.The multiplayer component works reasonably well, but you'll have to provide your own opponents - bring a friend or two. And the DLC allows you to play not just as one of the heroes from the campaign, but also the bosses, who can function quite differently.So, if you're at all into puzzle fighters, give this one a go. It's good, even if you just play the campaign. Maybe play a round or two against your friends.			"

And of course, this wouldn't be a Heroes game if you weren't playing a hero, with their own, potentially game-changing ability.The single-player campaign is quite long, and offers a mild progression and resource management element (as in, you'll have to buy special units if you get them killed in combat) in addition to unique boss encounters. There's also a story, of course, somehow related to Heroes 5, but cartoony so kids might like it, maybe? I don't know, I've lost interest in HoMM around 3, and in cartoons around 12.The multiplayer component works reasonably well, but you'll have to provide your own opponents - bring a friend or two. And the DLC allows you to play not just as one of the heroes from the campaign, but also the bosses, who can function quite differently.So, if you're at all into puzzle fighters, give this one a go. It's good, even if you just play the campaign. Maybe play a round or two against your friends.			"

												A causal game on the HoMM universe based on the match-3 recipe. Cartroonish-style heroes for a younger player base.The game is quite interesting a differs from typical match-3 games as you build attacking formations with links and also defensive walls. There are various units and hero abilities and a length campaign. About strategy the game has nothing to do with the first awesome HoMM games. Still I would rank it higher than the latest monstrosities of the series...Pros:+ nicely crafted casual game with many different units and hero abilities+ main campaign has long duration+ cute graphics and environments as well as unit animations+ interesting boss battles that differ from the regular fightsCons- frequent and rather long loading times- rather repetitive towards the end. Fractions may have different units but eventually it is always: legendary >> champion >> regular units- could contain more boss fights with varied objectives rather than depleting opponents health- in many boss battles the last columns to the left and right play no role. The field is already rather limited in size- tried 2-3 times the multiplayer but was never able to find an opponentAll-in-all a good and solid casual game for those who seek games following the match-three concept.

												I'm a big fan of the Heroes series and picked this one up on sale. I expected to play for like an hour and be done with it, but my partner and I just put two and a half hours into it without even noticing. It seems like it's gonna be a casual match 3 type (kind of like puzzle quest) but it ends up feeling more like a srpg just because of the style, narrative, and so on. The animations are cute, the plot is lightweight and fairly standard but not offensively done and doesn't seem to take away so far. Will probably revise after getting in, but I already feel like I've got my money's worth already in one enjoyable evening.			"

												This is a great casual game with high replay value.The campaign is quite nice, both in story and types of battles you get to fight. The story contains both humour, tragedy, betrayal and so on. But after you've finished the campaign, you will spend hours and hours doing single battles against AIs and hopefully a friend or two. Depending on which faction, hero, and item you choose you can vary your strategy quite a bit, making the game last longer.Highly recommended for casual gaming.			"

Great casual and strategic puzzler An interesting strategic puzzler with unique mechanics, Clash of Heroes does a great job as a game to play when you're travelling or want to start the day fresh with some puzzling and a cup of coffee.The story features some characters of the the famed 'Might & Magic: Heroes V' game in their childhood, as characters like Godric, Findan and Markal are featured.

												Clash of Heroes has excellent and enjoyable battle mechanics, decorated with light 'RPG progression elements' and set within a basic story. Storyline is not amazing, but does provide a very good setting for all campaign content. Visual and Audio aspects are extremely impressive for such a smaller spin-off of the might & magic series.Comfortably replayable more than twice, just because the battle system provides such a good balance of skill and random elements.Wish there was a sequel for this!

												Verdict: This one was a surprise. A beautiful, polished game with excellent presentation, surprising strategic depth and a simple but engaging story. The best Heroes of Might and Magic game for quite some time. 8/10Story: The story is simple and light but, married with the clean presentation, is still an endearing and somewhat engaging experience. Straightforward but nevertheless interesting characters will appeal to most people, and the big names to Heroes fans in particular. 6/10Gameplay:  I should start this by saying that I hate Match 3 games with a burning passion. But it feels wrong to even call this Match 3; it feels more like genuine turn-based strategy. Each side takes turns moving units around to match three and create ‘formations’, which then attack the other side. This is simple at first but, as you unlock new units and combinations, it becomes much more complex and interesting. It’s a very well-balanced game with offensive, defensive and mixed strategies all being equally viable. 9/10Graphics: The presentation is excellent, colourful and polished, and the attack animations are powerful. It’s surprisingly fun to see classic Heroes characters rendered in an anime style. 8/10Sound/Music: The sound is great and the re-mastered soundtrack will cause Heroes fans to reminisce like crazy.  8/10			"

												Ever since this game was introduced to me by my friend Liam, i've been addicted to it.It's such a good puzzle game and really rewards clever thinking and forward planning. Think chess meets tetris sort of,It has an awesome multiplayer and...oh my god the music. How can anyone dislike the music?! It's so dramatic and entrancing, i ended up getting the soundtrack just so i could hear it on demand. Totally badass stuff.Different teams have different abilities and special units, but i much prefer the undead team of vampires, ghosts, zombies etc The game looks beautiful too; there really isn't anything bad i could say about it. I suppose they could have made a few more music tracks for battles, but i say that only because i love the handful they have already!			"

												I feel that this game is deceptively underrated.If you ever wanted a puzzle-strategy-RPG-type game (think: like Puzzle Quest), this is the one to go for. The mechanics are very well-designed, the in-game assets and UI look great at any resolution, and the single-player content will likely be satisfying until completion. Being able to kick-back with a 360 controller is also a plus.Despite being a genre hybrid and having RNG, strategy and tactics actually plays a significant role, as you can customize your unit/hero/item loadout before every game, and can try-out different things once on the field. For example, you could use units/heroes that are quick to charge-up, and have them all constantly bombard your opponent from multiple points, making it difficult to defend against. Or you could focus on using strong hero units (which a player has a limited number of) that take a while to charge, but have a lot of damage-output once its turn comes and if it hasn't taken too much damage from your opponent before then. Or just about any loadout combination and tactics you can think-up.The game also uses high-resolution art assets and an automatically-scaling UI, so the game will look great at any resolution. And the unit animations themselves (especially the Hero attack animations) are both well-done and expressive, but won't make the field difficult to grok at any point. I run the game at 1440p without any issues.As far as the single-player mode, I thought it was well-done. While the story and characters are kind-of garbage, and I didn't like starting a new character for each chapter, the game's difficulty sloped-up very satisfyingly, and every boss was a novelty that forced you to change your tactics. I believe the reason for this is because of each character's level-cap, where the later bosses/mini-bosses in each area were all crafted for you to be at that cap, so that you couldn't just grind your way out for an easy victory against them. Aside from the bit-too-easy battles at the start and the huge difficulty ramp at the final boss, the single-player was satisfying and challenging enough to pull me the entire way through.If you've been looking for a puzzle-RPG hybrid and want a chill game to kick back with, I'd recommend M&M: CoH. Just bring a controller.			"

												This game is quite fun in some places, and excruciatingly painful in some missions.  Pluses: Battle puzzles in which you have 1 turn to defeat all enemies on the board. Really makes you think about how to set up combination moves.Minuses: Certain missions in the single player campaign simply come down to luck. You can have the best strategy in the world, but you are under a severe time constraint in some missions, and if the initial setup is bad, then you might as well just reset the mission and try for a new initial setup. (Which, thankfully is possible by ""retreat"" option from menu. Though it costs a bit of resources in some missions)As far as gameplay, it's match 3, which various bonuses for fusing units, chaining units, gaining extra moves for multi-combo plays. Pretty simple, and yet there is a bit of strategy to try and squeeze the most from your units with the least amount of moves.Various ""Artifacts"" also affect the gameplay, and choosing the right artifacts and unit combinations can make or break certain fights.All in all, an acceptable fun, slightly casual, with a few hair pulling moments game which kept me busy for several days.If the price is acceptable in your eyes, I'd give it a solid 7/10 buy.

												Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes is a turn-based pvp puzzle game.  It is nothing like the M&M series, outside of the fact that you have some familiar monster names.  You set up three of a kind vertical to attack, and three of a kind horizontal to defend.  The turn-based aspect limits how many moves you have per turn, so every action has severe consequences.  There is a bit of luck involved when requesting more pieces, and expect to get frusturated from time to time where luck can sometimes overthrow the best strategist.  Developing combos is a must for advancing in the game.  The AI will be relentless, so make sure to never hold back.As a person who loves puzzle/strategy games, this was really up my alley.  If you aren't a puzzle enthusiast, you might find it a little overwhelming, as there are no random encounters to build up the level of your heroes and armies.  There are optional encounters to help build up your level, but every battle win helps build up the levels of your units.			"

												For all the Match-3 games with RPG elements, there is no title that satisfies quite like Clash of Heroes.  There's something eminently enjoyable about strategically building your troops into defensive formations, and then watching your little guys march across the screen to smite the opposition.  The storyline is entertaining, and fits with the current HOMM mythology, and if you enjoyed the music in HOMM V, this game takes many of its musical inspirations from the same.  Highly recommended.

												Great original puzzle game with interesting mechanics. However, I'm not able to finish it because of insane difficulty spikes in the last campaign. There are no side quests to level up, the enemy is on a higher level than you, his units are on a higher level, and he gets two charged Rakshasas at the beginning while you don't have them at all.

												Clash of Heroes is a refreshing game that has hooked me ever since I started playing.  I, myself, tend to not stick with puzzle games for long as they tend to feel old pretty quickly.  However, Clash of Heroes has a pleasant mix of puzzle and strategy that really can pull you in.  For someone like myself, who tends towards strategy games, Clash of Heroes has enough strategy in it to keep me interested as well as a good amount of puzzles to mix it up.Add on a campaign that is fun and pulls you in.  I find the storyline to be enganging, not incredibly violent, like most games these days, with some humor thrown in.  It's a nice game to sit back, play, and enjoy.Overall: 9/10			"

												Best game in Might & Magic since HoMMIII! I couldn't last more than few hours with last three games, this one kept me sticked to my PC for more than 30 hours, and when you're done with campaign there's multiplayer if you didn't get enough. Keep in mind though it's a very small game (considering the level of development put into this game), you're not necessarily going to fall in love with manga styled graphics (but some will), and you're propably going to be bored because of the soundtrack that's taken straight from HoMMVI. Nonethless, worth every penny, provided you like turn-based strategies.			"

												This game is fairly fun, and not too frustrating. I liked the art, and the music is passable.My main issue is that I as a single-player gamer, I finished the campaign in about 20 hours and felt little desire to go back and replay. Thus, my recommendation is if you can get it for $5, I'd say it's worth your time. Otherwise, look elsewhere.			"

												Great Buy while it's on sale, but you have to enjoy Puzzle Games!  Operates more along the lines of Puzzle Quest 2 then a Might & Magic game.  Does use Might & Magic characters, and it's actually a prequel to the story line of Might & Magic V.  So as long as you don't go into it, expecting it to be like most Might & Magic games, then you'll be fine!This game was originally a DS title, but it got an excellent port to PC, and pretty much any PC will be able to run this without an issue.4/5 Stars because I really enjoy Puzzle Games!

Clash of Heroes is a strong puzzle-battle game with well-designed mechanics, surprising strategic depth, satisfying RPG systems, a long and lush story-based campaign as well as quick AI match and multiplayer modes, and terrific production values using traditional 2D art and spritework.  As I understand it, fans of the Heroes of Might & Magic franchise will get even more out of it.

You should have a reset button on the puzzles. it's not much but it would make for a quicker and smoother gameplay.You should get XP for failed battles, just a little. At the start of the game every mob is a few levels higher then you and you can't farm XP.Tier 1 mobs gain max level way to fast, either increase their cap or tweak their stats to alow for more XP. More XP is _always_ better.Some of the loading-screen, talk/text are not optimally designed, they could go faster and smoother.Rant over. it's still a very enjoyable game!

												Incredibly entertaining, story rich and pretty insteresting. It isn't overly complicated, and some challenges are optional. You would think that this game would get repetitive/boring quickly, because of its playstyle, but it really doesn't -- It's a really great game overall. Perfect to play when you're waiting for something, or when you mindlessly want to play something without worrying too much about anything. Fairly addicting, and well designed. I recommend it.			"

												A truly classic Match-3 game (as silly as that sounds), right up there with the first Puzzle Quest. This is a console port, but the mouse even works better than using a controller. (But it's a shame that you can't use the original DS version's pixel art.) Some puzzles feel very tacked on, and it's annoying to figure out by trial and error which NPCs are low enough level for you to have a chance against, but battles are very satisfying.			"

												This game was fun (annoyingly arbitrary success requirements aside), UNTIL Aidan's campaign. Hint, DO NOT SKIP THE DEMON BATTLE THAT COMES UP EARLY IN HIS CAMPAIGN. I repeat, do NOT skip it, or you will flat out not be able to advance. There are no random battles, no puzzles, no side missions, NOTHING. Just a story battle you will absolutely not be able to beat. I tried literally 20 times, and the best I can say is that I held my own for a bit. Her champion units are WAY too powerful to be left undefended (they can kill a wall, a unit, and you in one attack), and using your champion units (of which you can only afford 2) will either see them killed, or will reduce them to such low attack that they don't do any damage either. If this is the game developer's idea of a fun challenge (retrying & retrying & retrying & retrying until I can charge 2 champion units with my 1st turn), fire them and hire someone in touch with reality. If dumb luck were fun, I'd spend all day flipping a coin.			"

												I had high hopes for the game since it comes from the very nice guys at Capybara, and because it's the first time in eons the Might & Magic is attached to a possibly good game. But ultimately, this puzzle game with RPG-like structure doesn't really have that addictive, just-one-more-game feel like other puzzle games like Puzzle Quest. Plus, the gameplay is incredibly linear, so if you get stuck at some point, you're basically just stuck there. I enjoyed it until about half way through, when the tedium begins to settle in. It's not a bad game, and I still think it's worth playing, but it could have been way better. 6/10.			"

												This is a smartphone game. Everything about it screams ""smartphone port"". The UI is clunky and ugly, although the artstyle is nice. Everything about it is designed to be operated with a big fat thumb, one handed on the toilet. Except.. the match length... the average match took me about 30 to 45 minutes to complete, all credit due to the RNG.Matches are won by sheer luck where your and the opponents reinforcements end up. If you are lucky, they will be opportune and you can get ahead with your 3 moves, if you are not... well then the opponent will stack up on walls, making it impossible to get units through. At this point you end up chipping away with minimal damage at the enemy, praying your big beefy units make it through, because the match is dragging on and on. Each match i won, was a stalmate until RNGesus finally decided to create an opening for me by giving the opponent an inopportune reinforcement draw.There is no way to react to the loadout of the enemy, other than save scumming, and with 3 moves there was no way to make big sweeping changes to the positioning. You are focused on using whatever RNG gives you, than wasting time trying to set up big attacks. Why? Because the AI is constantly combining whatever it can.. which forces the player to do the same, trying to ward off the attacks long enough until there is an opening created by RNG.But what really makes me not recommend the game... are some of the story encounters, where the game isn't just content with forcing you to somehow beat an enemy. No, the game throws objectives in the encounter at you. RNG moving 'allies' in the enemy ranks, which you aren't supposed to hit. Or having to protect a unit. Or hit two target at the very same time. All the while the AI is playing as it always does... basically handicapping the player.There is an interesting formation and fusion system in the game, but under the constant onslaught of the AI pulling one off is more luck than skill. And i can only imagine that playing against real players you either have a chess game or someone is playing like the AI, combining whatever they can and thus forcing you to do the same.Its a shame. It has a pretty artwork and it could have been a really nice game, if it either let you decide where your reinforcement went, or gave you more than 3 moves, so you could actually make changes to your rows. So, its 90% luck and 10% skill.			"

												A weird little deviation of typical M&M games. Not sure what audience they were aiming for, but it missed me. It's a shallow little puzzle type game with rpg elements. I found a massive bug immediately that wouldn't allow me to progress in the game, due to the broken wall making mechanic, starting IN THE TUTORIAL. A fix to this bug can be found by going into a Google rabbit hole though.My main gripe with this game comes in the boss battles, especially the end boss. To win the last fight, you have to achieve 2 things. First, you have to have a perfect or near perfect start, which is difficult, since it's random, then, you have to play perfectly or near perfectly, so, expect to restart the fight A LOT. You can get a perfect start, play perfectly, and still waste several minutes losing, simply due to bad draws. There's simply too much randomness here and it becomes punishing and soul crushing at times.I  cannot recommend this game.			"

												I want to recommend this game, I really do. But I cannot, here are some thoughts on this game. In short, the PC version is the avatar of Ubisoft's recent approach on the M&M franchise which is to gut out any magic of the game and butcher anything that is creative.I have played the NDS version of this game for more than 200 hours. When compared to the NDS version, the only thing improves on the PC is the graphics. Game mechanics wise, the game is completely gutted and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ised. In the NDS version, there are many interesting creature abilities, and many interesting faction specific artefacts which can boost these abilities even more. When these two combines, there are so many tatics to explore and so much fun to enjoy. Now they are completely gone. Just to name a few, druid from Sylvan is now trash with his ability shortened by one round and his artefact gutted. This unit is now a joke. Maybe still usable, but no longer fun to beat an opponent who is stronger than you. Djinn suffered the same fate, artefact gutted and ability itself neutered. Rashasa is a mediocre Champion, but with his artefact on the NDS, which gives him 25% PWR boost and 1 round charge reduction, he becomes an formiddable foe. On PC? sorry it is spayed and the Rakshasa's artefact now is a joke. Rashasa also received an PWR punish and now this unit looks like a joke. There are many more, I won't cover them in detail. Anyone who enjoyed the NDS version will know this better.It may seem to stem from the balancing point of view, but this game is basically dead online, and you would probably only play with your friends. And if that is the case, the NDS version with more fun is clearly a superior choice. Instead of fixing some of the weaker units/artefacts/heroes on the NDS, the developer decided to gut anything that is outstandingly fun and watch this game burn.			"

Then the whole overpowered foes in the start of the game, where there is no way to farm exp, gold, ore or crystals for units (Elite Units costs to have).The concept is a nice idea, but the story is not in the HoMM lorewise, and the whole idea of leveling up, is to make your units stronger, but hey if a lvl 1 can kill an elite lvl 4 then what is the point in leveling up the units? Same as the combat is based on luck on how your units lands. I recommend playing Puzzle Quest instead for this game.			"

Oh the various units are all slightly different, but the differences are so slight it was hard to tell after a while.Play it on a mobile device. Your PC is better than this.			"

												If you're a fan of the series, you'll hate this game. It's poorly optimized; it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2d graphics will barely run even on modern specs.. often badly losing sync. The balance is questionable at best, and it feels more like competative bejeweled than it does anything else. As you procede through the campaign, it proceeds to get more and more contrived, and because the dialog and story are written by a complete and total ♥♥♥♥wit, it feels like a saturday morning cartoon version of something that was previously somewhat mature. For example: Elves coming accross a necromancer, digging up elf bones. ""We're going to put an end to your grave robbing shananigans!"" the line was so bad that it was almost nightmare-worthy in it's corniness, but otherwise did indeed haunt me.this game is bad, in pacing, setting, coding, and aparent intention. Don't ♥♥♥♥ing buy it.			"

												This is a fine example of branding gone horribly wrong.  Like taking a brand that is a good, cozy brand that you grew up with and has always been a friend and a mark of reliable quality, a brand of trust, and doing something bizarre with it.   Like if Campbells Soup went into manufacturing diesel motors.   Even if the motors they make are good, they shouldn't do it.  Stahp. We all know Might and Magic as the franchise of addictive 4X games with simplistic tactical combat, classical fantasy units like orcs, knights, vampires and dragons.  Build your cities and outposts, capture resources, cast magic spells and win!Not with this game.  They put Legend of Zelda, a teenaged american nerd who thinks he can draw anime, tetris and plants vs zombies into a blender, crushed what came out and stamped ""Might and Magic: No Really!"" on it.    It's a weak puzzle game with a strange anime type veneer on the front.  They threw away all the classical features of Might and Magic, leaving a poor competitor to Bejewlled in place. Graphics: Limited but works okay in 4K.  Artwork is ""american anime"", which doesn't work with Might & Magic.  There should be none of this kind of thing. Gameplay:  Very bad.   You go in expecting you're playing Might & Magic and you're playing plants vs Zombies turned 90 degrees.   You dump your soldiers randomly onto the field like a game of tetris, then build them into stacks or rows so they can do something.   Thematically it's weird.  In terms of gameplay it just doesn't make any sense.Technical: Not really a 3D game.  Stable and functional, but very simplistic. Might & Magic is a good solid franchise.  It's not the best and far from the worst.  This game might even be worth a recommendation but the failed branding and sense of betrayal, combined with being far, far below par for a game in this franchise, with such weak gameplay, leaves me with no choice but the thumbs down.   There are better Might & Magic games. There are better puzzle games.  This one has no place to go but down, like pizza flavoured beer, some combinations just don't work.			"

I still didn't beat it, but I'll try it again. Unless you have an anime sickness (it's graphic style reminds of these, though it's a bit westernised)  I'd recommend this game to anybody, it's really interesting and. believe me, I'm a demanding player :)			"

												A pretty simplistic game in appearance that reveals its complexity through a single hour of playtime.The basic 3-units principle(to make an attack, three vertical units of the same colour, to make walls, three horizontal) gets immensely complex and varied once you add links(having groups of the same colour attack at the same turn) that reinforce your attack, fusions(two attack groups one behind the other fuse into one group twice as strong), and of course Elite and Champion units that require 2 and 4 units to activate them.Almost every single unit from every single race has a specific capacity, poison, jumping over walls, magical defenses, immunity to attack while charging, hacking the enemy lines/enemy charging power while charging, the variety added to the basic 3-units system makes this an incredibly capable game with possibilities that never seem to be insufficient no matter the circumstances. You can literally be about to be killed by your enemy, call reinforcements, and find yourself gifted with a generous unit placement that allows you to build the walls and defenses you need to just survive and counterattack to victory. There is a freshness in this game that never dies out.It's actually one of its greatest strengths and weaknesses, how random the battles can go. You can be gifted with a perfect line of units from the very start or have absolutely nothing to go on with. The game can be very frustrating when a perfectly planned attack is ruined by the sudden arrival of an enemy Champion just in the column you're about to use to finish off your foe. It can also be frustrating in the other way: you will call reinforcements to see one of your costly Champion units die immediately at the hands of some basic enemy attack with 2 attack because you couldn't get it moving in time.As frustrating and unfair as the randomness is, it is also one of this game's best aspects. The only reason I speedrun this game is that it has the merit of never(apart from the tutorials) making me feel like déjà vu. Every battle is at least new enough, no moments in the game feel like I've been here before(except the bosses, of which there are only 4, along with quite a few unfair pre-prepared battles) and even when it does happen, the randomness of the reinforcements usually palliates that very quickly.Gameplay-wise, it's simply excellent. Having played through the campaign quite a few times for speedrunning, I have yet to find this game to bore me at any point, and it's quite surprising to realise how a simple system can be at the same time constantly demanding and very free.A good example is the fusions: if you want one, with core, Elite or Champion units, you're gonna have to get rid of all your walls first, since you need six tiles to make any fusion and there are only six between the goal your enemy has to hit and your first line.Beyond that, every hero has got his own superpower which can range from somewhat poor(hello Cyrus) to ridiculously broken when you know how to use them(hello Aidan with lots of walls, Anwen with a clear opening, Markal with two uncharged Death Knights).Beyond beyond that, artifacts can be found in many flavors in the campaign and then used profusely in skirmishes or online battles. And the variety there is by no means inferior to the one in the units, although I'm sure everyone will end up using ridiculously strong artifacts like the Spider Cloak, Lion's Mane or Celerity Ring.On a side note, the balancing of the campaigns is a bit poor. Why is Nadia not only ridiculously rich in HP(she starts at level 7 out of 10!), but also given enemies that play defensively, troops that make almost no damage, and is also generously dotted with Academy enemies, who can raise layers of superwalls like drinking a cup of coffee? It makes her campaign ridiculously long and just unpleasant. The times I get for Anwen range under 50 minutes, Godric takes less than an hour, Fiona has a rather long campaign that takes about 1h10 minutes, Aidan has a rather short campaign that also takes less than an hour, and Nadia ends up taking me 1 hour 40 minutes!Continuing on the bad side, the story is completely ignorable. It's not bad(no big plot holes, awful writing or terrible characters) but absolutely nothing about it feels in any way original. The characters almost feel stereotypical, you have the courageous and honorable big brother, the courageous but more sheltered little sister, the more angsty teenage younger brother, the huntress of the woods, the good student girl who fights the good fight...All of their personalities can be written in a quick line and although they never made me facepalm(none of the main five anyway), the last thing I wanted was to be tasked with finding an interesting personality trait among them. I don't mind finding needles in haystacks, but this is just impossible.The story is of the same type, it's nothing awful, but it doesn't convey anything even remotely amusing or deep. It ends in a happy note that works but doesn't really follow the somewhat tragic storytelling we had for most of the game. It's not really light on clichés and nothing about it is worth mentioning. I had a laugh once in the entire game. A giggle, really, at the demon who dies from the volcanic eruption he wanted to see. The rest is skippable. Special mention, though, to the villains: they range from comic relief(Azexes and his forgetful schoolboy behavior) to so obvious it hurts(Carlyle and his fashion for being a general ♥♥♥♥).Visually, I like the animé art style quite a lot, and the quality of the animations is certainly very helpful at making it a nice game to watch. I do have a serious issue about those: they're long. REALLY long. Sometimes it's ok, but seeing the knight twirl his spear around before charging for the 1000th time has really grown old. Less long animations would've really helped in making the game a lot more fun. The PLAYER TURN and ENEMY TURN screens are also ridiculous, they last something like 3,5 seconds! Talk about a needless loss of time! Those could've simply not existed and all would've been better. As much as I appreciate the animé visual style for almost everyone, some races are totally failed: the good guys and necromancers are mostly fine, but the magicians' golems or titans look nothing like the machines they are, although that's nothing in comparison to the Demons and how every unit but the hound is failed. Even when lit with flames and about to strike, I find it difficult to take the immense Pit Fiend more seriously than a plushie. Demons look neither scary nor ugly, and that's a true minus for me.With all that said, the last element is the music.It sucks.No other way to say it. This game has very poor music.Out of five campaigns, forests, a capital city of men, the land of the undead, Hell, and a mighty Magician tower, I remember exactly zero theme songs. Why? Because there aren't any songs. It's all ambients. BAD ambients, with no memorable sounds at all. Whooshing winds and shaking leaves, that's all. The battle musics are thankfully very varied, however that would be a good thing only if they didn't all suck as well! Out of the eight or so battle themes, there is one I like. The final boss music is fine too. The victory theme(the first 4 seconds of it anyway) and the two former are the only songs I can say I appreciate musically out of the whole game. Having played HoMM5 before, I know that many of these songs were taken from the rest of the franchise and sort of put in this one. It doesn't fit, none of the songs are that good, so it's a game that is terribly uninteresting musically.A lot more could be said about bad minigames, Sonic 06-type loading times(two loading times into each battle), but I reached the limit.Final word is that despite my complaints, this is an incredibly fun and varied game that always develops into more complexity and fun. Try it.			"

												It may not look like much compared to any games in the Might&Magic series, however there is more than this game than it's cover lets on. While staying impressively true to the Might&Magic universe, it brings a lighter mood to the usually serious Might&Magic games. Even in it's ""combat"" you can see many similarities to past games of the series. Though don't be confused, this game is much different. It is more strategic than anything, and often requires you to think about your moves rather than just throwing units at the enemy. It is probably one of the most relaxed, fun, and challenging strategy games I have ever played. Not to mention the availability of co-op online gameplay, which brings in even more strategy than with just one-on-one gameplay.There aren't many cons I can think of off the top of my head. If anything, it would be the role luck plays in many of the games. Sometimes you just get delt a bad hand, and that can ruin the whole game. Even with the Relics you get from playing the campagin, they often aren't enough to save you from a bad start. Or sometimes the enemy start is just so good, you can't come back from his initial moves.Even so, this game is great. Whether you're into hardcore strategy or just enjoy a relaxed strategy, this game might be for you. While you can play hardcore and think 5 billion moves ahead of the other player(s) you can also just think one or two moves ahead,and still have fun, maybe even win! This is a great game, no matter what side of gaming you come from!			"

												A good unique strategy game I'd highly recommend. The singleplayer is interesting enough to keep you going through the whole thing, and has things to unlock to play with in multiplayer, so you'll have to go through it if you want to compete!Multiplayer is a lot of fun and definitely has a large competitive nature to it. Some strange combination of about 70% luck and 30% skill governs the game, with an unfortunate loom of unbalanced nature to some of the strategies. It's become more of a meta-game in regards to choosing what overpowered loadout you think will counter their overpowered loadout. This unfortunately takes some of the spontaneous fun out of the game imo, I prefer to play with less popular and more entertaining strategies as it keeps the game fresh. This of course means getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me by people who just want max efficiency unfortunately, though.Anyway, I'd strongly recommend this game, you'll definitely get your money's worth out of it, at the very least. Just don't expect anything related to any other Might & Magic game from buying it.			"

												I have mostly given up on Might & Magic due to Ubisoft's inacceptable business practices, and because I am boycotting UPlay. Which is a shame, because I am a very long-standing fan of Might & Magic. I was sceptical about this blatant cashing-in on the brand, which otherwise has nothing to do at all with M&M (except using young versions of characters introduced in the already-Ubisoft-produced Heroes 5).But to my surprise, below the fan-baiting title lies a casual puzzle game done right. I dislike the random elements that sometimes force you to repeat the harder levels several times, because even the perfect strategy can be defeated by bad drawing luck. The game also urgently needs a quicker way to bypass the tedious, endless story sequences. Apart from that, this is the first ""combat puzzle"" game that I really enjoyed.			"

												I went into this one somewhat blindly. Much more Puzzle Quest than I expected. It was entertaining for one or two campaigns. It got pretty tedious by the end. The story is completely throwaway, which is fine... but the M&M branding had me looking for something more. Levelling heroes and acquiring units and artifacts is a very linear process and more of a facade than it is an avenue for any sort of strategy or decision-making. Boss battles always involve fusing in one or two particular columns. Once you've played a few rounds you've played them all. Jump at $5. Or don't.			"

												Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes is a puzzle RPG in which you play different characters to protect your lands from demons. The story is stereotypical and doesn't offer much depth, it was hardly even worth the reading.Besides that the game was a pleasure. The graphics aren't top-notch, but with the characters and the UI being in comic style and the background beautifully painted it's still nice to look at. It's the same soundwise, not a big deal but serves it's purpose well enough.Without doubt the main aspect of the game is the gameplay and this is where it shines. You have a lot of possibilities to develop your own strategy, with several units per character, quite some items and different mechanics like chaining or fusing. Even in easy mode you will get a good challenge. Instead of replaying the game on a higher difficulty level you can move on to online multiplayer mode in search for a better challenge.If you are into puzzles and can forgive the boring story this is a great game.Score:Presentation: 60%Gameplay: 98%Visuals: 78%Sound: 60%Total: 74% "

There also are quite a bunch of secondary objectives and challenges that add to the game longevity.-Graphics are clean and cute. "

												I haven't played Multiplayer yet but have finished the campaign. It's a really cool game that I enjoyed mostly because it doesn't have things I hate about Heroes of Might&Magic. Without gameplay elements that kept me away from Might&Magic games I had a lot of fun with this game. Those Puzzel-Quest fights are surprisingly fun and  interesting, especially if you find a fraction that you like and suits you well.Pros:-Interesting gameplay-Well done manga-styled graphics -Not bad plot, I enjoyed reading dialogues-If you don't take it too serious, the game can be really funny -It depends on luck pretty much only at the begining of a fight-Some units are just so cool to use: Sukkubs, Ghosts, Vampires, Angels or Knights (in my case)-There are side quests (and sometimes in the actual plot) where you fight with different rules.Cons:-Academy is sooo boring... I could finish whole part of the campaign on one sitting but the one with Academy I had to struggle to even play. -You can be tired of doing the same thing over and over-There is no really any trouble with fights because you can start them over and over (after being deafeted) without any waste of units/resources or anything-It's not Heroes of Might&Magic but a different game- remember it. If you like Heroes it doesn't mean you will enjou this game (but there is a demo on Steam).			"

												Ever since Ubisoft picked up the rights to the Might & Magic franchise after 3DO went bankrupt and took New World Computing down with it, their work as a publisher for the franchise has been...hit or miss. And usually a buggy, ill provided mess. Clash of Heroes is not such a story; it is the single most polished game to come out of the franchise since the aquisition, helped by its gorgeous art style that immediately evokes Avatar: The Last Airbender, but actually makes me think back to Heroes of Might & Magic 2, with its simple graphics still being the best in the franchise due to just a timeless style. The only thing holding Clash of Heroes back from being an out and out classic is its schizophrenic difficulty curve, and an ending sequence barely any better than a series of title cards with plain letter text.But it's an incredibly solid puzzle game, and, while the unit recruiting/resource mechanic is a bit tacked on, the artifact and unit tier mechanics are definitely good additions. And, god damn, what sells this game the most, for me, is the total tongue in cheek nature of its story and characters. Like, after Heroes V took itself way too seriously and was just frustratingly stupid, and Dark Messiah took itself way too seriously and was just hilariously stupid, Clash of Heroes almost went and took the ♥♥♥♥ out of the Ashan universe, which, coupled with Might & Magic X's actually good storyline, gave me hope for this revival of the franchise.

												Clash of Heroes is a puzzle RPG, where you attack by matching units vertically and defend by matching horizontally. Other things like artifacts and hero-specific spells make the battles more interesting. The puzzle combat is a lot of fun, and the RPG elements add quite a bit to it.The story wasn't bad... much better than what I expected a puzzle RPG to have. The graphics are colorful, distinct, and done well. The sound was pleasant, though not memorable.The only real problem I have with it is that a lot of units have unique abilities, and it never tells you what abilities your opponents are using until you get them for yourself. It really sucks when you die because you didn't realize that all Nightmares fire at the same time.Puzzle game fans should absolutely get Clash of Heroes.

												Advance Wars meets Tetris Attack. Each faction has a variety of unique units that you move around like puzzle pieces; different formations allow you to attack, defend, and so on.

												A good unique strategy game I'd highly recommend. The singleplayer is interesting enough to keep you going through the whole thing, and has things to unlock to play with in multiplayer, so you'll have to go through it if you want to compete!Multiplayer is a lot of fun and definitely has a large competitive nature to it. Some strange combination of about 70% luck and 30% skill governs the game, with an unfortunate loom of unbalanced nature to some of the strategies. It's become more of a meta-game in regards to choosing what overpowered loadout you think will counter their overpowered loadout. This unfortunately takes some of the spontaneous fun out of the game imo, I prefer to play with less popular and more entertaining strategies as it keeps the game fresh. This of course means getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me by people who just want max efficiency unfortunately, though.Anyway, I'd strongly recommend this game, you'll definitely get your money's worth out of it, at the very least. Just don't expect anything related to any other Might & Magic game from buying it.			"

												The game is a really fun puzzle/strategy game with solid gameplay mechanics and nice art. Unfortuneatly it is plagued by bugs and doesn't seem to be getting any real support from the developers so far. Multiplayer is particularly bad. There is no penalty for people quitting games or constantly lagging out. There is no real lobby to browse all the open games, their rules, and the players hosting them. There is no way to see how many people are on and willing to play multiplayer, so you have no idea if you are likely to get a game soon or the only one online. Once you start looking for a multiplayer game, you can't do anything else. It would make a lot more sense to be able to go play single player until your multiplayer match was ready, but no one thoght of that and the game is basically abandoned at this point so unlikely to get any such updates (plus it was basically a console port as it was). All of this works against building a thriving multiplayer community, driving people away, which creates a viscious cycle. The people that are left playing are the most hardcore of the hardcore, resulting in uneven match-ups of a level 7 player against a level 378 player, because there isn't enough of a player pool to do any fair matchmaking.It's a real shame that it suffers from these basic UI and matchmaking design flaws, because the actual gameplay is fantastic. Despite all of these issues, I'd recommend the game, just make sure some of your friends get a copy because that's pretty much the only way you'll get to have any fun in multiplayer.The story is also pretty lame, but it is set in the new Might & Magic universe so that's pretty much to be expected. Really miss 3D0's Enroth and Erathia setting for Might and Magic.			"

												Clash of Heroes follows the story of five young adults from different cultures that come together to stop a demon invasion. Clash of Heroes is able to find that perfect level where everything is customizable enough that the game doesn't become oversimplified and dreary, but also keeps it simple enough so that we don't get overwhelmed. Each one of the five factions has its own distinct style, and even though the smooth animations and environments are remarkably detailed, they fit just perfectly and never detract from the gameplay. Although the basic foundations of battle are simple and easy to understand, many factors have to be taken into consideration when trying to master these battles. High replayability. Its cliche story and unremarkable dialogue sequences are Clash of Heroes' only weak points, but these can be easily ignored for what it offers in return.			"

												My feelings towards Bejewled-inspired puzzle games has been lukewarm at best, even when the game is recognizably good or prettied up by Square-Enix. Not to say it's a bad basis for game design, just that it was one I didn't think was for me. But Clash of Heroes took me by surprise with an intelligent twist on the whole ""Battle Bejewled"" formula with a design that gives a lot of meaning and tension in your choices. Describing it is a bit hard, but once you get a hang of the basic idea, the game then adds a bunch of ways to maximize your damage if you're patient and have some foresight. Playing optimally takes work, and it's a lot of fun once all the different tools and variations are in play. The game also has a very modular design in pretty much every aspect: every unit has a different way to deal damage and a different timing on when they deal it, the items you equip and the spells you cast can have a significant affect on what your strategy will be going into the game. And on top of that, each army comes from six different races who all play very differently from each other.In short, this is a thoroughly excellent strategy game that delivers much more than anyone would have rightly expected from it. It's often on sale for $2.50, and a bargain at twice that price.			"

												A lovely blend of Puzzle Quest and the Might and Magic franchise. The campaign lasts about 30 hours and there is a multiplayer mode. Outside of the battle mode there is very little to do, so if you aren't into the puzzle-esque battle system you won't like this game. The storyline is quite interesting and takes place before the events of HoMM V. Graphics wise the game utilizes manga-stylized characters and colorful environment.

												Beautifully drawn art and great mechanics make this game really fun, but you can only puzzle for so long I've found. Multiple storylines = lots and lots of grinding, and some missions have arbitrary goals that get really annoying due to the randomness of puzzle pieces. Frustrating at times, and the music is average, but the art and the interesting puzzle ideas make it a great game in small doses. Multiplayer is awesome though, as you lose all of the cons of the above mentioned story mode.			"

It looked like a game I never thought I'd play or like but after half an hour or so of getting to know how it plays I realised I was hooked. Since then I've played through the campaign twice, played countless matches of multiplayer and bought the game on pc. It's a solid tactical board gamey rpgish game. Really simple to get the hang of the basics but it takes time to really get used to making the most of your turns. I'd recommend it for the campaign but if you have 3 friends who'll get it as well then you can play countless hours away on the 2v2 multiplayer. Really solid game, I was pleasantly surprised.			"

												Not for everyone. This is a very unique strategy RPG where you have a battle system that resembles a puzzle game.The art style looks like an hybrid between anime and cartoons (probabilly anime-style but drawn by westeners). I like this art style, it looks very smooth and pleasant.You have your units placed on a grid and you can move and stack them. To attack, you need to stack 3 units of the same type and color vertically. You can also create walls by lining up 3 units of the same kind and color horizontally. There are also special units for various special attacks, which I won't explain here.I overall really enjoyed playing through the campaign.			"

												Kinda short, but fairly fun. I bought it mostly for the nostalga value, as ive been playing Heroes of Might and Magic V since it came out, i thought i would try this. The game play was good, but i assume it was a port from a handheld game, as it was very basic. Not a bad story, but you would enjoy it most if you were into Heroes already, I would only suggest getting this game if you liked Heroes V.			"

												This was a solid game.  The combat mechanic is simple - line up 3 of the same color units vertically to attack or horizontally to defend, create combo chains, cast an occasional spell.  The story is decent, units look pretty, multiplayer is quick and seems to work well.  I got 20 hours of entertainment out of it for 2.50 and might go back for more multiplayer down the road.  Buy it.			"

												This game took me a bit by surprise. I originally bought it on my android phone because it was on sale and while I liked it I had a bit of trouble getting into it because I had a hard time seeing some of the unit colors clearly on the small screen. When it went on sale on steam over the holidays I grabbed it and have been pleasantly surprised by the mechanics of the game. You can develop your strategies based on how many turns your units take before they attack and what particular strengths they have. Using different types of units can allow you to build up waves of attacks that complement one another. So, I have found that for what I was expecting to be a fun but not terribly complicated game it actually has some decent depth to it.			"

												Great mixture of puzzle and RPG elements. Gets a little boring/repetitive in the middle, but once you reach the Heresh campaign you start to appreciate how different the heroes are and how much you have to adapt your play style to be successful. The art is great, even if the story is a little mundane. It relies a little more heavily on luck than Puzzle Quest, due to having less space to work with, which can be frustrating at times. Overall, still excellent for a good 30hrs to obtain 100% completion.			"

												4/5 : A different approach to the classic match 3 puzzle game.  This is not Bejeweled and, in fact, cannot be more different.  It is closer to a hybrid of Plants vs. Zombies, Heroes of Might and Magic, and Ogre Battle.  Solid gameplay, lots of fun.Complaints: Too many loading screens and each campaign does not differ enough in terms of gameplay.  Each race should be significantly differently.  Instead, while the strategy for each may differ, you can play them all the same and get away with it.  At $15 the price is a little high.  However, I've put in 12 hours and I still have a few campaigns to finish.			"

												It may not look like much compared to any games in the Might&Magic series, however there is more than this game than it's cover lets on. While staying impressively true to the Might&Magic universe, it brings a lighter mood to the usually serious Might&Magic games. Even in it's ""combat"" you can see many similarities to past games of the series. Though don't be confused, this game is much different. It is more strategic than anything, and often requires you to think about your moves rather than just throwing units at the enemy. It is probably one of the most relaxed, fun, and challenging strategy games I have ever played. Not to mention the availability of co-op online gameplay, which brings in even more strategy than with just one-on-one gameplay.There aren't many cons I can think of off the top of my head. If anything, it would be the role luck plays in many of the games. Sometimes you just get delt a bad hand, and that can ruin the whole game. Even with the Relics you get from playing the campagin, they often aren't enough to save you from a bad start. Or sometimes the enemy start is just so good, you can't come back from his initial moves.Even so, this game is great. Whether you're into hardcore strategy or just enjoy a relaxed strategy, this game might be for you. While you can play hardcore and think 5 billion moves ahead of the other player(s) you can also just think one or two moves ahead,and still have fun, maybe even win! This is a great game, no matter what side of gaming you come from!			"

The story is completely throwaway, which is fine... but the M&M branding had me looking for something more. Levelling heroes and acquiring units and artifacts is a very linear process and more of a facade than it is an avenue for any sort of strategy or decision-making. Boss battles always involve fusing in one or two particular columns. Once you've played a few rounds you've played them all. Jump at $5. Or don't.			"

												I'm a huge fan of puzzle games, and even though the match 3 mechanic has been used on a multitude of other puzzlers; I feel that Clash of Heroes presented it in a way that still feels unique to me.  The story is great, and it has a decent play-through time; but the bulk of my over 70 hours of playtime has come from the hotseat multiplayer.  You can play a quick 20 minute amazingly fun hot-seat game with a friend with all of the artifacts and characters that you have discovered throughout your single-play through run.The graphics are charming, the music is enjoyable, it has high replay value and a great puzzle/rpg mechanic.

												Easily my favorite puzzle game of all time. The mechanics are unique, but take very little time to get used to. The gameplay finds the rare perfect blend of action and strategy, making it gratifying to play on a puzzle solving level without becoming tedious at points. The game has a single player ""campaign"" that is thoughtfully designed, but the true value of the game comes from the competitive multiplayer. This game's online community is nonexistant, with the occasional level 100 mastermind that is discouragingly good to play against, but I could not tell you what I would give to have a handful of friends to play matches against regularly.

												A pretty simplistic game in appearance that reveals its complexity through a single hour of playtime.The basic 3-units principle(to make an attack, three vertical units of the same colour, to make walls, three horizontal) gets immensely complex and varied once you add links(having groups of the same colour attack at the same turn) that reinforce your attack, fusions(two attack groups one behind the other fuse into one group twice as strong), and of course Elite and Champion units that require 2 and 4 units to activate them.Almost every single unit from every single race has a specific capacity, poison, jumping over walls, magical defenses, immunity to attack while charging, hacking the enemy lines/enemy charging power while charging, the variety added to the basic 3-units system makes this an incredibly capable game with possibilities that never seem to be insufficient no matter the circumstances. You can literally be about to be killed by your enemy, call reinforcements, and find yourself gifted with a generous unit placement that allows you to build the walls and defenses you need to just survive and counterattack to victory. There is a freshness in this game that never dies out.It's actually one of its greatest strengths and weaknesses, how random the battles can go. You can be gifted with a perfect line of units from the very start or have absolutely nothing to go on with. The game can be very frustrating when a perfectly planned attack is ruined by the sudden arrival of an enemy Champion just in the column you're about to use to finish off your foe. It can also be frustrating in the other way: you will call reinforcements to see one of your costly Champion units die immediately at the hands of some basic enemy attack with 2 attack because you couldn't get it moving in time.As frustrating and unfair as the randomness is, it is also one of this game's best aspects. The only reason I speedrun this game is that it has the merit of never(apart from the tutorials) making me feel like déjà vu. Every battle is at least new enough, no moments in the game feel like I've been here before(except the bosses, of which there are only 4, along with quite a few unfair pre-prepared battles) and even when it does happen, the randomness of the reinforcements usually palliates that very quickly.Gameplay-wise, it's simply excellent. Having played through the campaign quite a few times for speedrunning, I have yet to find this game to bore me at any point, and it's quite surprising to realise how a simple system can be at the same time constantly demanding and very free.A good example is the fusions: if you want one, with core, Elite or Champion units, you're gonna have to get rid of all your walls first, since you need six tiles to make any fusion and there are only six between the goal your enemy has to hit and your first line.Beyond that, every hero has got his own superpower which can range from somewhat poor(hello Cyrus) to ridiculously broken when you know how to use them(hello Aidan with lots of walls, Anwen with a clear opening, Markal with two uncharged Death Knights).Beyond beyond that, artifacts can be found in many flavors in the campaign and then used profusely in skirmishes or online battles. And the variety there is by no means inferior to the one in the units, although I'm sure everyone will end up using ridiculously strong artifacts like the Spider Cloak, Lion's Mane or Celerity Ring.On a side note, the balancing of the campaigns is a bit poor. Why is Nadia not only ridiculously rich in HP(she starts at level 7 out of 10!), but also given enemies that play defensively, troops that make almost no damage, and is also generously dotted with Academy enemies, who can raise layers of superwalls like drinking a cup of coffee? It makes her campaign ridiculously long and just unpleasant. The times I get for Anwen range under 50 minutes, Godric takes less than an hour, Fiona has a rather long campaign that takes about 1h10 minutes, Aidan has a rather short campaign that also takes less than an hour, and Nadia ends up taking me 1 hour 40 minutes!Continuing on the bad side, the story is completely ignorable. It's not bad(no big plot holes, awful writing or terrible characters) but absolutely nothing about it feels in any way original. The characters almost feel stereotypical, you have the courageous and honorable big brother, the courageous but more sheltered little sister, the more angsty teenage younger brother, the huntress of the woods, the good student girl who fights the good fight...All of their personalities can be written in a quick line and although they never made me facepalm(none of the main five anyway), the last thing I wanted was to be tasked with finding an interesting personality trait among them. I don't mind finding needles in haystacks, but this is just impossible.The story is of the same type, it's nothing awful, but it doesn't convey anything even remotely amusing or deep. It ends in a happy note that works but doesn't really follow the somewhat tragic storytelling we had for most of the game. It's not really light on clichés and nothing about it is worth mentioning. I had a laugh once in the entire game. A giggle, really, at the demon who dies from the volcanic eruption he wanted to see. The rest is skippable. Special mention, though, to the villains: they range from comic relief(Azexes and his forgetful schoolboy behavior) to so obvious it hurts(Carlyle and his fashion for being a general ♥♥♥♥).Visually, I like the animé art style quite a lot, and the quality of the animations is certainly very helpful at making it a nice game to watch. I do have a serious issue about those: they're long. REALLY long. Sometimes it's ok, but seeing the knight twirl his spear around before charging for the 1000th time has really grown old. Less long animations would've really helped in making the game a lot more fun. The PLAYER TURN and ENEMY TURN screens are also ridiculous, they last something like 3,5 seconds! Talk about a needless loss of time! Those could've simply not existed and all would've been better. As much as I appreciate the animé visual style for almost everyone, some races are totally failed: the good guys and necromancers are mostly fine, but the magicians' golems or titans look nothing like the machines they are, although that's nothing in comparison to the Demons and how every unit but the hound is failed. Even when lit with flames and about to strike, I find it difficult to take the immense Pit Fiend more seriously than a plushie. Demons look neither scary nor ugly, and that's a true minus for me.With all that said, the last element is the music.It sucks.No other way to say it. This game has very poor music.Out of five campaigns, forests, a capital city of men, the land of the undead, Hell, and a mighty Magician tower, I remember exactly zero theme songs. Why? Because there aren't any songs. It's all ambients. BAD ambients, with no memorable sounds at all. Whooshing winds and shaking leaves, that's all. The battle musics are thankfully very varied, however that would be a good thing only if they didn't all suck as well! Out of the eight or so battle themes, there is one I like. The final boss music is fine too. The victory theme(the first 4 seconds of it anyway) and the two former are the only songs I can say I appreciate musically out of the whole game. Having played HoMM5 before, I know that many of these songs were taken from the rest of the franchise and sort of put in this one. It doesn't fit, none of the songs are that good, so it's a game that is terribly uninteresting musically.A lot more could be said about bad minigames, Sonic 06-type loading times(two loading times into each battle), but I reached the limit.Final word is that despite my complaints, this is an incredibly fun and varied game that always develops into more complexity and fun. Try it.			"

												Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes is a strategy game with RPG elements, at first I didn't think it would be that fun but I love this game.  I put over a hundred hours into it and I would gladly play the story over again.  It is not like bejeweled or the typical “match 3 items” game.  Depending on the direction that you make the match in (horizontal or vertical) it will make a wall or make an attack formation.  There are other special units that you can make into an attack formation that deals massive damage.  As you play through the story you unlock new units to put them into your army.  As I said, this game has RPG elements and has a level-up system as you gain XP.  You gain XP simply by winning battles.  The music is fantastic in the game and is very intense.  Art is well done and very colorful.  The game was challenging enough but not too hard at the same time.  I enjoyed that for the final boss you actually had to sit down and plan a strategy before you made your next move.  The Multiplayer is very fun as well.  There are 1v1 and 2v2 options.  You get to choose your units and artifacts and then play against a friend or team up with one and play against two others.  I would highly recommend the game.  It was very entertaining and well worth the money I payed for it when it first came out.			"

												I love the art design of this game, which is one the main reason I gave the game a spin(the other being curious about HoMM universe). It's part puzzle and part strategy, and whole lot of luck. You set up an army before battle selecting 3 core units (read: cannon fodder/fuel), and two specail units(either elite or ultimate). Core units can attack by making a vertical line of three same color unit(plus charge time). Walls are made by a horizontal line of three same colored core units(these absorb damage of course). The special units need to be powered by the corresponding colored core unit placed behind the special unit(elite 2 units and ultimate 4 units). You also get a special move that differs on the hero leading your army. In single player they're all are balanced, but in mutiplayer you gain access to some broken characters due to their magic skill. Items can be equip to give you an advantage. Story is standard fare, fun gameplay, and some very funny one-off characters. I liked it.			"

												I'm a huge fan of puzzle games, and even though the match 3 mechanic has been used on a multitude of other puzzlers; I feel that Clash of Heroes presented it in a way that still feels unique to me.  The story is great, and it has a decent play-through time; but the bulk of my over 70 hours of playtime has come from the hotseat multiplayer.  You can play a quick 20 minute amazingly fun hot-seat game with a friend with all of the artifacts and characters that you have discovered throughout your single-play through run.The graphics are charming, the music is enjoyable, it has high replay value and a great puzzle/rpg mechanic.  Very much worth it in my opinion.			"

												Really surprised me, much more strategic then what I thought it would be. Huge campaign, and I'm told theres a decent multiplayer, though I can't imagine it's still active. It's technically like a match 3 color coded thing, but all the different troops and how varied they are, the different objective battles, the war between making a barrier or an attack formation, really gets you in the game. The story is decent, nice atmosphere, definitly in the realm of M & M.			"

												Interesting gameplay. Matching like colors with different types of units can get very strategy-oriented. My wife and I bought it thinking that you can play 2-player co-op against AI computer opponents, but you cannot do this in the PC version. I think you can on the Xbox version, which might be where my confusion came from when reading reviews & descriptions. We're both happy to play the base campaign and occasionally play against each other in ""multiplayer"" mode -- there's an option to host the game and then a Steam friend joins your game in progress.The in-game help system is very lacking -- there's a lot of figuring it out on your own, which is sort of a puzzle in itself. I can't seem to find a manual anywhere online for it. It's an older game that has been released for various platforms (phones, consoles, etc) and re-made in HD for Steamworks.			"

												I haven't played Multiplayer yet but have finished the campaign. It's a really cool game that I enjoyed mostly because it doesn't have things I hate about Heroes of Might&Magic. Without gameplay elements that kept me away from Might&Magic games I had a lot of fun with this game. Those Puzzel-Quest fights are surprisingly fun and  interesting, especially if you find a fraction that you like and suits you well.Pros:-Interesting gameplay-Well done manga-styled graphics -Not bad plot, I enjoyed reading dialogues-If you don't take it too serious, the game can be really funny -It depends on luck pretty much only at the begining of a fight-Some units are just so cool to use: Sukkubs, Ghosts, Vampires, Angels or Knights (in my case)-There are side quests (and sometimes in the actual plot) where you fight with different rules.Cons:-Academy is sooo boring... I could finish whole part of the campaign on one sitting but the one with Academy I had to struggle to even play. -You can be tired of doing the same thing over and over-There is no really any trouble with fights because you can start them over and over (after being deafeted) without any waste of units/resources or anything-It's not Heroes of Might&Magic but a different game- remember it. If you like Heroes it doesn't mean you will enjou this game (but there is a demo on Steam).			"

It looked like a game I never thought I'd play or like but after half an hour or so of getting to know how it plays I realised I was hooked. Since then I've played through the campaign twice, played countless matches of multiplayer and bought the game on pc. It's a solid tactical board gamey rpgish game. Really simple to get the hang of the basics but it takes time to really get used to making the most of your turns. I'd recommend it for the campaign but if you have 3 friends who'll get it as well then you can play countless hours away on the 2v2 multiplayer. Really solid game, I was pleasantly surprised.			"

												I'm a huge fan of puzzle games, and even though the match 3 mechanic has been used on a multitude of other puzzlers; I feel that Clash of Heroes presented it in a way that still feels unique to me.  The story is great, and it has a decent play-through time; but the bulk of my over 70 hours of playtime has come from the hotseat multiplayer.  You can play a quick 20 minute amazingly fun hot-seat game with a friend with all of the artifacts and characters that you have discovered throughout your single-play through run.The graphics are charming, the music is enjoyable, it has high replay value and a great puzzle/rpg mechanic.  Very much worth it in my opinion.			"

												A good unique strategy game I'd highly recommend. The singleplayer is interesting enough to keep you going through the whole thing, and has things to unlock to play with in multiplayer, so you'll have to go through it if you want to compete!Multiplayer is a lot of fun and definitely has a large competitive nature to it. Some strange combination of about 70% luck and 30% skill governs the game, with an unfortunate loom of unbalanced nature to some of the strategies. It's become more of a meta-game in regards to choosing what overpowered loadout you think will counter their overpowered loadout. This unfortunately takes some of the spontaneous fun out of the game imo, I prefer to play with less popular and more entertaining strategies as it keeps the game fresh. This of course means getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me by people who just want max efficiency unfortunately, though.Anyway, I'd strongly recommend this game, you'll definitely get your money's worth out of it, at the very least. Just don't expect anything related to any other Might & Magic game from buying it.			"

												It may not look like much compared to any games in the Might&Magic series, however there is more than this game than it's cover lets on. While staying impressively true to the Might&Magic universe, it brings a lighter mood to the usually serious Might&Magic games. Even in it's ""combat"" you can see many similarities to past games of the series. Though don't be confused, this game is much different. It is more strategic than anything, and often requires you to think about your moves rather than just throwing units at the enemy. It is probably one of the most relaxed, fun, and challenging strategy games I have ever played. Not to mention the availability of co-op online gameplay, which brings in even more strategy than with just one-on-one gameplay.There aren't many cons I can think of off the top of my head. If anything, it would be the role luck plays in many of the games. Sometimes you just get delt a bad hand, and that can ruin the whole game. Even with the Relics you get from playing the campagin, they often aren't enough to save you from a bad start. Or sometimes the enemy start is just so good, you can't come back from his initial moves.Even so, this game is great. Whether you're into hardcore strategy or just enjoy a relaxed strategy, this game might be for you. While you can play hardcore and think 5 billion moves ahead of the other player(s) you can also just think one or two moves ahead,and still have fun, maybe even win! This is a great game, no matter what side of gaming you come from!			"

												Really surprised me, much more strategic then what I thought it would be. Huge campaign, and I'm told theres a decent multiplayer, though I can't imagine it's still active. It's technically like a match 3 color coded thing, but all the different troops and how varied they are, the different objective battles, the war between making a barrier or an attack formation, really gets you in the game. The story is decent, nice atmosphere, definitly in the realm of M & M.			"

												I've given this game enough chances to prove itself.There is no option to customize opponents in quick battle mode.The UI is confusing and too little data is given about conditions of the units and the walls.The game lacks a 'one move undo' button which would eliminate harmfulness of accidental button presses (issue mostly with laptops).The game lacks a quick way to restart the battle, making campaigns tedious due to long process of loading a save and initializing the battle again.The game keeps f***ing freezing when you win a battle (see screenshots). However, the condition seems to be that the Sylvan dragon attacks on the last turn.The whole game is basically based on RNG, making victories hollow and losses frustrating without chance to learn.

												I haven't played Multiplayer yet but have finished the campaign. It's a really cool game that I enjoyed mostly because it doesn't have things I hate about Heroes of Might&Magic. Without gameplay elements that kept me away from Might&Magic games I had a lot of fun with this game. Those Puzzel-Quest fights are surprisingly fun and  interesting, especially if you find a fraction that you like and suits you well.Pros:-Interesting gameplay-Well done manga-styled graphics -Not bad plot, I enjoyed reading dialogues-If you don't take it too serious, the game can be really funny -It depends on luck pretty much only at the begining of a fight-Some units are just so cool to use: Sukkubs, Ghosts, Vampires, Angels or Knights (in my case)-There are side quests (and sometimes in the actual plot) where you fight with different rules.Cons:-Academy is sooo boring... I could finish whole part of the campaign on one sitting but the one with Academy I had to struggle to even play. -You can be tired of doing the same thing over and over-There is no really any trouble with fights because you can start them over and over (after being deafeted) without any waste of units/resources or anything-It's not Heroes of Might&Magic but a different game- remember it. If you like Heroes it doesn't mean you will enjou this game (but there is a demo on Steam).			"

												    First found this game downloading demos on Xbox arcade, fantasy puzzle game, ok. Never played the Might and Magic games.    After playing the demo I was blown away how perfectly the rpg/strategy/and puzzel aspects combined. When the demo asked me to ""press X to buy"" first time ever I actually did!    Fun and fresh following all the main characters each doing their small story arcs trying to get back together with their own trials to face, and own little armies to build up to duke it out in puzzle combat!    Even has a solid multiplayer, to play against friends with.    Give this game a try if you like puzzles and/or Fantasy!			"
