												I'm 17 years old. I'm sitting in front of my Pentium II PC and I've just finished installing Baldur's Gate. I've crafted my perfect character, and I'm now adventuring through a gorgeous world. I've fallen headfirst into the game reading novels worth of text and not noticing as hours melt away.It's 17 years later. I'm 34 years old. I'm doing it all over again and it's like I'm travelling through time.Every aspect of this game is perfect. I wouldn't change it even if I could. I find myself wondering how in-game mechanics work and I'm tempted to alt+tab and google what spell is best. Instead I just keep playing and figure it out myself. I can't even *remember* the last time I didn't look up this sort of info in a game. Who cares if this sword does a little more damage than that spear? My character likes that spear and he looks awesome wielding it.This is the first Kickstarter decision I've made that I am completely happy with. Thanks Obsidian for taking me back in time and reminding me that you don't need gamefaqs to enjoy a game.			"

												I noticed that most people reviewing this game have previously played similar games. I don't have much experience with CRPG'S at all, thats why I thought my view of the game can give another perspective on things. That means I have not played games like Dungeons & Dragons, Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale or Neverwinter Nights before playing this game.Pillars of Eternity starts of with a character creation. The amount of options that you have here is absolutely crazy. You can probably spend hours here, changing every little detail. You pick your sex, race, class, attributes, culture, appearance and finally voice.This game have many difficult settings and are obviously made for replayability. Pillars recommend that you start on easy difficulty, so I did. I most say that easy in this game isn't that simple! Loadscreens while you rest are pretty and some other environments in the game, like dungeons and forests. I like the details on the characters, it's very sharp, even when you zoom in. The only complaint I have is that some backgrounds are a little blurry and low res, which looks a little bit silly when it's next to a very detailed character. I get that they went for an ""old-school look"" but I still think that doesnt really match. But when you zoom out that won't really bother you.I recommend that you crank the volume up for this title, because background noise and sounds, in the dialogue and in combat, are great. It will help you get into the story and atmosphere better.Ventors in the cities and villages will buy all the trash you loot from enemies. You can buy camping tools, weapons and potions from them. If you have many followers you can carry more items, and all items can be transfered over between anybody in your party, which is great. So if I find a staff as barbarian I can simply open up the inventory and equip in on my mage.You will have to read most of the dialogue yourself, although some story related things are read for you. I still wouldn't recommend this game if you hate reading, because there's a lot of it. You can right click on items and spells to read everything about them as well. Some are just lore stuff, others are actually useful information.The story is dark and mysterious. Combat in done with real time and pause. You can also use slow motion in fights to make things more manageable and easy. As you level up your character and possible followers, you gain points which you can spend on things like sneak, survival, etc. You also get to pick spells.You can create really silly partys if you want. You can combine all the races and even have animal followers like bears. It's entirely up to you who you bring along the quests and you can choose how they will look like, what weapon they will use and what role they will have in combat.Options menu is very good. You can customize everything they way you like it in terms of controls. The graphics options are not as good, but for this type of game I wouldn't say its needed.The replayability is obviously insane when you think about how many races, followers and difficulty levels this game has. You can play the entire game solo, or you can choose to bring mages, dwarfs, godlikes, wizards, humans...and so on, with you. You can also create different kinds of humans, elfs, etc. It's fantastic.Obsidian Entertainment has created a great game overall, that even new CRPG players like me can enjoy. I have barely scratched the surface of this game, but I can already see that amount of work put into this title. It's fun, dark and mysterious and im having so much fun playing and learning new things everyday.Highly recommended title, if you don't mind reading of course.			"

												Pillars of Eternity is an isometric party-based computer RPG using real-time-with-pause combat.What is Great about this game:- Complex and deep story that moves the game along incredibly well- Deep character creation and multiple classes each with multiple viable playstyles bringing significant variety to your own playthrough- Rich and appropriate back story, lore, and flavor text added throughout the game that is worth reading- Enjoyable tactical combat with numerous options for pausing and other options to make the game more enjoyable- Unique and sometimes fascinating quest lines with multiple alternative methods for success (e.g. talk yourself out of a combat encounter)- An ending storyline that was possibly the most thought-provoking and intelligently written as any I have experiencedWhat is Good about this game:- The game looks quite nice but could have used more art/animantions to improve it further- The voice acting is quite good where it exists- Good use of Steam features (cloud saves, trading cards, achievements, etc)What is Bad about this game:- The combat could have been significantly improved (although still very good) by including methods to automate companions similar to the systems in FFXII or Dragon Age: Origins- Given how story heavy this game is, it would have been much improved by including more voice-over work.  The voice acting is very good, but is only available sparsely.  The writing is more than worth reading, but having it spoken would have been that much more engrossing.Conclusion:Pillars of Eternity is the current pinnacle of story-telling in RPGs with a great combat system and a classic style.9.5 / 10.0			"

Pillars of EternityDeveloper: Obsidian EntertainmentPublisher: Paradox InteractiveNote: I will try to be as spoiler-free as possible.Note #2: I don't think I can do this game justice, but I'll try anyway.Introduction==========Quite possibly the best isometric CRPG to be released in recent years, Pillars of Eternity is an entirely new world expertly crafted and filled with lore created in the style of the classic Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale games. Any fan of these games will instantly fall in love with Pillars of Eternity and it's similar design.Gameplay==========Played from an isometric top-down view, Pillars is packed with things to do. You play the game entirely by mouse, pointing and clicking to navigate each area, converse with NPCs, battle enemies, and more. One of the best things about this game is that it is extremely detailed and immersive with it's superb storytelling. Pretty much exactly like the titles mentioned above. There is a literal TON of reading, as everything is presented to you in much the same way a dungeonmaster or storyteller in a tabletop game would. Every detail is spelled out for you, and you get to make you own choices in each dialogue. Most of these choices have a profound impact on the outcome of whatever quest you are on (people can and will die!), and even the main storyline.You start out by creating a character from a huge list of options. There are a small handful of races, several classes, and you can even choose some regional differences for each race. You could easily spend and hour or more creating your first character. Along with your ""main"" character, there are 8 (10 with The White March Part I add-on) unique companions you can recruit. You can also create more characters to join your party after a certain point. Each character can be customized the way you see fit from an extensive list of spells, abilities, auras, talents, and equipment.One of the big features of Pillars is the Stronghold. Shortly into the game you come into ownership of a stronghold called Caed Nua. Caed Nua, once owned, can be upgraded and repaired to offer you a variety of new features, goods, and services. For example, you can build an Inn that will allow you to rest. Another example is you can construct a barracks which unlocks the character creator. Also found underneath Caed Nua is an extensive maze-like dungeon, which can be explored throughout the game, with each floor getting more difficult. There are many options in battle, and probably the most helpful (but sometimes annoying) of which is the Auto-Pause feature. This can be set to activate when any number of events occur, such as a character's Endurance dropping too low. Pausing allows you to survey the battlefield and make the best decision possible to turn the tide back into your favor. An important part of any RPG is inventory management. With a game of this scope, there are naturally a ton of different items: weapons, armor, accessories, food, potions, scrolls, crafting ingredients, and more. With all of these items, you need a way to store and manage everything. Thankfully, each character has their own inventory, and you can freely move items between them at anytime. But the biggest boon to item management is the Stash. On your inventory screen, you will see a large button with a Treasure Chest on it. This is your Stash, which can be accessed from nearly anywhere, at anytime, and is seemingly infinite in capacity. If it has a limit, I never found it!Most RPGs are packed full of quests and tasks, and with this comes th eneed to manage them. The quest log in Pillars is pretty detailed, giving a sort of summary of any actions taken during a quest. This is extremely helpful, in that if you take a break from the game you can easily come back and jump right back to what you left off on. This is a common complaint of some of the larger RPGs, that when picking the game back up after awhile players have no idea what they were last doing, so they start over. Pillars eliminates that problem entirely.When you reach the edge of a map, you are able to leave the area and return to the World Map. From here, you can travel to any previously visited location no matter how far across the map it is. This fast travel is extremely helpful in navigating the world and completing objectives.Graphics==========If you liked the graphics of Baldur's Gate, then you'll love the updated style Pillars of Eternity offers. You can zoom in and out at anytime, and the closer you zoom in, the more detail you will see on nearly everything. The characters in particular are very well done, as are the environments and maps of each area. They all look superb. I simply cannot say enough about how good this game looks. All of it is very well-made and designed, and really draws your eye to the details. It's just so detailed and beautiful as a result. The only downside is that there isn't too much variety. The entire base game map is mostly woodlands and forests, and all of the dungeons look really similar...stone and darkness. It isn't until you get the White March Part 1 add-on that you start to see more varied environments (SNOW!).Sound and Music==========Absolutely amazing. The soundtrack is wonderfully immersive, and extremely well-done. Making the soundtrack available in the store was a great move. Once I'm able to afford the Champion Edition upgrade, I'll definitely get it JUST for the soundtrack alone. I'm a huge fan of video game music anyway. I found no problems with any of it. Every track was expertly paired with the right situations in-game for full immersion.The sound effects are extremely well done too, even footsteps. This is a game I play with my sound up full blast, there's a lot of details in each area that's conveyed via the sound. Each area has a lot of ambient effects, like crickets in a woodland setting or stones shifting as you traverse a dungeon.Performance==========This game ran flawlessly on my low mid-tier rig. No hiccups whatsosver. No framerate drops, lag, stuttering, or random crashes. The framerate did appear to be capped at 30 though, as I never saw it go over that. I'll need to pay attention next time I play and make a note about it.One of the main complaints (well, only complaint) I have with this game is that inbetween every single area you will run into a loading screen that takes anywhere from 5-15 seconds to clear off. Thankfully, these screens feature some beautiful artwork and often helpful tips about the game, so it's not too big of an issue.Final Thoughts==========Pillars of Eternity is a MUST PLAY for fans of the CRPG genre. A truly immersive and expansive adventure that you can play your way. If you enjoyed any of the games mentioned at the top of this review, you *need* to have this game in your library. And with the recently released White March Part 1 add-on and accompanying patch that added some much needed features to the game (Party AI), it's gotten even better! Don't pass this up, it's well worth the price of admission.Gameplay Demo==========

												After over 100 hours I finally finished Pillars of Eternity and I think I'm ready to write this review.Is this game good? It's more than good, it's great. It's not only one of the best RPGs of all times, it's also one of the best games I've ever played. It has great story, beautiful graphics, sound and music, deep mechanics and everything what good RPG game needs. But don't expect revolution, this is just step ahead in comparison to best classics like Baldur's Gate.So what you may expect? Pillars of Eternity is pure old-school RPG in modern times. Engine is very classic, but modern in the same time. So you have 2D view, but with zoom. Combat is in real time with active pause. There is a lot of reading and dialogues. You will spend a lot of time to manage your party stats, skills and inventory. I played in hard difficulty and it was necessary to survive.What about world and mechanics? There is new world and RPG mechanics made by Obsidian, but it has a lot in common with Dungeons and Dragons. It's heroic fantasy with many races (there are elves and dwarves too) and classes (like paladins, warriors and clerics), which combines elements we all know and love, with some new ideas, which is great. One word about spellcasters. I love the way how each magic class is different to each other, they use totally different spells and strategy, there are many fresh ideas here.Also other thing is great. Best dialog system I've ever seen. Here you may feel your how your reputation and stats affects your dialog options.But not everything is perfect. There are some things in that game, that would be improved, like your castle for example. This is clear that potential of this idea isn't fully exploited. Sometimes I felt like this part of the game was done in a rush.VERDICT:If you're an old-school RPG fan, this is must have for you. With this game you will feel the same magic as you felt playing Baldur's Gate.If you're younger player, I'm not sure you will be so delighted as I am. I can recommend this game to everybody but I know there are many people which expect more intense RPGs in modern style. So if you like to read a lot and think what to do, try this game and find the ancient magic.Like this review?

												It's hard not to compare this with Divinity: Original Sin. Both were funded on Kickstarter, both have a 91% score on Steam, both are rich, engaging cRPGs, and they were released months apart. It's fair to say both games have been wild successes that have surprised even the developers. If you had to pick ONE of these to invest time in which should it be?Turn-based vs. Real-time with pause: I eventually came to accept and even enjoy the real-time with pause combat of Pillars, though I much prefer turn-based. Real-time combat presents many problems that aren't the result of player mistakes. On numerous occasions I'd have characters stuck in place because the pathfinding didn't work right. The real-time combat often felt like a jumbled, chaotic mess instead of the tactical plan I had set out. Divinity is much cleaner in this respect and offered a much better experience, especially with respect to using the environment as a weapon. With Divinity I felt each power had a time and place, whereas with Pillars I ended up spamming the same powers and hoping for the best.Story: Pillars of Eternity definity wins out here. While the story in Divinity:OS wasn't bad, I would call it playful to the point of campy. Pillars had a deep, mature fantasy story worthy of a novel. While it was almost too much reading at times, the story was serious, dark, and dealt with real themes. Art: Pillars harkens back to the golden age of Infinity Engine games like Balgur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, etc. The scenes are appealing, but prerendered and they felt a little static. This helps stoke the nostalgia for the late 90s, but Divinity feels up-to-date and immersive. Couple the art style of Divinity with it's highly interactive environments, and the world of Original Sin ends up feeling much more alive. Music: Both were great soundtracks but Pillars feels just a bit derivative of the Lord of the Rings movies. They aren't bad at all, but almost generically fantasy at times. Music is important here because when you spend tens of hours in these worlds, you're gonna get this music stuck in your head.In short, you should play both if you love deep, isometric, high-fantasy, western computer RPGs. If you MUST pick, consider the following choice. Choose Pillars of Eternity if you favor story and choose Divinity: Original Sin if you prefer combat. Both are hallmarks of a great RPG and each specializes beautifully.			"

												Pillars of Eternity, one more try to make the ""sucessor of Baldurs Gate"", one of the biggest Kickstarter projects made by rpg veterans Obsidian Entertainment.So, after nearly 50 hours playtime (i´m around the last third of the game) what can i say to the big promises? First off, the world of PoE is very detailed for a newly made one, the history, races and classes are partly innovative, partly good old fantasy genre like.The gameplay itself naturally orientates itself on the old masters, you create your character, who can alter the fate of the world in an epic storyline, while finding allies for his group on the way through the story (which can alternatively be filled with custom made characters.. or you can even try to go through it alone).Regarding classes there are new ones like the cipher and many known ones from barbarian to priests to the different gods (a nice extra for these is, that the way how they act throughout the game influences how ""satisfied"" their deity is with them).Regarding classes and ""improvements"" here also shows one of the main changes of PoE, there are rather less skills, then usually known in old time rpgs. Also the classes are not limited as how they advance in them. For me, i honestly preferred the old way a bit, when not everyone could learn anything but to each his own. Also it seems to me that especially the rogue class suffers from that choice, as everyone can learn about traps etc. now.. so the only thing really special about them is backstabbing. Stealing isn´t possible anyways.When advancing in levels the classes differentiate again a bit more through perks, which can be aquired on selected levels (some general, some bound to different requirements).Graphic and music are top level for this kind of game, only the camera possibilities/movements could be improved, especially during battles or while in towns etc.Regarding quests, dialogue and story in general there are few things to complain about, the main storyline is branching and quite interesting, the happenings on the way have mostly more then one way to complete them. Furthermore there are different factions you encounter and can ally with them and in general the way you behave throughout the game affects every location/faction. Last but not least you also have the possibility to get your own stronghold, which is to be restored as well as cared about.. and even has an own multiple level dungeon. Personally i would have wished for some more class specific dialogue options (especially the cipher class), but that´s a minor complain.Your companions are well made and have their own personalities as well as quests, though could use some more banter.On a further note regarding Obsidian and their reputation for delivering bug plagued games, i think the self management through Kickstarter helped them, as i had few problems in that regard. Also the game keeps getting improved after release. The downside of the Kickstarter, if you want to call it one, are many KS characters, who stand around throughout towns mostly and some little sh*tstorm made once more by some extremists who were to dumb and fanatic to understand irony.Conclusio: If you are a fan of (old) isometric, group related rpgs on an epic scale then you can´t do anything wrong with this game.

Pillars of EternityNote: Each field is weighted differently, and thus affects the overall score differently.  Field Rating Review   Graphics 8.5 While the isometric envrionments are absolutely gorgeous, the character models leave something to be desired. Overall though, the world that has been crafted in Pillars of Eternity is absolutely beautiful, and calls you to explore every damp dungeon, and every overgrown ruin. Combat animations, especially spells, are extremely satisfying to watch, as each spell has very unique and detailed animations.   Gameplay 9 A revival of the classic Infinity Engine style of gameplay, Pillars of Eternity is true to its roots. With pausable real-time combat, a maximum of 6 characters to control (12, if you choose all rangers with pets...if that's your thing), and plenty of spells and playstyles to choose from, you are bound to find a playstyle that fits you and that you enjoy. Choose between 11 different classes, 6 different races, and several more sub-races, and customize your characters look to start crafting the story you want to experience. With wonderful voice acting, fanstastic story-telling, a vast world with tons of content, and even your own Stronghold to upgrade and maintain, Pillars of Eternity welcomes both old and new players to the genre with open arms.   Story 10 The world in which Pillars of Eternity takes place has been lovingly crafted, with hours upon hours of lore to sift through and explore. Usually in games, I quickly open and close the books you pick up, and skip through dialogue rather quickly, simply wanting to get to the point (looking at you Skyrim, Dragon Age, etc). However, in Pillars of Eternity, I have found myself spending hours reading all the books available that explain the world of Eora, and talking to every NPC I can find, following every branch of dialogue. I have come to actually care about my companions that tag along with me, and want to know more about them and their background. The wonderful voice acting (though sometimes strangely absent) only helps to further create depth in this incredibly imagined world.   Multiplayer N/A This game is all about the single-player. Enjoy it.   Replayability 3 The drawback of such story heavy games, is there isn't often a reason to go back and play them, other than to experience the game through a different class. However, since you are able to have 6 companions at a time in Pillars of Eternity, you can experience each character class through a single play-through. Really the only reason I find to go back for another round at the game is to make some different choices, try a harder difficulty, or achievement hunt.    Overall 9.1/10 I was, personally, not a fan of the Baldur's Gate series, much less any games like it. But Pillars of Eternity has enthralled me enough with its story that I have come to love it dearly, and it has opened the door to similar games for me. If you enjoy story-rich games, Pillars of Eternity is easily near the top of the list and is the game for you. If you want to lose yourself in another world for hours on end, Pillars of Eternity is the game for you. If you want to experience an epic journey in a living, thriving world that is beautifully crafted, Pillars of Eternity is the game for you. All in all, Pillars of Eternity is a game that every gamer should take the time to experience, even if only to remember how incredible a game with a good story is.

Posted: June 13, 2016
												Eternity is a high-quality, top-down CRPG which borrows a lot from the classic style of Baldur's Gate 1 and Arcanum, with complex combat rules, complex setting full of lore, and a long plot with a number of side quests. It is meaty and enjoyable for many hours, and will be of particular interest to fans of classics like Icewind Dale, which it learns from and also refines on.However, some flaws of execution leave it a bit short of the very top CRPGs like Baldur's Gate 2, Torment and Fallout 2.They rolled their own new setting, which is serviceable and compares favorably to Arcanum, Dragon Age, or Elder Scrolls. However, many details of the setting are frankly silly and awkward. While I appreciate the effort and understand about licensing issues, I don't think this helps the game.Character creation is generally nice and detailed, but it's a bit fiddly. It's also not as flexible as one might hope relative to the greats. Relative to the greats, you have somewhat more limited scope for your character. You cannot, for example, be a Glenfathan, or any more evil than a cruel hero; and all your companions are basically neutral or good. The self-defining questions you answer aren't as deep as Torment's were, and don't really affect anything. There is no way to complete a pacifist playthrough. Again, your character creation and role options are a bit limited, but you still have a number of options.The writing gets a solid B. It's not the best I've seen, but it's decent. There are some interesting themes. But that is all. I also felt there was less written content in this than say Baldur's Gate 2, with a lot of the gameplay length coming from the ""Endless Paths of Od Nua"" which is a giant grind dungeon. There is more of a combat emphasis, somewhere in between Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale maybe. The game will afford more replays if you enjoy the combats.The art, music, sound, and voice acting are all of professional quality, but not remarkable. There is not much music, and it gets repetitive. The game works well at a technical level. Linux support is good, and greatly appreciated, although they decided never to implement capes, which I don't understand. It doesn't matter much. The pace of patches has been steady, which is refreshing.Many of the complaints you will see about this game are silly whining. The ""gold plate"" characters and the tomb inscriptions have really minimal impact on gameplay; you don't have to read them, and you can remove them with mods. I think it's reasonable that you have to sneak to find hidden things, just like Baldur's Gate. I think they've made good efforts on class balance as well.			"

												Pillars of Eternity is a RPG game developed by Obsidian Entertainment, releasing on Steam in March 2015. This game is a spiritual successor to the game series Baldur’s Gate and Icewind Dale. The game was kick-started in September 2012, with the highest ever funding at the time of over $4 million. Game play in POE is very much like the other games in the series, the tactical combat with your party of adventures, and an overwhelming amount of choices in terms of stats, equipment, skill points and attacks.  The game play does get easier the further into the game you get, as you characters grow in strength and you just become more tactically aware of your surroundings and you will work out how to get the most out of all of your characters. The game is has a heavy amount of dialog, if you don’t like reading then this game is definitely not for you. The game starts off very slowly and for the first three or four hours, you will spend the majority of that time reading text and getting started with the story. Throughout all of the dialog choices, you also get plenty of important decision that can change the outcome of certain events as you progressively get further in the game, such as siding with different factions etc. Whilst the outcome of your choice is not always very clear, the game does a very good job of masking those decisions without you realising how important they actually are. Right from the character creation screen, you will see how in-depth this game goes, there is an abundance of choice and options for you to make whilst creating your character. I was a little disappointed to see that I actually reached a level cap towards the end of act three, so almost half way through the game, I couldn’t progress my character any more. This in turn made the rest of the game seem somewhat imbalanced as I was able to just waltz through the enemies without batting an eyelid. POE whilst it doesn’t have super amazing graphics, the environment and locations that you find yourself in still look gorgeous. The way the world is presented makes you want to explore it inch by inch. The UI is the most important part of this game graphically; it is smooth and functions perfectly. You are able to find all the information you need within a click or two – believe me, there is a lot of information in this game you are going to need! This game is basically a novel inside of a game. The story is often criticized by some people, but I for one was completely intrigued and loved following it right from the start. The story is deep and moving, with plenty of cliff hangers, twists and turns as you progress.  On top of the main story line, you can follow plenty of optional side quests which add so much more immersion to the world you are in, it allows for extra character development and more choices. I actually really cared so much about my characters at the end due to what they have gone through, I spent more time than I would like to admit pondering over dialog choices. Like I said above, there is a lot of text in this game, whilst a good portion is voice acted, another good portion is not. So you better be prepared for some reading. Normally I much prefer my games to be completely voice acted; it helps me get more immersed in the story and I am probably a bit lazy, but I was completely happy to read everything this game had to offer. I honestly thought I was reading a book at times. When you begin the game, the difficulty level is fairly challenging. You have to really think about your adventures’ next actions and movement, but as with most games, as you become more familiar with how the mechanics actually work, you become more and more Intune with it, allowing you to breeze through the game at points. The end boss is somewhat of a challenge, which required me to retry a couple of times. Once you get a few bits of high quality equipment, and your characters become over levelled due to the amount of experience awards in the game, you won’t find any point to be impossible to conquer though. I finished my play through of POE in just under 60 hours (not sure why Steam says I only have 45?); this was doing the majority of side quests and exploring the world quit sufficiently whilst also taking the time to enjoy the dialog in the game too. I have seen some people put well over 100 hours into this game, and I suspect that is because of the game’s high replay ability factor.  One of the main elements which makes the game replay able, would have to be the in-depth character creation, you can create a brand new character that plays completely different to your last one, making your gameplay experience different too. Personally I don’t think I would do a second play through of the game because I feel I have got all I can out of the game right now, but those that really want to drill down this game for every inch, there is definitely a high amount of replay ability on offer. The game runs like a dream too; I was able to play on 4k resolutions with the graphics turned right up. At times I did attempt to use the Steam controller, but the mouse and keyboard is the much prefer method for this type of game. The game did release with a few bugs and glitches, but after the first patch, these have all been cleaned up so I was able to play without any problems. Pillars of Eternity is any classic RPG fan’s dream. If enjoyed Baldur’s gate, or want a completely immersive in depth role playing experience, then you need to be picking this game up. Steam’s price of £34, 99 to me seems a bit excessive, but you can pick this game up for almost half that on external websites if you shop around.  For me this is a stunningly good game, that I would consider a must play.

												WARNING!Please don't bother buying Champion or Royal edition! It's not worth it at all! It's just couple of below average quality wallpapers, a few sketches, a few tasteless ringtones, a novella is very short, a documentary is on YouTube. The only things that are somewhat valuable are Almanac, Collector's Book, Guide and OST - but make sure you will be interested enough to read tons of text about the game's universe. OST is hands down really good.Better buy DLCs which are not included in pricey Royal Edition.I wish I could refund Royal Edition.As for the game - it's good!I think I like this game a bit more than Divinity Original Sin.Beautiful graphics and great optimization!Interesting mechanics and diverse classes and skills.I like crafting and enchanting systems - they are simple to use and very useful!

												I love this game.I laugh at the people who are writing negative reviews because of graphics, and because of, oh dear lord, they have to READ. *facepalm*. Explains a lot.I have currently played near 23 hours of this game, this is the most immersed in a game I have been in for ages. I don't want to stop, to eat, to go to sleep, I must keep playing! I haven't come across any bugs like other people have, the biggest bug I've come across is a piece of armour named after a potion. Yep, game-breaking bug right there.The only complaint I have is that my person can't romance anyone. Oh well, she and her wood-elf friend Aloth will be the best of friends forever! I know it!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO YOU!IF!!! You can handle beautiful yet outdated graphics, and oh my gosh, a bit of reading.			"

												Obsidian set the mandate from Day 1 of the Kickstarter that the game would be a spiritual successor to the Infinity engine games (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment).In all ways, Pillars of Eternity is a successful evolution of exactly that.  Where Infinity games were all based on Dungeons & Dragons, a system designed for turn-based combat, Pillars of Eternity maintains that same depth and feel, however built from the ground up for real time with pause combat.Pillars allows the player a choice of 11 character classes, each are a very unique experience much like the Dungeons & Dragons classes they're inspired by.  Unlike a lot of modern games that follow the MMO-inspired holy trinity design (tank, support and healer classes), Pillars, like early Dungeons & Dragons ruleset have a lot more variety in their class design.  Sure, when you go into combat, you will still have your frontline, damage, support and healing characters, but it is not quite as cut and dry.  Additionally, there is no weapon or armor type limits on your character because of your character class, so a character could be a wizard in heavy armor and a blunderbuss, whether that is a good idea or not is up for debate but it is possible.One of the biggest improvements to me over Infinity series as well as most RPG designs is the engagement system.  In most games, if a glass cannon character gets engaged by an enemy, their initial thought is to run and kite the enemy until a frontline character can reestablish engagement with the enemy.  However, if you attempt to run and kite in Pillars, you will suffer an automatic disengagement attack.  This system forces the combat to have more tactical value than what you see in most games with enemies just being kited around.Of course, that is a lot of talk about combat, Pillars also has very deep and reactive story telling through conversations and choose your own adventure style cut scenes.  In both, you will have a variety of choices based on your characters attributes and skills.  Additionally, in conversations, there is a disposition system which tracks your character in 10 different personality types such as cleverness, cruelty, honesty, and more.  These will allow for some additional role-playing through the game as you develop your character.With an unnamed expansion already announced, Pillars should have a lot of run time and with the variety of character classes and choices in the story, a lot of replayability as well.

												Get PoE on sale. It's a 6/10 for me.Here's what makes the game for me.PROs: - the game is beatiful to look at - the worldbuilding, I think the non-DND world setting came out just fineCONs:- When I think Pillars, I think loading screens. Lots of them. All the time. Getting longer and longer as you progress in the game. For 2015, a 2D game, with the amount of memory our computers have these days. No.  - The character system is designed to yield ""sensible"" characters, regardless of your choices. That's an explicit design goal. It's trying to save newcomers from thinking/planning out their parties, making sure they can be successful no matter what. I understand the attempt at minimizing frustration and catering to non-min-maxers first, concentrating on the narrative instead. But barring extreme scenarios like solo runs and speed runs, the end result is that no matter how you design your character(s), there's likely be very little difference in how you play most of the game. Your choices do not really imply a play style. - Character progression. There is little that makes a difference. The stats making a difference are defined by the level alone. That's following the ""anything should be a sensible choice"" philosophy, which translates to ""anything is an equally uninteresting choice"". So you outlevel every encounter eventually, you can't often outsmart it. There's just no speicalization choices that would make enough of a difference.- The game consists mostly of combat. Mostly of pointles combat against trash mobs. It's becomes repetetive and boring 1/3 into the game. Combat is not what I find most exciting about RPGs. I understand that combat is a very important aspect, but reducing the game to just that... - In general there is little choice and variety in how you tackle quests. In ACT I there *is* a single quest involving Raedric's Hold where you actually do have choices and options. Different points of access. Different decisions on the outcome. Different paths through the levels. Different *alliances* you can make on the way. The rest of the game: not so much. Linear ""kill everything on this map before going to the next"" design most of the time. - Buffs generally not practicalSo you're walking into the lair of a dangerous monster and you can't pre-buff your party to be more resistant to its particular attacks. You have to do this when combat starts. Which is to say, you'll not do it, because in combat it is much more beneficial to cast something offensive bringing the enemy down as quickly as possible, or debuffing him. That decision was to make sure the game did not have to be balanced around your party being pre-buffed in battles all the time, pre-buffing being considered a tedious repetitive activity. Well, in practice it results in the party not getting much of buffs at all, and the priest being a mostly useless character in or before battle, also reducing on the complexity of the game. The game could very well be balanced around having certain buffs on major fights. - Engagement mechanicsEngagement mechanics penalize movement with an almost guaranteed auto-hit (painful, since it would often crit) when trying to disengage from an opponent. That means, once you've 'crossed swords' with someone, you stay there. This was invented to prevent kiting enemies around, having them owned effortlessly by ranged party members. Again an understandable proposition. In practice, that means you play PoE much like you play an MMORPG: have 1-2 high defense units take ""aggro"" and finish them off with some high DPS units lurking in the back. Rinse repeat. It also means most fights are static and not tactical at all. Your tanks go first, your damage dealers and crowd control units go in the back. The enemy AI is mostly limited to ""rush closest enemy"". So they engage with the tanks and wait to be killed. Only exception being some caster enemies which are scripted to attack/dominate party members most susceptible to their attacks.- No innovation in RPG mechanics/character behaviour beyond what what was already there in IE games. For example: getting in combat mode. Consider this situation: some random unnamed NPC peasant catches your armed-to-the-teeth 6 man party stealing his rice bowl out of his cupboard. Most likely he'll turn hostile and try to kill you. Because that's what peasants armed with a wooden spoon generally do when defending their rice bowl against 6 hardened warriors ready for battle, waving swords around that are covered in magical flames. Even bodyguards at a brothel should run away if outnumbered 3 to 1. Oh, and nobody takes offence at the carnage if you 'legitimately' kill half a village, and two factions because 'the gods' demanded it as part of a quest to 'gain favor'... You're being a murderous villain and nobody even seems to care. That's not RPG. Even as far back as Gothic I you could beat somebody down, rob them blind with all the consequences for faction status etc, and yet not kill them. I expected something beyond ""killing everyone is the best and most straight forward solution to every quest"" in PoE. Where are some smarter choices like locking enemies in a trap for example?- The Stronghold mechanics are a joke. Its benefits are obscured by load screens. The investments you make you'll never recoup from the taxes you get across the entire duration of the game. It is mostly devoid of any life, and not the hub of operations at all. The benefits are not better than going to the next best city/village hub. And mostly, it's a bunch of annoyances waiting to happen: You have to keep coming back to defend the keep, you have to watch all your captives flee eventually, you have to micro-manage some chars to 'escort' visitors lest they cause trouble, you have to micro-manage some chars to go on '#prestige-modifier'-Adventure, to come back with some copper and no rewards to speak of, much less even a summary of what they were supposedly doing. There's not a single plot option open to you if you have invested in your keep, as opposed to not investing in it and letting it rot. So it's an annoyance that costs micromanagement effort and money. I expected better.instead of time-based mechanics for stronghold taxes everything hinges on 'stronghold turns' which are artificial units that tick away as you solve quests and tasks (of which there are only so many). That is to prevent rest-spamming and getting filthy rich from the tax income. Same for stronghold ""adventures"". So here you have it, you'll invest all that money into your stronghold to then not be able to ""role-play"", by just roaming the land for a bit, and wait for the next tax day to upgrade your kit with. Nope, you'll have to keep playing quests exactly like you would if the stronghold was not even there. And then eventually you'll get a pittance of a tax while you've just resolved a quest somewhere. - Crafting is uninspired. Yes you can do it. But you can do it anywhere, with pre-defined recipes that you know from the outset and hardly learn additions to. Apparently every brainless♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥can just pop out a flower, some bat ears, a ruby and 300 coppers to 'enchant' their favorite pair of pants to be #{damage-type}-proof on the spot. No probs. Oh, but only of they are at least level 4.- The story itself. I liked the world and writing. I did not like the pacing/presentation at all. To me it made no sense that the main character is chasing the villian so relentlessly. Aside from problems with player character motivation, it's just not original to have the story be an uninspired chase of an ever elusive villian from hub to hub. The motivations of the villain itself are not clear most of the time, so there isn't even a 'cause' to attach to. If you like BG1 as it is, you're going to like PoE. But unless you've spent the last 10 years under a rock, you'll feel the flaws most keenly as well. You've likely played better.			"

												Have you ever played Baldur's Gate? Icewind Dale? Neverwinter Nights?Well, those games are called CRPGs: computer role-playing games.Pillars of Eternity fits just right in as their spiritual successor.ProsI bought it on a sale (60% off) so I felt my money was well spent!I finished it in about 80 hours and I took my time but didn't see everything. The money per hour ratio is pretty low, which is nice; I finished the game wanting for more! I won't buy the expansion now since I'm poor, but I'll add them to my wishlist; Gotta love the hoarding, exploring and destruction feelings; Weapon improvement is awesome; There's no such thing as an alignment: you get a reputation on regions by how you portray yourself on situations. I know some people say it's a con, but ♥♥♥♥ them.   Reputation: Irrational +1, Aggressive +1.  ConsSometimes dialogs are boring so I skipped them. The main story is about lost souls and past lives and stuff, but to be honest I felt it was too wordy sometimes; Dialogs are displayed like this: ""What is he doing?"" - you asked yourself while reading this guy's review. - ""I guess I can see the point now"", you mumbled while scratching your chin.  Sometimes the quoted sentences are voiced, but the other parts are not and there's no pause for you to read what's in between the voiced sentences. This actually irritated me a lot. It broke the immersion so much I just hurried the silent reading and considered the voice acting a distraction. I used to feel relief when the sentences weren't voiced so I could take my time; I couldn't find a key that centers the screen on character. Maybe there is one but I was way too lazy to find it; Some minor UI bugs, but none of them were a show-stopper. I'm a Unity developer myself and I know UIs can be a pain to fix, but sometimes pop-ups were flickering fast and making the text hard to read. This gave me a bad first impression since it happened at the character creation screen;Some things I learned the hard wayAny class can disarm traps: there's a skill called Mechanics so just invest on it. Make a rogue only if you love sneak attack like me;Characters are moving too slow? Press D to turn on Fast Mode;Endurance is how much punishment you can take before fainting in battle. When the battle is over, all characters get up and fill their Endurance with part of their overall Health. If a character faints in battle there's a severe random debuff that only go away when resting; I tried playing on normal difficulty, but after a while I sticked to easy.  This change only applies to maps you haven't visited yet.  I know some people like to suffer and get maimed by the game, but I'm in for the ride and good times; When picking up loot, you can put it all at your party's stash (it's the chest at the bottom-left corner of the UI). Every character has 20 slots for stuff, but you don't need to fill them. Ever; You can spend some gathered items to improve weapons and armor only AFAIK. Do it on unique items since they have buffs you can't get by any other means; Same bonuses given by equipment don't stack. If you have gloves that give you Might +1 and a headgear that gives Might +2, you'll only get the +2 bonus; Pets are cute but useless. I thought they would evolve to something fierce and dangerous, but no, they just follow you all over the place. A pretty useless feature if you ask me.Overall the experience is awesome and I believe it's worth the price and the effort.Unless you don't like CRPG, and in that case I'm wondering why you read this far.Thanks for reading and here's an ascii crooked cat to commend you on your efforts:|\- - -/||  o_o  | \ _^_/ "

												Pillars of Eternity is incredibly in-depth and one of the closest experiences to Dungeons & Dragons I've had in a video game. The storyline is definitely one of the more interesting ones, with an incredible amount of lore to explore and each character you meet has a background just waiting to be heard. The environments are gorgeous. And the combat is deep & challenging and a real plus for fans of Balder's Gate and Dragon Age. I would highly recommend checking it out. Especially for fans of the old Infinity Engine games and cRPGs. It's fun!

												Pillars of Eternity is maybe a hard approach for people who never played Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale (or any other Infinity-Engine Game), as Diablo 3, Dragon Age and other Action-Roleplaying-Games are out these days. But if you have played e.g. Baldurs Gate (and so on...) it's like a warm welcome home. All characteristics of good and old fashioned roleplaying are fully included in Pillars of Eternity. On top of that comes a wonderfully detailed painted world, a great and lovely written Story along with very fine dialogues and character interaction. I highly recommend it to every fan of Infinity Engine Games, as well as to everybody who is looking for a challenge along roleplaying and to those who are not thrown back by slightly outdated graphical styles and the absence of a Coop- or Multiplayermode.To be honest, there are not that many overly outstanding features - I like the Keep Building and the way of character development very much, the fights are nice and tactical challenging sometimes (!). There are also some nice hints and referers to other games and stories. All I expected from PE was a solid RPG in the Style of Baldurs Gate - and yes, that's what I got.With that I want to adress the pricing, which seems to be a problem for many people out there at the moment. Judging about the worth of a game is pretty subjective, of course. But I'll try to approach it from an almost neutral point of view; in Germany it's at 41,99€ at the moment what makes it a fullpriced title. Does it contain playtime and replayabilty worth that price? Yes! But does it contain a mindblowing new experience to RPGamers? No! If you're looking for new and innovative games, better search elsewhere. This is an all-classic experience, polished to glow these days, but not to brightly shine.So the price may be a bit to high at the moment. People who either don't really care or are into the genre anyways should buy it. Those who just want to test and give it a quick look better shouldn't at the moment, instead they better wait for a steam sale or online-distributor deal.The point and the grounding of this choice is; Are you aware of what you get? Get informed - The Internet offers so many ways these days. Personally I have a great load of fun with it. And when I play I find myself spending almost 4+ hours a session afterwards, which is a mark for a good game to me. Thanks for reading!			"

""What if we can be assured of nothing?"" - Iovara ix EnsiosIt should be sometime around the summer of 2002 when I discovered the existence and the concept of not any computer RPG - but specifically Baldur's Gate, and every classic computer RPG Bioware and Black Isle Studios produced thereafter. I was just old enough to play a story oriented game by the time, and possessed enough language skills to get a liking to story narrative + fantasy literature. So my formidable adventure with CRPG games began, crafting a fascination for me in the manner of roleplaying and story narrative in video games forever.It's 2016 now, and as I installed Pillars of Eternity, the tremendous hype of thousands of CRPG lovers who experienced the genre back in the time in its full glory rang in my ears. A grand expectation was at hand, and I was worried that even though it would be a sweet shot at nostalgia, this might not be a genuine deal. Then I started playing this game. 170 hours in, I completed it and I am positive that Pillars of Eternity holds the promise of being a genuine successor to old CRPGs, deserving every little bit of praise coming to Obsidian Entertainment’s way. It is a glorious experience.The mysterious world of Eora - a high fantasy setting developed by Obsidian Entertainment, and home to many creatures and concepts of wonder, both new and old for us - holds many secrets, including the secret of the Watcher. As we begin the game, we create our character, attaining him/her both expected race/class combinations and abilities, and a background to establish former personal experience. The character customization options are various, and each new Watcher we would create would most certainly hold a new approach to this mysterious world. It should be useful to note that every background/class/race combination presents a new outlook and new dialogue options for the said character, promising a diverse gaming experience even as we start.Whomever we decide to play as in this world, starts up in a caravan journey, approaching the hardy region of Dyrwood, for whatever reason that we hold at the time. The rough journey gets rougher as we get sick with high fever and troubling dreams in the middle of the night, and as the caravan takes a pause near some ruins sacred to the local people of Glanfathans. An age old dispute occurs, a slaughter takes place, then... a biawac appears - a dreaded wind storm speculated to rob people of their souls. It rips the region apart, leaving everyone as hollow, lifeless shells and somehow, we become the only survivor. Witnessing the source of the storm and coming alive out of the chilling supernatural experience, tired and frustrated, we manage to arrive the small settlement of Gilded Vale, only to be called as ""the Watcher"" by the spirit of a dwarven woman...Now, we are able to perceive spirits and touch souls, reaching for the boundary between the physical and the spiritual. From thereon, we will take on a long journey, trying to learn the nature of our abilities and the cost they attain to our sanity, searching for the mystery of this biawac, an ancient servant of a secret sect and a life long forgotten by even time itself, yet not by the soul. As we journey, we'll gather companions with their own stories and missions, harbor companionship for many, enmity for some and we'll gather a reputation for our deeds throughout the realm. Involuntarily, we'll come to learn an ancient secret and change the face of Eora forever.Excited? I knew I was when I realized that I had just spent 8 hours nonstop as I just started to play the game. The world is quite rich, characters are realistic with various personalities, outlooks and aspirations of their own, narrative is elaborate both with philosophical, social and political context - and the humor itself is point on based on party interactions and comments! As I finish the game, I find myself already missing fiery demagogies of Durance, hilarious remarks of Hiravais, smart exaggerations of Aloth and comforting anecdotes of Eder... and quite so many other NPCs with colorful personalities that I'll miss.Independent from NPC personalities, the core story mechanics and interrelation of cause/consequence are surprisingly successful. There are various ways to conclude a quest, and the way to go with any of them would subtly alter the outcome of the main scenario, as well as the tone and interaction of the world to a degree. Your choices would attain your character some characteristic values like ""benevolent"", ""cruel"", ""stoic"", ""smart"" etc. As you attain those personality values through gameplay, some NPCs start to treat you differently based on your personality consistency and reputation, presenting new outcomes based on your actions.A minor example from my experience: At some point in the game I was in Defiance Bay - the main city of the scenario, bustling with side quests. A boy approached me and asked whether I'd get a steel dagger for him. When asked what a 10 year old boy would do with such as weapon, he stated that he'd like to become a squire to a knight and he could do anything with such a weapon. Big dreams, huh? I said ""why not"", completed the mission and carried on. Sometime later I revisited the city, and turned around the corner to shop, and the town crier declared that a boy lost 3 fingers in an accident! Just... wow.Graphics exemplify the capability of Unity engine in presenting a classic Infinity engine atmosphere, and behold: results are a glamorous beauty. We have the classic isometric mapping with a six people party formation to roam around, yet on close-up we are presented with tiny artworks at every corner from the architectural wonders to the natural beauties of the realm. Every new map that you tread into is a new source of respect for the labor put into the game. The soundtrack, environmental sound effects and voice acting are all top-notch, presenting an immersive environment in an isometric gameplay - which is a hard feat by nature.Here comes the trickiest part about any RPG - combat mechanics. I won't go so far to declare that they are the best, yet with various customization options similar to D&D 3.5 mechanics, character builds are formidable. Each and every class have their strong suits and flaws, so all combat mechanics - and even some diplomacy encounters - work better in a full party. Usually, having 1-2 tank fighters - Eder is quite appropriate for that - , 2-3 dps characters - both ranged or close quarter - and a healer - Durance all the way! - is a decent party combination that would put you through the game, with some decent challenges on the way. Side note: alongside both expansions, there are a total of 5 Dragons within the realm and dragons are no joke in this game, as it should be so. Prepare yourself heavily for those encounters, they would take careful planning and more than one venture.The game harbors various achievements. Some half of those are mostly story and exploration based that would come naturally with your progress. The other half though, contain difficulty achievements that would take you to solo the game on various excruciating difficulties. I heard that Barbarian class - or a carefully arranged Chanter with decent summons - would be the way to go for that, yet the game gets patched quite often even today so I have no idea what mechanic has been polished or watered down to arrange a balance. One single achievement is only granted to kickstarter backers though, so if you haven't been a backer it is sadly out of question to %100 the game in terms of achievements.As the last verdict, Pillars of Eternity is a game worthy of the experience. It is basicaly a must for any RPG gamer!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Pillars of Eternity is an isometric CRPG from the studio that brought us Fallout: New Vegas and South Park: The Stick of Truth. One night you are travelling with a caravan through an area north of the Gilded Vale. The caravan stops for everyone to rest and you go out to get water for the group, you return to find a group of mercenaries who have killed all but one member of the caravan, a strange phenomenon occurs and you are forced to flee through a cave. When you reach the other side you find a strange ritual taking place and when it is complete, something about you is different. In Pillars of Eternity you must venture through Eora to find out what this change is and how you can reverse it.PoE is set in the fictional realm of Eora. Eora is full of different factions and races and as you play the game you will discover how they link to each other and why as well as discovering the rest of Eora's deep and incredibly well thought out lore.A couple of things to note before you carry on reading my review. Firstly I have not finished this game at the time of writing my review, I'd say I'm about a fifth of the way in but I feel like I've experienced enough of it to write a detailed review. Secondly this is the first time I have properly played a CRPG and so I'm inexperienced with this type of game so some of my opinions may differ from CRPG veterans.The Game Itself+Great graphics and well designed emvironments though the character models aren't the best+A reasonably detailed character creator with a number of different races, classes and backgrounds to choose from+An interesting main plot as well as some interesting side quests+There's a hell of a lot to do, as mentioned previously at 16 hours playtime I'm only around a fifth of the way through all of the content on offer+Due to the game's reputation system and side quests with different possible endings you can create your own story when playing PoE even though the outcome is the same+Fantastic writing, in particular the interaction of different characters who feel real due to how good the writing is, e.g. how they respond to what is being said+Some great voice acting+As mentioned before Eora has very deep lore and finding out about it over the course of the game and through the Digital Collector's book is fascinating+The combat is simple yet rewarding and you really have to think about who should attack who and with what so that you are successful, especially when fighting large groups+Eight different companions to find and team up with over the course of the game, each of a different class with unique abilities to help you in a fight+All eight companions have interesting backstories and all have a reason for being where you found them which is good to see+Relatively early in the game you get possesion of a rundown stronghold and you can restore it to its former glory, I absolutely love that kind of thing in games so I thoroughly enjoyed building it back up+The different locations in the game are rather large and each one either has or is linked to a fair few sidequest though the map looks a bit empty as there aren't too many different locations+Outstanding soundtrack and great sound effects throughout+The game's difficulty can be changed throughout+Big heads mode, thanks Josh!-Voice acting is used sporadically, the main characters all have their own voice actors yet most of their dialogue is unvoiced and you have to read it, I felt that it often broke the flow of dialogue as one section would be voiced and the next wouldn't be with seemingly no method behind it-As mentioned previously the character models don't look great-Frequent loading screens which take a long time-There's a Kickstarter backer only achievement so unless you backed it you can't get 100%Special Edition ContentThis covers the Royal Edition of the game, the first five are also available in the Champion edition. I will cover them in the order that they appear on the store page.+The OST is, as mentioned, fantastic+/-The Campaign Almanac is interesting but the font is difficult to read+The Digital Game Map is very nice and has a good amount of detail though it has a bit of a strange resolution+/-The Making Of Documentary isn't available yet-The Wallpapers are all very nice but they all have strange resolutions and aren't available in 1920x1080-The ringtones are nice little sound clips but I don't think you'd want them set as your phone's ringtone, most of them are soundclips of a character speaking+/-The Digital Novella isn't available yet+The Digital Collector's Book is very good and goes into great detail when explaining the game's lore+The Concept art is absolutely fantastic and very high quality, I thoroughly enjoyed looking through it+The Digital Strategy guide is very helpful and well writtenVerdict:9.5A truly outstanding isometric CRPG with great graphics, an extremely well-written story, good combat and rich lore to back it all up. If you're a fan of CRPGs you've done yourself a disservice by not picking this game up sooner.***This review was written using a key provided by the Publisher for review purposes***El K.			"

												What a fantastic game, I have been completely blown away so far. After playing Divinity Original Sin last year, I didn't think it could get any better but this gem has proven me wrong. The story and writing is absolutely incredible, the lore is very rich, and best of all the game is HARD. In just my 7 hours of playing so far, I have had to redo many fights, planning out new strategies, trying out new spells and weapons, all in the goal of bashing those pesky monsters to bits. Did I mention the bits, or rather giblets? Yeah, many times when an enemy is crittically injured by a blow and dies, he will explode in a shower of blood and fleshly bits, and it's always a fun sight. In the graphics department, this is a very debatable topic, but I think these lovely hand drawn backgrounds surpass many modern games in their simplistic beauty. Music and sound is also very well done, and I've taken a special interest in the great way ranged weapons sound and feel in this game.The two companions that I have come across my travels so far have been very well written, and their backstories very diverse. My only complaint on their regard is that at the moment the game has no rogue, barbarian or monk companions, so you will most likely end up filling those roles with custom adventurers or your own player character, but that is a minor gripe.In regards to equipment, scrolls, potions and a plethora of other goodies, this game has them in spades. Hundreds of common and magical weapons and armor are just waiting to be discovered, many of them very unique in both name and appearance. Thankfully, the game has a stash mechanic to store your massive hoard of items, so you can gather to your heart's content.All in all, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The one very minor bug I've ran across so far was restricted to the tutorial popups and a very odd sound loop, but disabling those easily rectified the issue so in no way does it hamper the game for me. If you are one of the many avid baldurs gate, icewind dale, or neverwinter nights fans that yearn to revist the glory days of old, look no farther because Pillars of Eternity is the perfect choice for you.

												One of the deepest RPGs on Steam from one of the most revered developers. Do not let the old school engine fool you - you can expect a high production quality for this genre. There are a few nasty bugs on release to avoid, read the forums for more information.Is it worth the $40+? Hell yeah it is. This is a real RPG.			"

												Yes it's early.  But whoa...    This game should be up for literary awards.  Only the written word can so easily, and completely, convey meaningful emotion and nuance.  Perfected along with the vibrant backgrounds, subtle yet solid soundtrack, and actually legible at high resolution text (adjustable font size in menu), this game will hold to be the test amongst all story based rpgs.  What little I have played of the combat engine has been intuitive.  Infinity engine perfected.  This game plays like a MUCH better written Baldur's Gate, except buttery as well, ...butter!   The extremely competent game mechanics hide away nicely, so that the immersion in environment and story stands unbroken for hours.  There have already been some large mood shifts and some mouth open gasps within the first 2 hours of gameplay.  I admit that I am already a huge fan of Obsidian, but it is with great reason.  I do not game for victory.  I do not game for competition.  I game to be entertained.  A 50-100 hour interactive book or movie is an immesurably better option than scrolling endlessly thru Facebook, or watching ""reality"" advervision.  Mr Sawyer, Avellone, Cain, Brennecke, Urquhart, and the rest of that team deserve an award.  Not an award given to shooters because of realistic ballistics.  No.  I am talking Pulitzer prize level descriptive writing..(in my opinion obviously).  Kickstarter gave them the freedom to be as flowery as they wanna be, and boy oh boy did it pay off.  AAA publishers and  mindless console drones, screw you and your multiplayer gib shot twitch muscle ""e-sports"".  No, not really, as that stuff has merit to you if you enjoy it.  But for me, THIS IS WHERE IT'S AT!  I have the butterflies like the first time I read LOTR, long before Elijah Wood supplanted my vision of what  Frodo looked like.  Bring your imagination and ENJOY!!>>>>UPDATE<<<<56 hours in and I love this game even more!  I have played thru some bad (mechanically) games just to see a decent story.  Not a worry here!  This story seems layered and rich, and even the game mechanics are amazing.  Anybody who doesn't like the way it plays are either looking for something specific (it does NOT play exactly like Baldur's Gate, despite similar appearance and mechanics), or they just haven't taken the time to learn the system.  If you choose to pass up an amazing artistic Tour de Force due to ""mages not being as OP as in BG"" or something along these lines, then you are very hard to please and I believe it to be a mistake.  If you like RPGs, and when you think of ""RPG"" you don't immediately think of skyrim, then this is worth a shot!!			"

												Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!Gorglax the Destroyer, an orlan aristocratic ranger, was far from home. Hell, she was far from civilization. The nearest town was a day's walk, and she needed medical attention. Ever since that storm she hadn't felt herself. She stared for a while at the clearing ahead, a quiet meadow painted purple by wildflowers in bloom. Birds chirped, flitted and fluttered. Bugs droned, bumbled and buzzed. A symphony orchestra was blasting all around her, which was more than a little jarring. Finally she was jerked from her daze by her antelope companion, Gary. “We have to get to Gilded Vale,” she said, breaking the silence. “MRRABLURGHHBLURGH,” agreed Gary the antelope (that is an approximate onomatopoeia of antelope noises). They set off to find the road when two young wolves, truants probably, attacked. Gorglax raised her arbalest, wound it, and loosed a bolt into one wolf. It whined and bled out on the soft blanket of wildflowers as the other closed in, bearing its canines. Gorglax was done for, she couldn't wind her arbalest fast enough. She shut her eyes and had all but accepted her fate when Gary the ♥♥♥♥ing antelope butted the beast, causing it to explode in a gory geyser. After acknowledging how metal that just was, the pair continued on their adventure.I liken video games to baking. Yes, the recipes are frequently rigid and mostly unforgiving of experimental deviation (one such deviation I made while baking resulted in what I've coined as “bread soup”); but even the most structured recipe allots for the 'dash,' the mysterious magic that often defines the finished product. “Oh, this is simply DELICIOUS. What did you put in this?”“Oh, this old thing? It's pretty standard: egg, milk, flour... and just a dash of magic.”“MAGIC ISN'T AN INGREDIENT, TED.”And yet that douchey non-response best describes what makes Pillars of Eternity so excellent:  it's an original CRPG with the combined minds, bodies, and souls of its classic predecessors. It is, perhaps, greater than the sum of its parts.So for the mildly spoiler sensitive crowd, let's revisit at the last paragraph. Everyone else keep your hands and feet inside the review at all times.Pillars of Eternity has you, the hero, traveling the land of Dyrwood, a mystical realm filled with beings, creatures, ruins, and adra – a sort of organic rock jutting from the earth like jade claws from the depths. You are (shockingly!) the chosen one of sorts, a Watcher – beings capable of seeing the previous lives of the inhabitants of Dyrwood, speaking to the dead. Most that claim to be Watchers are hucksters, charlatans, and the rest are often driven positively batty by all of the intrusive soul fragmented former lives (theirs included). There's mystery, intrigue, ancient civilizations and arcane magics, unique party members to drag along... pretty standard RPG fare. There are troubled hamlets, a large city, a ruined fortress, and natural wonders to gawk at, all lovingly prerendered. The world and those settled there feel alive, and for the first time in a while I felt compelled to listen to every bit of dialogue, read every bit of codex, flavor text, all just to familiarize myself with this fascinating new world.Of course you'll have to do some killing, it is an RPG after all. And you'll kill 'em all: wolves, giant spiders, lizard men, ghosts, bandits, trolls, wizards, spooky skeletons, mushroom men and dragons... Pillars of Eternity doesn't exactly break the mold when it comes to mythical beasties and foes, but the combat does. When an enemy is spotted your party will pause and you'll be able to select a general attack or take the time to individually select special actions for each party member.When you do engage you'll see their various defenses, strengths, and weaknesses of your foe – dependent on factors like weapon type, flanking, status effects, etc. It's thoroughly tactical and engaging, and even on lower difficulty settings I watched my entire party succumb to one or two enemies because I just tossed them into the fray all willy nilly. After dispatching enemies your bestiary will be updated with pertinent information. There's also often sweet, sweet corpse loot; loot can be equipped, used for crafting, or sold to vendors.I'll also touch briefly on the travel/sleepy time mechanics. See, the Eastern Reach is pretty expansive, and you'll be hoofing it from the get go. Day and night cycles, and characters will become fatigued from travel (not to mention bogged down by negative status effects after lots of fights). You have one of two options: camping out “in it” while adventuring, or shacking up at a number of permanent locations. Camping should only be used as is necessary, since you only have so many supplies to set up camp with, and some of the longer adventures will require your party to get that much needed refreshing between combat.The minor-est of complaints! Here they come, ready yourselves. Because the world is prerendered and mostly static, fights will sometimes break out behind solid objects, which is a little frustrating (if you zoom in on a solid object obscuring a character it will become semi-translucent, but it's still a pain). And when you have a full party attacking enemies the notifications fly by in a flurry of text, which can make optimizing attacks difficult on the fly. Other than these quibbles the game is great. I've encountered no bugs, no glitches, and it's just overall a delight to play. Anyone familiar with classic BioWare fare and CRPGs will find themselves very much at home.Pillars of Eternity is, simply put, really really good. The scope of it is dizzying, your first hour ingame may very well be in the character creation menu (but in a good way!), the combat is deeply satisfying, the score is GoT/LotR/Souls Series/Elder Scrolls Series all wrapped up in one, and  the story is thoroughly captivating. I haven't completed this game (it looks like the first of many playthroughs may well take 60+ hours), but short of it ending with an about-face “it was all a dream” or an elaborate song and dance number my sentiment will remain unmoved: Pillars of Eternity is a spectacular game, proof that old-school done right is timeless... it certainly helps that I'm playing as a dwarf/elf with a wisecracking antelope sidekick that explodes wolves.  That's always a plus. "

												Excellent old-school game if a little unpolished at release. Now after all patches and expansions it's worth every penny. Well thought-out lore is especially great for immersion.Thumbs up to Obsidian for maintaining excellent quality of content and staying true to RPG/D&D roots with PoE and Tyranny projects. This is particularly worthy of respect in today's dark times when PC games are clustered around two terrible extremes: dumb AAA chewing gum titles on one end, and half-baked pixel-art indie garbage on the other end of the spectrum.

												Baldur's Gate was the ultimate videogame for me when I was a kid, but I've always had trouble convincing my friends to like it. The same is true now for Pillars of Eternity. The quality of the game is superlative, it's just an inaccessable format to some people.  I think this is probably the game for you if you can enjoy a fantasy novel or have ever read up on the lore of a videogame outside of the game. The thing this type of game does best is world building. The characters you meet have weight, everything matters, and the universe feels unique. It's not a cheap knockoff fantasy world where they just switch around the names of familiar tropes. There's a holistic personality to the world you're in and you just want to get to know it. And the best part is that getting to know the world doesn't mean reading through the codexes in a menu somewhere. The game teases bits of lore and it's up to you to find out more. You learn about a war and you have to meet a veteran to find out what happened. You find the name of a god and you seek out a priest to learn their beliefs. You'll hear someone tell a myth and you'll actually seek out the book in game so you can get the full story. And even then, no one source is definitive, so you're delighted if you ever stumble upon a new tidbit.			"

												A game that old school RPG players waited for a long time. A true isometric RPG in Baldur's Gate style. Fantastic gameplay where tactical combat is more important than fast clicking. For example, the old/new stats system really make you question and forces you to think seriously when it comes to choosing your weapon or armour that grants specific attribute bonuses, or, for that matter, when you are creating you character. The endurance - health system is also one of the factors you must consider when you enter a battle, because, when you lose all the endurance in the battle you get knocked out. When the battle is over you regain your senses, but you lose health. The only way to regain your health is by sleeping in the Inn, using the camping supplies, and, of course, keeping an eye out on the endurance levels all together, because, when your character health is depleted, he/she will die. There are so many things you can do in the game and you can easily be side-tracked, but, as it happens, the main story doesn't get lost in the mix. It only expands, whether it is by adding the content and backstory to your companions, or by upgrading your stronghold and solving quests inside it. All in all, it is a great kickstarted game for the die hard and greenhorn RPGers alike.			"

Posted: April 13, 2015
												So I just finished the game... [Review]Well, at 46 hours, that was one, long and fun ride.  I haven't felt so involved in a roleplaying game since Planescape : Tormet and it speaks volumes of the writing here.  There were a couple bugs and I'll get to them in an instant but the major ones were swiftly corrected, leaving some minor ones with very little impact in game.First, let's start with the obvious.  This game was obviously developped by gamers who know what they like in a game.  Everything about the interface screams convenience.  At first I was surprised to only find sixteen equipment slots in the inventory, until I noticed a well organised, infinite ""stash"" box.  Every quest item and ingredient (and there's a LOT of them) instantly goes to your stash, leaving you to select only what you want to keep.  New weapon that you don't plan to use?  Stash.  Crapload of stuff on the ground?  Stash.  You can also dump equipment from your inventory to your stash if you like.  There's also an option to be able to access it anywhere, otherwise you are limited to inns and during campings.  I preferred keep it like that but it's really up to the player.Speaking of convenience and options, there's one to enlarge the looting radius.  Basically that means that whenever you loot something from the dead, every other corpse nearby will be looted.  I definately recommend you put the radius to the maximum.  There's the usual meta-infos, what you want displayed, when the auto pause begins, there's a lot to check out.  There's also a limited number of ""resting"" available, which for those abusing it in other games might come off as annoying but you get 4 on ""normal"" and less on harder difficulties.  You find ""camping supplies"" in a lot of crates and most merchants sell them as well.  By level 7, I hardly noticed the supplies since you get a lot of spells to throw to your enemies and it becomes an issue only if you're dangerously low on health.Yes, low on health.  This is both a good and a bad thing so I won't hold the developpers for this interesting and new concept.  You have two ""life"" totals.  One is the stamina and the other, your actual health.  Your health is always far higher than your stamina, sometimes as much as three or four times the total and both lower at the same time.  However, since your stamina's much lower, you will fall unconscious before dying at least for a while.  After the fight, your unsconscious characters will get up and the endurance will refill quickly, up to the current health.  So when your health is low, your endurance bar will be capped and that's when you risk dying.  I thought that was an interesting idea but my issue is that the only way to raise your health is to rest.  Mind you, it does make sense in a way But there are times when you wish you didn't need to use your supplies just because one character nears death.  Even the highest priest spells do nothing to raise the health at all.  There's an option to change the final death to injuries but I left it off, I preferred the perma deaths.  Again, great work on making sure the game's tailored to a player's preferences.On another note, I hope you love reading.  This isn't Diablo 3 here and again, I'm bringing Planescape Torment as a comparison.  The writers did a stellar job, when you can talk to a NPC, the dialogs are expansive and there's a lot of body language added for immersion.  There's also this fun idea of letting Kickstarter backers write their own NPCs.  Now and then, you'll meet people whose nameplates are golden instead of tan.  When you click on them, you can ""Reach out for their souls"" and get to experience, from that NPC's point of view, an important moment in their life.  They have no impact at all ingame except to give you a better immersion and let you read something fun.  I read every one I came across, some are pretty gory, others are light hearted and sweet, others just bittersweet.  It's definately an awesome way for Developpers to reward the backers and I'm pretty sure all of them bought the game just to be able to see their own NPC.  The fact that they are entirely optional is also well thought, someone who don't really like reading (and why would they play a game like that is beyond me) can just ignore them.  Now, as far as party creation goes, I can already tell some people might feel put off by the fact you can only create one character at the start.  When you enter an Inn (and it happens within the first hour) You can hire mercenaries up to your own level, at a cost.  I found out what thanks to the generous loot, I could have a full party of six very quickly with very little impact on levels.  You also meet scripted NPCs, who are all very interesting but since my first character was a mage and the first hireable NPC you meet is also one, I went with creating my own party.  You get the standard stuff, warrior, monk, druid etc with new stuff like a chanter, which is basically a bard that can take actions while chanting and once a song is complete, you get a strong effect or a cipher who gains ""mana"" by damaging enemies.I pretty much completely neglected the scripted NPCs, meaning my party never intervened or commented during conversations which was a bit sad but I did not regret it, my own party was rock solid with far better stats than the scripted ones.  By the end, I did promise myself to use the scripted ones in my next playthrought since they do offer a very lively interaction with the world.  Very early in the game you gain a stronghold, which offers you a major questline as there's a VERY large dungeon in your own basement (actually under your own dungeon, which I thought was clever).  You can build structures to add minor bonuses when you rest at home as well as get cosmetic changes.  Overall it's a fun addition, it adds little to the overall story but again, the massive dungeon alone is worth it.  At fifteen levels, it's by far the largest in game and also by far the most interesting, each level has it's own ""theme"" and distinct look.The enemies were for the most part varied but I admit I'd have wished to see less of these damn ""shade"" monsters, you see them from start to finish and by level 8, pose no serious threat.  The enemy AI is very good too, I was often surprised by flanking moves and concentrated attacks on vulnerable party members.Speaking of AI, there is one, for your party, kinda.  I wish it would show a bit more initiative but once the fight begins, the party members mostly find a new target by themselves but at the start, won't do anything unless you order them to.  They also don't seek new targets if they are too far either.  Personally I like to micromanage my party so I hadn't noticed this until well into the game, as I issued my orders right from the first active pause of combat.The game is capped at level 12.  While I understand that at this point you can easily steamroll most fights by just asking everyone to rush in, I hit that limit very early, at the start of act 3.  There's a ""bounty"" quest system from your fortress' lodge that are basically ""go there and kill this person"" and they are challenging fights but gives a LOT of XP.  Capping at 15 might have given more of an incentive to finish all quests.  The spells stop at level 6 but there's room for 3-4 more levels in the list, I figure that if the game sells well (and it sure did) they could consider that in the sequel.Now for the auditory review...  you normally don't expect a game like that to look so good but I've paused at several times in game just to look around and admire the scenery.  Most dungeons are a feast for the eye and the music is really good.  It has a very ""Obsidian"" theme to it.Verdict : 92%.  STRONGLY recommended.			"

												Alright, this is going to be a bit more in depth. So if you're interested in the mechanics featured in Pillars of Eternity, this might be for you.Character Attributes and StatsAttributes as you might know them, have been repurposed, and some of their effects put into their own sub categories. Every main Attribute has it's base purpose now. Like Intelligence for example affects the size of the AoE and how long spells/buffs/skills last, and Might affects the strength of physical attacks, spells and also healing. The reason for this change is to throw away the old min/maxing of stats in favor of viability and sandbox character creation. Other effects that are usually tied to these attributes or classes have their own categories now, which can be adjusted through equipment or during a lvl up. One example of this is Lore. Where Intelligence is used in other games to determine what scrolls you can read, Lore takes it's place in PoE. Even though this might sound intimidating or confusing at first, it honestly isn't. Not only is it easier to understand than the ""old"" way, where the same attributes affect different classes in different ways, but it also prevents hitting a wall in late game because you chose the wrong attributes for your class in the beginning. In PoE this problem is (almost) nonexistant because the system is made so your character will still be viable. Maybe not the way you planned it originally, but still viable. Even messing up deliberately is very hard to do. The basic idea is: create your character the way you want it. And the tooltips explain very clearly what each stat does and how it affects your character, making it very easy to build the one you want to play. Combat systemCombat in PoE is real time with the option to pause it anytime you want. And you definitely want to pause, because the combat is generally pretty fast in this game. Most fights against regular mobs are over after the first couple of seconds if you have a strong opening(The Cipher's 'Mind Blades' followed up by crippling melee skills for example.) I've played two characters on normal and hard so far, and most basic encounters are relatively easy when using the right strategy. But a strong opening, combined with tactical positioning is the key to handle most encounters quickly. This game rewards the thinking person, and the combat is no exception. The combat system is quite deep and has a lot of room for tactical adjustments. I'll just cover the basics here. As you might suspect, dice play a large role in combat. If you hit your enemy or not, is determined by a D100. 1-50 is a grazed hit and 50-100 a regular hit. -0 is a miss, and +100 a critical hit. Grazed hits do -50% DMG, crits do +50%, and a miss makes you look like an idiot. Here's an example of an attack as you'll see it in the combat log: Acc:40 - Def:26 = 14. Roll:70 + 14 = 84(Hit). 13.5 - (DR:6.0 - 3.0) = 10.5 Pierce So, what's happening here? First you have your Accuracy which is compared to the Defense of the defender. In this case the difference is 14 in my favor(40-26=14.) Next is my dice roll to which the previous result is added(or subtracted if your Acc is lower than the defender's Def.) I rolled a 70 plus the 14 from my Acc bonus, meaning 84 = a Hit!Then, there's the DMG my weapon does(13.5) and after that the ]Damage Reduction from the defender, which is subtracted from my attack's DMG. Normally this would reduce my damage to 7.5(13.5-6.0), but since my Dagger has the effect to bypass 3.0 Damage Reduction, I only get a 3.0 penalty and do 10.5 Pierce type damage.Whew! Not so complicated after all is it? However, there are 4 different types of Defense for each character and multiple types of Damage Reduction, which give this system quite a lot of depth to work with.Another basic mechanic is Engagement. Once two characters are engaged in combat, they are ""locked"" to each other. Breaking this lock(to escape or attack a different character) gives the other combatant a free attack. This is a fundamental system, that some people have trouble working with. It also means that the character making the most DMG or aggro doesn't necessarily pull all your enemies. This is where clever positioning and the usage of skills comes into play. (You're going to hate enemies that tunnel or warp their way around your carefully aligned defense. Stop them with spells and skills before they get a chance to do so. See: strong opening.) Vitality & EndurancePillars of Eternity has basically two versions of Health: Vitality and Endurance. Endurance is your resistance to short-term injury, or how much damage a character can withstand before they are knocked unconscious in battle. Vitality represents long-term injury or how much damage a character can sustain before they are maimed or die permanently. A character's Vitality is based on his Endurance and multiplied according to his class. A Druid with an End. of 50 will have Vit. of 200, since his class multiplicator is 4. Every hit you take in battle reduces End. & Vit. If your character takes 10DMG, you'll lose 10 End. & 10 Vit. End. is de facto your combat health, and if it's totally depleted, you're knocked out for the rest of the battle. Therefore the healing spells/skills in the game affect the End. The only way to replenish your Vitality however is by resting. Either by camping or sleeping in taverns. Also, your End. will sink with your Vit. once it reaches it's value. Meaning that with a Vit. of 36, you'll also have an End. of 36. If your Vitality reaches 0, you'll be maimed. Maimed is a serious condition that inflicts grave combat penalties. Once a character has been maimed, further reduction of Vit. will always result in death, and it can only be healed through resting.Spell castingAs in old Infinity Engine games, spells have limited use and need resting to replenish said uses. But Pillars of Eternity also features skills that replenish after each battle. The key is to balance these two, so you'll not find yourself without spells in the middle of a dungeon. The amount of camping supplies you have also varies with each difficulty. On hard, you may find yourself run out of spells and without camping supplies right before a major battle. But this is a good example of how Pillars of Eternity handles difficulty. It not simply determines the health and strength of enemies, but the amount of management and tactics required by the player. The WritingThere's not much to say here, other than that it's some of the best writing I've experienced in some time. It's not only the story of the game, and the lore(which is almost mandatory for a setting like this), no it's the syntax that makes it so great. Even though you have walls of text in front of you, it almost never feels bothersome to read. Language and sentences are formed so reading remains fluid at all times. Party members are full of character and always fun to interact with, and even regular NPCs are interesting, since even the most basic Q&A session is tied to a bigger story.BugsAs it is tradition with Obsidian games, Pillars of Eternity suffers from some release bugs. Some common bugs are that you can't leave areas, crashes when entering a certain area, that the cursor stops working etc. All these are already confirmed to be fixed by next week though. Pillars of Eternity is not simply Baldur's Gate 3, and I thank Obsidian for breaking through the wall of overused mechanics, which not only enhances the game to a great deal, but also makes it truly stand out as a CRPG. Read the tooltips and get familiar with the mechanics early on, before you hit the ""real"" part of the game, and you won't have any trouble with frustration :^)			"

												This game was a flash to the past for me in every way imagineable.  The first hour of the game reminded me of the magical times I had playing Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape Torment as a teenager.  I don't know how they managed to do it, but they have made, in my mind, the perfect homage to the old in a modern package.  This is what PC Gaming should be. This IS what PC Gaming is today.  I cannot reccomend this game enough for anyone who even moderately enjoys roleplaying games, tactical combat, or anything with a good story. 10/10. We can all hope that we get a steady dose of expansions and sequels.			"

												My point of view:Been waiting such game for years after Black Isle gone for good. It is really done well and you can see the developers long hours of work in it.Pros:+Real RPG we wanted for years+Hardcore experience+Sandbox (you are not suppose to DO something before anything. you can explore the world and do nothing if you want after prologue)+Challenging (ill add this to cons also since many people are complaning about it)+Details (You should put some attention to details. Not all companions will give you quests with in conventional way. some you need to talk time to time and you need to check dialogs with them regularly)+Good visuals+New Stats (Back in old days 1charisma or 1int characters were popular to max out some stats but adjusting stats as multi purpused is genious and brings back balance)Cons:- Low variety of companions (will be fixed with aditional content or mods i hope. First thing that bothered me)- Hardcore and challenging experiance (there are many topics about this its not a problem for me but to warn you guys)- Dull spell casting (only 1word and 1animation . Different speel verbals and signs, animations would be there! i expected it but ...)- Low variety of avatars at character creation screen- Some wepons are useless (guns>bow no need to use bow *YES i know they are in real wold but we are not in it and there is magic. Classical ranger concept is about bow so it can bother some roleplay fans)**Havent decided about ost yet This game is a must have if you loved old Black Isle games. Not complicated as Planetscape but good and jucy as Baldurs gate 2 and better story then Icewind Dale. Need more companions and interactions with companions. Also havent encountered a bug yet which is nice(corrected). Voice overs and voice acting is done perfectly *nearly*. There are too much souls with useless interaction it gets abit boring after a while it can be corrected by living in them by in game cutscenes kinda thing. *EDIT-Ost is kinda good you never got bored of it but dont have VERY special thing in it (according to my taste) but a very good ost.- Encountered 2 bugs     -When you autosave(F5) if you try to move with arrow keys game puts your camera at the corner of the map    - 2nd bug is kinda SPOILEER!!!!!        The big♥♥♥♥♥dragons' attack bugs time to time and he stuck at the middle of attack animation so it makes him easy kill.			"

												Having played Baldur's Gate 2 multiple times over the years (including the ""enhanced"" edition), POE should have scratched the same itch, but it doesn't. I really, really wanted to like it but after two dozen hours I long for BG2. Rather than a spiritual successor, it feels like a rushed homage to its predecessor. Here's what I didn't like:The world feels quite small, character development choices are not particularly meaningful,melee combat is woefully ineffective (the more armor you have, the slower you hit,  The bigger your shield, the less accurate you are).  Forget about playing a DPS fighter, you're SOL.really found it hard to care about the PC, the world, or any of the companions.loading screens EVERYWHERE. Inability to turn off autosave (seriously?) - every screen transition has a 10 second loading screen - it doesn't matter if you're going from a city map to the world map, or just upstairs to the 2nd floor of the inn.  This made me dread indoor environments.the Watcher's Keep -alike, Od Nua, was very disappointing - it almost felt like a series of procedural dungeons.  No puzzles, a very basic story and disappointing treasure.buffing outside combat is impossible as certain skills/spells cannot be activated or cast outside combat.  Again, seriously?  A backwards design choice that really detracts from immersion.related to the above, since buffing is impossible, the best strategy for any encounter is to front load as much damage as possible, which makes the slow loading firearms almost a default choice for ranged combat.the loot in this game is so underwhelming I ended up not caring.exposition overload - almost every character will drop an exposition bomb on you, about the world, their motivations etc.  Instead of telling me, show me - in the way the world is designed, the placement of NPCs like beggars, refugees or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s etc.It LOOKS like BG2, but doesn't have much of a soul.  Overall just felt rushed.			"

												Genre - Fantasy RPG with paused tactical combatI had played through both Baldur's Gate games extensively back in the day and I have played this game a lot before making an opinion.It began as a kick starter and stays true to the gameplay of the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale games. You have an isometric view and guide your hero through story driven quests whilst recruiting up to 5 NPCs with their own dialogue options and personalitys. The story is interesting and manages to be fairly original, immersing you in a new universe to explore. You have a world map to navigate and the White March expansion adds an increased level cap, weapons that level up and a new area with quests.I haven't completed the game yet as I have hit my level cap near the end of White March 1 (14), and suspect that White March 2 will increase it further (16?) so don't want to lose out on exp. Some of the fights are still difficult on normal and I have found myself going back to them once I powered up a bit more. The weapons/spells are varied enough for a fantasy universe and the side quests interesting.You also get to look after a stronghold near the start of the game. This to me was more of a minor distraction and something that could be built on in the sequel, although it still performs many useful functions and the basis for the endless paths quests.As a fan of Baldur's Gate I think the developers have done a great job, and I hope they continue to build on this franchise. I am now looking forward to White March 2 so I can beat the end boss or rage quit trying... "

												It's finally out. Jesus, just when I was getting my life on track...Pillars of Eternity is, hands-down, the best game in its genre since Baldur's Gate II.So, yeah. Anyone who ever played any Infinity RPGs for fifty hours straight knows what I'm talking about. Huge, isometric, story-driven games which emphasized immersion in worlds where your choices mattered, your mistakes were painful and the story was engaging. Sure, you had to read giant blocks of text and fight uphill battles that you could lose at the roll of a die, but both of these activities were immensely rewarding in themselves, because the writing was top-notch and the tactics you had to employ against your enemies had to be both creative and abide by Gygax's Tome of Neverending Rules to succeed. This was obviously before they slapped the RPG label to streamlined generic space operas or sandbox Bethesda countryside crawlers with bad writing and worse design. Pillars of Eternity takes place in Eora, which might seem as a garden variety fantasy world at first, but quickly establishes its own identity as you discover that souls can be seen and interacted with and are considerably more palpable than the metaphysical malarkey you normally use to pick up drunk hippy chicks at pretentious parties. Add the political intrigue of separatist colonies and the invention of gunpowder into the mix and you get a uniquely deep universe in which you will have to use cunning, diplomacy and brute force in equal measure to stand a chance.While both the classes and mechanics are basically modernisations of the D&D archetypes and rulesets, enough has been built on top of them to improve the overall experience: you have an infinite inventory for junk, craftable food, potions and enchantments provide secondary activities that enrich your arsenal and there's a really clever compromise between streamlined gameplay and the typical Dungeons and Dragons downtime which separates your encounter health pool (called Endurance) from the general health pool (which you can only regenerate by resting). The cherry on top is the stronghold you get to conquer and own fairly early in the game, and investing into its various buildings not only beautifies the initially decrepit keep, but also provides bonuses, NPCs and a recurring supply of gold. The graphics are gorgeous, giving a painterly feel to the backgrounds and overcoming the technical limitations the Infinity engine had 17 years ago (dynamic water, convincing particle effects and modern resolutions being just the obligatory minimums), while retaining the general feeling gamers had exploring Faerûn. Even the classes and spells are pretty much the same, with occasional renames (presumably to avoid copyright infringement), though their efficiency has been tampered with and itemization is much less restrictive than it used to be. If what you read appeals to you, then, by all means, buy this game. It's worth every penny and you'll get your money's worth in gametime, guaranteed. If you're like me, which is to say an absolute loser with no future and zero qualifications, you'll probably have the time to run through it within a week, but if you spread your doses responsably enough you'll probably be playing this a few months from now. Regardless of how immersive and brilliant this game will seem three hours in, don't forget to walk your dog, hang out with your friends and bang your girlfriend 'til she smiles.  "

												Impressions after 11 hours of gameplay. Will keep updating as I play more. Pillars is Obsidian's best game to date, and a genuine masterpiece.Visually stunning: incredibly detailed backgrounds, with plenty of environmental particle effects that add a lot of life to the scenery. The 3D character models fit perfectly into the scenes, and have smooth, weighty animations (far improved from the backer beta, from what I remember).The audio is equally impressive. Everything sounds 'right', from footsteps to arrows hitting their mark. Music seems to be fairly standard fantasy stuff, with lots of flutes and such (Not a music expert, sorry.) Being 'fairly standard' is by no means bad. All the pieces I've heard have been very nice, and fit the scene and situation perfectly. The music is also not on a continuous loop: there are moments where all you'll hear are the ambient noises. Makes me appreciate the music even more, and has (thus far) prevented it from being overly repetitive.The game's interface is great. It's modern and easy to use, but not minimalist. Wood and paper textures ties it to the world, but it avoids being old school clunky brilliantly. Fonts are clear, and the size can be adjusted in the settings. There's also a colourblind setting, for those who  need that. Often in games like this, the story starts off very, very slow. Not the case in Pillars. In the 11 hours I played, the world has me absolutely hooked. The main storyline seems very interesting and highly personal. Side quests are mostly tied to the main story, and all offer a variety of choices along the way. I especially enjoyed a quest where the party is tasked with killing a lord. I figured out three distinct ways of disposing him: 1. Enter through the sewers and sneak into his throne room.2. Scale the castle ramparts, enter through the top floor, disguise the party as priests and just walk to the throne room.3. Storm the gates and murder everyone.This specific quest also had an added layer of complexity, but I won't go into detail here; too many spoilers as it is. As you would expect from Obsidian, there's a lot of well-written dialogue and every situation and character I've encountered has been described in great detail (made even better by the fact that the descriptions match the visuals, unlike in, say, Shadowrun Returns or Wasteland 2) Dialogue options are plentiful, with frequent skill / stat checks that do a great job of tying the RPG system into the conversations. Most characters also have at least one line of voiced dialogue, to give the player a better feel of the person. A nice touch.The combat is solid, and reasonably challenging even on Normal difficulty. 11 hours in, my party consists of two fighters, two spellcasters and an archer. Even at low levels (2-4) my party composition offers great tactical depth. The casters both have ~12 extremely varied spells available, and the rest have 2 or 3 abilities each. Battles are quick and very dangerous; I find myself pausing after most actions. Armour seems to play a huge role: my fighters wearing brigandine take significantly less damage than my archer, clad in padded cloth. The differences between weapon types are fairly noticeable as well (especially short vs. long weapons). As a whole, the combat is very fun and the interface for it is highly intuitive.Character progression feels a tad slow, but every level up offers plenty of skill points to distribute, one or two abilities to pick and sometimes a perk as well. Leveling up feels meaningful, and it's immediately noticeable in the characters' performance. The large variety of classes, races, backstories and cultures should offer plenty of replayability, when combined with the absolutely vast amount of different directions every conversation can go.

												I don't care to ever write reviews and quite frankly my PC Gaming has taken a major halt in the last few years because like a lot of you interested in this game I've been playing PC games since the start and been through all the classics. Quite frankly I don't get impressed easily anymore.Finally a game comes by (single player non the less) that has totally encapsulated me in it's world and I want to play, I think about playing, and I enjoy every minute playing. I did download this game cause I'm broke right now but after the first day I immediately bought it. I never thought a single player game would be worth 45$ again. It has some minor bug of course but it's refreshing playing a game that feels complete and not another terrible early access mess that I play, get bored, and never ended up playing the ""completed"" game.Thanks Obsidian for bring us back to how PC gaming use to be and you have my full support in the future. Don't be eaten up by big brother and continue doing what you're good at.			"

												Played for 30 hours... not even through the first act... going to take me a year to finish this game.Love it!EDIT:A serious review now that i sunk a fair few hours into it and completed the game on the harder settings.Pillars is a great in its own right, there is no reason a Baldur's Gate fan or an owner of Wasteland 2 should not buy this game. Its mechanics are familiar and simple enough to pick up.The combat is forgiving on the lower difficulty settings but when you crank it up you really need to know you're stats, abilities and enemies.Because of this i would suggest (although its quite obvious really) that for you're first playthrough just familiarise yourself with everything the game has to offer.I could go on and on but i am no game reviewer and there are alot of good reviews on metacritic etc that already go into alot more detail.So il end my revised review with this.There's a good reason 80,000 people backed this game, raising over $4 million just so they could then buy the game and play it. Although im not a backer i would like to thank everone who is.Good Job Obsidian.Good Job gaming community.			"

												Pillars of Eternity's main offereing is the satisfaction of choice both in Story and Combat & for Rpg veterans which love to get interwebbed  into evergoing deeper mechanics this is Nirvana.Now this does not mean that you will be cracking your head trying to learn how to play this,but it does require some miniute effort.The amount of reading which resides in this Wonderful game, would most probably amount too 2 novels, so please be informed there is alot of reading which at times can be tedious if not in the right mindset.(There is voice acting but not enough to make the Story concrete without reading.)Overall if you love rpg's I will whole heartedly recommend it. For people though which have never touched CRPGs I would suggest to hold steadfast&Research because they are slower than modern Rpgs.			"

												I just finished my first playthrough on the hard difficulty and on expert mode.I don't give this game a ""thumbs down"" because it is a bad game, but because of the wasted potential, the half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gameplay concepts and the fact that it's predecessors (Baldur's Gate and the likes) have done so much more so much better. Here I'll post a few examples to prove my point. Pretty much all of my criticism concerns features that are much better thought through and implemented properly in BG/IWD - so there should be no opportunity to make such a list:Classes: - the thief has no benefits at all in regards of sneaking, unlocking stuff and disarming traps compared to any other class?!- no pickpocketing- you can only place one trap in total, which makes the underwhelming traps even more useless- chanters are boring to play. You can only use their special power once, somethimes twice in a fight- choosing solely defensive abilities on a fighters makes him pretty much invulnerable (on hard difficulty my tank never got in any trouble although he always drew aggro from the majority of enemies)- due to the lack of special abilities and ammunition the ranger is boring to play and the companion (I only tested the wolf) is downright useless and gets knocked out every fight- a paladin with no anti-undead abilities?!Inventory/items:- I don't get why you would implement the stash the way the developers did. It totally eradicates inventory management and you get to collect and sell all the loot you come across. The entire game I had more money than I could spend, even purchasing the useless upgrades for my castle. Does my party drag a 10 ton freight container around all the time or how the heck does this work.- why does a food vendor buy 200 weapons and armors from me?- no need to identify found items. Do they all come with instruction manuals and product descriptions?- the inventory of vendors never changes and the majority don't sell anything that could be considered a remarkable upgrade (oh the times when you crawled out of Irenicus' dungeon and stumbled into Adventurer's Mart)Combat mechanics:- you have no possibility of preparation for a battle whatsoever. This not only reduces tactics to a nostalgic wish, it also makes combat unnecessarily boring. Therefore scouting out enemies is useless and, thanks to the broken stealth mechanic, not possible at all most of the time- You can't drink certain potions, use certain abilities or spells while not in combat. What?! Why?- I got bitten by a spider as large as a house and got poisoned. Yet there are no anti-venom potions or spells and after killing the beast a few seconds later, the poison was gone and the character rehealed instantly back to full endurance. This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and would make being prepared for such situations needless, even if it were possible- no ammunition for ranged weapons. This would've been soo easy to implement and boost the tactical aspect of combat a lot! - not a single battle where I had to stack e.g. all the fire defense I can get to surviveMagic:- the spell system is a joke compared to it's predecessors- the available buffs are so weak, short timed and limited, they're not worth the time clicking through the unergonomic menus to cast (some buffs only last 3 seconds - are you kidding me, it uses more time to cast)- the range on AoE spells is a joke, why can't I cover the screen in exploding fireballs and clouds of deathly gas?- the game can't decide if it wants to use friendly fire or not, some spells affect companions, some don't, why not just provide the option to toggle all friendly fire on or offExperience system:- why do NPCs have the same exp when I meet them regardless whether I am level 1 or 12?! Do they live in a magical training dimension? - I don't like how every character has the exact same exp levels independent of his class and everyone levels up at the same instant- I like how I only get exp from killing enemies until I've finished my bestiary. But why doesn't this provide me with a combat bonus against these enemies? Crafting:- crafting doesn't make sense at all. Why can I do it anywhere and anytime? At least make me carry a mortar and pestle or limit it to doing it when resting- why does mixing a few herbs to create a potion cost hundreds of copper? Do my characters just throw the money on the ground to calm the gods of potion mixing??- why is the minimum 2 potions, costing 2 of every ingredient? A lot more:- no boss fights that would be worthy of that name- no epic loot that would make a difference, just combinations of the same boring properties I can craft myself- no thinking challenges or riddles- no random events like ambushes when traveling or attacks while resting in a dungeon- no humor or funny/silly side stories or quests that would lighten up the continuously dark and gritty atmosphere- no deceptions, at least none that I can recall. Everyone in this world seems to be honest, no one tries to trick you- the castle is, apart from the dungeon below which could be anywhere else, useless and doesn't provide any benefit to the game- companions don't have an alignment, so nobody cares much whether you do good or bad To conclude this 'review' (it's more of a rant, I know) I have to admit that I liked the game just as much to make me finish the main story and invest 60 hours into it. Sadly there's not much else out there recently in this genre. Maybe this will provide some input to build upon in the sequel.			"

Posted: February 19
												Pillars of Eternity was Kickstarted in 2012, with Obsidian promising a return to Infinity Engine-styled isometric RPGs with RTS-like combat. The first time I played it was in 1.0 before any of the expansions were released. The combat seemed to be pretty unintersting, as if they had complicated the IE-style ""select all, attack"" for easier encounters, and there seemed to be  far too much of it, with most areas being full of trash mobs.Having finished it in 3.0 with both expansions, I'd say it's become a better game. Far from perfect, though.There are still too many trash mobs to pad out content, even if the best fights are epic and difficult as all hell for a below-average cRPG player like me (played on Hard, Normal is still a bit too easy if you already have experience with this kind of games).The third act is still very much rushed, and the end of Act 2 is still a terrible attempt at copying Dragon Age: Origins' Landsmeet (since unlike DA:O, your choices in this event have no effect on what happens at the end of it.) The stronghold still feels pretty tacked on, though improved. The performance is still awful for this kind of stuff, and loading times are pretty bad as well, getting worse the longer your playthrough becomes. Still, it's an enjoyable game. It looks beautiful, having IE-style 2d art for each level, and a soundrack, which though somewhat different in a few tracks from the original IE games, is still good. When you get a good encounter, the combat feels much better, as you're using the wide array of abilites in each of your characters as best as you can in order to just get through the fight, instead of using them to kill trash faster.You also have to have pretty good positioning of your characters, especially since the engagement system (which means when you're in melee with an enemy, either one of you leaving results in an attack of opportunity) restricts kiting, since trying to do it will result in dead companions. In the best fights I had quite a bit of tries to just find the best positioning for each character.Character development is maybe still far from great: even though weak versions of other class abilities have been added as a choice to anyone (a possible test in multi-classing for the sequel), there are times when you're levelling up and you'll choose the least useless-sounding feat, but the abilities are pretty cool, casters having much more control than damage spells, making combat more intersting (though only when the encounters aren't padding, as i mentioned.)The companions have some pretty fun banter and some of them interesting stories, and they sometimes liven up your average map painting/clearing simulator that is a game inspired by Baldur's Gate exploration. The story is interesting at first, dull in the middle and gets good as well towards the end, even though Act 3 and the accompanying city both feel unfinished (the second city was promised as a Kickstarter streatch goal, and they did deliver, though below expectations.The base game itself is still just a decent/good game bar some bits (Raedric's Hold and the Adra Dragon), but the expansions are a major improvement. Less trash and harder encounters (if your steward tells you not to go to Cragholdt because you're too weak, then please don't trust me) make them worth by themselves, but the addition of soul-bound weaponry with a story and powers that you slowly unlock through combat is pretty cool, especially since the loot in the base game feels very much underwhelming without a lot of gear that feels unique or really powerful (hell, one of the first companions you meet already has what is probably one of the best armors he's going to get the entire game.) The areas you visit are also more interesting and visually striking.This game was an enjoayble experience (I might have been too negative in this review), just not a really great one in case of the base game. I recommend it with the expansions.			"

												Not Recommended at full price, wait for $10 or lower at least. Loads of tedious combat encounters and binary quest solutions. Unable to get all achievements since one is exclusive to Kickstarter backers.UPDATE: Finally made it to the end boss on Ironman Path of the Damned and the game has glitched rendering me unable to complete it and invalidating ALL of my progress. I have spent nearly 150 hours trying to find something other than the main story to redeem this game but I have nothing.      I have played Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale, Fallout, Torment, as well as Neverwinter Nights 1&2. I have played just about every obsidian game that has come out as well, with my favorites by and far being NWN2 Storm of Zheir, and Fallout: New Vegas.       However when I play this game, it is (to my surprise) boring. The problem is a vast majority of the game is combat, tedious number rolling save-scumming low damage limited spells combat. There are no instant-kill abilities or vibrant graphic spells to break up the monotony such as Torment, it is largely just putting a tank or two at a bottleneck and picking apart packs of monsters. It almost feels that most enemies exist of the sake of existing. There are other things I dislike about the combat (especially the engagement system) but I will save my figurative breath.     As with any Obsidian game the dialogue is well-written, although I find that a majority of  dialogue choices loop to the same outcome. Most quests end up with you fighting the person regardless if you want to or not, a vast majority of people are more than willing to just charge in and die to a group of random strangers for no discernible reason instead of going to jail or opting to run away. It seems most ""persuasive"" options involve threatening people until they tell you what you probably already know.     That being said I don't really enjoy this game, it holds a lot of potential that just isn't realized and ends up executing ideas poorly. Obsidian has an undeniable talent for writing, but they are just not up to balancing a game. The leveling system is a mess of must-have or don't-touch abilities, and even with a 6 person party it just feels completely underwhelming.			"

CRPG HEAVEN!Baldur's Gate saga, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter... these are some of the heavyweights in the CRPG genre. Playing Pillars of Eternity I would now have to add this title to the list. Let me explain why below.Story/GameplayThe story is rather interesting, dealing with the concept of souls and past lives, which I have rarely seen before, so it led me along nicely causing me to want to find out more.Quests are many and are much fun. You have the main storyline quests to follow, normal quests and then tasks to complete.Gameplay is very similar to the titles above but with a few differences. No co-op, so no playing with friends, which I enjoyed a lot previously but hey. No need for pistol/bow ammunition, just equip and start shooting. Everyone can wear full plate armour, regardless of class with no major penalties and look bad♥♥♥♥♥The writing is exceptional and I love to read descriptions of action and the environment as well as learn new words I can use in real life.StrongholdA new addition to this style of game is the inclusion of your very own stronghold that you are able to acquire, upgrade and run as its lord. I'm a big fan of this in games and I must say that it feels fleshed out and part of the game, rather than tacked on. There is a point in the game where you have to fight to keep the stronghold and you as its lord, which I must say was thrilling.GraphicsVery similar to the CRPGs of old and yet just better enough for this generation, however I wouldn't zoom in too much as the graphics fall apart with character detail.Music/ScoreJust as good as other CRPG titles with the music helping to take you on an epic adventure.CompanionsYou have eight to choose from in the main game and a couple of others in the White March expansion. I found that some companions are better than others regarding the dialogue and their personal quests. Are they as good as those in the Baldur's Gate saga? No, but they're not bad either. Some remarks they make are funny and insightful. I would have preferred if all their dialogue was fully voiced, but I guess it would have cost too much, well I hope that's the case, otherwise it's just lazy.LootAs with all RPGs there are a shed tonne of loot to collect, which triggers the OCD in me. I must gather everything! Leave no stone unturned! Crack open that stone... just in case ;)SummaryIf you enjoy or have enjoyed the Baldur's Gate saga then you owe it to yourself to play this game. It's not exactly the same but what differences there are help it to stand on its own. As of this review I have only played 51hrs but I can easily see myself playing well over 100hrs. Once I have completed the game in its entirety I shall edit this review to reflect that and my final thoughts.8/10 "

												This is an even better game than the Baldur's Gate series, and is almost as good at telling a story as Planescape: Torment. Kotaku had an article where it said: ""You know you have a good game when you reroll after a few hours just to test another class"". I rerolled, and I think I might just do another shortly to test the Cipher and/or Druid. The story and writing sucks you in and holds you to it's bosom from the minute you start in the caravan camp. And unlike other games you are given clues to what is happening, but nothing else. Which gets your head going. And this part, in addition to the beautiful graphics is what makes it occupy far too much of my time (even when I turn it off). Colorful NPCs with a story to tell makes the game even more engrossing. The same goes for the game world PoE is set in. It's something completely new and alot less black and white than you find in other games. Being the good guy isn't always the same thing as helping people by completing quests. Sure, some of the NPCs are pretty stereotypical, like the animancer early in the first act, but others are not so obvious. It makes it more fun. And because your choices in the dialogues have a direct impact on your own power (turn off the information on what choices give what reputation for extra fun) you really have to think your way through things.Another thing I love is the size and lenght of the game. This game will occupy tens of hours of your time if you let it. Some of the side quests are bigger than other games' main storyline!I'm an oldschool table-top RPGer and have been addicted to D&D for 30 years. Pillars of Eternity makes me want to play the game system ingame, and game world, with my friends in a table-top RPG. I never thought I'd find a game system which is as easy to learn and as hard to master as this is. The possibilities are endless, and the continent can be expanded without having to explain it away. Which makes this my nr. 1 game in my ""needs expansions and a sequel"" list.The game truly pays homage to the old IE games, and would be perfect if not for the, at times, horrible pathing of your party when in combat. That, and the Chanter's high need for micromanagement are the only negative things I can think of when it comes to this game. It's just as awesome as the hype made it up to be. Come PoE2 Kickstarter I will use alot more money than I did with this one. It will be worth it.  This is not a game for people who click through dialogues as alot of the nuances and story will be lost on you. Truly a game worth the money.Pros:StoryStoryStoryGraphicsColorful NPCsGame systemClassesYour own StrongholdMassive game worldMassive amounts of fun (I've played into the first act and played 30 hours on one character alone)Large side questsDialoguesCons:Team pathing in combatChanter micromanagementWill result in withdrawal symptoms until Pillars of Eternity 2 is releasedFamily life suffersMy weight will go up from lack of exerciseMakes all other RPG games look badI really wish Steam had a ""Hell yeah!"" button below....

												Pillars of Eternity. Widely acclaimed as a spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. While I do not doubt the truth of such claims, I would like to offer my perspective as someone who's never played Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale, and thus approach PoE with fresh eyes.For a start games in the fantasy genre which PoE sits in are plenty on Steam. Indeed I have an earlier review of Spellforce, a game which was somewhat forgettable for me despite brave attempts to capture the spirit of fantasy RPG. As I hadn't played Baldur's Gate nor Icewind Dale, PoE's first job as to sell itself to me on the steam store page. I approached it with some skepticism initially and wasn't entirely sold on the top down isometric view. The game's content, gameplay, mechanics, lore etc however, reminded me of my evenings of pen and paper RPG games I've had with friends, and that convinced me to give it a try.It was a decision I would not regret. Character creation is one of the biggest parts of any good P&P fantasy RPG game, be it Dungeons and Dragons or Warhammer. The character creation of PoE made me feel exactly like I was starting a P&P RPG game. It wasn't so much as customising my character's look as it was fleshing out my backstory, allocating stats etc. I spent almost 3 hours alone in character creation.The story is well written, well paced. The lore is rich, you feel like you are in a wonderful fantasy world to be explored. While having individual maps instead of a massive world like any of the Elder Scrolls games makes exploration less of a focus, nonetheless it's still good fun discovering new places. The combat system takes a while to learn and master, and having a game manual would really help, but by and large the mechanics of the game aren't too difficult to pick up. When playing it I had a sense I was playing a game with Elder Scroll's rich lore and setting with Diablo's graphics and interface, both franchises I absolutely adore. As a setting for individual role playing in, it's right up there with Elder Scroll games. There aren't many games which have made me think ""I really love the fantasy genre"". Fable was the first that got me started. Warcraft, especially WoW, got me deep into it. Elder Scrolls cemented my love for the genre, and I didn't think it was possible to take my love for fantasy to a new level, but Pillars of Eternity has somehow managed to do that. Playing it brings back the sort of emotions I experienced the first time I played Fable, WoW, Elder Scrolls. All the more amazing given the isometric top down projection and fixed maps PoE utilises instead of first person or over the shoulder views in an open world those other games share.With the rich amazing lore as its foundations, I can see PoE being the beginning of something great. A grand new fantasy franchise to go alongside giants such as Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, Warhammer etc. PoE has recently released its first DLC, I am sure the first of many. This is a game franchise with a great future to come, and I am not only glad I am a part of it from the first game, I hope to bring along as many of you on this adventure as I can.Edit: already PoE is being held up as the new benchmark. Issue 283 of PC Gamer has a review for a similiar isometric view RPG game called Kyn with this exact phrase: ""The more I played, the less it reminded me of Pillars of Eternity..."" Also I wrote this review before I read the PC Gamer's review of PoE. Here's part of the opening paragraph: ""Almost an hour had passed, and I was still on the character creation screen. That’s how I knew, before I’d even started, that this homage to classic computer role-playing games like Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment was authentic....""And here's another part of the next: ""It’s the most captivating, rewarding RPG I’ve played on a PC in years, and I’ve fallen in love with the intricate, richly painted world they’ve crafted.""Seems familiar? Those were exactly the same things I've said about PoE that's made me fall in love with. This game is a must try for RPG fans. Get it, you won't regret it!			"

												I want to personally thank Obsidian for developing another great game. A lot of work and time was put into this and it shows.The Good-Good Graphics.-Beautiful Music. (The Music and ambiance is top quality.)-Good Voice Acting.-The UI looks very professionally done. It looks like an artist designed it all from scratch. The time/day monocle in the middle. (Just like Baldur's Gate 2's UI)-Challanging on Hard and Path of the Damned.-Good Story.-Crits on the last hit on a mob makes them explode into meaty pieces just like Baldur's Gate.-Very Much Like Baldur's Gate.-Love the humor of some of the characters.-Tons of loot. (So much loot, that it would even make Goarge Lucas Cream in his pants.)-You can aquire your own stonghold.-You can take people prisoner.-Somewhat Indepth Character Creation.-Really good story writing.The Bad-Things seem slow at first. The amount of information thrown at you can be overwhelming.-Classes are interesting, but are not as complex or indepth as Baldur's Gate. No dice re-rolls .ect Your set with a set amount of points no matter what so there is no possiblity of creating a really unique character. (Slightly Dumbed Down)- All Classes have the same exp amounts. (Slightly Dumbed Down)-The AI definitly needs some work. Even with the AI scripts added to the game they still randomly do things you didn't command your party members too do. Summoned creatures can be a constant annoyance sometimes.-Found some Glitchs in some areas were I could shoot mobs through walls.-There is only one thing that really really annoys me about this game. It's The Horrible path finding in dungeons. In Baldur's gate 2 they fixed it. I don't know why they didn't think of fixing the path finding in dungeons. I don't even think they tested it. It's pretty bad and I'm surprised they still havin't fixed it after it being out for a year. (I hope this one complaint doesn't make you thumbdown my reveiw. It's the only real annoyance I had with the game.)Conclusion.Overall I'm pretty impressed with Pillars of Eternity. Some people on steam here complained in forums it wasn't as indepth or had as much content as Baldur's Gate, but I guess the reason why it never bothered me is I don't expect that from any of the newer games these days. I actually had low expectations and I was surprised how rich the lore is and how the story slowly opens up. The Classes are interesting too and I love the Ranger pets. Even if some of the lore might of been overwhelming at first. There is a really good game here and it's definitly worth the price tag. I think the developers did a really good job.8.5/10			"

 “If there were no gods, it would have been necessary to create them.” Pillars of Eternity is an isometric role-playing game (rpg) developed by the company Obsidian Entertainment with emphasis on tactical combat.  Atmosphere & presentation: + Vast and mature fantasy world with great love for detail.+ Excellent background music enriches the atmosphere. + Additional game mechanics, like the bounty hunter missions and castle construction, create a welcome diversion to the mundane tasks of an adventurer. + The extension White March increases level cap and delivers additional characters, equipment and side story elements.+ Clean user interface and good inventory management. + Great replay value. o The different factions are interesting in the beginning, but their general involvement with the player is rather small. o Satisfying execution of almost every aspect of the game, due to several patches. Combat & gameplay: + The ability to approach a potential combat situation in multiple ways is well balanced in the game. + Transparent combat mechanics allow the player to understand each encounter. + Implementation of a dynamic difficulty system provides rpg newcomers, veterans and masochists with a satisfying challenge.+ Impressive customization system allows for extensive weapon and armor modifications.+ Broad spectrum of skills offers good character development.+ Lower spells remain efficient on higher levels. o Party size is limited to a maximum of six characters.o The player can decide to travel alongside a companion party or custom party.  Characters & story: + The main plot is complex and multi-layered. + Well written dialogues and narrative.+ Very good voice acting of all characters.+ Certain quests offer several ways to complete them.+ Dialogues and events can be solved by an attribute or skill check. + Major decisions of the player are reflected in the end sequence of the game. o While some characters are interesting and provide an authentic development, others remain immature lacking depth. o Not all dialogues with non-player characters are synchronized. o The protagonist cannot start a romance. - Any character class can learn to pick locks and disarm traps, which diminishes the attractiveness of the rogue class.- The creation of a multi-class character is not possible. Summary: Overall, Pillars of Eternity offers high-quality content and sophisticated gameplay. The world is fantastically immersive, and represents a wonderful role-playing experience.  Amusing quotes:  “Let’s try this again: Step aside or die chocking on your own innards.”  “What kind of coward asks for his own man to be killed? The kind who will be so enraged by it, that no amount of pain will stop him from beating you so savagely, that you will carry the disfigurement into your next life.”  Trivia: NPCs with gold name plates were designed by the backers. Interacting with them will allow you to experience each one’s unique history.

												Pillars's creation was funded by nostalgia for the Baldur's Gate series and Planescape: Torment, but much of the work was done by the people who made Icewind Dale, and it shows. The gameplay is analogous to sitting down to play a D&D campaign by one of those insane DMs who obsess over pointless minutiae and devote countless hours to ""fixing"" the game.The resting system is a good example of this type of crazy DM-style wasted effort: supposedly you could ""exploit"" the rest system in the old IE games to render entire dungeons easy because you faced every encounter at full strength. Now, to begin with, this wasn't even true unless you modded the game, and even then nobody actually did it. But as people do, some loud people on the internet whined about it and for some reason Obsidian listened. So in Pillars you can only rest outside of inns by spending limited camping supplies. You can only carry a small amount, depending on the difficulty setting. These camping supplies have some pretty powerful magic, though, seeing as you can whip them out in the middle of a dungeon full of hostile enemies and not have to worry about them attacking you while you rest. However, it is a completely pointless little mechanic. If you really want to there's nothing stopping you from wandering out of the dungeon, resting at the nearest inn, and coming back to pick up where you left off.Another new mechanic added to the IE game formula is engagement, which is fundamentally broken as of the time I'm writing this. Essentially, it's the cumbersome attack of opportunity system from D&D 3rd Edition edited to make even less sense. In practice it locks your characters into standing around if an enemy closes into melee range; if you dare try to run away you instantly eat an infinite number of attacks and die. Enemies, on the other hand, rarely have reason to care about engagement unless the AI is programmed to respect it--which is all they did in the old IE games. It's a system that is annoying, doesn't work properly, and ultimately does not contribute anything to the gameplay. A lot of the work that went into Pillars falls into this category because it was done with the crazy DM mindset mentioned above, which is funny because I would imagine at least some of the folks at Obsidian remember what was said when Fallout 2 was in development: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""So the gameplay is a bit of a mess, and dungeons are a tedious slog if you can't find a way to avoid combat (the game doesn't reward combat anyway, so the shortcuts consisting of clever little cutscenes and skill checks are much appreciated). Some classes are (as of this writing) far from ideal, such as the Monk (their central mechanic involves taking damage to power their abilities, but player characters generally die almost immediately if enemies' attacks are actually landing on them). Many design decisions are just strange: a lot of classes get their best abilities up front, in the first three levels, so leveling up rarely feels like a significant improvement. Higher-level abilities actually tend to be weaker or otherwise less ideal than lower-level ones. Much of this is just poor balance and could be adjusted with patches. Others feel inexcusable: a lot of people get frustrated by the ghost-type enemies, who have extremely high defenses, teleport, duplicate themselves, come in mobs, can spam a powerful ranged attack, and in melee easily stunlock your party to death.The new original setting is a disappointment. A lot of creatures get new Welsh or Celtic names but are otherwise the same as their D&D equivalent. The story ultimately is more concerned with demystifying their own world and laying out an existentialist ""science vs. religion"" allegory. Every mystery in the setting is explained in detail before the end, and the world ends up feeling like a tiny, wretched sort of place. It's an interesting contrast to the big and wondrous settings of Planescape or Numenera, both of which Obsidian is intimately familiar with. The story is slow and ponderous and pretentious and, after a major misstep at the end of Act 2, squanders any sense of momentum or player investment it might have developed up to that point before rushing to an unsatisfying conclusion. The primary antagonist is petty, uncharismatic, and doesn't end up making much of an impact or even a whole lot of sense (I'm not entirely sure why he does anything he does, unless he's supposed to be nothing more than some kind of strawman religious zealot). Even Isair & Madae from Icewind Dale 2, as two-dimensional as they were, were more interesting and memorable villains. An effort is made to give the custom protagonist more personality than what was on display in the older IE games but it doesn't amount to much, especially compared to pretty much every other RPG Obsidian has ever made. Notably, there is no way to talk the final boss to death, which in this extremely longwinded game feels like an oversight.In the end, Pillars of Eternity was always a project fueled entirely by nostalgia. The fact that it fails to meet the level of quality of the games that it's modeled after on pretty much every conceivable level (I do think it's better than the first Baldur's Gate, but that's not saying much coming from me) means that there's no compelling reason to play it when you could just (re)play Baldur's Gate or Planescape: Torment or Icewind Dale.

												Pillars of Eternity is fantastic. All the rave reviews that have been flying around are completely true. It reminds me of the old Infinity Engine games like Baldur's Gate and the like, but it feels more modern at the same time.  Even the backer content that was included (such as the backer names, the backer created NPCs, backer created items) have been fit into the world seamlessly. As long as you don't mind a bit of reading (which enhances the atmosphere and story, it's not just there for filler) and you enjoy party-based crpgs with a good story, you'll love it.I have not finished the game yet, but I am loving it so far and wanted to tell everyone.

												Up until now, I had never played an isometric RPG like this and I figured I'd add in my two cents for others like myself.  My previous experience has been with games like Skyrim, the Mass Effect series,  various shooters and an assortments of strategy games.  With that in mind, I was a little concerned that the pacing of this game would be an issue (having to pause repeatedly in combat, reading through a lot of text, the lack of flashy special effects and cutscenes, etc...).  Not only is it not an issue, I found that it was quite relaxing!  This game makes me want to play it while drinking a cup of hot tea while sitting in front of a crackling fire.  It's an experience to be taken slowly and savored.  I spent about 30 minutes in the character creation alone and loved all the various options that went into crafting the perfect hero.I read some copmplaints here about the graphics quality, but it was a non-issue to me.  In fact, I have found that to be one of the things working in its favor.  In a weird way, not being bombarded with flashy special effects and cutscenes is one of the things that has helped make the game more immersive and relaxing to me.I highly recommend this game.  It's deep, immersive and the story and world is charming and interesting.  It requires time and thought and is not a game that is designed to be rushed through, but I feel that it does a great job at rewarding the player's time investment.			"

												ENG/ITAA masterpiece, spiritual successor of Baldur's Gate and Icewindale, 2D isometric RPG with real time combact and tactical pause.+ Supercool graphic art and level design.+ Tons of spells, weapons, armor....there's even a deep crafting system.+ Gorgeus lore.+ Great variety of enemies, bosses, NPC.+ Solid tactical combact system and good AI.+ Convincing skills three.+ One of the best character's hub ever seen in a RPG.+ Exellent music, voices, audio effects.+ Good replayability due to the system of choices.+ Works on an economic/dated PC. - Main quest not very original.- Battles are sometimes a little confusing.- DLCs ​​are really necessary.Un capolavoro, secondo me erede spirituale dei Baldur's gate e Icewinddale da cui però si distacca per quanto riguarda le regole di D&D, qui liberamente interpretate, molto più approfondite e secondo me migliorate.+ Fondali stupendi, level design sublime, tutto molto particolareggiato e curato, molto belle le animazioni di personaggi, mostri, magie ed elementi dei fondali.+ Armi, magie, armature, oggetti unici a volontà e un sistema di craftaggio molto sviluppato.+ Il background è molto bello, molto ben caratterizzato, sia per quel che riguarda i personaggi, il lore ecc...+ Grande varietà di nemici e boss.+ Il sistema di combattimento è solido e appagante, a livello di difficoltà ""marcia della morte"" il gruppo viene annientato se si lancia in battaglia senza un minimo di strategia, è sempre preferibile attirare i nemici, sfruttare il ""fattore campo"", eliminare prima i più deboli o quelli con abilità rognose ecc...le IA si comportano abbastanza bene, se un personaggio è ferito lo prenderanno di mira, cercheranno sempre di farvi fuori i maghi...niente di eccezionale ma convincente.+ Le abilità sono tante, ben differenziate e incisive nel gameplay, con la campagna principale da quello che ho capito il level cap è bloccato al 12...pochetto...non si sbloccano molte abilità, ma con i DLC si arriva a livello 24...molto meglio.+ La fortezza del protagonista è bellissima, piena di cose da fare, quest, strutture da costruire, relazioni diplomatiche...molto ben fatta, si può addirittura spedire in missione i PNG parchegiati...+ Il comparto audio è molto valido con belle musiche, voci, sottofondo, effetti sonori...tutto molto bello.+ Benchè piuttosto lineare le scelte influiscono notevolmente su trama e risvolti fornendo anche un discreto grado di rigiocabilità.+ Gira tranquillamente su PC economici e datati.- La trama principale non brilla certo per originalità, personalmente non mi è piaciuta tantissimo anche se non manca qualche colpo di scena e risvolto inaspettato. Le scelte compiute la influenzano certo, ma rimane piuttosto lineare, niente di epocale insomma. A qualcuno può comunque piacere.- A volte le battaglie sono confusionarie, specialmente se ci sono elementi del fondale che nascondono i contendenti, il campo di battaglia zeppo di gente o ci sono molti effetti di magie in corso, è il prezzo da pagare per non avere una visuale ruotabile...- Le due espansioni apportano migliorie al gioco davvero necessarie per godersi l'esperienza. Benchè la campagna principale sia sufficientemente lunga, io ne consiglio caldamente l'acquisto e non è che siano proprio economiche... "

												THE SONIC 06 OF ISO GAMES.This game is a shell of what I expected it to be. I let the hype train, and the 3.9 million budget (on kickstarter) isometric rpg game, make me think it was going to be an epic that would allow me to relive Baldur's Gate. And I was wrong.I'll start off with a few things I liked. Inventory management is much easier. You can place the majority of loot in a huge container. The Prologue I found to be extraordinarily fun, and I felt everything about that part of the game was well fleshed out. The fast forward that allows you to quickly walk around is a dream come true. The stronghold mechanics were extremely fun and well done.EDIT: I'd like to update the news on this review, the devs caved into SJWs to remove a limerick that was pathetically not offensive. In addition to that, the devs have stated modding on the Baldur's Gate scale is unlikely. So yeah, enjoy this objectively worse game. Funnily enough, they largely stated they would ""support"" mods. By support, they must have meant ""allow"" mods, supporting them in a metaphorical sense rather than an actual implementation sense.I'd also like to mention the absolute shameless moneygrab the upgrade packs are. It makes EA look generous.But sadly, for a story rich rpg, if you find the story and characters uninteresting and the combat unfun, you will not like this game.I found myself fairly uninterested in the story. In Baldur's Gate you were the spawn of a dead God, in planescape Torment you were an amnesiac immortal who can die, in this game you're a ghost whisperer.The prologue was fun until the end, and the game kinda felt like it just kept rolling downhill.First, like most obsidian games, it's been released with numerous bugs, though you wont notice them at first (loading game with some stat boosting armor stacks the effect, saving and reloading enough will make you invincible.)Combat is terribly unbalanced. There are SEVERAL situations where my backline (the damage on the team) is simply rushed by most persons of the enemy group. In order to stop them, I use tank-warriors, whom are immediately ignored and practically walked through. Warriors in general don't do very much damage so you HAVE to rely on your backline. But if you can't peel the enemies off, GG better reload.Then you can form a party of max/min rangers. 4 rangers, a cleric, and a tank/rogue are unbelieveably strong because they each get an animal companion. The hardest difficulty with this group is relatively easy.Mages and Clerics cannot cast buffs before battle. So no preperations can be used save for just ""winging it."" In battle tactics often involve simply having your backline hope the front line can prevent the fast moving rush monsters from touching the backline. In baldur's Gate, this wasn't nearly as bad an issue, as you could summon monsters or even buff characters before a battle, in this game u kinda just hope and pray.Mages have been SEVERELY weakened relative to what you probably expect. Many of the spells you'd expect them to have have been split up between roles, such as chanter, and chanters can't learn mage---excuse me, wizard spells. In Baldur's Gate you'd use all your mage spells in a battle early on. But it wasn't too big an issue, you could rest all you needed, though it would risk combat. In this game, you CAN'T rest without supplies, and you can only bring 4 rests worth in normal difficulty, plus they're relatively hard to come by.Then there's the skirmishes. They only programmed party ai to auto-attack. A very lazy way to go about things considering just about every iso game in the infinity engine allows your party to auto-battle with more developed ai.The game's built in characters ""tag along"" with your party without any real reason to do so. The only character that actually seems to have a reason to tag along is the Grieving Mother and Sagani. The others are just risking their lives for you and doing chores around your keep because ""it seems less boring than waiting around."" The writers make little effort to conect the characters to you at a personal level in any way. They barely even seem to notice each other, and while they do banter, the banter will likely remind you of Dragon Age rather than Baldur's Gate, they say a few voiced lines, instead of arguing or having something meaningful to say, they just feel like they're making minor comments. In Planescape: Torment, the characters could all connect to the main character because they were all suffering torment and at one point or another, dealt with experiencing their nature jurassically change. And the reoccurring question: ""What can change the nature of a man."" Was pure icing on the cake. I could analyze that game and its merit all day.In this game: Many of the characters aren't particularly interesting to begin with, and are shockingly low in number. BG1 had 25 companions available and 5 temporary companions. This game has 8 companions and 2 temporary. Something is amiss if the amount is a THIRD of available in game party members of a 1998 game it tries to succeed that have much less dialogue than Planescape: Torment despite much better technology not to mention recieving 4 times their asking budget. None of the in-game characters seem nearly as special or interesting.There's a LOT of writing in this game, but quantity doesn't necesarily mean quality. There's *some* great immersive dialogue, but there's just moments where I can't help but not care. The characters' motivations are poorly constructed, the quests are immersively flawed, ex: a certain paladin: (""I have to go to this location that is currently unavailable at this point in the story, so I'll just ignore my meager existence because my plotline isn't important enough to give an explanation as to why I can't guide you to this location on the map yet."") I recall PoE was CONSTANTLY advertised as free of publisher-based restrictions and a free creation envisioned by the developers. Yet, it plays textbook safe, as one of the most generic, word swamped, fantasy adventure games I have ever played.An example: A man who is witnessing the memories of himself in a different life is watching himself♥♥♥♥♥♥a woman in tears. The dialogue should describe a pained expression on his face, so that I PERSONALLY am able to figure out he feels a sense of shame and regret. Instead, the writing is, ""he makes a face as though he is ashamed of what he's done and that he regrets doing such a thing."" I'm supposed to figure that out by watching his face, stop flipping the narrative to omnipotent God who understands the feelings of others, start telling me what IM seeing so I can make that judgement.Don't even bother with the lore. Some creatures are just called ""tall."" There's no specifics given.Oh and the FAN CREATIONS EVERYWHERE. Oh God. At first I was reading the various tombstones wondering why this was all over the place. Turns out if u paid 500-1000$ you got to add some of ur own fanfiction to the game. The npcs created from this are mostly hardcore Mary Sues. Thankfully, holding tab allows you to determine who's real and who isn't. But if you want, you can ""reach out for the soul"" to read about the fanfiction character that semi-cannononically made it into the game.There's also a Kickstarter only achievement if you're a completionist.As another reviewer said:  ""For 34.99, it's a been one huge and, frankly unacceptable disappointment. It piggy backs on the reputation of much older and far superior games, without ever matching their achievements. Baldur's Gate will be remembered in another fifteen years. Barring bargain basement sales, POE will have been forgotten""Having said that, maybe I'm being unfair? I keep wanting a game to top Baldur's Gate and Torment, but I have yet to see a fraction of what this game could and should have been.TLDR; If you hate yourself and your money, purchase this game.

												Pillars of Eternity is the crowd funded spiritual successor to Baldur’s Gate 1-2. It’s an overall very good game but suffers from a few issues. I will be looking at the strengths and weaknesses of the game. The Good:-Very well written-Some very interesting NPC’s and companions-An interesting setting with some great ideas-Highly entertaining -Good choice/effect-Nice atmosphere  -Solid and well developed loreThe Bad:-You have some really good quests but also a lot of throw away quests-Fairly weak main story line with a forgettable villain and there is in fact no true, believable motivation      for your player character to do things he/she does for most of the time-too many loading screens-boring spellsThe Ugly:-The combat and the encounter design is just flat out bad-Too much combat in the game and it gets incredibly tedious after a while -visually the combat is a cluster♥♥♥♥Overall a solid title 8/10			"

												Wow, this game is amazing. If you are a fan of the Baldur's Gate series, or just looking for a good, challenging rpg, do yourself a favor and buy this game. I'm only playing on normal difficulty and I still find the game frustrating (in a good way) at times. The music in the game is amazing, though I wish there was more of it, and the controls and ui are all on point. I'm a huge fan of the Stronghold system, you gain a castle of sorts early on in the game and can make an array of upgrades for it to improve defense and commerce. Whether you're new to this sort of game or a returning veteran, this is definitely a fun time.			"

												Ye olde RPG. Recommended if you know and like this kind of game, or are really motivated to learn.At first, the game is pretty rough to learn. First, you need to learn the mechanics, which differ significantly from D&D even if they look the same. Once you've done your character and start the game, it drops a volley of lore-bombs on you, and it takes quite some time before this avalanche of Welsh-sounding names starts making sense.Once you've cleared these hurdles, you discover a well-thought game in a great setting, with an intriguing story and interesting characters, The game really gets on its own once you've reached the big city, with side-quests everywhere and different factions you can align with.I don't recommend it if you're not familiar with isometric RPGs and are looking for a first game in that genre to see what the hype is all about. Get a Shadowrun game or The Age of Decadence instead, they're fantastic games too but they don't demand as much dedication up front to get into, and turn-based combat is easier to master than real-time with pause. Then, if you decide you love that kind of game, come back to Pillars of Eternity.			"

												I tried to love this game, but the spark was missing. I wish I had dreamt about the world, obsessed over the story and clicked ""New game"" again as sooned as the credits rolled out.There were moments of brilliance in the companions' storylines (Grieving Mother and especially Durance. Not Kreia's level of awesomeness, but Avellone did a damn fine job on that priest), gorgeous writing, a few great twists on the classical D&D setting, a vivid world full of lore and gods, but ultimately, the storytelling fell flat. Playing this game felt like watching the landscape through a train's window: the scenery was beautiful but the emotional engagement was nonexistent. I never cared about the characters I met. I felt like a stranger in a strange land, and though the plot was increasingly unsatisfying, I powered through, hoping for a wonderful resolution which never came. Since the dev dream team had complete creative freedom and a great starting concept, it's a shame to accept that this ambitious game ended up being ""just a solid 7/10 if you're a fan of the genre"".This game is fan service for veterans of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment. If you know all these games inside out and are a completionist, you will enjoy Pillars of Eternity. If you discovered Obsidian through newer games such as NWN 2, KotoR 2, or Fallout New Vegas or got used to fast-paced RPGs such as Dragon Age Origins, The Witcher, The Elder Scrolls or the Mass Effect series, don't be surprised if Pillars of Eternity leans heavily towards the old school:- there are a few huge difficulty spikes coming out of the blue, - you will spend a lot of time running back and forth between areas,- you will spend a lot of time reading the quest journal and bestiary to figure things out,- you will spend a lot of time reading dialogues (the prose is magnificent, but you'll stop reading the golden characters backstories soon enough),- you will spend a lot of time getting your guys unstuck from the terrain,- you will spend a lot of time staring at loading screens (about ~3 hours out of my 50 hours playtime).

Pillars of Eternity is the best roleplaying game I've played since Neverwinter Nights.It's a classical western fantasy RPG - the player guides a party of adventurers through an epic journey, where the fate of the world just might hang in the balance.It's clear that Pillars draws heavy inspiration from Dungeons & Dragons - when creating a character, the player chooses a race and class, then assigns attributes and skills, and the game mechanics are obviously supported by a rigid ruleset and powered by virtual dice rolls. In addition, some of the classes, weapons, etc. may be familiar to D&D aficionados, but Obsidian has done an outstanding job of creating a distinct, vibrant world for Pillars of Eternity, from a wide variety of races and (orthogonal, in some cases) cultures to a range of traditional and innovative classes to geography and folklore to political rivalries to its own pantheon of living deities, around which the main storyline revolves.Many of the reviews of this game mention Baldur's Gate, and with good reason - gameplay-wise, Pillars borrows heavily from BG: isometric perspective, formation-oriented party management, fast-paced realtime combat with a variety of conditional autopause settings, even the ""You must gather your party before venturing forth"" message when transitioning between areas. However, these are all good things (maybe not the message), and everything feels right, whether exploring the wilderness,  creeping anxiously through a crypt, navigating a bustling city, or frantically trying to survive an ambush. I particularly enjoyed an original mechanic they've added: there are several sections where the player is guided through a sort of illustrated choose-your-own-adventure sequence, where the various options may involve intuition, tactics, or skill checks, and will almost certainly have nontrivial consequences.I do have a few minor quibbles: for example, it's possible to accept at least one of the optional quests and get fairly entangled in it before realizing that there's no hope of completing it at the party's current level. Each entry or exit from even the most insignificant building involves a loading screen, which means that exploring new town or village becomes a long sequence of these screens, divided by short segments of walking between buildings. Finally, the player, through a special ability she gains early on, is able to gain insight into the lives of many of the non-playable characters - however, these insights have absolutely no impact on the game in any way.The story is epic, complex, and engaging - one of the finest I've encountered in a computer RPG, and the personas and backstories of the auxiliary playable characters the player will encounter on her travels weave seamlessly in, enriching the depth and color of the experience.All in all, Pillars of Eternity is a fantastic game, and I would unhesitatingly recommend it to any roleplaying enthusiast.

												Everyone who grew up with the Infinity Engine games -- Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, etc. -- owes it to themselves to play Pillars of Eternity. This is the sequel we've all been waiting for. The heart and soul of the isometric RPGs remain, complete with gorgeous environments and an inspired combat system outside the constraints of D&D. The only thing that's changed is, well, all the stuff that you could possibly make better.57 hours spent to complete the base game missing only a small handful of sidequests. Sensational game.			"

												Pillars of Eternity is Obsidian's first try to make a game without any publisher pushing (which is what fans believed was always the problem with the bugs in their games for example) thansk to their kickstarter campaign. As it turns out yes they can release a well polished game (even with a huge complicated world like poe). Managed to finish the game after 75 hours more or less so you can see this is a huge game. there is tons of quests both main and sidequests and most of them are actually decent (not the go there and get me 5 furs kind). Even in the few ""fetch"" quests there is a story there and twists that made them fresh and enjoyable. The game looks very pretty if you like the old school isometric style, has a great soundtrack which managed not to bore me after playing the game for 70+ hours. Everyone who likes the genre this is perhaps the top crpg that has come out in the last 10+ years and certainly the best kickstarted project i have backed so far (although shadowrun is a close second). There is a ton of options in the dialogues and choices that can and will affect the world in quite a big way (unlike other ""rpgs"" which will not be named). The combat was interesting and engaging and quite hard even on normal especially on the start of the game. There is also a huge totally optional dungeon in game (14-15 floors). Definitely recommend this game and i hope obsidian can go back to ks and would gladly back them for more.			"

												Yes this game is enjoyable - no I still wouldn't recommend it.This game is mostly a shallow attempt at recreating the succes of Baldurs Gate and similar infinity engine games but fails coming close to them.Better play Baldurs Gate 2 or Dragon Age: Origins again or just wait for 75% sale.Positive: + The graphics are beautiful yet stay true to it's sucsessors art style.Negative:- Loading times and perfomanceThere are pretier games out there. But there are few that take so long to load. And it get's far worse the longer you play. And for a game with such a nostalgic look the perfomance is horrible(low framrate and freezing). This game just is badly optimised in many ways.- The game just gives the illusion of choices. Nothing what you do and say matters. E.g. Godlikes are decribed as beeing hated on - you will never see any reaction on beeing a godlike.Or you can be a mass murder and people still react friendly to you. There are almost no quests where any of your choices change something. There are a few where a person dies or not accourding to your actions - but thats the most you get. Normally you can kill everyone involved or try to solve everyting peaceful - the outcome is the same. Your party members wont leave no matter what♥♥♥♥♥♥you do, even if you sacrifice one person from your party. - The game is full of Kickstarter ""comercials""1/4 of all Characters you see in the game are from kickstarter funders - that do nothing, say nothing and often have totally unfitting names. They are just there so you can read the little stories the funders wrote. Even worse are the Kickstarter-tombstones. In every dungeon you see tombstones that are filled with funder texts - often nonsense ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The loading screen advise is even to not read them because they break the 4th wall.- Content was cut and put into the Expansion - it feels like an unfinished game without.Without the addon you don't even have a character for every class. Yet those Expansion characters where put on the cover of PoE. The items in the base game are very bland - all interesting weapons, especially the souldbound ones are expansion only. It feels like this content has been cut out and put in the expansion to sell these. Which wouln't even be that much  of a problem if we wouldn't be talking about more than 40€ for the base version amd 24€ for the DLC.- The game feels low-budgeted or rushed at many parts.* I have seen few crpgs with so few spoken text lines. There are many NPCs which don't even have one sentence which features voice acting. Yet for many NPCs it's exactly one spoken line and nothing more.  Oh other languages don't even get that 1 sentence spoken - voices stay english.* You are the only character contributing to the story. You followers don't matter. In conversations only your skills matter - even if one of your followers boosts a much higher skill than you. You are the only person involved in talking - the best you get is some meaningless comments from followers but these are quite rare.* Most uniques are not unique, they are just crafted with the same stats that you can craft by yourself. There are like 5 helmets with stats, and normal headwear doesn't gives any stats(why is so much of it even there?). Even full helmets don't give armor(=deflection).* You will come accros bugs that make you feel you play a beta game. Items that don't work and show code-blocks, quests that you can't finish because you took a path that the devs didn't saw, save games going corrupt, very odd balance choices.- The game is at an awkward spot regarding story vs. gameplayThe story followers are built to bad that you feel punished for playing with them. Custom Characters are FAR stronger.Custom Characters don't talk.Even if they don't talk that much the story followers add much to the gameplay. Without them PoE feels more like reading trough a ""choose your own adventure"" book. Especially on the higher difficulties you are forced to play with custom Characters which reduces the amount of fluff and story you experience.So what do you want: A party with talking characters or a good party?- There are LOTS of informations missing.It begins with the lacking informations on weapon speed and other stats. You need to look up how everything works like you want to write a min maxing guide on some MMORPG to understand basic combat math - and you better look that up.- Minor nitpickings* You can't pickpocket. * Looting/stealing stuff reduces your reputations - unless you kill all bystanders. But the slaughter doens't affects your reputation most of the time. You can even play a ""rightous"" Paladin and don't suffer for killing & looting unimportant NPCs.* Combat is best solved in the cheesiest way possible 90% of the time - putting a tank in a chokepoint and the damage dealers behind him.* Often you can't loot the items that charaters obviously got.* Balance patches can make your party obsolete. I can understand that you can't play a character in the beta and expect that he will be as good as when you started. But PoE got a few heavy balance patches that made good characters nigh unplayable. One of these is coming soon, heavily nerfing one class (cipher).* The guide from the Royal Edition is wrong in many points because of changes after the release.In the end this game is not horrible. But there are so many odd design choices, lacking parts and bugs that this game is not that enjoyable. I would only advice to buy on 75% sale or in a bundle with the 2 DLCs.			"

												I have to say the game has surpassed my expectations thus far. I fell in love with Baldur's Gate in 1998, and this is the game I was waiting all those years for as a lifelong RPG fan.It has all the important pieces firmly in place- Great story- Deep gameplay mechanics (even if I would like it to be D&D 5th edition)- The dialogues are well written and utilize the attributes in a clever and interesting way- The party banter is here (yay)- The world is nicely crafted (I would prefer Forgotten Realms though, but beggars can't be choosers)- Added great additional mechanics (Choose your adventure style encounters)- Doesn't treat the player like an idiot, gives a solid amount of challenge- The graphics, music and the atmosphere are ideal, and unbeatable, especially for the heroic fantasy fans- Interesting quests, and amazing writing (i have mentioned that before, but can't stress in enough)I do hope this gem will sell millions and will herald a true RPG revival, not only from Obsidian (love you guys), but from other talented developers as well. I am sick and tired of the cancer modern Bioware-EA and other soulless developers were publishing after the demise of infinity engine era games, trying to pass dumb, console oriented, 'streamlined' uninspired turds as 'rpgs'.Like other reviewer wrote ""Dear Baldur's Gate fans, welcome home.""

												So far the (c)RPG reinnessance that started 2-3 years ago, brought by Kickstarter and independent efforts, has been nothing short of wonderful, with multiple minor titles and some great highlights as Shadowrun Dragonfall and Divinity Original Sin. But each game, while brilliant in their own way, was just short of a masterpiece as a whole.I'm pleased to say that Pillars of Eternity has become the first one to achieve total grandness. Combining intelligent writing and storytelling with depth of gameplay and this little concept we call ""fun"", it immerses you in an original world full of adventure and hours upon hours of immersion.If you are an RPG/cRPG fan at all, love Fantasy, or you are even interested in narrative games with in-depth choice and consequence at all, you owe yourself to play this game.What a great time to be alive.

I chose to really take my time toget a feel for the world and to take in the environments, seriosuly if you just stop doing what you're doing in this game to look at your surroundings you'll be astonished the amount of detail that there is in the world.This was my first isometric rpg, and I'm so happy I chose a good one because it sparked something in me and now I wanna go and play every isometric rpg I can get my hands on.

												Pillars of Eternity is a top-down isometric party-based RPG in an original High Fantasy setting. Combat is in real-time but with optional pauses to sort out strategy. The influence of the D&D Infinity Engine games are strong, many of the developers had previously worked on those titles. I would compare this game mostly to Baldurs Gate II, as Pillars of Eternity has incorporated elements of the cancelled sequel (The Black Hound) to this game. Much like the Baldurs Gate games, you create your main character by selecting the sex, race, attributes, skills, class, portrait and physical appearance. Different from Baldurs Gate, you can now select a background history. This will not influence too much in the game, but they can open up new dialogue options, a few characters will treat you differently, and you'll have different skill points to use.My character I played through to beat the game and both the expansion packs was a rapier wielding Paladin with a smart mouth. For the rest of the team, I alternated between the in-game companions and ones I created from scratch. Pretty much any playstyle is supported (you can roll with a party of  only rangers, or only spell-casters, or just go solo and murder almost anyone) at least up to Hard mode. And each class offers a far more flexible play, Wizards don't have to be weak glass-cannons to be useful, and Barbarians don't have to be stupid either. Paladins have some of the strongest defensive play options, but that didn't mean my own character had to feel particularly gimped by going for a more offensive set-up.Two original classes included in the game is a spin on bards, called Chanters (in combat, their singing buffs or debuffs anyone near them, they are also the primary summoners of this game) and Ciphers. Ciphers are the “spellswords” of this game, instead of relying on an inventory of memorised spells, they build up physic energy by attacking enemy targets, and can use this energy to cast devastating spells onto the enemy. Whereas Priests and Wizards deplete their spells through usage, Chanters and Ciphers get stronger as the fighting goes on longer.Although I did enjoy the world the game was set in, the story and lore in the main-game does get a bit muddy around the third and fourth acts, the expansion packs feel much more tighter. Much like what Baldurs Gate III was supposed to be, souls and past lives are extremely central to the plot. My two biggest gripes with this game is the performance of the game, particularly in the more busier areas like cities. I have a GTX 680, and most of the more populated areas have a very noticeable drop in frame-rate, down to low 20s in some areas. The second is that going for the more grounded approach to fantasy means that there are far less interesting locales to visit. BGII had you visit a city under the sea, travel to different dimensions/planes, visit the Underdark, and much larger locations and maps. PoE might be more detailed, but it does feels much, much smaller, even with the expansion packs. That said, there are some nice QOL features that never existed in the old Baldurs Gate titles I wish they had now, for example: an option to speed up walking in some areas, a timer based stealth mode, plenty of easily accessibly information on how certain mechanics work, spell and ability radius circles, perma-death mode, and so on.As for the extras in the upgraded editions: map is nice to look at to give you context of where you are in that world, even just the once. The ringtones are bad, the wallpapers are meh, the documentary is fine, so is the almanac an enjoyable read. Soundtrack is awesome. My edition didn't include the novella.tl;dr: great if you loved top-down RPGs of old, there's plenty of this game to keep you engrossed. Not as epic as BGII, which is up to you if prefer the tone.

												Pillars of Eternity is average, enthusiastic fan fiction.Don't get me wrong. I loved BG1. And BG2. But not so much Throne of Baal. And Planescape: Torment is one of the best games I've ever played. However, Pillars of Eternity just feels like it was cobbled together by some diehard fans who couldn't let go. They're writing fan fiction to relieve the ""glory days"".The story itself is so so, and it can't decide if it wants to take itself seriously or wants to be a tongue in cheek fantasy parody. For example, there's an endless dungeon filled with vampires and mages and monsters right underneath your home, called the Endless Paths of Od Nua. Seriously? And the game takes pains to remind you in every town and forest you go to that it was crowdfunded, with little in-jokes and even name lists of sponsors plastered everywhere.  The big reveal at the end is predictable and underwhelming, especially since it basically begs the questions: ""okay, so what?"" and ""so what exactly am I supposed to do about it? if anything?""As for the system itself, it's a D&D pastiche. Unlike Dragon Age: Origins, ShadowRun or even Risen, there's no reason for why the character classes are in the setting. It's just a grab bag of D&D tropes. Let's get the monk, the psychic, the barbarian, the druid, etc. etc. and copy paste them into our take on Forgotten Realms. You've got your elves and half-orcs (sorry, Aumaua), and dwarves. Whatever race and class you pick, don't worry. It has virtually no impact. The only thing the game tries to do for originality is that it combines attributes together in new and crazy ways, to pretend it's fresh and creative. However, why a fireball-hurling wizard needs to be a mountain of muscle to do real damage doesn't make any logical sense to me!All in all, this game will appeal to two types of gamers. The old-school Icewind Dale and Baldur's Gate fans who can't move on, and think modern games are rubbish. And secondly, for people new to the genre who want to be old school without having to deal with the dated graphics and hardcore difficulties of the really old games.Me? I thought the game was alright. A weak 3 out of 5. But I prefer to both replay my old favorites AND enjoying the new, cutting edge RPGs, rather than get lost in fan-fiction recreations of old legends. YMMV.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Obsidian Entertainment Publishers: Paradox Interactive Initial release: March 2015Genre: CRPG, Strategy, Dungeon Crawler #Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationPillars of Eternity a throwback back to the days of proper Role Playing games. Where character sheets and making actual dialogue decisions (coinciding with some stat checks, I don't believe there are dice rolls) were par for the course. An only slightly more modern take on Balders Gate or Icewind Dale.The game pretty quickly drops you into the action and tells you you're very important. Its up to you what to do with that or how to react. Combat takes place in real time. With each action using a cooldown to activate in order to avoid an interrupt, aside from movement. A sort of active turn based variety of combat. Character creation is extremely in depth perhaps lacking in physical customization but the character traits, stats, class and narrative background are all available for customization. There are many many many classes to choose from to fill out your 6 person party.  Barbarian – pretty self explanatory  Fighter – Most well rounded class Chanter – magic user (units – 'lines chanted' during battle) Druid – Shapeshifter (DPS) Cipher – magic user (units – 'Focus' earned from doing damage with regular weapon) Monk – Special abilities earned from 'Wounds' or damage taken  Paladin – Can be tankish, healer Priest – magic user, healer, pos+ neg- buff, debuff dealer  Ranger – has pet, (slightly useless rogue in my opinion) Rogue – charismatic, DPS, scouts, disarms and detects traps  Wizard – magic user (most effective use of Grimoire) Perma Death is a real thing on higher difficulties. The green bar on the character portrait is Heath, the overall status of that character. The portrait itself, when taking damage fills in red, this is endurance and when depleted is what will knock someone out of battle. If someones Health is depleted entirely. Bad News Bears I'm afraid. You'll run into characters that have quests associated with them and require you to take them on your journey. These characters are also voice acted as well as some important NPC's. Though not every line has a voice over as this was a kickstarter game (as the loading screen is very apt to point out) That's simply not a realistic goal for something with as much text and dialogue. I should mention that though another character can interact with NPC's you are making the dialogue choices based on your base character for any stat checks that may occur in conversation.  You can re-spec any character at any inn for a relatively inexpensive price if you've made a terrible judgment in choosing traits or some other facet that would otherwise make your current quest more difficult. You can 'hire' a new recruit at any inn, by which I mean you can just make the exact type of character you are missing from your party. More money equals higher starting level. Fairly early on, you arrive at a place called Caed Nua, which becomes your own stronghold and fairly integral part of the game. You can upgrade it, repair it and use it as a place to rest and receive bonuses from. Depending on how much prestige you and your party have as well as the overall status of your stronghold it can be attacked by bandits (or by other groups) in which you are given the option between hiring some mercenaries and auto-resolving from afar (they can help in a manual resolve as well) if your travels have taken you too far away to make it back in time before they strike or you can travel back yourself and manual resolve to defend your keep. There is also a rather extensive side mission available here among other things.  THE GISTA true delight for the days of old when RPG's were more than 'press button for sarcastic response'. One can only hope that games of this depth and caliber remain popular enough to be feasible for proper development in the future.Follow my curation for more "

												So....this game was everything I hoped for and more. Obsidian really set the bar for CRPG's. Beyond that, I think Avellone and company really elevated their game further as far as their story writing goes as well. Just flat out superb, seamless, and fairly well flawless IMO.There has been a lot written about this game already, obviously, but I will say that with all the hype and all the funding that went into this, the potential for a let down was great, so to have the game not only deliver, but deliver in such grand fashion was amazing.The character development was deep and fulfilling and the quests actually made sense....rather than just simple fetch and escort quests with no rhyme or reason, everything had an actual reason in this game, and even where they didnt serve to advance the main story, they still had a very real role in filling out the depth of the world itself.The actual story line itself was pretty gripping. The end of Act 1 gave you the sense of a journey really just beginning, the end of Act 2 was a ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥"" moment, and the end of Act 3 let you know there was no turning back and that everything was about to get all too real as you approached the end of the game. That doesnt even factor in some of the other, non main quests story lines that develop throughout the game, which are also stellar.The journey itself was filled with pretty much any emotion you can imagine. The moral choices were often difficult due to the realistic consequences that come with every decision.Speaking of decisions, quite a few of them factor into the ending...and speaking of endings, I cant remember another game that had such a well thought out one. There also seems to be potential for a lot of variations to the ending depending on what choices you made at pivotal moments throughout. My ending was a fair mix of incredibly good and depressingly bad consequences to what I had done during my extensive playthrough. I loved that fact. I am thoroughly impressed with this game, and I have to give it the edge over Baldurs Gate 2 as maybe the best CRPG of all time, and a top 5 all time great game from any genre.I have a lot more to say, but so vast was the story and so deep the experience, that I think maybe it's better if I leave the rest unsaid and let you form your own opinion instead. Play this.Can there be a 15 out of 10? Because seriously, I think that is how I am going to rate this game.			"

												After 40 odd hours of play time and extensive experience with the old Iso Infinity Engine games; There was a real hype surrounding this title. Thankfully the wait has not been a dissapointment for me. Since Launch I took the weekend to play through the campaign and currently 40 hours in I have not even scratched the surface yet, so a short experience in gametime is not an issue.The story is 100% worth experiencing and is pretty close to Planescapes Experience if you enjoyed that classic. The sidequests can be engrossing and feel as detailed as the main campaign at times. Tasks are your fetch/kill/item quests for extra xp, so the three tiers of quest types cover all the usual ground.I am loving the companions, Obsidian have always made well written characters. Durance is probably my favourite so far. ♥♥♥♥♥S!!! Combat is fairly clunky but provides a challenge and a lot of patience late in the game on normal to hard difficulty. I played for a good 10 hours or so on hard but switched down to normal to experience the game over the engine issues that need fixing. No doubt various balance patches will come out for this. Obsidian are hardly known for their clean bugless games on launch..historically their QA department are a bunch of clowns, which is a shame considering how good their game design can be.I would say the only flaw (albeit a subjective one) is that Obsidian did make some progressive choices with NWN2 with regards to game performance (faster loading or no loading when moving upstairs in a building etc. For some reason they have regressed to having a loading screen for every map change similar to Baldurs and Icewind Dale engines. While I realise this is a nostalgia trip for some, to completley dismiss advances of modern tech to cater to some purists is an oversight in the long term now you're marketing to people beyond the backers.Eitherway, I am loving my experience of this game and purposefully have said nothing about the plot.Reccomended if you enjoy detailed, lore rich, micromanagement, tabletop inspired, story driven CRPG's			"

												Honestly, this is only a thumbs-down because there is no way of putting something 'middle ground', and with all those positive reviews, potential buyers must beware of this game's flaws.Before starting, I'm a veteran of this kind of rpg, Baldur's Gate Saga, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment (my favorite of all time), I've played it all, so you know I won't be some 'noob' who bumbles around with the controls and is incapable of handling a manual.Pillars of Eternity is an important game in this generation that was forcefed games made by publishers that had no contact with their public, it was successfully financed by the public, and from that standpoint Obsidian was more than successful. This game was made with love, and with lots of holes...Starting with the good aspects, every companion so far has interesting stories to tell and different personalities that can be deep. The way the characters are generated are meant to avoid Minmaxing, every single stat can help any kind of character in some way, enabling different builds for different classes. Speaking of which, equipment works differently. Every weapon has pros and cons, and any class can use anything. A wizard can use heavy plating, a warrior can use a long-range wand, heavy armor makes actions slower, and certain enemies are immune to certain kinds of damage, so you can't rely on a single sword all the time. The music made by Justin Bell is... practically a carbon copy the old rpgs like Baldur's gate's Michael Hoenig (Which is a good thing). There is a diverse set of quests for you to take care of, some have pretty emotional stories to tell, and there is always something hidden for you to see.Other good thing is the time manipulation, you can not only make time run faster, but slower, good to micro-manage a fight. SPOILERS, you get a keep, and the ability to manage some sort of building or fortress is always welcome on my book, provided you be  able to -really- manage it (I'm looking at you, Baldur's gate 2, the precursor for 'hero gets a keep', but that frustrated me awfully due limiting said keep to just gain gold from time to time.) and in an interesting twist, you have not one, but two kinds of fame, local fame, and personal fame. Some actions can brand you as a specific kind of person, be charitable, and people will find you benevolent, be harsh, and you might get points as a Stoic person. And with bad/good reputation systems per region, like Fallout 2, you can really make yourself a hero of a thousand fames. I can't tell much about the plot, but it has its ups and downs. The game not only acknowledge helpers, but celebrate them, and here and there you will see names of backers in the shape of special npcs with unique stories and messages on cemeteries.Now, for the bad part.Every single trait explained before has huge, huge, huge flaws.Every single point explained can be insanely frustrating, sometimes nearly gamebreaking at times. The backers? You will see thousands of those characters just lying around waiting to be clicked and expecting you to read their stories time after time after time. After the first city, I started to ignore them altogether. They are EVERYWHERE and sometimes they can be downright immersion-shattering. None of them interact with you, in any way, they are just there to be basked upon and so their 'awesome stories' can be read.Combat is a mess. The Allied A.I is so idiotic that it's nearly impossible to have a single fight without micromanagement. If they set on a target, they won't disengage from it without a direct command. Meaning, they can be mowed down by 'opportunity attacks' made by the enemies and worse, step on traps, run inside the area of a fireball (friendly or foe), and much worse. You can't tweak the A.I to me more specific than ""kill everything in sight"" ""Only move if the enemy attacks you"", and as another reviewer noted, the enemy AI knows how to work VERY WELL as a team. You can't buff your team before fights, you can't lay more than ONE TRAP and ONE SPELL TRAP, which severely limits strategy. The cleric spells are nearly useless, since many of the status effects that low level enemies can cause on you (Paralysis, Dizzy, Charmed) can be only countered with high-level spells. Which you won't have. Skills are another mess, they are rarely used, useful, and only the main character can use his skills in interactions, meaning, if you are a wizard and spent all your points in lore, no matter if you have two super-warriors with 10 in athletics, you will have to waste a rope or cheat. The devs wanted to avoid minmaxing? Awesome! Then why in the name of Bhaal they chose to put So many interactions with such a high stat requirements? I had to use 18 intelligence to haggle prices with a courtesan, but had to use -Resolve- to talk about an ancient relic with a scholar!? Oh, and you can't stack boosts given by items. Nice, no problem, except that the boosts given are just +1 or +2, items with +3 are awfully rare. Oh and either you get a cape, or a necklace... WHY!?The quests... where to begin? I'm not against straightforward good vs. evil plots. Baldur's Gate 1 main criticisms was that evil characters were screwed because of the dualist nature of the game. I agree with the criticism, but I don't mind that, the game itself was honest in acknowledging it's nature. but many (thankfully not a lot) of quests in Pillars will offer a false sense of morality. A Moral Conundrum is when you can't choose based on the fact that each choice has equally convincing and important arguments. Pillars just pretends to give 'hard' moral choices by offering either something 'good', or something 'evil' that will give you an item, boost, or more money. Again, it would be all fine and dandy... except that Reputation hardly matters except in key points. It doesn't help you buying/selling stuff much, no random groups will try to hunt you down. And the game pretends to always offer you a 'third choice' if you have stats/skills, which it doesn't in points that would really matter. And many, MANY are severely flawed or bugged. There was a quest in which I had to save a group of soldiers from a banshee that enthralled them. I killed  the banshee without a single soldier dying, only to discover that the devs never gave you an option of saving said soldiers. You have to kill them. Also, without a warning, you might be suddenly drafted into a faction without the option of getting out, if you merely accept a quest. And many, many personal quests with your companions won't change a SINGLE thing in their story. You could treat certain members awfully, insult them, but... nothing changes, you just gain xp.The game allows you to make items, potions and scrolls, yaaayy! To make something really useful, you will need rare ingredients that rarely appear. The enchantments that you can place on a piece of armor or weapon are severely limited and expensive due said ingredients being rare, so you're better off buying weapons with a shopper, or finding special gear in dungeons. For the last part, the Keep. Having a keep in itself is awesome, a place to call home, a base to build... except that the mechanics are utterly broken. See, to avoid making the players just sit on their asses waiting time to pass to collect money, the devs made time pass in the keep in two senses, turns, and days. Days are used to build stuff like walls and houses, and turns only pass when you finish quests. It has two special stats, security and prestige. They SUPPOSEDLY should bring you more money and guests (prestige), and protect said money and guests (security). I maxed them both, and my money kept getting stolen by bandits.So, it's a good game, but be warned!			"

												There's a lot of talk out there about how if you liked the old infinity engine games (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, etc.) that you will love Pillars of Eternity. This is almost certainly true, but not everyone has played those, so if you are just looking for another good RPG. If this is the case, get it, let me tell you why! Just keep in mind this the continuation of an older and much different kind of RPG, one that you read much more than you see visually. Some might see the 2D backgrounds and relatively unimpressive 3D models and think ""why play this when I can play the much sexier new Dragon Age?"" Well, if Dragon Age is akin to an interactive movie, Pillars is like an interactive book. It's brimming with excellent writing and interesting characters, not to mention some fascinating lore. It can seem a bit like standard fantasy with dwarves and elves running around, but after only 7 or so hours it's got me hooked. I don't want to go into too much detail about mechanics and things, other reviews have surely covered that. TL;DR: This a thinking man's RPG, it may not have had a huge budget, but the folks at Obsidian are (in my opinion) some of the best in the business, and this an excellent game. If that sounds good to you, buy it, and support some of gaming's best content creators.			"

												A great retro-style, isometric view RPG, probably the best of its kind since Dragon Age: Origins. Though the writing quality is uneven, with some names feeling as though they came out of a fantasy name generator and some plotlines being disappointingly anticlimactic, the narrative as a whole and most of the major side quests are extraordinarily well designed. This, paired with the game's beuatiful, painterly art style and the amount of freedom granted to the player in terms of narrative choices are what makes the game worth playing. The game is not without its faults: the level of cap of 12 is too low for a game with so much to do, and if you're the sort of player who likes to complete all side quests, you'll find yourself reaching it long before the final dungeon. The megadungeon which forms a major side quest in the game is irritatingly grindy, with interesting points popping up so rarely in between frequently redundant battles as to make the trek through the entirety of it rather infuriating. Finally, and perhaps most problematically, the game's mechanics are a mess: skills, attributes, the array of 8 different damages, and a confused jumble of traits intertwined together just feel incongruous and make no intuitive sense. Despite all of that, however, the excellent storytelling and fascinating lore of the world are what make this game shine. All in all: a fantastic throwback.			"

												I've quite a history when it comes to playing infinity engine games and D&D oriented games in general and I can not in good faith recommend this game for the price it's being offered. I've played Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, including the expansion throne of Bhaal. Yes I've played Icewind Dale 1 and 2 and even Neverwinter nights 1 and 2. Pillars of Eternity just doesn't measure up, in large part due to the laziness of the developers and an overall lack of innovation. This is the first time I've played through a Bioware/Obsidian rooted game and skipped through the text conversations out of the shear dreariness/tediousness of the story in PoE. The combat is dull and a step backwards from the scripted companion AI in the infinity engine games. If the idea of micromanaging every action of your party members sounds appetizing, then you might very well enjoy this game, that is if the bugged AI and invisible walls don't ruin your experience, as quite regularly you will find that your party members will twitch or stand around aimlessly while you attempt to slog through the game's ever boring world. I should also mention the fact that your party stops getting xp from battles after getting enough kills of certain mobs and completing that mob's beastiary, making battles an annoyance and borefest later in the game). I paid $38 for this and regret doing so, for those infinity engine fans wishing to purchase this game, I would suggest waiting for a price drop and paying no more than $8. Don't believe the hype, this is not the lovingly made Baldur's gate successor you had hoped for.			"

												Pillars of Eternity is a reminder of a different time and not only because it tries to recreate the atmosphere of the immortal classics, but because it treats the player the same way the games a decade ago did. It doesn’t straightly assume that the players are clueless (can be read as stupid) and doesn’t hold their hands in everything they do, instead it gives the players the opportunity to learn through trial and error and discover the game by themselves. Difficulty and logic are notions almost lost to this new generation of games and with some producers saying that their games are more difficult than they should be (when it is quite the opposite), the future doesn’t look so bright. Games like this one come to stand against the current trend and their success show that there is still hope.                Pillars of Eternity is not a flawless game and knowing Obsidian’s work, that was never going to happen, as the people working there have a huge history with bugs dating before the existence of this studio. The game makes an appeal to nostalgia for a time that is never coming back, but it stands on its own and shines like a diamond, a little rough on the edges, in a sea of carbon yet failing to be the masterpiece of this age.This title also stands as proof that Kickstarter crowdfunding is not a way of just cashing on the hopes the fans, redeeming this concept from the latest mishaps.                If I can let my suppressed subjective side speak freely for a short passage during this review, I want to say that I enjoyed this game immensely, more than most of the games in the last couple of years. It was a heart breaking moment for me when I heard that Obsidian Entertainment was so close to bankruptcy and I’m glad that the fans of this genre and of this studio made their continued existence possible. By the time I write this review, Pillars of Eternity is a known success, it has an expansion in works (already announced during Kickstarter) and this can only make me happier.  Obsidian Entertainment (inXile and some other smaller studios), don’t ever leave us, because without you and your games, the PC gaming industry and the RPG genre will be much bleaker.                As an ending note I would like to say this: The Witcher 3, Shadowrun: Hong Kong and Torment: Tides of Numenera, come and challenge Pillars of Eternity if you can, because this RPG is high up there!Pros:+ Perfect combination of artistic and painted-like 2D graphics with 3D characters+ Epic soundtrack+ A story full of adventure, mystery and choices+ Extremely well written dialogues and some captivating characters+ Tactical combat with many challenging fights+ The DnD vibe+ The Endless Paths+ Loot system and the itemization+ 60-70+ hours of gameplay and enough replay value+ Infinity engine games feelingCons:- Enough game breaking bugs and lots of other glitches at launch- Some of the combat mechanics don’t work too well- The skills system is an underwhelming copy of DnD- Many small maps- The stronghold is nothing more than a money spender/maker- The big number of loading screens can become a nuisance- No vegetation animationsRead the full review at:http://thegameslashers.blogspot.ro/2015/04/pillars-of-eternity-review.html "

												I'm going to keep this very short. For the fans of the genre, this is a must-have. The old school feel, dialogue boxes, the hud and the isometric landscape will bring tears to your eyes if you were around for the first BGs like me.BUT, as you progress you'll start seeing through the nostalgia and noticing the flaws. And there are a few; 1- Spell menu designs; horrible! Spells only appear when you hover your mouse over the spell level slot, which is frustrating because you keep missing it by an inch and it goes to the next slot, or worse cast the wrong one just to realize turns later. Sounds like a small thing, but considering the hours you spend casting them I would have expected something better. 2- auto leveled companions; yeah, you start your game, hang around for a couple of levels then meet this great guy, priest or something; you should be happy, but you can't. Because their level always matches yours and as usual they are complete idiots when it comes to picking talents. Don't be surprised to find your exact build (happened to me with a paladin) and stupid worthless crap like extra level 1 spell slot?!.3- very inconsistent difficulty curve; won't be a problem for a some of you but I have friends giving up on the game just because the first few levels were near impossible to beat. this game starts really tough but once you reach level 8, you'll start butchering people like crazy. The problem is the dungeon below your castle which you can use as a grinding area and get a few levels without advancing in the story. So from that point on you'll breeze through the dungeons, stopping only for a few occasions like a few bosses (the master below!).4- And finally, subplots. I have to say the story is great here, but all of us oldschoolers expected funny sidequests, really wacky npcs with stupid motives, the occasional wondering idiot and so on. Also everything kinda ties into the main arc, which is great in a way, but what about stuff like the knights of solamnia in BG2, vampires and such? I miss those.Apart from all that, this is a very good game, and I was hooked. The game has a very good story, great voice acting, beautiful sceneries and intense battles. my rating: 8/10			"

												I wanted to love this game, I was so excited to love this game. But from the moment I started playing something was off. There is so much here, but all of it falls flat. There is a ton of exposition about the fantasy world you’re dropped into, names of peoples, places, history, religion and past wars. But every bit of it feels like a meaningless amature fantasy novel. At no point are you given anything to care about. You are simply thrown one generic fantasy name after another. The first dialog is full of things like, ""welcome to the land of glaflagin, where the people of dubligloonin fought off the flaflarin!"" I loved the old games in this style but this one is missing the important bits I liked about those. It’s like they made a game that looks like the old ones that were good but don't have any of the parts you liked about the old ones. I will give this game some props because it made me realize the parts of those old games that didn't add anything, but this one utterly misses the point. It sure looks pretty but it’s an empty and shallow world. It doesn't help that the combat system is a slog, with lists upon lists of spells and abilities feel like a pain to get through, multiply that by your whole party. A strategic system that would work well on the grid of a D&D table but is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥full of trial and error on the screen. So then I turn the difficulty down to just play the ""story"" but it just never hits the right cords. There are characters you can click on in the game, random NPC's with names that give you rich back stories of their past lives, THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING. I finally just stopped clicking on them because there were nothing but a waste of time. Why? If I wanted to read someone's crappy disjointed fantasy novel I will look for fanfiction. The stretches of time between plays got longer and longer until finally I had to grapple with he fact that it simply wasn't fun for me to play. A kind of game I really, really, want to encourage but this just happens to be an example of a not that great one.			"

Pros:+ Extremely well-written+ Customization options for many features (when to auto-pause, how the stash can be used, dialogue displays, UI, etc)+ Modernized Baldur's Gate experience+ Deep, three-dimensional characters+ Expansive lore+ Character stronghold+ Mega-dungeon+ Choices and consequences matter and are rarely black and white decisions+ Custom system that's easy to learn but hard to master+ Dialogue and character interaction is extremely complex, and relies on varying attributes, abilities, reputations and previous character choices to determine available options and how those options are received+ The ending actually reflects your choices in game and gives a sense of closureCons:- Loading screens.  So.  Many.  Loading screens.- Spotty voice acting- Combat pathfinding can be kinda stupid- Immersion-breaking backer content- Extremely text-reliantOverall: Pillars is a great game that's extremely immersive and fun.  If you are a fan of isometric games like Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale, but can't get into them due to their age, this is a perfect game to try.  Obsidian did everything right.  The game is streamlined and their original system works wonderfully.  The text is beautifully written, and if you can ignore the backer content (any tombstones or yellow-name characters) the game is one of the most immersive you'll find.  Voice acting gets choppy (one frame is narrated, the next is not, then another narrated, etc), and there are a lot of loading screens.  These are minor issues in an otherwise perfect game.  Every choice matters in this game, and if Bioware pays attention, maybe they can take a few notes on how to properly end a Mass Effect game.Bottom Line: You probably already know if you want this game or not.  But if you're on the fence, wait for a solid sale and buy it.  It's a blast to play, and whatever problems the game may have fade away in the face of the final package.  I will never not recommend this game.			"

												An exceedingly high quality RPG drawing inspiration from the the golden age of the genre, and PC gaming itself. The easiest way to describe it is as a spiritual successor to Bioware's Infinity Engine games, like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale most notably. I don't want to devalue it with that term (same as how I felt another excellent game in the CRPG revival scene, Wasteland 2, was too often simplified as a successor to the isometric Fallout games) as it has a lot going for it. If anything I think it drew a lot of inspiration from Planescape: Torment, as well as 2009's cult classic Inquisitor. Pillars actually strongly reminds me of Inquisitor, just with tighter mechanics and better production values. The lore itself isn't too out there, it's a fairly Tolkien-esque world. What really lifts it is the excellent writing quality and sheer abundance of it. The last game I can remember with such good writing was the aformentioned Planescape: Torment, back in late 1999. The game's lore is richly crafted and with a huge attention to detail. You can really get lost just reading the books and the cyclopedia. The in-game dialogue is similarly well done, it really has that cosy feel of DnD and 90s CRPGs but on a higher level of quality. The other two strong points are the graphics and the strategic combat. The visual style of the game is just fantastic. Enviroments almost look like paintings and the lighting effects are especially notable. The production value of the game is as a whole, really good. Sound effects and music are both very well done too. The combat is excellent too, it really pairs well with the deep RPG elements and character building. The system is based off DnD but is pretty much custom made for the game and it works very well. The combat is consistently enjoyable and different classes offer many different options for the player to approach and conduct combat with. All in all, the game is another excellent release in the CRPG revival of recent years. Highly recommended for any RPG fan and practically a must buy if you're a CRPG fan. In the era of the action RPG, it's great to see games like Pillars of Eternity keep the old-school flame alive.			"

												If a modern slant on the deep RPGs of yesteryear are what you have been looking for (and, frankly, who hasn't) then this is certainly the game for you. But newbies be warned - this is a slow-burner of a game. By which I mean early sections include a LOT more walking around and talking to people than actual fighting - if you can't live with that then just don't bother -rather than writing silly negative reviews based on a sole aspect and 30mins play. About the ""bland"" combat - it isn't bland. It changes as you progress in much the same way as it has in EVERY DnD type game in history. If you want shallow hack n slash look elsewhere kiddies.Which brings us to the story. And, to my mind at least, storylines in RPGs are ALWAYS the most important aspect. This one is original and the new setting and weirdness of the developing situation (which is really quite dark in parts) create a great sense of intrigue and immersion AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE PATIENCE NOT TO WANT TO BE FIGHTING HORDES FROM DAY ONE.For me, then, this is nigh on the perfect game. But it will not appeal to the impatient or those who are only about instant high octane killing. 98%			"

												OK, I have to get this out.I loved BGII (not BGI) and consider planescape:torment an ideal game. Everyone loves this game, and if you buy the game, you probably will too. But I feel like I am the only one who sees all the problems with this game.We need to move forward. The old crpg's were great, but they were not to be idolized. We need to understand why we loved them, and let the genre grow with us and become better.This game feels like it was made by a team of writers who felt that combat was an interruption. Far too much emphasis is placed on words words words. Dear god the reading. I'm even a huge reader myself, but I do not turn on the computer to read a novel.The addition of write-your-own-story style vignettes was a great idea, but honestly they were never that shocking or a real decision. If you took a risk you gained an item and usually just lost some hit points (overall not a huge detriment).I want to go off-track and rant for a bit. Can we please not make any more ultra-generic fantasy games? Nothing about this world was remotely interesting until the 3rd act. It was the same, ""the mayors daughter's is lost"" stories that I have seen so many times I'm over it. But everyone gobbles it up and I don't know why.The game demanded I do their textbook reading. They had people speak, and the dialogue written so you could read along, but they always added in their little descriptive sentences so they could make sure you knew what happened. So often I had to struggle to picture scenes told entirely through text. If only they had some way to use characters and voiced dialogue to make me understand what happened. Oh wait, they can, but they spent all their @#$@% effort figuring out which adjective should describe a leaf.*spoiler* After I beat the game, you would think that my character was a baby♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with a gambling problem. Every damn story-line they wrapped up was some horrendous or heart-breaking event. Keep in mind that I did not help some characters with their problems because they were annoying and I did not know where to go. I worked my♥♥♥♥♥off to try and clear one district of undead people and turn off the device to recover it. What does the epilogue tell me? That I somehow messed up my choice and now it is overrun again after some people moved in.The WORST part of the epilogue was the story about me taking back a keep from a cliche insane king (I'm glad the writers stayed up all night developing him) that really any human with a shred of decency would try to eradicate. They said the crazy king came back as a lich or something, killed his nephew, and now reigns over the dead region because he killed everyone. Wait wait, that is cool as♥♥♥♥♥♥ I WISH I could have had to deal with that. I wishan entire act was fighting an undead king and determining how to keep him in the ground. This is awful because they had an awesome idea that they just relegated to a paragraph, then threw the cliche mountain at me instead.*End Spoiler*In the end, I just wanted to get through the game. The combat is incredibly overcomplicated. There are 10 or so status effects, and none of them are intuitive or seem to matter besides stun and knockdown (which apparently are the same). Sometimes your weapons would be ineffective, and there would be a character saying it, but the combat log was so dense I had to hire an accountant to find it. When I considered the amount of real life time I spent in combat, it was actually faster to not use many abilities, and instead just give my characters passive abilities so they auto-attack harder.Let's also talk about there being no party AI. Baldur's Gate had AI. That was over a decade ago. Computers have octupled in power, and ducking obsidian can't get together to write simple AI.Combat encounters were slapped together. There was no actual encounter design, they just had groups and open areas.When you leveled up characters, there were very few meaningful choices. There are 6 different weapon specialization talents that all do the same thing, but you know, if you want to choose them and not really care that is good too.Finally, combat difficulty could go from tutorial level to final scene of Ender's Game difficulty. The final boss was sooooooooooo hard. Why? Their defenses were so high that everything was a graze, doing 1-3 damage versus full damage of 30-40. I basically had to exploit to win.So yeah, everyone loves it, and I feel like this game will become the dances with wolves of video games: enjoyed at the time it came out, but a decade later nodbody knows why they liked it.

												After finally finishing this after 100 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hours, I think it honestly might be one of my favourite RPG's ever.I always have faith in Obsidian. Their ability to create RPG's is unmatched. Or maybe I say that because Fallout: New Vegas showed just how utterly dogshit Bethesda are at it.Anyway, if you've played old infinity engine games like Icewind Dale or Baldur's Gate, I can tell you that Pillars Of Eternity is a more refined version of those CRPG's with some mechanics to improve upon it, along with a more medieval, gritty world and lore. It also doesn't ultimately follow traditional DnD rules, but personally I liked the way it did things.The story is basically that a crisis is happening that is leaving newborns without souls, and like all RPG's, you are majorly involved in this and you set out to uncover the answer. The story is honestly pretty deep and thought out. The ending was a bit anti-climatic, but the ending SCENE was good. The DLC was honestly even more climatic and tense than the main game, and I would highly recommend playing through it.Mechanic wise, it's a huge improvement from older RPG's. The endurance system means no more losing party members every 10 minutes, as they just get knocked out in fights instead. (They still have max health and can die, it's just it takes a while to wear them down.)Classes are set out to be proficient at pretty much most things, each having a different main proficiency though (like most RPG's). For example, fighters are good at taking damage, Beserkers are good at DEALING it, Paladins are good at attack and support, clerics are good at support spells, wizards, attack spells. It's all a really fun system and no class isn't fun to play. The soundtrack is god-tier, the lore and world is incredibly interesting, the characters are pretty well done. This has genuinely been the only game in existence that made me warrant getting the collector's stuff BECAUSE I loved this♥♥♥♥♥♥so much.Definitely recommend buying and playing. For how much content this has, it is truly worth more than it is. All I can say is that you shouldn't play it with the mindset that it will blow traditional CRPG's out of the water. You'll just dissappoint yourself. Play it and expect something you expect out of any other game.			"

												Having finished my first and more or less thorough walkthrough I think I'm ready to write a little something about this game. Short version: this game is beautiful and I enjoyed playing it immensely. And now for details.I didn't back this game on Kickstarter. I must say I had my doubts, even when the beta was out I wasn't sure I liked what I saw.  Gladly, I was wrong, but nonetheless let me start with negative criticism:- Bugs. Yes, there are bugs. Back when the game was released there were quite a lot of them, some of them rather nasty. However, bugs are only a temporary issue as long as developers work hard at fixing them and right now Obsidian is doing fine. You can see a lot of communication between gamers and developers going on at the forums, most issues are already reported and will be addressed at some time. Which is why I don't think that bugs are that much of a problem.- Bad/weird design decisions. Those are much worse than bugs because those are a part of the game. The interface, for one, is far from being perfect. Pathfinding is terrible, especially in battle. Battles themselves are separated from the peaceful exploration which means that pre-buffing or pre-summoning or other things like that are not possible. So there are things like that, but not that many of them. Not enough to spoil the pleasure of playing but for some players probably enough to wince once in a while.- Backer content. I have deepest respect for Kickstarter backers, but all that backer content is better off somewhere... well, not in the game itself. The tombstones can be ignored, but I would trade all those 'special' NPCs for just one real NPC of Obsidian's design, or, better still, for a little quest.- Role-playing system. The game utilizes an original role-playing system that was designed to kind of remind you of D&D while not being D&D, which benefited the game and harmed it at the same time. Some things work nicely: combat mechanics work, original classes like Chanters and Ciphers are awesome, ability and skill checks function properly. However, such classes as priests, wizards or druids seem (to me) like they were just copied from D&D without much thought. Also I have a real problem with attributes, skills and abilities. Why don't they influence each other? And why are the skills so odd? Outside of dialogue interaction, each skill has exactly one use. Then there are attributes. For example, in this game Might represents both physical and spiritual power, which means that virtually every class needs Might to be able to do damage. At the same time, Intellect only affects the duration of effects and such, so a Wizard might fare better with high Might and low Intelligence. Interesting, but doesn't make much sense if you compare it to how attributes are treated in dialogue options. In textual interactions Might is just plain physical Strength and Intelligence is, well, how smart you are. This means that attributes fail to describe your character. So do I make a mighty wizard to be effective in battle or do I make an intelligent wizard to actually roleplay in dialogues? Anyway, chances are you won't even pay attention to all this while you're playing. However, in the long run, in case there are sequels, not having a coherent and thought-through role-playing system might do some harm.- White text on dark background. Had to note that specifically. My eyesight is not perfect, I know, but this bright white  font against dark background is killing meeeee. And there's a lot of reading to be done in this game...But enough with the negative. The good things! There are actually a lot of them so I'll only mention what comes to mind immediately.- The game is very rich in content. It isn't some linear sham that gets shorter and plainer the longer you play. The game is very consistent with lots of quests, NPCs, fractions and locations to explore.- Exploration is pure joy in this game. Actually, I believe that PoE has the best dungeon-crawl gameplay ever. Dungeons are so beautiful, so lovingly crafted, so interesting to explore that I wouldn't probably mind if the whole game was one big mega-dungeon. And I have never been a big fan of dungeon-delving before!- Options. There are a lot of options in the game. A lot of different ways to finish quests, but also a lot of plain game options. Fast mode, slow mode, bigger fonts, smaller fonts, color-blind mode, auto-pause, languages, subtitles - everything is adjustable and this is awesome.- Most importantly, this game has that elusive charm that BG2 or IWD had. The feeling that makes you explore map after map until it's morning and your eyes can't read the dialogues anymore. It is immersive, it is thrilling, it is intriguing. Obsidian put their hearts and souls into this game, they genuinely care about it and it really shows. Which is the main reason I have to call this game a major success. Everything that is wrong with this game can be corrected, it isn't such a big deal. The only thing that you cannot patch is the absense of the soul. This game deals with the problem of human souls and of so called Hollowborn - children born soulless. Today, there are a lot of games that seem to be Hollowborn too, but not this one. I hope Obsidian makes many more games like this and next time I'll try my best to support them early on!P.S. Something I forgot to mention. Doing a complete playthrough took me 70+ hours, but for some time I had to play offline due to a very odd bug that several other people encountered too. So don't mind the 'hours on record' thing too much.			"

												An exceptionally well-crafted game.  Some of the reviews here confuse me.  I would not say this game is a Witcher III, but it doesn't pretend to be, and it doesn't carry the same price tag.  I would say I did buy the Champion Edition on sale for 66% off, and I have never regretted the purchase.  As you can see, I have quite a few hours in the game, so I've gotten my money's worth.  I'd buy the game for $25 or less (Champion Edition).The game does drop you into the world, like most classic rpgs, but once you're there it pulls you in.  I suspect some reviewers don't read the storylines much, and if so, then of course, much of the flavor of the world is lost.  Some characters are narrated, but many are not, so reading is a requirement.  I'd play this game when you'd like a relaxing game with a beer or coffee, when you've had your fill of intense FPS games or even rpg games that requirement all hands on deck and 100% attention.  This is truly Baldur's Gate style - when game were just fun, and often their story, while subtle, sticks with you for quite some time.  NPCs: 8/10The NPC character you find have decently interesting storylines, though I do wish they had a couple romance options, and it doesn't quite seem as dynamic as the Baldur's Gate conversations. That is, your responses don't seem to have as many or as dramatic of an effect on relationships in your party.  I do miss that.Storyline: 8/10The storyline, as mentioned above, doesn't necessarily start off incredibly deep, and the NPC storylines don't do a terrible amount to pull at your heartstrings, but they aren't dull as some reviewers have said.  That would be unfair to them.  It's a unique story with lots of interesting turns and plenty to discover and that keeps me interested in the next chapter.  More importantly, the world is teeming with interesting stories.  For instance, some of the stories connected with the keep are absolutely great, and your choices feel important.  Similarly, some of your choices in other stories can lead to unexpected allies or prisoners in your keep.  That is an exceptional aspect of this game and there are few other games like this.  Reminds me of table-top rpg games I've played for years.  And it's certainly not any worse than something like Divinity: Original Sin which I eventually got bored of and didn't finish the main storyline.Graphics, Visual Design: 8/10The graphic aren't exemplary.  The photos do an accurate job showing potential buyers what they'll get.  It's basically a prettier Baldur's Gate.  Or, to use a newer game, it's much like Divinity: Original Sin.  It's, perhaps, a touch less pretty, but it's got unique art design.  Again, you're not getting Witcher III, but nor should you be expecting that.Gameplay: 8/10Here's where I think some reviewers have totally lost their minds.  The game play is in some ways, what you'll expect - once again, like Baldur's Gate.  It's *certainly* not worse.  That's complete madness to say.  And in some ways, it's unique and wonderful; I find some features incredibly refreshing and superior to Divinity: Original Sin which seems to be a fan favorite.  The short instances that you occasionally find for grappling hooks, prybars, and lockpicks are beautifully rendered and the choice to provide a mini-Choose Your Own Adventure in those is beautiful!  It makes me feel like a kid again, making important choices and discovering new treasures or adventures.  Traps can be useful depending on the scenery.  Unfortunately you can only put down one so it's sometimes hard to lead enemies into them, but that's realistic.  Combat lacks the synergies of Dragon Age and Divinity, and in that respect resembles old-school D&D games most.  But the endurance and health mechanic is new and interesting, and gives a realistic feel.  The limited number of campfire rests makes the player reluctant to rest all the time, which leads to some nailbiting combat, but there are just the right amount of extra campfire supplies spread throughout maps to reward players that carefully push on and manage their spells and health.  I've been playing on the hardest difficult on my first playthrough (without Iron Man of course, though).  And it's been a perfect difficulty for a cautious player.  In the beginning I did have to retry quite a few battles as I was getting my characters leveled up to a sweet spot and I was learning the system, as well as acquiring loot.  But once I did that, I've been moving along at a good but challenging pace, occasionally turning my attention away when I realize that I'm in too deep.  This is the perfect balance between challenging and fun.In all, the game has some very innovative aspects.  I haven't mentioned a number of other interesting features like the stronghold aspect (which is simple but highly engaging) or the balance between quick stories and deep dungeons, or the crafting (which is expensive at first, but overall balanced) or the interesting unique items you can find.  There's so much love put into this game that it would be unfair to rate it at anything below an 8.  But it would also be inaccurate to put it at a 9, alongside the likes of Witcher III.			"

												This review is based on a 99% done playthrough on Hard difficulty.Let's start with the story and the eight NPC recruits first.  While it's hard to top 'You are immune to death, but your memories are gone. Have fun out there.' and 'Remember when you almost died to that wolf? Ok now go kill a god', Pillars of Eternity's main plot is very engaging and weaves itself well into the set pieces and characters you meet throughout your journey.  You are a random person in a caravan that approaches some weird cult and it's leader fiddling with an ancient machine. You're knocked out and wake up with the ability to peer into other people's souls.  Meanwhile sometime before the events of the game started Everyone's Favorite Benevolent God starts punishing heretics before finally being destroyed by a big F-off weapon and has not been seen since.  The main plot involves chasing down this cult leader while either dodging or supporting the influence of the many more gods present in the world. Many of the NPCs you can recruit have their own struggles with their own gods, and if you stick with them long enough, you can help them resolve their issues as well.  The game's reputation system, where you get 'points' towards the different attitudes you present while speaking with others (benevolent, cruel, rational, honest, etc.) is very well done and is sure to result in repeat playthroughs. Conversations can also depend on what class and backstory you picked during character creation. During one particular quest in Act 2, I found myself wishing I was a Priest of Skaen (evil jerks) just to see how it would have played out differently.The recruitable NPCs are written very well, have good party banter, and help you understand the quite wordy backstory of the world, however many of their pre-selected combat talents are either very poor or don't make any sense at all.  This has been known to cause players to rush to them before gaining too many levels so that they can build them how they see fit.  Min-maxers are going to do what they do in this regard, but I believe this to be justified until they are tweaked a bit to more accurately reflect what the game expects from you while in combat.The combat is what you can expect from the 'real-time with pause' games that it emulates such as Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale but with a few major changes.  The first major change deals with stealth.  When you go into stealth mode, your whole party goes into stealth mode. When one person is caught, everyone is caught.  This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and renders a rogue's major class talent, backstab, completely and utterly useless.  It's such a terrible, incomprehensible combat mechanic that I have to wonder if we, the players, are doing something wrong, and the developers intended it for some other use that we haven't thought of yet.Another quite jarring combat mechanic is 'engagement.'  Once you engage with an enemy, you are basically rooted to that spot. Any attempt to even move an inch will open you up to a huge free hit to your character.  While there are both items and talents that help with your defense while breaking engagement, it is still not enough for me to consider it a fun, worthwile addition to combat.  The AI pathing isn't good enough, especially when fighting in hallways and doors. I find myself tolerating engagement rather than enjoying it as a challenge to overcome. With all that said I am greatly enjoying my time with the game and can't wait to start another character.  It truly is a successor to the great Baldur's Gate games and it is one I will be playing for a long, long time. "

												tl;dr:Pro:   Great writing (plot, character dialog, scene description, lore), awesome artwork and music, long playtime. Weirdly gratifying combat, challenging gameplay*. Lots of classes, specs, and gear to choose from, huge number of viable playstyles.Con:   Micromanagement can be hard if you aren't used to it, and combat overwhelming* (controlling six characters at once is hard until you master the ""pause"" function). Player may have to choose between more immersive roleplay (voice-acted, scripted NPC companions) and a better chance in combat (character-made, optional companions). *Higher difficulties are only for veterans of squad-combat games. Don't be a hero, start on Normal if you aren't sure. The Long:Extremely well-executed fantasy squad-combat game. Game has something for everybody; if your like exploration, the map is sprawling. If you like character development, the game's core companions have some of the backgrounds and personalities I've found in gaming, and their dialog is greatly altered and nuanced by the player's background and actions. If you're into the RP part of RPGs, your experience will be greatly improved by the running NPC commentary on your exploits, and the game's wrting is so good it could've been moderately successful as a text-based game or novella.  The gameplay itself is intuitive and satisfying, though there are some mechanics players might not be used to. Experience can't be grinded, for example, because the game gives exp rewards by the quest/encounter, not by the body count. In other words, if confronted by highwaymen, the player can get experience from killing them all, yes, but also from talking them down. Hunting down random bandits in the woods, however, nets no experience unless they were part of a quest or encounter. This system is great for players who might be interested in more diplomatic or pacifistic characters.   If you've played Wasteland II (which was developed with the help of Obsidian, who made Pillars of Eternity), you're somewhat familiar with the gameplay of Pillars of Eternity (they both use the Unity Engine). There are a lot of gameplay differences, since one's setting is post-apocalyptic and the other's is Tolkienic fantasy, but the feel is roughly the same, although Pillars seems much more fleshed-out in terms of story, writing, and artwork. Don't expect Wasteland II when you buy this game, though. There are key differences in party and combat mechanics that might change the game for you.  Mainly, Wasteland focused on four main, player-designed characters and a few NPC companions you could invite to tag along. Personally, I really just used my main 4 characters, so mine was a manageable party. Pillars of Eternity begins with one player character and up to five companions that the player will rapidly accumulate, to the point where several of these masterfully-written, convincing, and engaging companions will have to sit out because there's no more room for them in the party. It's hard to choose which NPCs you want, and you can choose to have none, if you're suicidal.   (The player can also buy (with the game's currency, relax) custom-made companions, created in the same way the main character was, with all the same options. These companions have no conversation options or anything, so they're not for the roleplayer.)  So, Wasteland could support 7 characters and Pillars supports 6, but Pillars of Eternity's combat is much, much more difficult than Wasteland's, and that's due in no small part to the learning curve of playing 6 characters at once. Wasteland didn't have this problem because of the one massive difference between these two games: Pillars of Eternity is not turn-based.  Because Pillars isn't turn-based, there's a ""pause"" feature that lets the player stop combat and issue commands (common feature in squad-combat games, notably Dragon Age). The level of micromanagement demanded from the higher difficulties is not to be underestimated. You will have to make sure your party members are actually attacking, instead of staring into space. You will have to manually click each of your part members, then click the skills or spells you want them to use, every time you want them to use them (you can queue actions with SHIFT, as in Starcraft, which helps a little). You'll worry often whether your healer will have time to cast his big heal before he gets knocked flat by a huge wolf, and there's no real way to know the timing without just unpausing and letting it happen.  Also, equipping your characters, individually, with up-to-date gear, enchanted and selected to suit their role, will take up time. Be prepared for micromanagement.  Micromanagement in all things. Especially combat.  You will have to find ways to block enemies from reaching your squishier party members, and you will have to find these formations on the fly, in every conceivable type of terrain, against enemies that can surprise you by, say, teleporting behind your healer, who you left too far away to be saved by your tank.   You will have to use weapons appropriate for the enemy's resistances, alternating between slashing, crushing, and piercing (and the elemental damage types, of course). This means keeping different weapon sets equipped (in combat, you can only change weapons if you equipped alternate weapons in the dedicated slots for them beforehand), and being prepared to command your characters to switch weapons on the fly. Thus, you might have to pick out multiple weapons for each character, and keep each set updated.   Armor is a gradient between Damage Reduction and action speed. Heavy armor makes everything slower, from melee attacks to spellcasting to potion-drinking.   You'll have to fight groups of small enemies several times more numerous than your party, and you will have to figure out what to do with your single-target attackers in these cases. You'll have to decide whether it's worth going for the enemy's healer, and you'll have to load when you choose wrongly. You'll have to change your party's armor sets regularly depending on the encounter.Don't let this dissuade you. The game is hard, but that only makes it so much more satisfying when you flawlessly dismantle a squad of high-level enemies despite having weaker and fewer characters. It's also incredibly gratifying to mow down mobs with hopelessly lower stats than yours, fair fight or no. It's always worth it when you get the loot. "

												Pillars of Eternity is riddled with irksome flaws from dodgy AI pathing that should have stayed in the '90s to a story which sometimes offers only an illusion of choice.Not one of these flaws undermine what is the deepest, most personal adventure to grace the genre in many years. Obsidian's writing is on form; the combat's vast array of strategic options deeply satisfying. Whether you're a life-long Infinity fan or you've never so much as seen a cRPG, Pillars is a quest which everyone should attempt. Here's to many more.Full nostalgia-free review (link contains mild non-story spoilers):

												Even if I didn't know it at the time I bought it, PoE was the kind of game I was yearning  for some time. Perhaps I'm getting old but been feeling over the last few years that games are less and less immersive, more shallow and mechanical even if more impressive technically with a few honorable exceptions. From the first moment I launched the game, I felt something special just by hearing the easily recognizable music of the start screen and menu. PoE as you probably know, is a retro styled game inspired by games such as Icewind Dale or Baldur's Gate and so, its' gameplay, interface and overall feeling is unapologetically cloned from those games.I'm usually not much of a fan of retro styled games but PoE is certainly different. The graphics are very classic but high resolution isometric 2D scenarios with 3D rendered characters. The scenarios range from beautiful to nice and some of the dungeons are incredible while others are a bit bland. A thing that usually bothers me in classic games is the generic look of everything and every piece of equipment. Such is not the case with PoE where unique items certainly look unique and special.The combat is actually quite nice. The combat is real time and pausable. While pausing, you must micromanage your party to certain actions and develop strategies. Don't mistake yourself, this game is hard but it is playable by anyone willing to think rather than aimlessly click for spells or attacks. There are other games much better for that.The companions are very interesting and I certainly loose my time reading through their dialogues but I don't care much for the souls of random NPCs written by the backers of the game. In fact, in game memorials to the backers sometimes break the immersion a lot since you read their nicknames or real names that simply don't fit the game universe. I wish they've done this homages differently. Most of the bigger side quests are very interesting and allow you to explore the world freely. There are endless items, spells and abilities which can be a bit overwhelming if you are OCD about optimizing your combat and stats, but it's fine if you play casually. I only stop to refine my characters when I feel difficulties in game. With the exception of some bounties and dragons, the combat is challenging but quite playable, dragons and some bounties can become really tough fights and require a lot of patience, thought and Google. I enjoy most of the dialogues and many of them are voiced but I feel that sometimes they extend a bit beyond reasonable depending on the subject. Certain mundane topics simply don't deserve so much text and feel snobbish and pretentious at some point but after a while you easily predict such cases and simply skim through them with no problem.For me, the worst feature of this game is the main quest. Despite some very interesting characters or moments from time to time, I simply find it boring to death more than I would like and it would be impossible to keep me in this game if the world itself and the other quests weren't so addictive. But I feel that the introduction of the world of Eora perhaps guided the tone and feeling of the main quest. I expect a much better main quest in PoE2. I think the main quests in both the expansion packs are much better. To give you a hint of what kind of story I enjoy, for me, good main quests were the ones of Elder Scrolls: Morrowind and Skyrim. On the other hand, I simply couldn't stand the Oblivion main quest and almost lost interest in the TES series.As negative aspects I must also point the loading screens which are a drag if you have a regular hard drive and the interface in this kind of games usually takes a while getting used to if you don't have the patience and of course, the ocasional bugs.I strongly recommend this game with both expansion packs. If you have the patience and time, buy the extras since it includes a lot of stuff you can read if you enjoy that. If you are not a reader, unless you are really eager to obtain a few wallpapers, soundtrack and such, don't waste your money.			"

												My fiance bought me this game based on the hype from streamers. He also knew that I loved the Baldur's Gate games and Pillars of Eternity was being hailed as a spiritual successor. I bought in the hype myself, and was very excited to play it.I'll overlook the glaring bugs that I encountered initially (having to do with Unity's network management [including Hamachi and wired ethernet adapters], which isn't even used for the game) because those don't have anything to do with the story, writing, shoddy combat system, or massive class imbalances.I started with a rogue, which I quickly learned was a mistake. Any character can use rogue skills like stealth and lockpicking, and the backstab bonuses are negligible. The game's monsters ranged from easy one-shot skills to groups of Shadows that will ignore your warrior and pick off your party by swarming the weakest character first.I don't have any problem with this type of mob, but when they occur within the first hour or so of the game without any learning curve, it's a bit imbalanced. I really wonder if people who aren't used to CPRGs even enjoy it.The writing is cumbersome and extremely difficult to suffer through. There's just too much of it. Which wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't mediocre to start with. That's nothing new in games, but the writing borders on shakespearean levels of twisted, confusing wording without any of the art or cleverness. I find myself either re-reading passages to figure out exactly why they're over-describing some scene or I just read a few words and skim through.This game is not unplayably difficult but the combat is extremely imbalanced and random. It just saps out the fun.This is just not a good game. And it's frustrating that since this is a Kickstarter-backed game, there is nothing but insane hype and blind support. People who gave money to the development of this game will support it unconditionally. Even when I seek help for some difficult parts, forums are filled with ""maybe you shouldn't suck so much"" instead of acknowledgements that *MAYBE* Oblivion's custom combat mechanics are s***.If you're thinking about buying this game, read the negative reviews first. Be prepared for what's wrong with it so there aren't any nasty surprises.			"

To begin with: Pillars of Eternity is a great game and worth every cent! The music and graphics will make every Baldur's Gate fan feel at home right away. It feels and appears to be a worthy disciple of the classic RPGs (Baldur's Gate, Nox, D&D, Icewind Dale, ...).However, there are some nasty ""buts"" which spoil the pleasure of playing.For example the loadingsscreens appear to last for ever after some hours of gaming. Especially the first load of every session takes sometimes several minutes (It's not my system!) Also the leveling is kind of expendable, because except of the athletic skill for every character, and the mechanics and lore skill for one of your character you can't really increase useful skills. Why raise survival if you never really have to eat something?Furthermore a level cap of 12 is kind of low and you need forever to get there (isn't ascending levels step by step the essence of RPG?).Another big nasty ""BUT"" for me is, that you can't see boots, belts and gloves on you character and that unenchanted helmets do not protect your character against weapons...Yeah there's no difference between wearing no helmet and a big, heavy steal helmet!All in all, a great game, but the Pillars of eternity have some cracks and won't last for the promised eternity...Update: Big plus, great story and many, many side-quest!Update: Maaaaaaan, there are really a whole lot of side-quests...nearly too much! :-D Only thing bothering after some time: too much reading --> some of the main quest story lines should be narrated via videos or drawings...P.S.: The loading screens are shorter now, maybe the the patch 1.05 solved the problem!!And another update: The pathfinding of all characters is sometimes very crappy.And my last Update:Really?! okay, so I'm Level 12 (Last Level) and playing on hard. I killed every enemy without any problems and was kind of overpowering everyone. This was a bit lame... So the end fight against Thaos came. I thought: ""Okay this will be challenging..."" But he and his living statues were totally invincible!! I tried for hours until I caved in and played the fight on easy... A very ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating end: at first easy and lame, then unfair and infuriating...Pity!And really my last Update:So I heard that many of the cons of this game have now been fixed!! That's great, but for me there is this bitter aftertaste: Why not fix all the little bugs and glitches and especially big mistakes in gameplay BEFORE releasing a game?!!?  I feel kind of ripped of, when a buy a game for 20 €, it's NOT EARLY ACCESS, play it for 80 hours + and then little by little everything that bugged me is fixed over the 	period of nearly one year.Right now there is version 2.XXX out --> I think that says it all!!I would have wanted the unalloyed joy of playing it in this condition right away. Or at least a warning that it's early access!Okay, it wasn't my last Update:Sooo, there Update 3.03 out now...I mean, it's great that they are stil working on this game, but...3.03 ..................Really?!It's so absurd, that I'm almost tempted to play it again just to see what's different and if it's 3.03 times better^^			"

												Save/Load simulator 2015 is here!Pros:-It's like getting punched in the nostalgia-berries right from the outset.-You very well might take six hours to create a character.-Being a villainous scumbag is well written for once.-Environmentally conscious - Journals and other aides keep the use of real-world paper to a minimum.-You will see fancy places and enjoy the ambient sounds that accompany them.-Grimoires.-Inutaak, arctic fox and the true hero of this adventure.Neutrals:-Combat is decent, except when you get hosed. SAVE SAVE SAVE.-I hope you like reading. Cons:-Some characters are unable to wear hats.-Certain classes will get knocked out when dealing with stiff breezes, small bunnies, or spicy cuisine.			"

												First of all I have to say I'm a huge fan of computer role playing games, some of my favorite ones being Planescape Torment, Baldur's Gate series, Icewind dale series, Arcanum and Fallout 1 and 2 which I've re-played a number of time over the years. I'm also a pen and paper player of D&D. I have been waiting for years and years for a true successor to Baldur's Gate to come, and sadly, I've fell to the hype and foolishly believed this is finally it. In few short points I will try to describe why I'm disappointed with this game. - It was widely advertised as a spiritual successor to Baldur's gate series so I was naturally expecting an epic storyline similar to a ""child of Lord of Murder"" and addictive combat mechanics similar to AD&D ruleset. Both are missing from this game. Obsidian tried to invent their own ruleset which just doesn't work as well and in the end makes every class too similar to each other. I rolled a rogue and was surprised to see my only rogue skill was mechanics, which every other character in the game could also level up, so why have the rogue class at all? There's no hide is shadows skill, only hide in shadows combat ability which can be used only 2 times per rest (which are very limited in this game), so in the end I outfitted him in plate and went full melee ignoring my rogue skills completely. Even though there's perception attribute, you have to use stealth mode to actually find hidden caches and since there's a lot of hidden items in the areas you visit, you'll be stealthy (and thus slow) almost all the time. No wonder this game brags with 100 hours of gameplay. Every class or race can use every item in the game, the only penalty being the reaction time (speed) of the character influencing casting or weapon attack time. Everyone can also use scrolls, all potions, etc.Spellcasting is also very bad and limited in this game, as almost every spell is combat only, meaning there are no pre-battle buffs, and taking into account that many useful spells are area of effect, and that there is friendly fire - nothing bad with that per se, but since your spellcaster has to get real close to cast them, it's virtually impossible to use them effectively.  There's no traditional spellbook but a grimoire which can hold infinite amount of spells but only 4 per level can be selected for use at a time, and then again you have a limited per rest usage of them. And since they are combat only, expect generic boring spells, different by damage type only (fire, ice, poison, etc.). Transcribing the spell from another caster's grimoire costs money, depending of the level of the spell. Why? I guess the grimoire you carry has a slot that says ""insert coin here"" or something. There are no actual materials used in the process, so... A lot of these immersion breaking and irritating little things in the game.There's also a infinite shared item stash which is carried by you all the time, there's no encumbrance, so strength makes no impact on how much you can wear or carry, you get the picture. - The story. It started interesting but very quickly went to ""visit this guy, oh he's dead, visit that guy, oh's he's dead also - let's visit another guy and hope he gives us some answers"". I'm 25 hours in the game and don't know crap about what's going on except I'm some kind of Watcher that can see the person's soul. There's a skill you get early on which let's you reach into someone's soul and read about that person's past life. There's a ton of those people around and it's not interactive in any way or integrated into a story, just walls and walls of texts. I started fearing visiting new locations because of it, just how much pointless stories I will have to read in this tavern? In the end I beat my OCD and just skipped those. The game just bombards you with lore, names and history from the get go, even on the character creation screen. It's very hard to process all that information, the names are not memorable, and I'm not even familiar yet with the layout of the world, so dumping all that information all of the sudden can be overwhelming. Races, provinces, wars, deities, cities, islands... OK, OK... let me care about something at least a bit before you hit me with info over the head. I had like 50 books on me in the first 5 hours of the game. - Crafting and lootThere's crafting in the game and it's available to every character, you do it from your inventory screen. Some items can be enhanced, some can not. You can put some properties on your gear and increase it's damage potential or defense. It' very generic and uninspired and I guess it's there only to serve as a money sink. In 25 hours playing or normal (which people say it's hard compared to similar games), I haven't used one consumable or a scroll. I don't see a situation where I'm spending thousands of coins to make a single scroll.Loot is also very generic, there are some named items in the game, but nothing special, nothing that lets you feel really powerful. In the end you can make your own stuff by crafting, I had everyone dual wield flaming weapons, which I made myself. If there's no good and interesting loot, there's NO REASON to explore. take into consideration there's also no XP from killing stuff, and you lose interest in exploration completely. Skyrim and Dragon Age Origins made the same mistake. RPG's are all about risk and reward. You risk your party to overcome an obstacle to get riches, items, artifacts, experience and with it new skills that again make you feel more powerful. The game should ideally throw increasingly difficult obstacles onto you, and in return giving you nicer things, it's a very simple process, really. Makes you feel satisfied. Do I feel satisfied with PoE when after a fight I find just same old vendor trash I found 20 hours before? No, I don't. I did not feel compelled to explore in PoE, at all. You literally explore the whole map, and find nothing except for a few crafting herbs. - QuestsNothing special or original, at all. Fetch quests. A guy in the woods I've never seen before asks me to overthrow a local noble. I accept and go to the keep of that lord, only to be attacked on sight. Why? Is that standard practice to attack everyone who comes to the door? I guess the interactivity lies in the 3 different entrances into the keep (main gate, sewer, over the wall). OK, so I kill them all, the crazy lord included and the first guy reappears and just takes the throne and keep over. That's it. No more conversation with the guy. NPC 1 changed by NPC 2. I actually still enjoyed that part of the game, the art of the keep was very nice but was surprised how shallow the writing was. Is that really the best what you could do with that story? Perhaps it get's better later on, but in 25h I've yet to see a memorable NPC or an enemy who has something interesting to say. Think of first level of BG2, I'm sure you remember the genie you encounter. That genie has a lot more personality than any NPC I've seen in this game so far. Final thoughts:The Pillars of Eternity is not a terrible game, it's OK, I guess. In fact, I liked it considerably more that the Wasteland 2. What PoE is missing is addictive gameplay, and better writing. I wish they bought the D&D license and went with Forgotten Realms setting and ruleset. This way it feels more like Drakensang: The Dark Eye than Baldur's Gate. A missed opportunity. When my honeymoon period with the game ended, about at 15h, I had to force myself to start the game again, and that's not a good sign. You know that feeling when you can't put your finger on a specific thing that's wrong but you feel it just isn't it. I'm not sure I will finish it at all, in fact it reminded me how Arcanum was great and I got a craving for that game, over this one. Don't believe the hype, it's not the best thing ever and can't measure up to 15+ yo games. Buy it, but only when heavily discounted.			"

												Like many decisions I made at 17, I had no idea the impact that installing Baldur'sGate would have on my life.  Fast forward to a man in his 30s returning to that special, hopelessly immersed, ""yes I know what time it is!"", place with the absolute gem that is Pillars of Eternity. The game is not so much a return to old glory, as much as it is old glory catching up to those of us who thought it past and gone.  The plot is VERY dark, gritty, and grown up.  There are volumes worth of lore, history, and politics written in detail, yours for the reading, which flesh out the setting and pivotal time in which you enter the story. The world is beautifully drawn.  The character and combat system, while not D&D rules and conventions, feels more like an evolutionary step forward for D&D e.g. Do you like your wizard to fire the same old magic missiles all of the time? Fine.  But after that I want him to pull out his pistol and shoot a filthy iron theif in the face! Can do.Faerun? Never heard of her.10/10Would wait 15 years again.			"

												This is what I craved for since Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series.I expected more than 38 hours of gameplay and more locations but even I consider it too short it was beautiful.Nice story with some original elements, lots of side quests, but characters personal quests seems underdeveloped. I wanted more story for some of them, like Pallegina or Grieving Mother. Some backgrounds are impressive but not all of them. Voice acting is good, music is enjoyable.Anyway, if you really want to get the story you will have to read and imagine for yourself a lot.Entire scenes are only in text, so if you lack imagination or you really hate reading don't try it, as there is no animations and no sounds for lots of scenes (like souls memories). Also not all dialogues are spoken.Crafting is so-so but Enchanting is really nice - why waiting to loot a good weapon or armor when you can make one yourself?I am an old gamer and I know to appreciate a good game, so I give it 9,5/10. Might seem outdated for some people but for me is a returning to CRPG roots and Obsidian knew how to made this enjoyable. Sorry for my poor English.			"

												I wanted to like POE and I played it through to the end but there are just too many issues. First of all there is WAY too much dialogue and lore to sift through. Instead of adding to the immersion it really becomes a chore. I can't imagine doing another play through primarily for this reason. With the exception of the Roderic's Hold quest the game is relatively linear and there are few choices you can make that materially effect the world. The castle upgrades seem tacked on and pointless. The skill system is very basic and doesn't allow for much specialization. Characters will often end up with similar stats and the only ones that seem to really matter are lore, lockpick and traps. They've updated some basic party AI for this game but it is woefully insufficient. Programmable AI was a feature in IE games 15 years ago. So there really is no excuse for the lack of its inclusion originally.As it is the system they have doesn't work effectively on the higher dificulty levels. Be prepared to click hundreds of times in a tough battle rather than have your party follow a simple script. There is SO much combat in this game it really does become a grind and I don't understand why people defend the massive amount of micromangement it requires. The load times in POE simply take way too long. I have an average system but I've heard that even players with good rigs still suffer from bad load times. This shouldn't be an issue for a 2D game running an old engine. The plot is meh and the characters aren't particularly memorable. This game is a dungeon crawler first and foremost and more like Icewind Dale than BG1 or 2. The party AI and dialogue just kill it for me but if you're a fan of this genre it might be worth a play through if it's on sale. RPG masterpiece it certainly is not.			"

												Incredible game, EPIC plot in a fantastic world, and characters I will miss for a long time. Just the right balance of mystery,  philosophy, humour, grit, dark fantasy, choice-'n'-consequence, and awe-inspiring regions and architectures. Highly recommended for the world and the story alone. The tactical combat is just my style, but I'm aware it's a bit of a love/hate system for some people. I find that it works great, personally.Though for honesty's sake, I will list some of the negatives you could expect of the game:Has a few issues around pacing, you can feel a bit bogged down in Act II, but persevere because it is totally worth it. Combat , even just on Normal mode, can be punishing and tough to get used to (especially if you're used to RPGs where *you* *alone* are the hero and doing everything, not calling the shots for a group of six), but - like Dark Souls - once it clicks, it *clicks*, and you'll be running through on Hard with few problems.Assuming you don't go with any of the game mechanic limiters (limited access to stash, etc), there's nothing really stopping you from spamming ""Loot All"" at everything and end up sitting on a money empire that even a Doemenel would envy. But this is a minor issue, at worst. If you don't like it, all the tools are there in the options menu.Still a few rare combat bugs, I know I nabbed a Blunderbuss that would blind most of my frontline when it fired.But no, seriously, give this game a whirl. One of the best RPGs on the market, in my books.			"

												Huge disappointment (I helped to kickstart it, so no - I am not a guy who expected Diablo 4). The world is utterly boring and unimaginative (a copy of medieval Europe... without any twist), companions vary from good (Durance) through OK (Grieving Mother, Eder) to absolute rubbish (the rest... extra terrible is that dwarf who's totally not an inuit and who dumps walls of texts about seal hunting and other ""fascinating"" stuff). I found out later that Carrie Patel was narrative lead - which explains a lot, I actually bought one of her books (I was really hyped for this game) and couldn't get past first 100 pages which is a rare thing for me.There's a ton of useless NPCs with some stories provided by backers (usually bad ones) - and although you can avoid them, they clutter cities and pubs and the whole idea of having them is completely silly. Other characters talk a lot but have nothing to say. I am a guy who enjoys ""games you can read through"", but I expect some decent level of writing, not just an outlet for some untalented nerd's graphomania. And don't make me start on game mechanics. All stats are dump stats, only your level matters. Crafting and enchanting feels like... crafted... 2 hours before release. Main antagoinst has charisma of shredded carrot. I actually couldn't even care about the story or what was going on, it was so boring. Actually, the game felt like Diablo 4 at times, since I was going through million instances of the same encounter where all I had to do was click on enemies in proper order, while getting annoyed with the engagement feature (good idea, bad implementation) - zero challenge, even on hard difficulty (except for that final fight under Caed Nua, for which you need level 12).But yeah, graphics is great... That's why we play games, right?			"

												5/10  - That's being generous.Baldur's Gate this certainly isn'tPros -1 - Graphically it's adequate. A step up from the games it claims to be emulating but certainly nothing to get all hot and bothered about. After 15 years, this type of game should look better than BG and BG2. Why people are going mad about this is as if its a new innovation, is beyond me.2 - I'm struggling to think of a 2.Cons - 1 - Character generation. Too many crap classes so that you either go for the old faithful fighter (dull, very dull) or a cipher (gets dull real quick). It all comes down to random dice rolls anyway, so it doesn't really matter what points you put where. 2 - As a game, either you're going to be new or old. If you're going to have new races, don't have elves or dwarves. Either forge your own identity, or don't. This just feels like a lazy attempt to pretend POE is somehow a new experience wrapped in a nostalgic bubble. By either description, it falls way short.3 - Wow the items are dull. Looting your local grocery store would result in more interesting items than you'll generally find at the end of a dungeon in this game. You'll grind your way through generic mob after generic mob, just to find a chest full of crap. So then, you're left with crafting, which while available, feels half hearted and ill thought out. They added crafting as a tick box exercise, rather than make the effort to make it rewarding. 4 - Combat. Okay.....open You Tube and find the Benny Hill theme. Then start a combat. Play the theme as your enemies target your spell caster. Watch the spell caster flee around the screen, followed by the enemy, followed by your tank hopelessly trying to reacquire the enemy.5- Combat. It's so bad it deserves more mentions. Combat will go like this. Fire off the spell you always fire off. Switch to your standard attack. Go downstairs. Make some dinner. Ring a friend. Come back to find the party still trading boring blows with boring enemies. This is if you're lucky.6 - Combat - If you're unlucky, you'll fire off a spell and set your tank(s) fighting, only to find that your ranged attackers have bizarrely ceased to attack and are now stood around doing nothing. That or they've been killed by the super teleporting shadow monsters that appear on top of them. In this case, you have the choice to either try and run, dying immediately due to the absurd game mechanics, or stand and die anyway. Your spells are mostly useless, so you'll be presented with a big list of crap to choose from each time you level, rather than spells that feel useful. In 30 hours, I have never found an item with any kind of wow factor. Nothing that I equipped gave me any sense that the effort of slogging my way through the generic, uninspiring dungeon was actually worth it.7 - The NPCs. Talking to strangers at the bus stop is more rewarding than engaging these generic, dull characters in conversation. They have as much life when they've been killed as they do alive. They have no reason to follow you and nothing much to say when they do. Baldur's Gate etc are old games now, but they managed to produce real characters. Fifteen years later and POE has undone this. I didn't care if they lived. I didn't care if they died. In an RPG of this price in 2015, that's just not good enough. I didn't expect Mass Effect character development, but I certainly hoped for more than walking cliches, that largely dissolved into taciturn automatons after their initial, uninvolving dialogue. 8 - The Lore/World - Lots of lore can be a good thing. It's been done well in other games. It's not done well here. It's like a commitee pulled together a load of standard fantasy fiction and slung it together to create a world notable only by it's staggering blandness. Blah, blah, elves, dwarves, blah, blah, ancient ruins, blah, blah dungeons. It's all so lazy and predictable. 9 - Having to rest to somehow regain your ability to use magic is a mechanic that was crap fifteen years ago. It belongs in table top roleplaying gaming, and that is the type of player attracted to POE. They want to play D&D again, but no one does anymore, so they wax lyrical about POE instead. That kind of limiting, tedious mechanic doesn't appear in computer RPGs anymore for a reason. Unless you're an old school roleplaying gamer, with the accompanying problems with OCD, this kind of mechanic has no place in computer RPGs.10 - Price - If you loved BG and BG2, then maybe you'll like this. I didn't, but you might. Wait for a sale though. To price this in a similar band to Witcher 3 or DAI is ridiculous. What you're getting is a  facsimile of games that are 15 years old. There's nothing new here and certainly not one iota of innovation. I would argue that POE is in fact a huge step back from the old games it seeks to emulate. Don't pay full price for this. It's not worth it when you can pay a fraction of the price and pick up the original and vastly superior genre games from the early 2000s, like Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights.Conclusion- For the price, this just isn't good enough. POE is bogged down by a bland world, uninvolving characters and a dull, bugged combat system. I spent hour after hour hoping it would get better. That somehow the world would come to life. It never did. For 5.99 this game would be okay. For 34.99, it's a been one huge and, frankly unacceptable disappointment. It piggy backs on the reputation of much older and far superior games, without ever matching their achievements. Baldur's Gate will be remembered in another fifteen years. Barring bargain basement sales, POE will have been forgotten in fifteen months.			"

												It is a very good return to RPG but unfortunately it's plagued by technical issues.what I liked: + Your character has a personality that builds up during dialogues, and there seems to be a lot of triggers for different reputations in most unexpected discussions, it's wonderful. + Your companions often have some comments to discussion you're having. + Pretty big world with a lot of memorable people, even if they only give you one tiny taskwhat I disliked - The stories are far too predictable, and attempts at jokes somehow produce a cringe instead - too hollywood style, the bad kind of it. - Monstrously long loading screens for every door, even if it's just a cupboard of an ""inside"" where your party barely fits with a chest that has negligible coin. - Weak loot. Finding a non-trash item is winning a lottery, let alone something actually useful for your style. And they're unique, which is heavily impacted by the below: - a game-breaking bug that seems to go unfixed for over a year. Your party configuration gets stuck and if you don't have an earlier save - ... You can unscrew it somewhat with a lot of fiddling, but all gear on some of the characters vanishes. Unique pieces that you won't ever have again and nothing can replace them.All in all, I've been having fun with it, by finding other stuff to do during loading screens. Until I got that bug. Which made losing these 44 hours painful enough to give it a negative. It's far too long to have several playthroughs.			"

												A true homage to the infinity engine games. Probably my favorite game of the CRPG kickstarter revival so far.A good story, although sometimes too wrapped up in its own lore for its own good. There are times when the NPCs will be using words that aren't defined, and you sort of have to use context clues to figure it out. There's also a lot of talk of different gods, regions, etc, and with no prior knowledge of the setting it can be a bit overwhelming. Still, the story was good and the world created was interesting.Mechanically, the game is basically a modernization of the old infinity engine games. The interface looks the same, the combat works the same, and it's all pretty great. My only complaint might be that the underlying game system is basically just a rip of D&D (which is to be expected), but to the point where you might wonder why they bothered to differenciate in terms between the systems. Might vs strength, deflection vs armor, etc. I encounted a couple of bugs, but nothing too serious. I had to use a third party program to fix a characters run speed at some point, but i'm sure that will be fixed in a patch.The kickstarter stuff is, thankfully, easily avoided. If you want to dive into it you're welcome to, but it's easy to know what to avoid if you don't care.Overall, a great game. I highly recommend it.			"

												Obsidian delivered again.All their known qualities (world building, deep lore, profound story and characters) are present in this game. Combat system and exploration are also great. There are some cons here and there such as little unique loot, short companion quests and medium combat difficulty (at least on normal) but the potential is there for future installments to tap into it.Most of rpgs in recent years are just a footnote to its magnificence. Pillars of Eternity is a classic of our times, prepare to be enthralled by it.			"

												As a huge fan of the old Infinite Engine games like Baldur's Gate I had hoped for so much *more* from this game. Whilst it did much to modernise the genre, in many areas it failed to live up to the nostalgia.Graphics - The game kept true to the art style whilst bringing it forwards into the modern era of gaming, the backdrops were breathtakingly beautiful and it played smoothly without any issues.Sound/Voice Acting - The sound/voice acting wasn't particularly noteworthy, it wasn't terrible yet it wasnt great either, it didn't really stand out much.Story-telling/narrative - The story was a bit vague and didn't really have much direction during the first act but it quickly picked up during the second act before slowly tapering off towards the end. There weren't any really exciting revelations or twists that made it wow me. The villain, their motivations and relationship to the protagonist were somewhat interesting but it wasn't anything that stood out. Often at times to convey just how filled out the world and backstory was you're presented with a wall of text which probably wasn't necessary and felt like it detracted from the story at times.Gameplay Mechanics/Combat - This is probably the most disappointing aspect of the game. The game feels like it's more of a stealth crpg because they limited the experience gained from combat to just the first few initial run ins with each foe type and kept the overall experience gained from combat to a very minimal amount, along with the plethora of items that dropped from enemies being utterly useless, it often felt like the better choice was to sneak/avoid enemy encounters which just slows down the pace of the game. Avoiding combat entirely was also made more desirable by the fact that you were heavily penalised for trying to escape combat or run around or disengage with an enemy during combat which often resulted in the character dying quicker than had you just stayed in place and tried to (but likely fail to do so anyway) tank it. Spell casting also felt more burdensome and tiring than in the older IE titles because of the resting mechanics of the game whereby you had to carry supplies to rest and were limited to only carry a certain amount of supplies with you, so if you ran out of supplies you were forced to return to a store to purchase more or not rest and not be able to heal, or restore spells for combat.Itemisation - The difference between a normal, un-enchanted item and a unique item felt lacking. The difference in damage was minimal, I played as a barbarian and would do 80s with normal items and as high as 96 using a unique item of the same type. Another problem with the itemisation is that so many items gave boosts to player stats, but conflicting stat boosts (ie. gloves that give +1 might and boots that give +2 might) would be nullified meant that gearing most slots felt like a waste of time and forced players down the route of jack of all trades, master of none.Overall I would rate this game as a 6/10, or in terms of similarities to the old IE games it has the combat of Planescape Torment with the story of Icewind Dale, it tries to relive the nostalgia but focuses on the wrong aspects of what made them great games.

												Still a bit early but I'm making a review regardless. I backed this game for $160, that was not a poor decision, because so far PoE is really fun.I'm not a big fan of the old D&D WRPGs, personally I think they're convoluted messes and I only really played through Planescape because the writing, atmosphere, and roleplaying made up for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat, and they really, really did, Planescape is one of my favorite games. I backed PoE because Obsidian are pretty much head and shoulders above almost every other dev team when it comes to writing, atmosphere, and actual roleplaying and I always want to see more games from them. (I’m also happy to have saved Obsidian from bankruptcy too) PoE being a spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate, still feels a tad bit grognardy to me compared to something like Shadownrun’s more streamlined and accessible combat but I'm getting the hang of it and having fun with it and the game does a good game explaning itself for the most part such as telling you exactly what stats you should be dumping into for each class you roll. It still does has a few dumb grognardy mechanics that it doesn't explain very well though, they're not dealbreakers but they can be annoying at times, such as seprate equipment not being able to buff  the same stats and no way to aggro enemies. Playing on Easy helps, but I still can’t play too stupidly so it’s not braindead easy. If you want a challenge though this game is very happy to oblige. The three reasons I backed this game for are all definitely here. The game can get pretty expostiony with its world building but its interesting worldbuilding so it’s cool. As said still too early to make a true final verdict but if this game keeps it up it will be a really good game and a must play for all the old D&D RPG and normal RPG fans alike.			"

												I really wish I didn't buy this game. There are so many awful design choices (or oversights) that ruin the experience. The gameplay basically boils down to having your tank in the front and having as little melee as possible. It's so immersion breaking that, in order to make your crew more effective, you don't use armor to make sure they refresh faster. There are tons of cheap fights where enemies spawn on top of you (spectres) or you enter a room and you engage in a fight right off the bat and your guys are in a terrible formation and just get slaughtered.I was doing fine for awhile until I couldn't beat certain fights and then I learned that simply having all your characters use ranged weapons (preferably guns) without wearing armor is the best way to go. It totally killed the game knowing that's how you roll through this game.			"

												Best 120 hours of gaming I have spent. Quality from start till finish, and throughout every single side-step in between. Pillars of Eternity is extremely well written. The stories are told in very rich language that is way above average even in fantasy literature. The game is one grand adventure and feels like reading/watching an epic and long story where it's up to you when and where the main characters will go and what course of action they will take. To fully appreciate this game you need to read  a lot of in-game texts, like books, dialogues with other characters, descriptions and all the information that shows up in your journal. And this is a very welcome gameplay element for me. Not only is it a pleasure to read due to how well written it is, it also fosters your own imagination. I love everything about this game: the combat, the stories, the main story, the lore. But most of all I love it because it's a properly executed awesome and epic long adventure that I never wanted to end.			"

												I've played only a very small amount of the original Baldur's Gate, so my nostalgia for the Infinity engine games is pretty much nonexistant. However, I still find myself absolutely captivated by this game. The visuals, tone, lore and characters are top-tier in terms of modern RPGs. If you enjoy reading huge walls of very well written fantasy text, this game is for you. Also, your choices matter! The combat is satisfying, though 90% of encounters so far basically boil down to:Send in the tank dudes, while my main character wizard dude nukes everyone from the back. There are occasions where teleporting enemies will disrupt this tactic, but even so it's satisfying every time your party is victorious. I'm about 10 hours into my new playthrough after I stopped playing last year, but I'm determined to see this adventure through. Would recommend for anyone wanting a decent long RPG to last the summer.			"

												If you like top down isometric rpg's you'll find none better...  I just picked up The White March expansion and so far so good.  Highly recommended at this sale price.  The game has provided hours of fun for me.  The one thing that annoys me is the kickstarter achievement, which makes it impossible to 100% the game if you weren't involved in the early stages of the game...not that I could or would want to invest the time trying to 100% it anyway, but it should be possible at least.

												Spiritual successor to the Baldur's Gate series, this lore-heavy tactical role-playing game will take you on lengthy but rewarding adventures.The direction is polished : detailed graphics, serious soundwork on music and environment (only regret being that main dialogues only are voiced).The gameplay allows the player to stop time and prepare the next set of actions to be performed; this is a welcome feature as combat may become confusing at times given the high number of characters on screen.The quests are long and numerous.For dedicated players.

Learning takes a bit of time, but I like the combat and gameplay.  There are like 100 options to chose from before you even start a game, like a ton of pause options, assist for colorblinds, and even big-heads lol.The dialogue is great, it even describes the man's behaviour when he's not speaking.

												It's a good game. however I must say I don't like the developers' approach on ""blance the game"" instead of making underwhelming classes more enjoyable, they kept nerfing other classes. it's all too discouraging for the players who got used to certian play styles, and made them completely unenjoyable or unplayable when an update comes. I know the developers are trying to let you enjoy all classes and skills more, but such overhaul is just bad planning.			"

												Pillars of Eternity is a well-written and strongly executed spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate II. No RPG in the last decade can hold a candle to its immersive role-playing experience or engrossing, highly believable world. This modernized take on the classic CRPG is a must-buy for any fan of the genre.But how does it measure up to it's predecessor?Below I will list a few points from the perspective of a veteran gamer who values immersion in his RPGs above all else, and will attempt to measure it against one of the greatest RPGs of all time.You must gather your party before venturing forth…Pillars is much easier to play than the Baldur's Gate trilogy, doing away with several annoyances Infinity Engine veterans won’t miss:  ++ Flawless path-finding   ++ Sexy as ♥♥♥♥  ++ Excellent UI design  ++ Level design plus “fast mode” saves a ton of time  ++ Tutorial, though heavy, is very informative  + Tooltips!  + New stash system for painless inventory management  + Flags for stat-qualifying conversation options  + Quest notifiers  + …and much more!  ++ Options to turn off most of the above if you feel it interferes with your role-playing  ++ Does all of this while retaining the feel of classic CRPGs (major nostalgia bonus)Character BuildingAt the systems level, Pillars biggest departure from classic CRPGs lies in its new attribute and skills system. To me this has been a mixed bag:  +++ Every attribute and skill has a place in conversations and scripted sequences  ++ A ton of options for each class, much more customization than classic CRPGs  ++ Updated reputation system is excellent and works as intended  ++ Very challenging early game– hallmark of the classic RPG  ++ Every attribute influences combat, no dead-weight attributes  + Skill system allows more freedom for customization  + Mastering new attributes is a fresh challenge for RPG vets  + Can build custom NPC adventurers whenever you want  - - - Classes are not nearly as unique as in classic CRPGs  - - No multi-class / dual-class, classes all have same XP chart for leveling  - - Leveling up doesn’t have the occasional power spike that was so satisfying in BG  - - No alignments! This affects companions most, more on that belowSo to sum up there is a big tradeoff here: much deeper customization at the cost of much weaker character identity / personality on each character sheet. Is this modernization worth it? Depends on the player.Modernized CombatIn general, combat in Pillars is much more enjoyable, though Baldur’s Gate still does some things better:  +++ More combat, challenging combat –closer to Icewind Dale than Baldur’s Gate  +++ Limited resting plus “per rest” and “per encounter”  system rounds out encounters!  ++ Melee engagement completes the positional party-based combat feature-set  ++ New damage-type and defense-type systems are excellently executed  + New friend/foe AoE mechanics add a bit more depth  + Modernized combat UI with AoE overlays decrease yolo-ness of spell-casting  + Item enchanting adds customization to combat style  +/- In general, more abilities and options, less impact of each individual ability  - - - Spells and abilities feel nerfed compared to classic CRPGs  - - Not as many crazy encounters as in BG.  - - Challenge is more in mastering the system than in new encounters.  - AoEs everywhere, not enough single-target spellsCharacters, Story & WritingFirst off: good effort by the new narrator, but not even close to the narrator of Baldur’s Gate!Obsidian’s writing may be its greatest strength as a studio, and I would say that several of their sequel projects exceeded the writing quality of the original (Fallout: New Vegas, KOTOR2, Mask of the Betrayer). In my opinion:  +++ Better high-level concept, deals with religion, philosophy and identity better  ++ Original world, characters, etc. are extremely fleshed out  + Main player arc is basically same story as BG, but written better  - - - BG still tells the small stories better, with more detail and broader range of outcome  - - Writing feels rushed sometimesThe companions, though, are where Pillars loses clearly to Baldur’s Gate:  - - - - - - - - - - Nothing close to a Minsc :(  - - - Less personality range of companions. Companions are not differentiated strongly  - - - Weaker classes and no alignments means companion identity and opinions are not as convincing  - - Companions rarely interact directly with other NPCs and events. When they do, feels forced.  - Less companionsAside from my extreme Minsc bias (shared by many), Pillars has significant weaknesses in its systems-level representation of characters, and therefore clearly falls short of Baldur’s Gate in storytelling.Content Design & Parameter DesignThe obvious complaint here is that Baldurs Gate is bigger, takes the player to more places, and exposes the player to a wider variety of characters and factions. No comparison can be made until Obsidian is done with the Pillars franchise– which hopefully will not be anytime soon.However, in many cases, Pillars is too balanced and too accessible, leading to some significant drawbacks:  - - - In BG, you can walk into a random house and start a huge quest, not the case here  - - - Very few chances to permanently gain (or lose) stats  - - - Related to above: less consequences for decisions and therefore less interesting choices  - - - Conversation and NPC interaction in general is not as varied as in Baldur’s Gate  - - Only one stronghold type, less replayability with different classes / characters  - - In general, items feel less unique– especially when compared to Baldur’s Gate  - Curve of item acquisition is more linear, so no dramatic item-based power spikes  - Effect suppression system is healthy for game systems but disappointing for playerPillars is not Torment, and was not designed to be, but its choices above make it modern at the expense of the “anything can happen” feel of Baldur’s Gate. As a role-playing game, the balance feels more like a smooth and guided experience– cleverly giving you the trappings of choice and freedom, while remaining very accessible.The result is a game with strengths that most players will experience, but lacking in the varied details and unbalance that made Baldur’s Gate so special. I would submit that those small details: silly side-quests, ridiculously unfair interactions, huge amounts of content almost completely hidden, etc. They are the quintessence of the open-world RPG experience. And still…There have been many advances to systems design since BG2, and Pillars exploits them to its full advantage. However, in many cases it does so at the expense of immersion. In the end, Obsidian has made conscious choices to make an experience that carries the torch of classic CRPGs in a new, accessible package. As they have said, Pillars does not replace the Infinity Engine games.Pillars of Eternity is a great RPG, and the best RPG of the last decade. With updates, expansions and sequels it may become the greatest of all time.But for now, and in my humble opinion, Baldur’s Gate retains its seat as the king of CRPGs.			"

												I'll keep this short for you: If you know what TSR, Black Isle, or Interplay are, you'll either nod knowingly or have things to flame me about, by the end of this. If not, you might have some poorly informed opinion-hate for me by the end, anyway. For safety's sake, if you still defend -- say, the D&D alignment system, assume you will hate this review, and me. Oh well.BUCKLE UP AND BRANDISH YOUR D20'S!This will come as a strange response, from a player of older cRPGs, such as the Baldur's Gate series, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, and Planescape Torment, but, after playing Pillars of Eternity through to its resolution, I suddenly come to realize that the Infinity engine has not aged well.The entire game is plagued by cliches of Tabletop gaming, and does little, either to adapt them for PC gaming beyond what Baldur's Gate and its successors already did, or to turn the conventions harshly on their head, the way Planescape: Torment's story was able. Even most of the enemies are ripped remorselessly from your Saturday night campaign, and given mildly gaelic redubs; Ghouls are Guls, Vampires are Fampyrs, Banshees are Cean Gwla, but it's blatantly transparent. The variety of enemies is even drastically down, from say, Baldur's Gate II. (You've got your typical 'horrible' living dead, bad-mouthed bandits and fanatical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ zealots, some slimes, some beasties, trolls, dryads, and dragons. Yay. I probably missed something and will be narked at about it. Bring me back killing my own mortality.)Worse yet, I never felt the story came to any decent level of 'resolution', for my character--one needling plague of open-ended gameplay that eternally haunts.For perspective for current gamers who are some five paragraphs in, and have never heard of Gary Gygax--if you felt like, say--the ending to Fallout 3 was stupid (having an anticlimactic final battle, being guilted to martyr yourself needlessly to someone else's morality, or suffering a lousy ending because you weren't a completionist when it came to sidequests), you'll feel cheated by the end of PoE, even when you think you're heading toward the ending you want--simply by the system of flags and scripts that determines what disappointing exposition scene you get. (No, Fawkes. You're not denying me my destiny, now get in the '♥♥♥♥ing' GECK chamber. I have a dog to walk away with while the narrator smugly talks about War. No, I am not buying the expansion DLC!)While the end boss to PoE is wholeheartedly on the opposite end of the difficulty spectrum to Fallout 3's ending, you can bet that the outcome doesn't justify the effort.Again for perspective, Torment's boss can be killed in dialogue, but provides a massively more satisfying resolution, that resonates with the overall 'message' of the game. The big bad of this game, by contrast, utterly refutes every line you throw, regardless of stats or what you've accomplished, to the point that you may as well fast-forward to immediate combat (--and past that, just turn on cheats, mouse over him and hit the key to shut him up.) Afterward, the game gives you the ending it has mathed out that you maybe could want, if Obsidian didn't have to spread itself thin covering all the bases (and you'd best bet they had to, the title was nearly their swan song.)Even these things weren't dealbreakers, alone. What truly threw me out of the experience was simply reaching the end stretch of the game, and realizing just how little has changed from older cRPGs in the engine--in fact, in terms of gameplay, things have taken a backslide, in the sense that the descriptions for the function of many of PoE's items are vague at best, and the merits of many of the different stat tweaks and perks pale in comparison to just exploiting the shoddy AI of the Infinity engine. Many encounters I won simply by targetting a single difficult enemy and having a character run around in circles to distract it, or spamming summons and pinning the enemies in corners, while my expendable characters took their time shooting. And if I feel like I'm coming up with tricks to outsmart bits and bytes, and doing complex math before battles, rather than winning out of a sense of skill... welp... Screw math, I'll save that for making stock investments. Back to games that make me care, rather than teabagging my corpse over algebra.MY BURNING QUESTION: IS +10 WILL more valuable than HITTING THINGS FOR 1.2x more DAMAGE?! I HAVE NO IDEA.What made sense as a general guideline for pen-and-paper get togethers over chips and Mountain Dew has never worked particularly well as filler for functional gameplay, on Infinity's part. Hearing the same statistical song and dance try to dress up as something new and improved over twenty years later just makes me groan.Point in Case: Borderlands 2 has a jumbled mess of statistics handed to me to sort out, for its guns--but I can tell what 'fire rate' or 'pellet count' or 'reload speed' are, without a glossary. If I get an amazing weapon, I can tell it's amazing at a glance, and it feels like an event. I know what elements on weapons are effective against what kinds of threats, at a glance, without a monster encylopedia. More to the point, the struggles of Roland and the Crimson Raiders, and the humour of characters like Hammerlock and Claptrap, keep me going in spite of needless number crunches that the devs may as well have handled. Pillars of Eternity gets as far as 'telling' me to care, and then 'literally' sets all my efforts on fire to advance its shallow tale, within the second act.One particularly egregious example: I kill a raving mad local lord who is driving his village into extinction, and appoint his idealistic cousin as successor. By the end of my overly arduous final boss-fight, hidden numbers assigned with dealing out the game's ending montage have determined that my old foe gets up from being dead, goes even crazier, and wipes out everyone in said village before the end credits can even roll. And I have no say in it--how was I supposed to forecast that? ♥♥♥♥♥♥move, game. Imagine if Handsome Jack got away with nuking Sanctuary despite your best efforts defeating the Warrior, in Borderlands 2. How lame would that be?But since I'm not twinking out six me's with optimum gear and stats, maybe I'm not doing something right. I'll never know--I'll be playing other things. Tip for you geniuses of metagaming preparing to flame me: none of the enemies provide combat exp, and the level of encounters scales with your level. Fighting trash mobs produces equivalent results to running to the far end of the room. Have fun with your grind.In summary: Pillars of Eternity neither renews the Infinity engine's myriad wrinkles, nor does it tell a particularly fresh or engaging tale. It's not particularly horrible either--just woefully over-promising, mediocrity on all counts. It was a lukewarm reminder that old things can get a second chance to show how well they've festered, and that's all a good little twink can ask for: spoilt milk and stale cookies with a great big fat +10 to some stat I'll have to look up the applications for, on the end.There's always Torment: Tides of Numenara, coming Q4, right?

												As a long-time lover of isometric RPGs such as PS:T and BG, this game looked remarkably promising. Being a part of the kickstarter since its infancy, I followed this game for years and was very eager to play by the time it was released.The game was an overwhelming disapointment.The mechanics were not transparent, most of the spells were unoriginal and unused, magic items had absolutely no personality, NPCs were mediocre, and the plot was ham-fisted.On the plus side, it's pretty. That's about it. This is not the revival of iso fantasy RPGs many were hoping for; it's a botched attempt to pander to a dying group.			"

												This is the game I was waiting for. Controlling a huge party and micro managing all their abilities. No more online mmorpgs for me for a long time. I can make my own party and go into dungeons and battle Epic bosses to satisfy my ego, and I do not have to repeat fights because of other people's mistakes. I only have myself to blame if i make mistakes.I thought Skyrim did it for me, I thought Diablo did it for me, I thought Dragonage did it for me and it was the closest, but finally this game nailed it.If you complain about the game's graphics please leave now. It has enough graphics to keep fans of this genre interested. I do not have problems with bugs, I have no idea why people cry about them so much, I just step on them if I ever see any.Warning: This game will deprive you from sleep. Play with caution.			"

TL;DR - I wouldn't blindly recommend it.  Know what you're getting into, if it sounds like something you'd enjoy then you very likely will.  It represents a high point for this sort of game, but this sort of game feels dated... or my tastes have just changed.If you enjoyed Baldur's Gate, you'll probably enjoy this.If you never played Baldur's Gate or a similar CRPG, there's a good chance you won't find this very entertaining.The combat is interesting and well explained, if, and only if, you dig for it.  Unfortunately, while it has real-time systems, everything happens so fast that frequently pausing and unpausing is a necessity.  It doesn't feel like I can relax and just enjoy the spectacle, which is unfortunate for a game I thought I would find laid back.The story sometimes feels slow and I never really found myself feeling invested in the characters.  Often times I found myself just blowing past dialogue due to boredom and simply not caring.  That's not to say the characters don't have good backstories; nor that they don't go through some amount of development.  Simply put, it just didn't hook me.  Maybe I've grown out of this sort of story telling?It took me a ludicrous amount of time to finally beat the game.  I would get bored and take breaks for months before feeling guilty that I hadn't finished it and come back to it.			"

												I was told very good advice by a friend: Once you start the game, give it awhile because you have to acclimate to the lore and the setting. I had tried starting a character once before a while back, and the game just didn't grab me for whatever reason. However, after actually sitting down and reading some of the extra lore and taking the time to talk to all the characters, I was hooked.Mechanically, combat is complicated. But I wouldn't have it any other way. Min/maxing on the hardest difficulty is really rewarding, and finding a good balance between all your party members is worthwhile. This game really seems to pander toward the hardcore crowd, which is a good thing imo in an industry that continually tries to appeal toward the greater market.			"

From reading the forums this is a common complaint. Save your money and more importantly your time.Positives:- The graphics are good, although they are mostly for show, you can't interact with most of it.- The interface is well designed- There is lots to do in the gameNegatives- There is lots to do, but little of it is interesting, tons of boring quests. A great example of quantity over quality.- The writting is terrible, I couldn't force myself to read any more of it after wading through endless screens of it for hours.- The combat is a chaotic mess. Lots of mindless details but few interesting decisions. "

												So let me start by saying that this is A Very Good Game (tm).I was a bit pessimistic about it -- after all, how many times has Obsidian come so close to releasing a truly great game, yet failed to completely deliver (granted, often through no fault of their own). I got to play a bit of Pillars at Gamescom last summer and was left feeling pretty meh about it. In hindsight this was probably more because the limited time I had to play it wasn't enough to really properly ""get"" the game from the very beginning.The writing is very Obsidian, and the worldbuilding is deep and complex. After a few hours in, I can already see Obsidian's trademark moral choices everywhere, and they definitely appreciate the shades of grey that they always have. Some of the choices you're forced to make leave you seriously wondering if you're -actually- supporting the good/bad guys, and I think that's honestly really great. Pretty much exactly what you'd come to expect from Obsidian.Now for some gameplay stuff: I'm playing on Normal difficulty, and as a vet of Infinity Engine games, I'm finding it quite challenging... though that could be my party composition. Being able to create adventurers to fill in gaps in your party is a great feature, but the writing on the companions is good enough that you'll definitely be missing something by using the cookie-cutter custom adventurers. That being said, one thing I'm definitely going to say now is HAVE A ROGUE in your party. The first hour or two of the game you can get by fairly easily without one, but I'm now running into a lot of areas that are laden with traps/lockpickable doors, and I really don't have anyone in my party that is adept at 1.) seeing traps before triggering them, and 2.) deactivating them when necessary. You can probably get away with a Ranger instead of a Rogue, with a bunch of points dumped into Mechanics/Stealth, but nothing is as good as the real deal.All in all, I do not regret paying full price for this game. It's really great, and simultaneously scratches that nostalgic itch for a Baldur's Gate-type game while at the same time offering many current features that make it stand apart on its own as well.I hope Obsidian makes bucketloads of money with this and then goes on to make spiritual successors to some other Infinity Engine-era CRPGs. Arcanum, anyone?			"

												I'm a huge fans of Chris Avellone and Obsidian Entertainment. However, I will comment this game very honestly. This game I rated for (6/10) because it does not hit my expectation.It is a good/OK game. I do not recommend to buy this game based on the current price.<Pro>Great GraphicsImproved UI of the baldur's gate version. Awesome weather effects, detailed surroundings.Endurance SystemGreat introduction of the endurance system that affects the Health Point system.Event Sandbox mode:User action based that on the stats is good concept.Warden System:It is a better game grinding version of Caed Nua Levels.<Less Impressive>Storyline:There is no breakthrough in the storyline. The reincarnation that retain the previous life memory is just too lame to be rewritten again and again in so many games and novels. If you are expecting Torment or Fallout 2 level of storyline, you might be disappointed. It's still an overall OK storyline.Stronghold:The concept is awesome but the system not impressive. It allows you idle NPC to join the adventure and get items/exp. The shops inside your stronghold sell normal stuffs that can be bought from any NPC sellers you find in the game. To travel all the way (very long hours/days) to get the a free rest bonus is redundant, you could get a better rest bonus at very cheap rate in any Inn.Dungeons:Basically you just hold  5-6 prisoners of the game. That's it. You mihght get rare items in exchange the prisoners but is entirely unnecesary in this game.Caed Nua Levels:Basically is designated for the player who likes to grind the game to prolong the game play hours.Godlike Race:The only race that is stood-out in this game. The rest are just the replica of the typical elves, dwarfs, halflings race with different names.<Cons>Bad combat system: There is no tactical position neceasary for your NPC. The easiest way to win the combat is group your teamates all togather and wait for the enemy to come to attack you. All you need to do is slow mode or pause the game to spam your spells and skills.Buggy combat system: The characters always got stucked or take the longer/danger route to reach enemy.Boring Side Quests: The side quests are easy, boring and insignificant. It does not really impact too much on the storyline but only the epilodges. The only side quest that capture my attention is the Undying Heritage.Unmotivated Main Quest:Basically you are just chasing an old man who did 'something' on you. There is no 'A MUST' reason to motivate you to continue the main quest. You could just live at your stronghold for the rest of your life.			"

												This is one damn fine game. It takes a classic formula and breathes new life to it in the form of a modern game with modern production values but all the atmosphere of the original Infinity Engine games. In addition, it takes a careful look at the mechanics, not tied to the AD&D rules, and sets about determining what works and should be kept essentially as is, what doesn't and should be either jettisoned or improved, and what new things could be brought in to further improve the formula. The result is a game that, while not without flaws, is not just a worthy follower to classics like Baldur's Gate but an improvement in most ways that count. The main thing the game could be improved with would be a slightly larger selection of companions.Still, if you're fan of cerebral, atmospheric CRPGs with lots of reading, good world-building and slick but not simplified mechanics, this game is for you.

												Unbelievably unexpecetd masterpiece. I did not expect to spend $45 on a self-titled ""isometric rpg"". I expected a poor attempt at Baldur's Gate / Temple of Elemental Evil. I've lately been reminiscing about the glory days of Neverwinter Nights, wondering which RPGs I could play to rekindle the D&D 3.5 feel. Holy crap, this game nailed it out of the park. Metacritic score of 93 is a good indication of quality, and if you've played NWN/Baldur's Gate/ToEE, you are getting exactly what you paid for. The story telling and writing is spectacular; I'm actually reading all the dialogue, While this doesn't call itself D&D (licensing issues with 3.5, apparently), it's got the feel perfectly down; fighters fight, paladins lay hands, and wizards cast a magic missle-esque spell. Good god, if you're not playing this game, something is seriously wrong with you.			"

Note: I recommend installing on an SSD in order to reduce load times, especially if you’re a meticulous explorer type. You can also use a mod to disable auto-saving, but remember to quick save/manual save occasionally.Pillars of Eternity, a beautifully crafted crpg filled to the brim with content, will hold your attention for a long time. A single playthrough can easily take over 70+ hours depending on how much of the world and quests you to decide to explore. I spent hours reading as many in-game books as I could and even spent some time reading the bestiary. There's even a character journal that'll summarize the things you've done in the game. You can also expect your choices to affect outcomes and your reputation with people and factions. This game is extremely dense and I suggest not rushing through it. Take your time and enjoy yourself. At this point in time, the game is also much more stable than when it first released. They supported the game with patches that solved many issues and squashed interfering bugs. They’ll continue to support with version 2.0 in the future which will add more functionality.Freedom of Choice This game’s degree of freedom and consequences lends itself well to roleplaying and being the character you want to be whether that’s a vengeful barbarian, a monk that’s just trying to set things right, or even a gigantic jerkface. Most of quests have multiple outcomes depending on your actions. Dialogue choices are abundant too and your character stats/background can also affect what you might be able to say. Sometimes the extra responses are for flavor or can result in a fight being completely avoided. Keep that in mind should you decide to have a smooth-talking intelligent character or a mighty sort of person who intimidates. All of the main stats can influence conversations, but some do so much more often than others such as Intelligence and Resolve. If you really wanted to, you could just fly through the game solo, though I’d expect more talking and sneaking around if you chose that kind of path.GraphicsThe game's art assets look fantastic for the most part. I only noticed a building or two and maybe some walls that appeared to be in a low resolution compared to the rest of the game. Just don't zoom in all the way and keep the camera at an appropriate distance, things become blurry if you go in all the way. Every place in the game is a work of art. I especially like the leaves on trees. The trees are gorgeous as are the big, scary spells in the game. It’s quite the sight when a druid calls down a thunderstorm. It’s a beautiful game. Hmm, I suppose I should mention the character models are a bit funny looking since they’re usually seen from an isometric view until you’re in the inventory screen. Also, please try big head mode at least once.Story I thought the story was fine for the most part, but my efforts and interests focused on everything else since I wanted to do as much as possible. I’ll be unspecific to avoid spoilers. The world is a dark place filled with murder, vengeance, and betrayal. The side-quests benefit from the settings by doing interesting things with it. It felt good to vanquish foes that I thought were deserving since my monk didn’t like liars or murderers in general. I thought the main villain’s motivations were interesting and how far he went to accomplish his goals went beyond insanity. The companion storylines/quests might be a mixed bag for some people, but I did end up liking most of them all except for Kana and Pallegina. Pallegina was definitely underutilized and should have had a more fleshed out companion quest. Kana was an interesting person, but his quest seemed underwhelming. On the other hand, Durance and Grieving Mother had some fantastic storylines. I highly recommend seeing the quests of those two to the end. There’s plenty of story to find and read. Even the unique items have different legends associated with them. Some of them function like tragic short stories and are told well.CombatThe combat is a mixture of real-time and turn-based in the sense that you can pause the game mid-combat and issue orders to your party. You can also change the settings to have the game auto-pause when certain conditions are met like low Endurance or when someone is knocked out. I found normal to be somewhat easy for the most part after I had a full party of six members. The game’s difficult encounters still had me pausing and considering my movement and orders very carefully. “Okay, I need a damage reduction buff here. You’ll make it rain thunderbolts, you two try and knock the big guy down, and I’ll have you summon some shades.” The combat has a nice amount of complexity to it when you come across a worthy challenge. If you decide to not have such a large party, then you can expect the game to become harder if combat is your primary way of handling situations. Pause often and succeed, this is not meant to be a 100% real-time experience.Hopefully Pillars entertains you for a long time if it’s your type of game. It has much to offer unless you hate reading, but if you play, you’ll have the added benefit of an increased reading stat. Hooray.			"

												Guys, this game♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off so many times. It really did. I absolutely hated the fact that it's... where do I start from?!1. Clunkily isometric - no camera rotation - what you see is what you have to work with.2. Objects would intersect with one another so many times, that I barely knew what was going on.3. My guys would wiggle left and right behind one another in a futile attempt to find a way towards the enemy. And even when there is actually space for them to occupy, they would not. Unless I click. Seriously?!4. My guys will absolutely leave the positions i have carefully put them in to expose my weak rear line. There goes Aloth... Again!5. My guy(s) would sit and wait like they are braindead while their comrades are getting slaughtered, waiting for a command on my part while I am way too busy making sure my Priest is on top of the whole endurance/conditions/buffs situation.6. Breaking my space key cause, honestly, that is where your left or right hand should be all the time, based on your orientation.To continue, although I was a teenager during the dawn of the crpgs, I never ever played one - I was way too busy with games like Might and Magic 6-9, Heroes of MIght and Magic 1-4, Starcraft, Caesar 3-4, Pharaoh & Cleopatra, Zeus - Master of Olympus & Poseidon, etc. I never got into that genre. And now, since Divinity: OS launched, I was slowly drawn to it. And I embraced PoE for all it is:1. The rich lore.2. The interesting companions with their own rich story and personality.3. The companion interactions that made me sit, listen, smile and laugh.4. The little side stories which were making me connect even to the npcs that I had nothing to do with.5. The gorgeous handdrawn maps.6. The approach to combat. I have never ever prepared so painstakingly for my battles. Feels really good.7. The exploration, looking under every nook and cranny. Spending half a minute carefully moving your mouse over the screen in search for hidden stuff has never been more satisfying.AND FINALLY, that damn crpg's tons-of-math-and-formulae combat system. At one point I found myself looking into every equation and every calculation and trying to improve my odds.Holy hell, what has become of me... From a guy flagging PoE as ""Not Interested"" to a person who delves into its mechanics, busying himself making plans for future playthroughs and builds and whatnot.To conclude - buy this game, even if you hate the stuff I hated before it appeared. It has this weird way of drawing you in as the game progresses. I played a good part of it with clenched teeth, sometimes even shouted at my monitor - while waiting for the next time my guys will♥♥♥♥♥♥me off in combat by doing the very exact thing I dont expect of them. And I still went on and enjoyed everything it threw at me, and boy was it worth it. I can't wait for the expansion!			"

												The time has come for me to review my first game, and so it shall be Pillars of Eternity.So far the game has enthralled me with musical cues, surprisingly intricate graphics, and a gripping storyline. The text-driven story has me acting out the scenes to myself, physically, and mentally. I was unsure of how this kind of game would play out in this day in age, being a veteran of this style of game, but Pillars of Eternity proved that it can still hold up to today's gaming needs. After over a decade of watered down, run of the mill games that I have played, this is a breath of fresh air.I can finally enjoy role-playing again.Thank you Obsidian Entertainment.			"

												Heard about this game from a freind of mine who got me to play Baldurs Gate I + II. Seeing a huge improvement in graphics which is something that catches my eyes I'm so satisfied with this purchase.  The ability to go around fight, quest, explore, strategize is incredibly enjoyable. Even if it did take me five tries to kill the first Drake I encountered. If you're not sure about picking up this high quality, well done peice of art check out youtube videos and some streams. I'm sure your interested will be piqued and I'll garentee you would pick up the game if you can afford it. (Worth every cent).Adding on since I was rushing for this review. It has enough modes to challenege all levels of intensity you may want in a RPG. I have seen little or no limits as to what you're able to do in game. Many hours of exploration, questing even improving your own Fortress, Keep, Man/Woman Cave whatever you want to call it. Overall this game is  a 10/10 Must buy for me.			"

												A very strong game that boasts a lot of player choice with different outcome to most quests, a wide selection of customization for your party, and a lot of different and cool weapons to use.Unfortunatley it's not perfect, the amount of particles makes large fights with many spellcasters very cluttered, but the foundation is there to kickstart this fantastic style of games back into action for a long time coming.Get it if you like a challenge, enjoy epic fantasy adventures, and have gotten tired of the pathetic character design of recent BioWare games where the whole focus seems to be for the main character to find someone to stick his♥♥♥♥♥♥in.

												When I don't have a D&D session planned, I play this game. It's really entertaining, the story is great and original and the gameplay is better than what people say. Just don't play in Normal difficulty level.			"

												This game is simply bad. It tries to copy a bunch of hit games from the late 90s and it ends up being worse than all of them even 15 years later.Tedious play, bland mechanics, a story that manages to be confusing and forgettable at the same time, horribly unbalanced mobs; I simply cannot recommend this game.

												It took me 50 hours to play it through in a rather slow and calm kind of way. While it obviously cannot nearly keep up to the amount of content of a Baldur's Gate II, (lenght of the campaign, amount of optional quests, interesting storylines), it yet does some things better than its predecessors.It is in every sense indeed a game for adults. Dialogues are very well-conceived and sophisticated, and so is the whole background of the story and this new world. Prepare yourself for a LOT of careful reading, if you want to really understand what's going on and take some insights from this game. If you don't, there is still a very good tactical fighting system to explore, but that's obviously not the major purpose here.You find yourself confronted with truly hard moral decisions, where you really have to think about what's right and what's wrong. That is so because the game gives you absolutely no hints where things might lead you or what is now the ""good character""-choice. Sometimes I found myself staring for five minutes on some dialogue options before i chose one, thinking really hard what to answer. The game, in its way, rewards you for the effort, building plausible consequences even on the nuances of how your character behaves and what he says.There is no black and white and grey like we are used to from the fantasy genre. Every situation is unique, and sometimes several or even all options lead to consequences that you can't morally justify, but yet you have to come to a decision!It's just like in the real world.That's why i liked this game.

												The day steam makes a ""tread lightly"" reccomendation is the day I actually start using it for serious reviews.PoE was some experience, alright. I could easily write a review singing it's praises and proclaiming it to be a work of genius, and I could also make a review attacking it as a charleton, unacceptably flawed RPG, and neither one would require me to stretch the truth very much.It's a pretty good game. It deserves, at the very least, a 7.5/10, just for the concentrated effort to the self-contained world-building alone. The combat could be robots fornicating and I would still probably think the game was worth a look because of how rare it is that a project takes world creation professionally. There's enough ""vanilla fantasy"" to understand what's happening without navigating encylcopedia entries, but enough subtle changes to make it interesting. It feels like a Bioware game, and I mean that in the most positive sense that could possibly be conveyed: small story setpieces, tasks, nonessential conversations...lots of little things that don't really mean anything but do make you feel at home. Player agency exists, but only through a filter, much like in Baldur's Gate, so don't expect a choice & consequences game along the glory of Fallout, or even New Vegas.The UI is absolutely fantastic, the inventory and map screens are totally flawless. Despite all the huballoo about the graphics I found the game to be among the best looking RPGs I have ever played, with even the apparently ""low detail"" character models looking pretty good to me. Most of the clothes and armor look great and the minis are awesome. The soundtrack is a bit too Baldur's Gate for me, but it can easily be ignored except in cases were it loops improperly (which it unfortunately does quite a bit). Engine-wise my only criticism are the loading times, which are far too long even considering my aged laptop.The ""guidance"" of Baldur's Gate seems to be both a blessing and a curse. Nearly all of the major problems in PoE are things that were major problems for the Baldur's Gate games, so it's a wonder why these problems exist at all. As many of the more negative critics have said, why bother making a spiritual successor to the IE engine games if you're not even going to improve on them? Probably my biggest problem with Baldur's Gate was the D&D system, which is pretty much total♥♥♥♥♥ But what PoE provides instead is somehow worse, which I didn't even know was possible. Perhaps this is secretely a Pathfinder CRPG? This is unmistakably a game that Josh Sawyer directed, seeing how there are ""no hard counters"" which is basically code for ""nothing can be stopped and nothing is fun"". 99% of the loot you get is terrible because special weapons have barely any unique attributes besides ""do more better damage"". Eder's armor is the best armor in the entire game because it means you revive yourself on KO about 50% of the time, which is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, and you get that about 2% into the game. I put it on my main character immediately and was still wearing it at the end of the game. Nothing else you get even comes close, even the game's equivilant of Excalibur. Maybe this Pillars of Eternity wanted to be like that other game with a PoE acronym on this. Thankfully I don't really much care for item progression in my RPGs.There are only two types of maps: way too ♥♥♥♥ing big and way too ♥♥♥♥ing small. The big maps are actually really cool when you first get to them. Probably my favorite part of the game, and most likely the thing I'll look forward to on replays, was navigating through the big areas like Defiance Bay and Twin Elms and discovering what everyone's deal was. The problem is that these maps are usually the ones with key resources like vendors and inns and you have to walk 500 ♥♥♥♥ing miles to get there, then go through a loading screen, do your thing, then go back to a loading screen again, and then do it all over again if you have two trips to make. It takes way too long to get anywhere, probably longer than those MMORPGs that artificially lengthen travel time so you're eager to purchase mounts. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous but I don't want to stop and smell the flowers all the time, I want to ♥♥♥♥ing progress. The small maps are usually almost pointless wilderness maps, which was another one of my big problems with Baldur's Gate. And then there's the combat. Here's where things really get ugly. Despite the massive hate for it, I found that engagement barely effected me at all, though I do agree with the critics that it is 100% punitive to the players, so the game would lose little retiring the mechanic. The real problem here is the encounter design, which is astronomically terrible. In PoE, there are really only two combat scenarios in the entire game:-You're in a wide open area with many enemies. Send one melee or a ranger pet to help out your backliners and have your tanks engage as many enemies as possible to allow someone to get some AOE spells off.You're in a closed area with a single chokepoint. Send a tank to block off the choke and have your ranged attacks shoot the hell out of the closest enemy.That's seriously it. Even as someone who regularly struggles with enemy placement in tabletop RPGs, it's a very poor effort. There are no flying enemies that soar over your melee attackers and force the hand of magic and arrows, no archers placed in sniper spots, no poison-inflcting venomancers that slowly drag down your party, no battles inside infernal traps, nothing. There is only a single mechanic which forces you to switch up your tactics, and that is charm/domination, which many people hate and get protection against just because it's the only thing you'll ever have to really worry about. Bad combat in RPGs really isn't a surprise, in fact, one of my favorite games, Arcanum, had far worse combat. But there is just SO MUCH OF IT. On my first playthrough I ended up killing 1502 enemies, 302 more than the number required for the ""Super Murderer"" achievement, and I only ended up killing maybe 20 NPCs that didn't go hostile on me first. I've always been one to hate the diplomacy-is-god style of RPGs where you can literally get away with murder by being a lovable scamp (see New Vegas) but this is ridiculous. I can't understate this: I probably fought more enemies in this playthrough of PoE than I did in my last 5 playthroughs of other CRPGs, including Dragonfall, which is a tactics RPG. So much combat and so little variety.I enjoyed my experience, and probably even agree with my purchase ($45, far more than I am willing to spend on most games), but it was a gruelling effort and I am kind of glad it's over. It's a good game made with a lot of love and care, with some occasional dips in quality, both combat-wise and narrative-wise. There's room for huge improvements with patches, and I would love to see a sequel so long as they don't double dip on kickstarter. But I won't be replaying it anytime soon.			"

												Here is my impression.This is pure excellence. Pillars of Excellence should be it's freaking title.This is THE successor we've been waiting for from BG1/2. I just love this game so much so far after encountering disapointment after disapointment from the AAA RPGs.I'll even make a bold claim and say it's better than the first baldur's gate (so far). Here I said it.The story is good (so far), the world/lore is interesting even though it has some classism to it, the writing is impressive for a game, the game is challenging (on hard for me), the combat are fun little puzzles...It's everything you could have hoped for from a successor but with:- FAR far better UI (some strealining for inventory management etc...). - Cute ""Living story"" elements when interacting with the world. Kickstarter project so no cinematics and instead you'll get drawings and texts.- Interesting combats right outside of the tutorial area. BG1 was really lacking with your level 1 characters and many classes having no special skills. Here I played a Cipher and quickly teamed up with a Wizard and a Fighter. I have a good amount of skills to play right at the beginning and on hard difficulty it's 100% needed.-The stat system is a lot more intuitive and explained through tooltips.Some may dislike the disengagement system (attacks of opportunity) but there are 0 reason for a fan of the old cRpg to skip that one. None.			"

												“She’s a goddess, as fickle as they come… and with all the failings you’d expect of an empress and a ♥♥♥♥♥”, Durance says to me in his growly voice. He is a priest talking about his own goddess Magran in whose name he helped kill Waidwen (who claimed to be the living vessel of the god Eothas) during the Saint’s War. Such is the relationship between gods and people in Pillars of Eternity. Gods are not abstract terms used only in blind faith, they are among us every step of the way providing blessing and punishment as they see fit. They are deeply woven within the very fabric of society, with everyone opting for a god to serve and follow. As you start your journey, you learn of Waidwen’s Legacy, a horrible plague beset upon the people of Dyrwood which sees their newborn come into the world soulless. It is definitely true that faith and religion are overarching themes in Pillars of Eternity, but it’s the liberty to create a personal touch provided by Obsidian that makes it so compelling.You witness a strange ritual at the beginning of the game and something strange happens to you. From there, your motivations are up to you. Nobody designates you as the would-be savior of the world, nobody even tasks you to look into Waidwen’s Legacy. You are simply a person making his way through the world designing your own motivations and choosing your own actions. It was this aspect of the game that I found most liberating and compelling. Too often in games you are simply tasked and/or commanded what to do with clear goals set before you. Pillars of Eternity removes all that which makes the whole journey very organic and natural. It’s devoid of that silly feeling of clearly knowing you have something grand to do, but you simply opt to do a lot of things on the side despite everyone constantly reminding you how the world’s fate rests in your hands. This may be a subtle effect, but I found it extremely refreshing and compelling.Obsidian was clear on what it set out to do with Pillars of Eternity, it is definitely a throwback to classic Infinity engine games most notably Baldur’s Gate and Icewind Dale. It even looks the part with its rather simplistic 2D graphics that will instantly remind anyone of those glory days of computer RPGs. However, even though Obsidian didn’t really push any big new ideas, Pillars of Eternity is still very much imbued with many modern takes on what we’ve seen and played a long time ago. The visuals aren’t going to blow anyone away, but the 3D character models, some very nice effects and a strong art style go a long way to make it visually appealing, even gorgeous at times.The combat is real-time with pause, very reminiscent of the first Dragon Age. It is highly tactical with plenty of abilities, spells and traps to choose from. The only problem regarding the combat is the atrociously bad pathfinding. Outside of combat, it works perfectly fine, but during combat, characters will very often get stuck on walls, obstacles and each other requiring you to very closely monitor everything that is going on and manually select each character to get them out of a bind, particularly in confined areas. This can be alleviated to a degree by smart group formation and a bit of micromanagement, but that shouldn’t be necessary. What’s different about the combat is its emphasis on endurance over health. Monitoring health is a long-term affair in each battle, but a far more pressing matter is each character’s endurance level. As they receive damage, their endurance decreases, if it reaches zero, they get knocked out. There are ways to get fallen members back up again and certain classes specialize in such abilities. However, if any character’s health should reach zero, it’s game over for that particular character. So it is possible to lose designed party members for good. However, you can create your own party members at taverns for a fee. There is a large number of character classes and races to choose from, some of which are rather unique such as the cipher class or the godlike race. The downside is the extremely low level cap (12).The game world is very big, there are quite a lot of different and interesting locations to visit from your map view whereas each location is spacious yet not overwhelming. You will also get your own stronghold ruin at one point which you will be able to build up again and receive various benefits. The best thing about the stronghold is that it hides a massive dungeon consisting of 15 levels and a nasty boss fight at the end. What is overwhelming at times is the lore and dialogue which sometimes goes on for too long. Also, the writing, while generally very good, can get a bit opaque. The main story is interesting, it raises many questions, but leaves the conclusions up to the player. There is a great number of choices to be made throughout the game and a lot of them will be addressed at the very end.There’s a lot to love about Pillars of Eternity. The way it liberates players by letting them play their own way at their own pace through the story, by letting them decide on both their motivations and actions, the interesting game world and lore, memorable characters and a very tactical combat system. By liberating themselves from existing worlds and publisher demands, Obsidian had complete control to create their best game to date and one of the best RPGs in recent years.9 OUT OF 10 (SUPERB)			"

												W A R N I N G This game DOES NOT include: - Quicktime events. - Climbing towers. - Poor writing. - Plastic drama. - Tacked-on multiplayer. - Social features. - Microtransactions. - Delusions of being an MMO. - Sesquipedalophobia. - Contempt for its own audience. - Scenes added for the trailer's sake. - Hollywood envy. - Obsessive excessism. - ""Press X for Awesome!"" - Skyrim's approach to map markers. - Ubisoft's approach to optimization. - Game-breaking DRM. - Spyware. - Malware. - Mass Effect 3's ending (or so I hope).If you're like me, that's a good thing.Pillars of Eternity is the best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ RPG I have played in years. It's atmospheric, genuine, filled with awe and constantly laying down little mysteries you just want to know the answers to.I'm yet to finish it, but after the time I've spent with it already, I'm ready to crown it, wrap it in the comfiest of blankets--like the world's softest burrito--and proceed to discharge medieval Polish poetry and foot massages until it knows how precious it is to me and how much I appreciate its stubborn refusal to treat me in the same disrespectful way most of today's entertainment products do.Good job, Obsidian, you beautiful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.10/10			"

												Pillars of Eternity was expressly created as an homage to the Infinity Engine games; the interface and beautiful painted backgrounds definitely make it look the part.  But what made games like Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape so special was more than just an aesthetic: they were vast, sprawling settings with epic stories that delivered engaging tactical encounters.  And when judged by those criteria, I feel that Pillars of Eternity is a worthy successor to carry on the legacy of the Infinity Engine.  Though the loss of the AD&D engine and settings does take some getting used to, the mechanics are solid and the world is compelling and fun to discover.  It’s an easy recommendation for fans of of the Infinity Engine and I’d also recommend it for anyone interested in an engrossing quest through a fantastic land.			"

												Pillars of Eternity is the much anticipated spiritual successor to the Bioware Infinity Engine RPGs many of us loved (and some still do). If you enjoyed those games, Pillars is a must buy. If you didn't, Pillars probably won't change your find and it stays pretty true to that formula. Pillars is a party based RPG with a strong sense of story. It's personalized to your character by incorporating your character's traits into conversations with NPCs - for example, your knowledge of the wilderness or a reputation of being kind may open new options. The sheer number of ways Obsidian  accomplished this was one of the highlights of the game. Of course playing out the tactical battles is another large aspect to the game. While they are well done, too many of them were easy on hard difficulty while a smaller number were challenging. The game would have benefited from a better balancing of battles to provide a more uniform challenge. Quibbles aside, I recommend Pillars for fans of this type of game.

												Pillars of Eternity is an oldschool themed RPG which delivers on all aspects while staying true to the classic template of RPGs of 90ies. The story is captivating and intriguing, music is perfectly tuned to world setting, mechanics are solid and transparent, animators have done a great job as well and level design is plainly fantastic, it's an enormous pleasure to go through each one of them. This is the game where you can go on an adventure and lose yourself in it. Only downside is that price tag could have been little lower. Otherwise it still is worth the original amount. If you loved games like Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights then you'll be right at home with this one!9/10			"

												Inspired by the games I grew up playing like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape Torment, to name a few, Pillars of Eternity is by far the best isometric RPG to come out in years. A new and exciting world to explore, a deep and intruiging story, oodles of customization and everything else that no doubt already has you feeling nostalgic about the good old days and how RPG's used to be. You should be playing this game, or at the very least be watching someone else play it. I've spent a good 15 hours in Pillars of Eternity and just can't get enough, loving every moment of it. Go now, gather your party, and venture forth into this adventure that should last you the better part of 70 hours!

												129 Hours Later, Finished! (Thoughts On The Game)First off a big thank you to Obsidian for such a wonderful game and second, thanks to all the kickstarter backers. I was only able to back the amount for the game (25 or 35) and I also added on the addition for the beta backer later on, so a huge thank you to the backers who put in the big money! Now onto my thoughts on the game!The things I loved:- Writing was fantastic, from the dialogue to the story to the characters, wonderful writing once again Obsidian- Art Design is so beautiful, seriously... so seriously, love it- Combat is fun, at first I wasn't to sure about it but I have grown to love it. While not 100% perfect, it is a well done combat system.- Soundtrack is fantastic, really sets the atmosphere for me as I am exploring or going along my adventures- The Stronghold is a cool idea and i like it, but it was def not perfect, alot could be added to this aspect in an expansion pack- Had zero crashes, no fps issues, no gamebreaking bugs and no broken quests.- Some of the decisions I had to make had me really thinking about it- Atmosphere is very well done- Enjoyable final fight!- The character creation and classes I feel are all well done Things I didn't like or that I think can be improved:- The Pathfinding was honestly my biggest issue. There was times when I would tell guys to go attack this game and they would either try and go the long way or try and go through another player. Some other times moving around cities one would get stuck on something. Nothing gamebreaking but this was the biggest thing that annoyed me during my time with the game.- The Stronghold could be alot better, while I enjoyed it and think its improved over Inquisition and Dragon Age Awakening, it could still use some improvements. Maybe more things to build? A type of trial aspect where you decide on issues people have? Give us more options as to what we can do with prisoners and allow more random people to come and live in your stronghold. Things That could be added for expansion pack:- A coop mode like Divinity Original Sin for an expansion pack? As much as I loved this game, I think it would be even more fun if I could play the campaign with ONE friend (as long as it didn't effect the singleplayer)- More character Portraits next time. I love that we can import our own, but in future expansion packs maybe get the artists to do a handful more with more variety for difference races,etc..Love the game! I enjoyed Divinity Original Sin, Wasteland 2 and Shadowrun Dragonfall last year but this is even better imo. So wonderful to see this revival of a genre that was my favorite for so many years. Here is to more Pillars Of Eternity, more CRPG's in general in gaming and more Obsidian magic.Someone asked me for a score, I don't usually give out scores, I prefer just writing thoughts on the game. But, I can appreciate any review score from 8 to 10. If you had a gun to my head and asked for a score though? I would say its a 9.5/10 for me personally. Not perfect but a hell of a wonderful experience! I have liked so many Black Isle and Obsidian games over the years, but you really didn't fool around with this game did you!I know there is a tank game coming from Obsidian and another unannounced game and two expansion packs for Pillars in the future, hope to see many more rpg's from Obsidian in the future, keep up the wonderful work! I have to deal with chronic pain every day so when a nice rpg like this comes around (or a good foreign movie or book/tv show,etc..) and has the ability to pull me into its world so well with and take my mind off of things it is a wonderful thing. Thank you Obsidian, I can tell this game was crafted with love!			"

												When I first got the game, the starting intro was intriguing enough, but I started to get very frustrated a few hours in, so I will start with the negatives since thats what most people will experience and notice first.  In the end, I came back to it a year later, got the expansion season pass and enjoyed it, but to do so, I had to forget my hopes and expectations and approach it as a new game again.  It was easier to do this when I knew the things I hated about it and could make adjustments (not playing as a wizard for my main character, and focusing on the story vs the combat)Even though the game captures the look and feel of an infinity engine game, they chose to create a new game system instead of liscensing the D&D or some other popular system, and this was the primary source of my frustration.  In particular, the new system is very limited in the spell selection of both wis and int casters compared to the baldur's gate games.  The other thing I dislike about the new system is that rogue backstabing is nearly impossible to pull off, and even when you do, the results are underwhelming for the effort.  Part of it is that even with stealth maxed for your level, it is nearly impossible to sneak close enough to anything to do a backstab, and when you do, the multiplier is only something like 1.5 or 2x, and it is never enough to outright kill anything that is not incredibly weak compared to you.The stronghold was also a disapointment.  Obsidian did a pretty good job with the stronghold in NWN2, so I had high hopes for the implimentation in this, and they did have some interesting ideas, but they just felt rushed or unfinihsed.  Its not so much that the stronghold is bad, its just not as good as it could have been, and not as good as what they did with NWN2.Now for the good points.The story is different and interesting with a lot of twists I did not see coming.  The first part of the game is pretty slow going as you are getting acquinted with the world it is set in, but things really start to pick up once you get to the main city.  I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say that the story was good enough to me that it was worth getting past the negatives I listed to enjoy it. The story and quests in the expansion (Whitmarch) are also very well done, and the expansion is well worth getting if you decide to get the game.I'm gonna give it a positive rating, but for anyone who has not played the Baldur's Gate or Neverwiner Nights series, I would highly recomend any of those over this, and I would also recomend Dragon Age: Origins and Awakening over this (but skip Dragon Age 2, that game is a steaming pile of rubbish).TLDR: Great story, disapointing game mechanisms.

												A nostalgic romp in an original and engaging world. Obsidian has made good on it's promise to bring you a fantastic and unforgiving isometric RPG.If you've played games like Baldurs Gate, or Planescape: Torment, then you know what you're getting into, but for the uninitiated, this is a text heavy roleplaying game. Instead of the constant grinding of enemies to level up associated with most similar games currently on the market, your experience will largely be rewarded from exploring new areas and completing quests, of which you'll find plenty.This is not to say that the combat system was neglected, it is both engaging and relentless. You'll need to take control of your entire party (unless you choose to go solo) and plan your attacks and formations accordingly. A host of spells, abilities and talents help you maintain control of the battlefield in real time as you dispatch your foes and progress through an compelling and well written story. Definitely a contender for Game of the Year.			"

												Ehhhh....this one's difficult. I'm recommending it, but I didn't like it, and not everyone will. I can admire this game, I definitely can, but it's way too hardcore for me. If you want a really hardcore RPG then this is for you, but I think I'll just stick to Bethesda			"

												Pros: + Obsidian + Going on 80 hours and just got to the 2nd act (I prefer to chew on something great rather than swallow it whole)+ Great story+ Dialogue+ Art direction+ Depth of customization (including combat options such as slowing down time for better control, auto-pausing when encountering an enemy or not auto-pausing, etc.)+ Nearly endless amounts of spells, upgrade options when levelling, and loot + Branching story and consequential decision making + Managing a stronghold provides some interesting options+ Interesting factions + Great replability + Awesome enemy variability + Enchantments are actually worth a damn+ PLENTY of stuff (quests, tasks, bounties, dungeon crawling) to do+ A sprawling mega dungeon that will make fans of good old fashioned dungeon crawling do cartwheels Neutral:+- You don't gain experience points from regular battles with enemies (as with most RPGs) but from completing quests, at first this really irked me because I'm used to gaining XP from encounters but as you play you understand why they did it. This is more a positive than negative for me, but I placed it here because I can see some people not liking this aspect of the game. Cons:- Durance's♥♥♥♥♥♥- The game has to end I honestly can't recommend this game enough, it can be daunting at first but stick with it and figure out what builds work for your playstyle and what strategies synergize and which don't. I promise you it's an incredibly rewarding experience.			"

												Well, as it's already been stated by many, this is a revisit to Baldur's Gate (1 & 2). It doesn't have the story depth of the characters of those classics, and it doesn't quite match up to the immersion of Planescape: Torment, but when it comes to isometric cRPGs this is one that stands out. You won't have the, ""Squeak SQUEAK"" of the ""Boo"" that is Minsc's hamster or the haughty judgementalism that is Jaheira in the character interactions, and you certainly won't get the gender-changing possibilities of your companions, but . . . it's not bad for a crowd-funded game.If you're expecting that level of depth and that's what you're looking for, you're not going to find it with this game. There is, however, interaction and some degree of character growth of the NPCs that can join your party. All NPCs have personal quests - not as rewarding as BG2, for instance - but it's there.Having said that, this is an isometric cRPG that allows you to create a character of your choice and choose, at your leisure, a party of either pre-built NPCs you meet in-game or recruit and define for youself. Your party grows in strength and experience, you stylistically decide how to develop yourself and your NPCs to suit your expectations, and you go through the game playing these decisions against the battle encounters you face.And that's kind of where it breaks down. The story - the plot - is interesting, but what you will find is that you approach all conflicts and battle in pretty much the same way. ""I put my 'tanks' or 'warriors' here, and everyone else destroys the enemies from afar."" is not an unfair description of how most fights go. If you're in it for the story, then great - it's like playing any RPG, such a Dragon Age: Inquisition, on casual mode. If you're in it for hardcore combat challenge, then you're just going to end up with larger groups of enemies against whom you already have effective strategies and tactics to defeat.Point is, the battles get repetitive. The story is there between the battles, but the story doesn't progress without the battles. Looking back, all those years ago at Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment, it probably wasn't much different. But at least at that time it was novel ideas and made me a captive audience. In this re-incarnation, it's the same thing except I know what to expect, and that diminishes the overall experience.I recommend the game, however, because of the story. That is, ultimately, why we play RPGs. I want to know what happens next; I am the protagonist and get to make choices that may affect future consequences, and I have a BIG♥♥♥♥♥DAMN SWORD that can cut you in two. As a revisitation on older cRPG games, it's nothing less than awesome. Graphics are decent, soundtrack is great, voice-acting is okay - there's just enough to bring those memories back from the 90's. And since I'm sentimental, I'll run with that. "

												Truly engrossing game. Graphics and style of play is just superb. The lore, gameplay and attention to detail is really well done. While many people will compare this to Baldur's Gate etc, this truly is a step up in class. Only into the early parts of the game but am totally happy with the game. The downside is I just dont have enough time to play!			"

												Do you enjoy spending hours at a time working on a branching questline only for all of your actions to be rendered completely pointless? Do you like micromanaging obtuse and obsolete game mechanics? Do you want a game that throws all its potential out a window in favour of being 'safe'? Then boy do I have a game for you! Pillars of Eternity presents itself as a throwback to the classic CRPGs, like Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment. However, it actually comes across as a game made by people who liked those games but did not understand why they were good. Pillars throws at you the trappings of choice, of an interactive world, of interactive design, but does not actually include these in any meaningful way. As an example, let's look at character creation. You're presented with a half-dozen options for races, all with different stats and backstory, then a handful of different class options based on the traditional DnD classes (fighter, wizard, rogue, bard, etc.) and then finish up with options for personalising the character's backstory, appearance, etc. Sounds great, right? Just what you'd expect. But when you come to actually play the game, you'll find that none of it really matters. The classes really just resolve into ""ranged"" and ""not ranged"", and everything else is just fluff. Your actual playstyle will be exactly the same whether you play a big, tough warrior or a small, sneaky rogue. The character options present different possibilities for interacting with the world, but these almost never actually come up in the story. If you play as a goblin (I don't care what you actually call them, they're still goblins), the game will tell you that your race is hated and discriminated against. This came up ONCE, in the 20-odd hours I wasted on this game. In a single option, hidden behind another conversation option, while talking with a single minor character. Quests and storylines may have multiple ways of approaching them, and multiple ways of progressing, but almost all that I played ultimately had only one single outcome, which had nothing at all to do with what I did. You can spend hours at a time working carefully on choosing which faction you're going to support, choosing which quests to do for that faction, deciding how you're going to accomplish your quests from the several options presented to you, weighing the pros and cons of each possible outcome, only for all of this to be rendered pointless when the storyline progresses with absolutely no impact from you or your actions. The writers are determined to tell you their story, despite what you do, without you being involved in that story. There is no real choice, no actual 'multiple paths' as advertised, there is just ""well, that's nice, now here's what is ACTUALLY going to happen."" Ultimately my problem with this game is that there is no real choice in anything. It is a crude imitation of what came before, with nothing new to add or innovations to include. 20 years ago, this game would have been a brilliant new addition to the CRPG library. It would have stood up against the best of its genre. Unfortunately, it's not 20 years ago. But I don't think the developers know that.			"

												It's more Baldur's Gate than Baldur's Gate.   Story is good; combat is challenging, fair, and satisfying; the personal stronghold quest line is better than the similar quests in Witcher 3 and Skyrim.  Very replayable if you have  the time because there are several competing factions in the game that you can join.			"

												This is an example of a game made to 'please the fans' rather that to have something actually enjoyable.Because of the kickstarter they felt obliged to stick to an uninspired backbone that killed any possibility to create a great game by adding features organically. They rather had a list of thing they wanted to show that they had, for the fans, and rushed them into the game.You can't make a game good because on paper its features look good. A good game is something that is crafted and tested iterativelly. Here the different ideas don't hold together properly.On paper you have for example :Good graphicsLots of lore'Innovative' class and combat system'Innovative' xp system (combats give no xp)In pratice:Loading times between tiny maps are embarrassingly long. Unacceptable for a 2015 game that pretends to emulates a 2000 one.I couldn't care less about the story, the characters. As it was said everywhere else, it looks like a collection of fan fictions.Class system is dull, characters feel all the same.Combats are a joke. You can't prepare for the combat before you engage the enemy (can't use spells and so on). Enemies are overpowered and even though there are lots of different lloking enemies in the game they don't feel very different. Abilities are boring and their effects interchangeable.The xp system is an absolute joke. This game as 10 monsters per square meter and combats give absolutely no xp ??!!Basically the entire game feels like a ripoff (I have barelly played it but I can imagine it is consistent trough the entire game). Is it supposed to be more realistic? So gaining levels and improving your combat skill by doing stupid quests is more realistic than doing so by winning fights? I will rephrase it : The entire purpose of experience points in this game is to improve combat related skills, but then combats give no experience? This game drifts too far away from what normally makes a good game.  That idea of having to go back to town almost every fights because you need to sleep to regain your spells... In baldur's gate it was ok because you could outsmart/outpower your enemies with well thought tactics and items, but this game suffers from the tall poppy syndrome and there isn't much you can do to feel clever/good. You feel like you're playing the same way everyone is playing, like on a rail.Apparently helmets in this game are purely decorative, give no stats. You can have an iron helm or a simple hat on your magician, it makes no difference. Is it for more realism, like the xp system?In this game everything feels so generic, watered down. What a waste of crowdfunding money! They could have just copied baldur's gates mechanics with better graphics and made an awesome game but no, they had to 'dust it off'.What worries me the most about this game is all the positive critiques it managed to get. It is neither an old school game nor a modern one, so what is it? What do people find in it ? "

												I backed this game on Kickstarter, despite never having played Baldur's Gate or any of the other predecessors this draws on. I thought the concept was interesting and I knew I liked Obsidian's work in the past, so I took a chance on it, and it paid off!First the niggles, because this game still suffers from a lot of the same problems most other RPGs do. You inevitably accumulate piles and piles of garbage loot for no apparent purpose other than to sell it, which requires you to individually select every item you want to sell. You get quests like ""Find a druid who knows about this thing"" but you can't actually ask anybody ""Hey, any idea where I might find a druid who knows about this thing?"" so you have to ask every single person you meet until you find the right one. And... well, really, those are the only complaints I have - ridiculous loot bloat, and quests that rely on brute-forcing through dialog options to find what you're looking for (which may tempt you to just check out the wiki). These are pretty common RPG problems, though, nothing Pillars is any more guilty of than its competitors.What Pillars of Eternity does have is really interesting worldbuilding, for one. The way souls are woven into the fabric of the world's magic and science is really interesting, and presents a lot of unexpected parallels to real life. The game's take on gods and religion is interesting too, and there's a great sense of local history and politics in the story. The only shame is that despite presenting the player with a wide-ranging, complicated controversy around the subject of animancy, that controversy ends up fading into a secondary plotline. Really, the world is crying out for a sequel that especially delves deeper into the politics and culture of animancy. The rest of the writing is also great, though the voice acting can sometimes sound like the actors thought what they were saying was kind of ridiculous (which it sometimes is).The gameplay is also pretty fun, with a fairly broad variety of spells and abilities, and so many class/race/weapon/skill/talent combos that I frankly got a little overwhelmed at all the possible ways I could develop my character. But hey, as far as I'm concerned character development is a key part of RPGs, so the more choice, the better. I played on an easier setting, because I have a job and a life and don't have time to bang my head against a wall, and while the easy settings felt perfectly fun and balanced during the first half of the game, I eventually over-levelled compared to the enemies to the point where I wiped the floor with them on autofight, and made the mistake of choosing to stay at the easy difficult when prompted (you get prompts when you start The White March, Act III, and Act IV if you're too high level, and can choose to scale up the difficulty for sport). This is really just my bad, though; if you are playing on Story or Easy, I recommend increasing the difficulty when you're given the option to do so later on in the campaign.I played with The White March, which is also excellent, but a word or warning - I think that the best narrative effect comes form playing Part I of the White March and then running around in the main game again for a bit before returning to Part II. I'm not sure if this is possible if you have both of them installed, but the way the White March II starts makes the most sense emotionally and narratively if you've been away from Part I for a bit.Overall, this was a really fun RPG with very interesting lore and characters and fun gameplay, even if it doesn't dodge some of my personal RPG pet peeves. Give it a shot!			"

												Short version : Best fantasy roleplaying game without pen & paper.Long version :Ok, there is no Minsc and Boo in this game, but otherwise this is best fantasy roleplaying game without pen & paper. I'm not big fan of D&D style rules, but in this game it works pretty damn nicely. They have made really good set of all kind settings to make this game good experience for different players. Difficulty settings let's you choose anything from ""I'm drunk kitten and attack everything without brains""-mode to really hardcore permadeath. Oh ye, there is also story in this game and at least at after 18h playing it hooks pretty nicely and there is really feeling that you can make a lot of choices and it really affects in this virtual world what you choose to do. TL;DR... I want to go back to play this game NOW! :)			"

												This game has no soul, you have to force yourself to like it. Even then, I really tried to get into it and the combat and classes are so boring that its impossible to have fun. The story is pretty good and it would be a good game if the combat/characters didnt feel so lifeless and boring. Its not fun when your barbarian at level 10 has 3 skills one of them is a toggle passive basically and you miss every 2 attacks. There is a terrible loot system which feels as lifeless as the game also. I seriously would pick up Divinity Original Sin instead, of course its personal taste but I wasnt even going to review this game until Divinity made me see how lifeless Pillars is. I didn't play baldurs gate much when I was younger so maybe its the lack of rose tinted glasses that makes me unable to get through the first few parts of the game without making a new character.

												An excellent spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, while having a unique world to explore with its own mechanics and a richly imagined lore. The character customization is deep and varied, the character progression well balanced and the main story is interesting, if coming across a bit short. I played almost 180 hours of this game, restarting several times before finding a character combination of race and  class that worked with my playing style. (in the end, I settled for rogue to get the extra experience for unlocking containers and disarming traps early in the game)I've finshed the game and am already chomping at the bit to have another go at it. Can't say enough good things about the execution of this classic style CRPG. "

												Thought I’d finally do a short update to my review now that I have actually played through the game, took me a long time to get into it (you should hopefully be able to infer from the text below why).Too long; didn’t write hur hur, self awareness  – Pillars of Eternity, from a story perspective, is a fantastic fantasy (borderline science fantasy) cRPG that is held back by issues with the narrative design and thick, purple prose ridden writing (!!!) as well as the ambition and the scale of the project (the story would have been much more impactful on the ‘surface level’ if this were the 2nd or 3rd game of a series). If players push on in spite of these issues, it ultimately does tell a very unique story that can be critically analysed and likewise handles some unique themes with a lot of nuance.			"

Product received for free
												*Review of original initial release only. Does not account for changes via DLC or subsequent patches.*Pillars of Eternity is a triumph.You start the game as just another traveller looking for a fresh start in a new land, flavoured by the choices you made during character creation. A LOT of terrible things happen and before long you are caught up in world where souls are endlessly reincarnated and the natural balance has been shattered. Some individuals can even see and manipulate souls. A lot of the strife, mystery and wonder in this game ties directly back to souls in some way, shape, or form.Your attributes, talents and choices also ripple out into the greater world. It is not possible to be on everyone’s good side. Treat one group well and another group may become hostile to you for helping their enemies. NPC’s and main characters will react to your race, class, nationality and affiliations. Conversations are influenced by a number of factors, providing you with a number of different conversation options. All of which ties to a reputation system. This helps the world feel much more grey, with right and wrong being a matter of perspective.The visuals are gorgeous if you have an appreciation for the style being used, even if the world could use a bit more colour in places. PoE does not have traditional cinematics. Instead players are given interactive text adventures with illustrations and sound effects that are directly informed by your stats and choices. The writing is almost always exceptional. Far, far above the usual flavour text that wraps around typical binary conversations in other games. The text based dialogue and the voice acting are really great. You might not hear as much banter as you will in other games but what is there is entertaining and sometimes surprising. The 8 official companions all bring something unique to the table.Character creation is one of my favourite parts of RPG’s. PoE is a wonderland in this respect. There are a lot of stats and mechanics to wrap your head around. You absolutely can build a viable character just following the on-screen tips and jumping into a game. The thing is, you won’t know WHY you are making those suggested choices. You’ll have descriptions to read sure, but you just won’t have an appreciation for the nuances of PoE‘s rule-set without experimentation. The game is setup in such a way that anyone can make a safe, viable character following the on-screen suggestions. Failure to Min/Max every damn stat won’t cripple you. Which is not to say you could not create a broken character, just that you’d have to travel pretty far off the beaten path to do it. By the same extent it is possible to break out “the maths” and attempt to make the most deadly backstabbing Orlan Rogue this side of Gilded Vale.You have lots of choices when it comes to creating your character and they all come with some kind of stat. There are 6 races, 15 sub-races and 11 classes. Some of the races are fantasy stalwarts that have been given a PoE spin like Humans, Dwarves and Elves. Others are a bit more unique.Combat in PoE is almost always a white knuckle affair. Fights happens in real time but you can pause and issue commands. As a bonus, you can also slow down or speed up time at the press of a button, allowing you that extra time to react to subtle changes on the battlefield or cross a big map as quickly as possible. During combat you have to keep in mind both your Endurance and your Health. Endurance represents how much of a beating your character can take before being knocked unconscious. You can replenish Endurance with items, abilities and spells. While most damage affects Endurance you will also lose Health during combat. Lose all your health and you’ll be maimed. Get hit again and you are dead. Companions can die for good. You can’t replenish Health or remove maimed status without resting at either a camp or an inn.Party composition, formation, location and more all have major effects on combat. You have to play smart, not just bold. Your party is incredibly powerful so long as you make your choices with care. The enemies in PoE are super aggressive, varied and absolutely ruthless when it comes to hammering weakness. One of the ways PoE is different from other RPG’s is that the restrictions on equipment have been relaxed, meaning your casters can wear heavy armour and wield great swords if you want them too. There are considerations when it comes to armour of course, but it is nice that your casters and such don’t have to be so squishy.PoE is not a game about grinding. Generally when you clear an area or map it stays cleared. Instead the game rewards players for exploration, discovery, completing quests and making choices. Whether you plan on fighting or sneaking your way through you are always going to have to be on your toes. You can’t just roll over anything you encounter. Some enemies will be too tough to beat. Some areas will be inaccessible without the right gear. You’ll have way more active quests and tasks than you can immediately complete. This means you need to make hard choices and return to questlines and areas when you are better equipped to tackle them.Besides the standard questing and combat (and a million other little things to be honest), PoE has two big features I love. The first of which is your Stronghold Caed Nua. Once you’re done battling through the Stronghold proper it becomes your base of operations. You’ll repair its buildings, shore up its defences, man it with soldiers, send companions out on quests and more from within its walls. You can even manage it while you are away. In some aspects it may seem a bit dry, but there is enough incentive there to keep making progress. Sometimes your Stronghold will come under attack. Other times you’ll take someone captive and hold them in your dungeons until somebody begs for their release. Even though the game has 8 official companions, you can recruit your own custom made adventurers any time you want as long as you have the cash. Since you can only have 5 companions in your party at a time, when your companions are not traveling with you they can be running quests from the Stronghold for a variety of rewards.The other unique feature I love is The Endless Paths, which is a sprawling mega dungeon underneath your Stronghold. It’s almost like a game within a game. You’ll encounter all sorts of monsters, heroes and quests as you fight your way deeper and deeper. The whole time you are rebuilding the Stronghold in the back of your mind you worry about The Master Below.Playing on Normal will provide a serious challenge. You WILL die many, many times. Hard mode is just that; HARD. Playing on Path of the Damned difficulty is pure masochism. Players can even take it a step further by turning on Expert Mode which completely removes all hints and suggestions from the game. If you are feeling truly crazy you can even try playing the game with Trials of Iron turned on which gives you just one save and one life. If you die, that’s it.The game also comes with some more subtle touches that have a big effect on the game. For one, you’ll never run out of storage space when you are out questing. Each of your companions can hold 16 items in their inventory, but everyone always has access to your party Stash, which as far as I can tell is bottomless. The UI is clean, practical and easy to use. The game allows you to control font size and includes a colour-blind mode.As far as bugs and glitches go I’ve encountered very few. The game never crashed on me once. I had to reload a save once to get a quest to trigger and I encountered text wrapping around improperly during a conversation with a random NPC. That’s it.*This review is heavily trimmed due to the limit Steam places on the length of reviews. Check out my profile for a link to the website I write for to see the full review.*			"

												If you are looking for a RPG in the same style as the classics, look no further. This game brings back memories of Baldurs Gate and Icewind Dale, and it definitely delivers the same high level of quality and immersion as those games. The setting is well designed, and you have a lot of lore to dig into if that is your thing. At no point does the game force you to do so, so you have a lot of freedom. The stories are good, and you are rewarded mostly from completing quests as opposed to hacking and slahing your way through the game. This enables you to better roleplay your character, as opposed to having to slay mobs for XP, which can sometimes be a problem in RPGs. Expect to invest a lot of hours into this game if you plan to complete it. This can be good or bad I guess, depending on what you are looking for. The main plot can be completed in about 50 hours, but to get the full experience, it is recommended to study a bit away from the game - what does each stat do (there is a lot of them), what about conditions, class mechanics, spells and so on. It is quite detailed and rich. There's some problems with the game you should be aware of: - Tanky characters often fail to hold aggro- The ending seems a bit rushed compared to the rest of the game- The main plot becomes increasingly predictable- It is difficult to build a proper healer, so you rely a lot on potionsTHese points are minor, and might be due to me misunderstadning mechanics, and it also comes down to personal preference. I have played a lot of RPGs, so it takes a lot to surprise me with a story these days - hence storylines becomes predictable. If this is one of your first RPGs, expect a great story! Overall, I would highly recommend this game, if you enjoy games that encourage you to learn more, and if you enjoy the style of the classic RPGs, as it brings out a lot of nostalgia.			"

												First off, I really like this game. I've completed both expansions and it's definitely grown on me over time. My first playthrough was as a death godlike cipher, which I didn't find nearly as fun as as an orlan wizard. In my first playthrough I made the mistake of not having high enough perception and resolve (which you need for speech checks). As my wizard, I rectified that issue and dialogue became more enjoyable. What I liked about the game:It's text heavy with interesting lore and world, some interesting characters, good dialogue, and a decent plot (not groundbreaking, but it's good). There are a variety of races to choose from, some of which are unique to the world and have different sub-types. You can also choose a culture in addition to race, which affects stats, and to a lesser degree, dialogue options. There are also quite a few classes, one of which is unique to the game. Classes and background (philosopher, slave, etc) also affect dialogue options to a small degree. All of these options make character building quite fun and interesting. The combat can be fun if you aren't constantly getting swarmed with enemiesThere are a lot of spells and abilities, some of which are pretty fun to use Can level up abilities in Lore, Athletics, Survival, and Mechanics (lockpicking) which affect dialogue options and how you interact with the world A lot of playtime (around 70 hours without expansions)There's a fast mode (press D), if you want to traverse areas fasterThe environments are beautifulYou acquire real estate early in the gameWhat I didn't like:Too many spells, a good chunk which aren't worth usingThe load times are quite long, even if you are just entering a house. This makes exploring cities tedious.Too many enemies, especially at higher difficulties. Too much combat in general - there are diplomatic options, but not as much as, say, Planescape: Torment. This game is more like Icewind Dale with all the combat. You have to camp or rest at an inn in order to regain healthThere's a few tedious as ♥♥♥♥ dungeons. However, at least they're optionalAll of the inns have the same musicYou can only use so many spells before you have to restEndurance/Health relationship might take a bit to figure out Companions don't take much convincing to follow you to uncertain death. Companions make more sense in Planescape: Torment and Tyranny, where companions most are manipulated or conscripted. I know it seems like there are a lot of cons, but these are only the things that bothered me (and I'm a bit cynical) - they probably won't bother others, except for the load times. Everything considered, it's a great relaxing game to get immersed in, and it's definitely worth playing, especially if you've got time to kill.			"

												Great story, brilliant game mechanics, awesome customization options and attention to detail.Talking about attention to detail...To my (quite extensive) knowledge of the genre of isometric RPGS, in no other game can you see your sheathed sword/mace/axe on the character's side while wielding a bow. The resting animations are also pretty cosy ;) It doesn't sound like much, but these are the little things that make a great and immersive cRPG.10/10, without any hesitation.			"

												Before the rating of this game drops heavy due to the sale. I want to say that this is a good game for people who enjoy good old rpg games like Baldurs gate, Icewind Dale ect. The game has a great story, great dialogue, good gameplay, good leveling system and a large world to explore. But the game is really hard if you do not have experience wit oldschool rpg, and most of the quests eigther  requires you to read trough ingame lore or the full explenations of the quest. Or the dignity to search up walktroughs.			"

Heck even if you haven't played those but enjoy a good RPG with a beautiful lore and rich story, with a nice set of difficulty's to choose from and customisation this is still a game for you!			"

												Let me begin this by saying I really wanted to like this game. I desperately wanted to. I tried in as many different ways as I could to convince myself that I just wasn't seeing Pillars from the right angle, that if I tried one more time I could get into it, but in the end I had to admit the truth to myself. Pillars of Eternity is garbage. This game falls flat on its face when it comes to important elements that make a great role-playing game. The first is the terrible cast of characters. In a game that revolves around a party of companions, they design an extremely limited (what, six, maybe seven total?) and bland cast of joinable NPCs that would never, ever travel together if you were looking at this from a story perspective. That might be forgivable if they were interesting with their own romances and side quests and intricate backstories, but they're not. The game designers seem to attempt an apology for this by shoehorning in some mechanic to design your own party of characters from the tavern, but for me that's just as half♥♥♥♥♥as apologizing for the terrible magic weapons they designed by letting you enchant your own gear.The second is clearly the combat. From the basic system to the character classes to the way enemies behaved and battles generally went, it's a big gigantic mess that is not intuitive or fun to play. The basic concept of Pillars combat mechanics are confusing and annoying. Items you find are woefully inferior to the bland generic items you can enchant, and the way stats interact with your class is unbalanced and at times extremely confusing (physical strength dictates the damage wizards do with their spells -- WHAT?). Many enemies are given stunlock abilities or endlessly heal each other (such as the Paladins in Raedrics Keep), and all are automatically designed to rush your weakest characters. There's no real way to stop this, short of sending your fragile characters away from the fight at maximum range, but as soon as they move in to do anything to help, they will get rushed and die. The worst part is that after you finish that tough-as-nails epic fight, you realize you're not a damn step closer to the next level for it because of a pretentious XP system that only rewards quest completion and not body count of defeated foes.Third is the lack of immersion or replayability. The game makes a big deal about character race, background, culture and all that, but ultimately those choices have no impact on the actual events of the story. The 'reputation' system they tried to implement is confusing and poorly designed, so that by the time you finish the game, you will have a car crash of many different reputation types. This is made even worse when certain classes (Priest and Paladin) have class abilities whose strength depend on this broken reputation system. Quest lines allow the illusion of choice at some points, but the result is the same regardless of what you do.Fourth, and finally, is the story. It's not interesting. The main character can talk to dead people, and some Big Bad Evil Guy in a mask is stealing souls for some unknown, shallow and ultimately pointless purpose. The hook for even placing you where the events of the game take place is immediately revoked a couple hours in after Raedric decides to yank his offer, leaving you as some wandering nobody with no purpose other than to chase down why you have funny voices in your head. Being a Watcher is supposed to be this super-rare unique Kewl D00d power, but the most reaction I ever got out of anyone amounted to: 'You're a Watcher? Huh. That's funny.' As plot devices go it's really weak and I found myself struggling to give a single damn about magic rocks coming out of the ground, hooded people performing nefarious rituals, or my character's involvement in the whole mess at all.The fact that this game has gorgeous aesthetic and production value makes all of this worse. With such crucial design flaws, this is literally the RPG equivalent of a hot girl that won't put out. She'll tease you, but in the end you'll walk away with nothing but blue balls, resorting to your only option of finding some relief by drunk dialing your ex.That's it. Pillars of Eternity is a hot girl that doesn't put out. End of review.			"

												Let's start with, should you buy this game? Yes, it is well worth the price.Pros: DragonsInteresting characters, Interesting Stories,Extensive spells(so many that i didn't use all of them),Fort Building,Fun Combat,Friendly Banter,Lot's of Bounties,Lot's of choices,Imprisoning people,Companion Stories & quest lines,An in Depth biography/journal that writes of your deeds, Dragons.A Few Cons:After the Boss fight the game just ends (apparently it autosaves just before you jump) Can't change decisions once they are made, for example, you can destroy and object or stop it, yet if you stop it,  you cant come back and destroy it later, because.... reasons? Need's More Dragons,Banter it seems is only limited to 3 lines, maybe rarely 4,You can ask your jailor to whip your prisoners but not treat them well? :L & prisoners barely say anything! a person who asked to be put in jail asked to be released, after 1 day!!!I feel that companions don't talk enough?Important vistors personalies, are often Non- exxistant in your Fort,I couldn't find anything to make my screen follow my character, having to constantly click ahead, maybe i missed it. It is said people complain more about things they love.Dlc:Why can't i get in the hot pools :(I want a 3rd DLC, ..... Dragon? oh and a nice sword.If you love RPG games, you should get this, it's well worth the money and will give you dozens, if not hundreds of hours of playtime.

												Really liked the tactical combat in this game. Primarily emphasizes preparation, using narrow doorways to your advantage, and generally positioning your folks properly. This leads to delightfully varied and challenging encounters. Do note, however, that micromanagement is also an important part of combat (they even tell you that when you're choosing a difficulty level), so if you don't like that sorta stuff, this game might not be your cup of tea. When it comes to story and such, I almost don't know where to begin. The world in this game is really creative and unique (just the fact that it's more of a fantasy version of the Age of Discovery rather than medieval Europe is refreshing), your companions are all interesting characters (really felt like I was friends with most of them, rather than being their leader), and since it's an Obsidian game, there are some really delicious philosophical ponderings here and there. Special mention goes to all the different dialogue choices you can make, though. Instead of just being different solutions to quests and such, there are also plenty of options that exist solely for the sake of roleplaying, to further flesh out your character's motivations and so on. That's really neat.If there's one major gripe I have with this game, though, it's that pathfinding can be really rubbish sometimes. Seeing folks politely waiting behind their allies because they don't realise they could go around that guy in order to bludgeon someone is something that happens too often.Oh yeah, and you can get at least three cats and a piglet in this game (but you can't give them little hats or armors, which I hope will be remedied in a future expansion).

												9/10 +1 if you are looking for a game to scratch the BG2 itch. -1 if you don't like old school games.This is the best isometric cprg since BG2. It out does other recent ""old school"" rpgs on many fronts. PROS: Story, character creator, interface, tactical combat, inventory management, and rpg aspects are all very well done.   There is a lot of content here.CONS: Bugs in the initial release, poor path finding, long load times(in  a 2d game.  Why?), and some of the encounters feel like filler.  Note to designers: every step of every map doesn't need to be filled with hostile creatures. Also, no repsec options in a long game with several skill options as you level may be off putting to some.			"

												Having thrown myself against this game twice now I think it's safe to say it is not my cup of tea and while it is incredibly gauche to make comparisons, the most glaring flaw is that Pillars of Eternity isn't Baldur's Gate. Or even Neverwinter Nights for that matter.The ""D&D but not"" RPG system just feels so incredibly awkward in every single facet: the attributes are all jumbled up and different, there are a plethora of status effects that overlap but are often ineffectual and the spells/abilities are familiar but slightly shifted in some manner. The endurance/health system is garbage and seems to exist solely to justify enemies doing absurd damage because technically you have health that you can heal into. Just let them have 400 health and having healing act normally, there's nothing unique or useful about the endurance system.It's unfortunate that the gameplay and combat are so god awful because the worldbuilding and side characters are at least intriguing. The story isn't anything new but it's serviceable and works for the intention of establishing a new IP.If they didn't try so hard to make an alternate gaming system this could have been a decent game.

												I'd have loved to love this game. From the outside it looks just like I'd want a modern successor to the Baldur's Gate and the Planescape stlye of RPG to look. And indeed it's gorgeous. It looks and sounds just right. But I just can't seem to be able to play it right. I simply keep getting killed. On the easiest settings. Repeatedly. I can't make heads nor tails of the spells (most of them seem to buff some ability I've never read of by 0.5%) nor of the combat system in general. Which is a pity cause everything looks so great. But now, almost 10 hours into the game I don't think I've progressed further than discovering the first hints of what the plot would have been about. I mean, I can live with a low power level. But I'd far prefer my wizard to have a magic missile and my cleric to have a simple healing spell instead of just some obscure buffs or offensive debuffs. In my days the only buff we had was the Bless spell (and, seriously, who ever really used that one?)...I'll be deinstalling the game to free up HD space again, but I feel sorry that I'm missing out on what appears to be a great game for others. But it's just too complicated for me. And I *did* finish Planescape. Thrice.			"

												A truly incredible game, and a sign of what Obsidian does best; Write compelling stories.I can't recomend this game enough, I spent 40 hours playing it over a three day period and was thorougly fascinated every moment of it. It is everything an old school RPG should be. The combat system is versatile and challenging, the control system is fluid, the maps are beautiful, the story is mind-blowing in its depth, and the RPG elements are just wonderful to fiddle with.11/10 Would kickstart again.

												Most of the people I know who play CRPGs consider the Infinity Engine games like Baldur's Gate I & II, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, Fallout 1 & 2 (although they were not IE) to be the ""Golden Age"" of RPGs. It's been sort of downhill since. Oblivion & Skyrim were beautiful but sort of empty and in my opinion unplayable without mods. And many of the RPGs of the last 10 years forgot the RP part. Yes I'm talking about you Fallout 3, Dungeon Siege, etc.Well, RPG fans, if you loved and missed Baldur's Gate & Icewind Dale, you will LOVE Pillars of Eternity. It is everything that was good about them come again with a modern look and feel. The level of detail, atmosphere, design craft, and forethought that went into this game is amazing. It is beautiful to look at, interesting to play with compelling characters and deep dialouge trees that really let you role play and tease the details of the story out.The game play is not perfect. And for those not used to the IE style of play might have some trouble getting used to it at first, but you will quickly master it. This is not Dragon Age, they won't ram the plot down your throat you have to work for it. Talk to people. It is not an Elder Scrolls game with unlimited exploration over a world that turns out to be sort of empty and after a while all looks the same. Each area in PoE is smaller but alive with activity. Give this a try. If you've never played the old IE games after this you'll want to. If you have and loved them, this is the game you have been waiting for for years.			"

												Pillars of Eternity is the type of RPG that can keep you on the character creation screen for hours. The moment to moment gameplay of Pillars is unlikely to surprise you if you've been following the revival of the CRPG genre through Kickstarter. You'll go on quests and slay dragons, and once your potentially 100 hour journey is complete you'll have read a couple novel's worth of text. Unfortunately the text is the superior half of the game; although some small improvements have been made to the CRPG formula a lot of its systems feel like they come right out of 1999.  Micromanagement is the name of the game here. Each member of your 6 person party can come equipped with what feels like dozens of spells. Every encounter is a test of both skill and patience if you plan on using your party members effectively. The game features a pause button for those who want to make the most out of all of their fighters, but I found this to chop up the combat and turn fights into a chore. I struggle to find a reason why the game uses real time combat at all, a turn based system like the one found in Pillars' Kickstarted cousin, Divinity: Original Sin, would feel more apt here. If you're like me you'll opt to push the difficulty down to ""Story Time"" in order to breeze through combat and allow yourself to experience everything else the game has to offer.The combat system in place doesn't use Dungeons and Dragon's ruleset, but that was near impossible to tell as an outsider. Characters hitting and missing are determined by dice rolls that are weighed by their statistics. If you love deciding whether you want the chest piece with 12 Resolve but lower Athleticism then you'll love min-maxing all of your character's loadouts, but I found the games ruleset to be a bit complex for my tastes. I much prefer when I have a great amount of choice in how I want my characters to perform not through small stat changes, but through large easy to comprehend choices; something akin to World of Warcraft's post 2010 talent system.Spells are handled on a ""per rest"" and ""per encounter"" system, where more powerful spells can only be used a limited amount of times until you get your characters back to an inn or campfire. Weaker spell are limited by how many times you can cast them in a given fight. Though this system will likely appeal to those who want to map out their descent into a dungeon, I found it really constricting and made me reluctant to use any of my character's cool abilities at all.Though my piece on the game doesn't look like a glowing recommendation so far, it was actually one of my favorite games of 2015. Though the clunky combat and complicated rules were large gripes of mine, that's where most of my issues with the game end. Pillars succeeds tremendously in nearly every other aspect, most importantly is how much it allowed for players to role play. Player agency in all aspects of the game was clearly a huge design philosophy for Obsidian, it's apparent from the moment you make your character. Your character's race, class, and background will influence the way other characters interact with you as well as opening up new dialogue options. Although all of this seems par the course, it's the superb writing that brings the role playing to life.Regardless of how you allocate your stat points, your character will be a Watcher: a person who can look into the soul of others. Though this gift starts as but a faint whisper, you will eventually be able to read the intentions of others that you talk to as well as manipulate their soul. Souls end up being a driving force of the plot of the game as well. You will hear from many a townsfolk about ""Waidwen's Legacy"", a supposed curse that prevents newborn children from being born with souls and are instead born as hollow shells. The matter of souls also ties into the games many religious themes. The in-game deities play a large role in the game's world and you'll find yourself opening your codex to refresh yourself on them many times. Understanding each of the provinces' deities as well as the gods of your followers is important to understanding the plot as well as the world's history. Religious themes in art can occasionally turn off people but the game's messages about religion are handled with grace and don't come off as overly preachy.The characters you'll meet on your adventure are layered and complicated, specifically your party members. Out of the eight total companions  in the base game I only found one to be boring, but even as the weakest of the bunch she's more compelling than most characters in other big budget role playing games. Each companion has their own personal quest that could have been a game of its own. You'll definitely want to pursue these quests as they contain a bulk of the characterization in the game, which is arguably the titles' strongest point. I found most of the quests to be an emotional roller coaster, some ending in tremendous highs and others ending in crushing lows. What's important to note about these mini stories is your ability to steer them. Your action, or sometimes inaction, will change the way that these plots unfold. After I finished my first playthrough of the game I was anxious to start all over and play in a whole new way.Occasionally the game will break away into ""choose your own adventure book"" style sequences. These sequences will require you to choose actions, frequently based on the type of character you play, in order to push the scene forward. Sometimes they are short scenes that have you jumping over a large gap, or longer sequences that require multiple inputs such as climbing a cliff while being pursued by enemies. These sequences were a great addition to the game that helped break up the standard action, I only wish there were more of them.The game isn't only combat and dialogue however, you'll obviously also spend a lot of time exploring the games rich and detailed world. The game doesn't take place in one large open world but rather in a bunch of smaller zones connected by load screens. Each self contained zone is dense with people, both friend and foe, that you can interact with. One zone in particular that you'll stumble across early on is your stronghold. The stronghold is a base-building side quest you can do for some small bonuses. The lore of the stronghold was compelling as you learn more about its previous owner and delve deeper into the labyrinth that exists underneath it, but unfortunately the same can't be said for the gameplay. It's a Farmville style upgrading system where you pump resources into your base and wait in-game days for the next upgrade to be pursued. Thankfully the bonuses you get from doing the stronghold are minor, so it can easily be ignored while you pursue other quests.The visual and sound design are magnificent. Hand painted backgrounds are a joy to walk through and the music feels like it would be right at home as the background to Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately, character models clash with the rest of the games aesthetic and appear far older than the world their contained in.Despite my qualms with its clunky combat, Pillars of Eternity was an amazing role playing experience with a fantastic world and equally fantastic characters. It's an easy recommendation to anyone who enjoys the CRPG style of game. The future is bright for Obsidian's own IP and I can't wait to see what they have in store for us next.			"

												This may turn into a somewhat lengthy review, so if you don't wanna read all that sh#t here's the bottom line first: This game is boring. There, I said it. First of all, let me say that I've been anticipating this game for about 2 years, having been a huge fan of the Baldur's Gate series for many years before that. This isn't a case of the concept being new to me, or that I was expecting an action game. It's not even a bad game. If you're genuinely enjoying this game I'm not here to tell you that you shouldn't. I will share with you, however, why I'm not thrilled. I have probably spent half of my entire gaming life in the BG series. After playing it so much, and having watched it age, it has become apparent that there are many aspects of the game that could be improved upon. When I think ""spiritual succesor to Baldur's Gate released in 2015"" I get certain expectations. Expectations I feel were not met.Foremost of all, is that the game is flat out boring. The game fails to create an interesting or immersive world. Too much of the game is presented in written form (i.e. prepare to read a LOT.) I can't say I have a problem with reading, but I found myself being bored often while reading what the game was serving up. I always felt like I was playing a game; it never took me to another place in my mind. All the lore was standard and uninspired. I'd rather it were set in a classic world we know and love as opposed to this hollow one. It doesn't help that in Dialogue, you can't tell how much longer the latest uninteresting NPC is going to babble on for.Too much of the written content is either wholly unnecessary or could have been presented in a more interesting and visual way. Instead of giving me a mini essay to read on the appearance of the huge sharkwoman warrior, how about making the character models more interesting and expressive? i.e. SHOW me. **MINOR SPOILER: Another example, when Raedric was offering me the chance to join him, I had lost all interest in the ""story"" of the quest. All I had to go on was two characters giving speeches. I just wanted him to shut up and for this boring quest to be over. **Why did I travel all the way across to the other side of this room just to click on a magnifying glass and read ""Rats scurry in between the cracks of the stairs."" or something banal like that. The game is littered with these useless nothings. The look of the in-game world is bland and uninteresting to me. It reminds me of a cross between Diablo 2 and Icewind Dale 2 in terms of atmosphere. I was never a fan of those games, precisely because they felt ""lifeless"" to me. Character appearance customization is something RPG gamers typically enjoy. Too many games fail to give us the fun we seek in this regard. The Infinity engine games failed, and so does Pillars.Speaking of a lack of improvements: All my old frustrations are still there. Namely characters getting in each other's way during combat, small and claustrophobic areas making for messy gameplay, poor selection of roleplaying options, etc.  In a visually appealing sense, there is very little upgrade from the old Infinity Engine games. Yes, the graphics are ""better."" More advanced, smoother. Water looks nice. But there's nothing that's done really well. In a lot of ways, Pillars of Eternity feels like an old game. That's not necessarily a bad thing, I just think there's actually better old games out there. Games that managed to create a visually appealing environment despite graphical limitations. One thing games like this always seem to fail in is visual presentation of populated areas. NPCs look particularly stiff (notice there isn't a single patron in the Gilded Vale tavern that's sitting down? WTF?). Oh and the choreographed movement of your party... ugh that's gross! Baldur's Gate actually did it quite well for the time. NPC models seemed more organic. I remember how alive the actual city of Baldur's Gate felt when I was exploring it for the first time. In this, and many other aspects, Baldur's Gate left a lot to the imagination. But it stimulated the imagination and took it in specific directions. Pillars on the other hand, is just dull. Or maybe I'm just getting old and not so easily amused any more. There's plenty I find frustrating with the in game mechanics too. Like why can't I use stealth with just one party member? Why is my whole party stealthed? What's the purpose of making the entire party move slower when stealthed? As a seasoned BG player I thought the game mechanics would be fairly intuitive for me, but I haven't been able to figure out the stealth system or some of the decisions that went into making it. I remember in an interview one of the devs was very enthused about how all the stats would actually matter and be helpful now, and how it would allow for unexpected and interesting character builds. Well, to be fair, the first part of that is kinda true. All the stats matter in certain ways now, which is nice. But I tried to make a smart and wise barbarian the first time I loaded up. Let's just say I had to restart the game. What's the purpose of limiting your party to 2 sets of camping supplies? All it does is make the game less fun for me. The party NPCs are just not memorable. Granted, I haven't got very far in their individual quests yet...but here's the thing: I don't really care to either. Baldur's Gate had memorable NPCs that oozed personality. I could go on but I think that's enough. I may end up finishing the game and putting a lot of hours into it. But that's only because I've waited a long time and there's nothing better. I've had some decent fun on it too, but my initial excitement has waned.			"

												As you can see from my hours played I tried greatly to enjoy this game.  Whilst this game attempts to harken back to the ""good ole days"" of Baldur's Gate and other isometric crpgs, Pillars of Eternity feels bland and suffers from some major game breaking bugs cropping up in each patch cycle.With each patch cycle Obsidian makes changes to the stat, ability and buff/debuff mechanics in what is an already convoluted system, not to mention the myriad of bugs that such a cycle brings.   Having to thoroughly read through patch notes to understand what over-the-top changes have been made can be frustrating.  Obsidian also seems to make changes to mechanics and systems that work fine whilst seemingly ignoring broken classes and abilties. The combat becomes tedious very quickly, usually involving bottling up your adversaries in a choke point and autoattacking them until dead.  When you do decide to use spells or abilities you will quickly find that a majority of them are completely useless, whilst those that cause stun or knockdowns to be king.   At those times that you are unable to keep your enemy hemmed in, you will find those carefully crafted tank characters will be next to useless in keeping the enemies of your squishy damage dealers.  The fault here is with the poorly implemented engagement system.  A tank has the ability to 'engage' an enemy and should that enemy leave the area from the tank they will take a hit.  Of course this hit does nothing to actually stop an enemy from casually walking over and making paste of your rogue or wizard.   I won't detail the number of enemy creatures in this game that can just bypass the engagement system by teleporting straight into your group's back ranks and perma-stunning or killing them in two or three hits.  This problem has only gotten worse with the new expansion.The itemization for character equipment is dull.  After a lengthy dungeon crawl of tedious fights to find items that are mostly yawn worthy was very disappointing.The writing in the game seems to peak and trough.  The companions and their storylines seem to vary from interesting to just mind numbling boring.  The lore itself comes at your thick and fast with exposition upon exposition though with the latter it takes too many liberties by assuming you already know some hidden but integral world lore.  This can affect your conversation choices, though admittedly that is not a big deal as your choices in the end really mean nothing.  The authors are telling a story and be damned if you are going to have really influence on how that is going to be told.On a few positive notes the graphics are very good and I absolutely adore the music.  Many times during my day I've caught myself humming the music from the game.If you want to try the game, do so!  Just wait until it is on sale.  The price for non backers is astounding when you compare it other rpg styles games released in the same time that offer a whole lot more.			"

												After taking a long break from this game and reflecting on it I finally came to the conclusion that it is just not that good. At least I cannot summon the will to even go back and play it to the end. It kind of pains me to say this because there is clearly the intention for a good game here and a lot of the base is there and I really liked the Baldur's Gate series which this game is kind of a spiritual successor to. It comes down to some really big major flaws which are mostly the result of some bad design decisions, even though they had the best intentions at heart I'm sure: The concept of ""souls"" in the story is interesting but doesn't really work for me. No one ever really dies in this world, as their soul doesn't get lost. People are just reborn. Ordinary people don't remember their previous lives. The problem with this concept, however, is that everyone in this world knows about this as a fact. To me, thinking it through, this would mean that everyone kind of loses his or her fear of death. Death becomes almost meaningless. You will never really die, so why worry? Why worry about this monster or that plague or anything really? It removes a lot of tension from the world and as a consequence, from the story in my opinion. No (direct) XP for killing monsters. By itself an interesting idea but then they don't really use this opportunity and place less boring encounters in the game. instead the player has to fight trash mobs after trash mobs (the optional super dungeon is especially bad in this regard). I was so bored of the combat after a short while. Too many skills and abilities in combat. In most fights you maybe use 1/10 of your skills (after gaining a few levels). Or I felt just overwhelmed by choice. Sure, using 10 different per-encounter abilities would make the victory even easier but it becomes really tedious and unnecessary. Usually I forgot to even use the abilities of my chanter when they became ready. Then there are so many effects, buffs, bonuses, debuffs going on, it kinda loses all meaning. The character stat system is just bad. Flat out bad. While I appreciate the intention of the designer to make any character build viable, it makes every character kind of the same. Characters lose their definition, their outline/contour. For Example: In other RPGs you have say ""Strength"". A char with high strength you can imagine that this guy packs a punch. Is a melee warrior, etc. A mage won't probably be very strong because he doesn't need the physical fitness so he will have rather low strength. Now take the closest equivalent in Pillars of Eternity ""Might"": The description says ""Might represents a character's physical and spiritual strength, brute force as well as their ability to channel powerful magic."" The result of that is that you can have a warrior with high Might (like the strength example) but also a mage with high Might who is also weakling. From the ""Might"" perspective, both chars are the same. At best, everyone should have high Might. Another problem with that stat system is that it gets kind of vague what these stats actually mean, especially in the context of combat. The ""camping supply"" system doesn't really solve the issues of the rest systems from older games as you can always easily fast travel out of a dungeon and get more supplies. "

												Excellent game! Combat is very well-structured, great gameplay and interesting story - though it could have a bit more depth. I was hooked after one hour of playing. Unfortunately it seems to have limited replay potential save for expansions. Once I buy the WM 1-2 I`ll definitely take it on again!I also wish that there were more NPCs or that their quests had greater depth - like those of NWN.All in all, best BG-like game I`ve played in a long time. Looking forward to PoE II!			"

												It had a really rocky/lackluster/disappointing start but with the patches and the additions to vanilla game with the expansions, right now game is really good.In the first 5 hours or so both the setting and story looks so generic and boring but when the ""prologue"" ends it really picks up and the end of the game is great. A lot of really good writing in the game. Just dont read the memories of any of the random/backer npcs, full of edgy and juvenile writing. Same goes for the tombstones.Visuals are great, really looks like a modern Infinity Engine game. Soundtrack is great too even though it gets a bit repetitive, especially the combat music.It has enough content to last for around 70 hours for a single playthrough if you dont skip quests. With expansions, it goes well over 100.Combat is the weakest part of the game and if you want to enjoy the story, quests, and characters I suggest you to play in easy or story mode just so that you can finish combat quickly. But I have to say there are couple of boss fights that are really enjoyable, but only a couple unfortunately.There is also the stronghold mechanic, on paper it sounds really nice but as you play the game you can easily notice that the devs couldnt finish their plans for it on time. With patches it got some nice upgrades and sidequests, but its still not complete.			"

												First of all, I have put around 45 hours on this game, most of the time on the offline mode. And I'm planning to halt my gameplay with this game until I get my hands on The White March. I'm on the middle of Act II as of now, but since the constantly stellar experience that I have since I start my journey, I have a clear picture of what I think about this amazing game. Pillars of Eternity is an isometric CRPG, devveloped by Obsidian, the same studio who made Fallout New Vegas, Knights of  the Old Republic 2, and Neverwinter Nights 2 (among others). If you have played, one of their game, you already know what to expect. Yes, a deep RPG mechanic, with excellent writing, reactive world, and freedom of action to bend the world as you will. Give Obsidian freedom, free from the existing storyline, gameplay mechanic from previous game (since they usually make sequels), and ""pushy"" publisher, and what do you get? It's Pillars of Eternity, an excellent game, made from scratch, with no ""restriction"" whatsoever, It feels like a game that Obsidian was itching to make from the start, a well realized, polished, ambitious, and nostalgia-fueled (for the better). It's Obsidian's best work so far, at least for me. Let's get more in depth to the individual aspect of this game. Story Rich, engaging, moving, and intriquing lore with believable characters. Coupled with a brilliantly written texts and dialogues. A very well paced story where the mystery, back story, and overall lore are slowly revealed over time. Every thing is revealed in the right place, right time, and right amount of it, making the story progression feels ever so intriguing and natural.  A ton of equally superb side quest, that adds even more interesting story behind the land of Eora, and especially Dyrwood, with twist and turns along the way, making it a really great read.GameplayIt's an isometric CRPG, akin to Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, if you're into those kind of games, you will be feel right at home. It's a deep modern RPG, something that has been lost for a decade. An RPG where the number matters, every aspect of the stats matters, and when you're trying to be a jack-of-all-trades, the game will punish you. Not that it's not achieveable though, in fact PoE offers a myriad of different ways to solve a quest. Stealth, frontal assault, backdoor assault, sweet talking, being diplomatc, deceit, it's your choice. And no, you don't get XP from combat, that shows that Obsidian wants you to know that combat can be avoided. One of the most praise-worthy thing to note on PoE is how it can streamline a complex RPG rule set and mechanic by giving a more straightforward explanation and neat, customizable UI. Both a simplified information of each aspect of the game and an extensive, more detailed manual are there for you to read and learn, in addition of a very customizable difficulty settings.The depth of this game can be seen even right on the character creation. You get to choose the race, class, birth place, background, and belief/motivation. Each with their own play style, advantage-disadvantage, and special abilties that you can mix and match ranging from the tried and true formula to the experimental one. My first character only lasts 2 hours because I underestimate the importance of those, and ended in an unsatisfying note, the second time (my current one), I  spent around 1 hour, reading back and forth the manual. and learning all those stats, so I can create a character that fits my play style. The combat is a blend between real time and ""turn-based"". Well, technically it's a real time one where you can pause anytime to issue command to your party. It's the perfect gameplay mechanic for this game where it can show both the complexity and chaotic nature of PoE. Use trap, ambush, sneak attack, and pretty much everything, PoE has multiple ways to deal with your foes. Dealing multiple effects to the enemy even before combat, you can paralyze, sicken, burn, stuck, frightened a single target, yes, poor lad. It has a flexible rule, and doesn't hold back as long as it's still in the realm of it's rule set. And then there's the party system. The mechanic itself is your standard party system, up to 6 party members where you can recruit and dismiss. One thing that set it apart is the amazing back story, and personal side quest for each character, and the fact that they are so well crafted, that no one is overpowering anyone, they're diverse, but equal.. Add unique personality, funny banter every once in a while, you'll get a set of memorable and entertaining party system. Oh, and you can customize your own party, like Icewind Dale, where you can fully determine how they looks, their background, role, and their set of skills. They are not as interesting as the pre determined ones, but still a very nice addition if you want to have a complete freedom of how you play the game. Stronghold is a great feature, though underdeveloped. There's nothing better than seeing your stronghold grow from a haunted ruin to a place where you can rest, hire adventurers, trading outpost, and a safe haven for travellers. But it's nothing more than that, except the mysterious mega dungeon below it. By the time I write this review, the 3.0 patch is released, and it contains improvement on the Stronghold mechanic. This is one of the section where I will revise in the future, So yeah, there's that for the momen.GraphicArt direction, art style, atmosphere, and level design over polycount and how detailed the grass looks, anytime, any day. Graphically, if you mean graphic by the latter, Pillars of Eternity looks dated, OK-ish, IF you do a close up to the character, so does the animation. But, who plays this game on close ups? Pillars of Eternity (and traditional RPG in general) is meant to be played in a farther camera position, widen your field of view, and seeing the beautiful scenery that Obsidian has created. Ah yes, I can't get enough of the scenery, it's an excellently made interactive painting. Every place has their own feels, atmosphere, and personality, strong enough that you know what's going on in that particular place. Creating a world, that is both beautiful when it described on text with a visual representation that can match, and complment it.SoundIt's one of those games that  has an OST which are so great that I care to listen it on YT or through the game files afterwards. The voice acting is also top notch, when there is one. And the effect sounds are great too. It's all around a fine one.OverallPillars of Eternity is a  must have for anyone looking for a ""traditional"", 90's RPG, that is modernized and streamlined in all the right way. It's deep, unforgiving, rewarding, immersive, and intense. A brilliant writing, solid mechanic, an art style that has a lot of personality on it, reactive world where your choice really matters, even if it's just a minor one, side quests that has variety, quality, and quantity, and flexible mechanic that give the player a lot of play style choices, in which you can find a lot of replay value in this one.

												It is with a very heavy heart that I give this game a thumbs down. I grew up with a fawning adoration of Obsidian's predecessors, and some of the studio's other titles rank among my favorite games. As a young adult, their office building was literally visible from my window, and I had high hopes and aspirations to join and work among them, though that did not pan out. Until recently, I had regarded Obsidian as nearly unequaled masters of their craft.That's why I found it so surprising when I found myself so bored that I never finished my first playthrough, and put the game down for some time. I was disappointed, both in Obsidian and that I'd kickstarted the thing. I recently have finally set down and finished both the original game and the White March expansion, but it again got pretty tedious, and it took a very forced effort.The gameplay is a purposeful homage to many of the classic Infinity Engine games of old, and it was very true to this. 2D isometric (though frequently gorgeous), you manage a party of six heroes, including yourself as the distinguished primary PC. The mechanics are D&D-but-not; they feel deceptively like somebody's house rules, though they're actually just dissimilar enough to be a problem. Examples include odd, unanticipated quirks to attribute function, such as that barbarians benefit strongly from having a high Intellect and your blaster wizard really wants a lot of Might.Combat is real-time-with-pause, as in its spiritual predecessors, and it was one of the many elements of the game that proved to be a real chore after a while. Combat actions tick by pretty quickly, even with the slow time option active, and micromanaging six characters tends to mean that you're only going to be advancing a few seconds at a time before you need pause and manage them again. If you don't like micromanagement, there is an AI available, but for most classes I found it pretty dreadful, routinely positioning characters suicidally and declining to ever use certain core abilities. The silver lining is that few encounters are ever truly challenging, and so less-than-ideal performance just means more regular nigh-costless rests and trips back to town.You will come to resent those return trips, though. The game's maps may be beautiful, but the loading time on each zone is staggering, 10-15 seconds each on my modern machine while running an SSD install. When you're looking at 3-5 transitions to go recover, you *will* get irritable after a while.Inventory management is also a staggering slog. It has been long enough that I do not remember quite how bad it might have been in the old IE games, but here, every enemy has loot, the vast, vast majority of which is useless. You get tons of monster and crafting parts you'll never use, and every human opponent leaves you their regular, boring old sword. Around a third of the way through the game, I stopped bothering to even sell most of this junk, as you find more incidental cash than you ever need either, in large part because you never need to buy anything. By the end of the game, I had some 50+ 'unique', legendary, named weapons, which were mostly indistinct and uninteresting to choose between. The White March expansion added 'soulbound' items, which progress and evolve in response to certain triggers, some of them boring (do X total damage with this weapon), and sometimes a bit more compelling (sleep with this weapon in the den of a dragon). These are pretty neat, but you get to them quite late, and yours may have already become permanently glazed trying to compare the morass of mundane 'epic' items you'd have hoarded up to that point.I found the world compelling. It is D&D-esque at its base, with your standard various basically-still-human fantasy race, ancient but advanced fallen precursor civilization, feudal-Renaissance sociopolitical structures struggling with one another, a pantheon of archetypal Involved deities, and so on. What makes the setup a bit more novel is the emphasis on souls; reincarnation is a thing, as is awakening the memories of past lives. A modern science is developing around the treatment of soul-related afflictions, such as the trauma of resurfaced memories informing you that you were a right vile *♥♥♥♥♥♥♥* in a previous life, as well as the manipulation and detachment/reattachment of souls. This practice is viewed with both great skepticism and superstition, and yet it might be the only hope for a crisis that the region the game is set in has been suffering from for the last decade: the vast majority of children are being born soulless, effectively comatose. This is some offbeat stuff, and I found the more the game focused on it, the more engrossed that I was. Unfortunately, I found this goodness spread far too thinly between far too many tedious 'adventuring'.In the final act, the game's writing veers wildly off course. Sparing details, there is an 11th hour twist that explains a great deal about the world, the primary antagonist, his motivations and his actions, and it opens a lot of interesting questions... absolutely none of which are pointed out by the game. Instead, the PC spends the remaining hour in a crazed freakout over something that would seem trite in Philosophy 101. I got the odd impression that the fact of this final revelation and the dialog and interactions of its aftermath were written by two very different people, with very different takes on what it meant, though I'm not sure if that was the case.With apologies to my beloved Obsidian, given the price of completing this game, both in dollar and hours, I cannot in good conscience recommend it. The return on investment, both in terms of novel gameplay and moving, effective storytelling, is just too low. Go play New Vegas or something, instead.			"

Unbelievable.  Clearly they stopped fixing bugs and just chugged out the next expansion.Check the forums before you buy.  Filled with bug complaints even now.			"

												A faithful continuation of the storied legacy of Infinity Engine RPGs. Makes smart changes to the gameplay while maintaining the overall feel of the system (with the sole exception of Disengage attacks, which are a bit broken.).Characters are written pretty well, though you'll quickly learn to avoid headstones and gold-name NPCS, which are written by backers and completely irrelevant to everything. Otherwise, the plot is quite solid-- not the best writing in all video games, but certainly good.Mechanically, the game stays pretty solid throughout, but there are some nasty difficulty spikes. Some, like secret dragon bosses, are fine-- they're optional, after all. However, I was annoyed by the large jump in difficulty that the final boss presents. I had to lower the difficulty to beat the game after a frustrating hour and a half of failed attempts-- whether that's a testament to my skill or the game's difficulty curve is up to you to decide. It really put a damper on the endgame in my opinion.I haven't played the DLC, so I can't speak to its quality. Overall, though, I greatly enjoyed my time with the game.			"

												The writing is voluminous but says little, almost as if crafted by an accomplished wordsmith who lacked a story to tell.The world is reasonably large, but I couldn't get attached to it.  Despite the verdant outdoor maps, everything in this story feels beyond dead.  There is no joy of life.  I'm sure they were going for this, but that does not make it a good thing to put in a game.The characters talk a lot but, with the exceptions of Sagani and Eder, aren't likable.   You won't find an Imoen, Minsc, or Keldorn here.The combat system attempts to copy the mechanics of Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale... and for functionality it might have made a good clone.  Somehow, it lost the soul of those games in the attempt.I don't know.  I can't really put my finger on the exact problem with this game.  It just didn't live up to its lofty goals of providing something like those great late-90s D&D games.  Skip it.  If you need a party-based RPG, I'd suggest Divinity: Original Sin instead.			"

												TL;DRIsometric party-based story-driven RPG with a real-time DnD-esque combat system.+ Entertaining and original story, backed up by well-written characters+ Rewarding and enjoyable combat+ Player character has significant impact on the world++++ Can have cats as pets-  Long loading screens-  Some in game bugs (one or two major, few minor)-  Sometimes ambiguous regarding instructions So I bought this game a few months ago when it was on sale. Played an hour or so but game felt very slow at start. Even after starting a new character about 2 months ago, the start still felt rather sluggish. But once I got past this stage, I didn't put the game down until it was completed and Pillars of Eternity is now one of my favorite games. Looking back, I can safely tell you that the first hour or so isn't representative for the rest of the game.Pillars of Eternity has a captivating and interesting story that unravels successively throughout the game. There is  a lot  of lore for a completely original universe- completing the main questline will give you a decent overview of the story itself, but exploring the numerous locations of the world map, completing subquests and generally just talking with NPCs will reward you with further, optional details. This is good for letting you set your own pace. The companions who accompany your character along the way are all diverse and, in my opinion, adds a lot of deph to the game. These characters have their own backstories and may interact with the player character during specific events. The player character has a significant impact on the story, shaping it differently depending on the choices they make and impacts the nature of interactions based on their chosen character traits, as it should be in a respectable RPG.  The voice acting in this game is brilliant, but some parts of the game isn't covered by it which is a real shame. The combat encounters are quite overwhelming in the beginning and will take a few tries before getting the hang of it (depending on one's previous experience with DnD combat systems). It's possible to change difficulties while in game if one wishes to change the weight of combat and focus more on the story, but worth noting is that this game will be challenging for some even on the easiest difficulty. The game offers several (eleven) playable classes with their own spells and playstyle, allowing for a lot of variety. Party composition is quite important here, but is pretty well covered by your companions. Even more composition options are offered by recruiting customizable adventurers from any inn. All in all, combat is challenging but is enjoyable once you get the hang of it!In conclusion, a very good and enjoyable RPG experience with challenging nuanced combat.			"

												Baldur's Gate I & II are huge shoes to fill, but the ol' timers did a great job of it.  I love this game.  I'm gonna start with the negatives, but mind you these are critiques coming from a caring family member, not a nagging spouse.  And the source for a lot of this is me being Baldur's Gate #1 fan, so... yeah.The :( At times it feels a little combat-heavy, but that might be because I obsessively explore every little cranny and categorically slay anything with a red circle underneath it. Things are streamlined quite a bit compared to BG (much like Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition was compared to previous versions).  It's also a positive, but the negative is, well, as awesome as it is to magically throw a battalion's worth of equipment into your stash throughout a long day of wholesale slaughter, and as convenient as it is to sleep off 500+ damage around what must be one magic campfire, it does tap a little bit on the fourth wall. And the 4th Edition style Per Encounter abilities are a little silly :\ (This is really about me not liking 4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons).  And the ranger's animal companion can't die (only get knocked out), so I have to roleplay him off as a crazy dog whose nickname is Lucky. The biggest one: PoE doesn't *quite* reach the level of character inspiration that Baldur's Gate had.  I think the voice acting is almost as good, for the most part (and still far, far, far above average), but there's not much of the miniature-giant-space-hamster, Ned (forgot his name) repeatedly talking to you and thanking you for not throwing rocks at him, Jaheira's ""Yyess, oh omni-present authority figure?"", Jan Jonson's ""Don't forget to raaise meee"" sense of humor that BG had.  It also has the misfortune of trying to follow Jon Irenicus from BG II, who was an extremely class villain.  Though this villain does have his moments.  And I do have a man-crush on Eder.The :) It has that immersive, deep, playing-a-good-book feel that Baldur's Gate (and all great RPG's) have.  I haven't reached the end yet, but it's all satisfyingly epic so far (just started Act III), and there are a few dialogue choices I find legitimately hard to choose between. Your actions have a little more effect on the world and how people treat you than most games of this type, which is really nice and further helps the immersion. The keep is really fun to have.  Even though I make a tremendous amount more on selling equipment than collecting taxes, and it's largely aesthetic, I really like having it. Though mostly a negative for me, I suppose there are benefits to the changes made for simplicity's sake (4th Edition stuff), such as not having to spend time prioritizing inventory space. It gets kinda dark at times, in a good way. There are a lot of neat-looking places.  I miss BG II's aesthetic a bit, but still, there are lots of areas and they all look nice. Soundtrack's pretty good, which is very important to me. Already thinking about the next playthrough. Just to fit in one more BG comment (take a drink): I think Pillars of Eternity would be my favorite RPG if it weren't for Baldur's Gate II.Have fun!  No-one's going to read this haha.			"

												OMG! OMG!Ok... so after Black Isle went down, and everyone who loved Baldur's Gate cried cuz if there ever would be a BG3, itd probably suck because Black Isle didnt make it... your prayers have been answered.Its awesome. It has lots of text with just enough voice that it keeps it interesting, rich descriptions and dialogue. Its not dumbed down for people who are afraid of reading and want everything spoon fed to them. Its Baldur's Gate if Baldur's Gate had come out in 2015.The game UI and mechanics will feel like putting on your favorite comfy sweatshirt to Infinity Engine veterans, and even to newcomers, the mechanics are intuitive. I cant say enough good thing about this game beyond many of us have waited alomost 20 years to see it made.			"

												Do I recommend this game? Actually... kind of. Not fully recommend it but it's not bad either.I don't own the DLCs but I finished the story for the vanilla game. None of the companions are memorable. The game's lore may be great but for some reason the story of this game isn't gripping at all. Maybe it's the execution. It starts out good but in the middle it runs out of steam. It's like the game is more interested in telling you its lore more than its story. Near the end you get to talk to someone and she'll dump a boatload of information on you that could've been made into a chapter in itself.I don't particularly hate reading in games but I got tired of it near the end of this game. On the first parts it's Baldur's Gate II quality but afterwards it's like they ran out of money so they just finished the plot thru text. Imagine watching a good movie but on its climax it just displays everything in text for you to read. It felt that way to me.Update=====On my third playthrough I'm beginning to appreciate the world and the story more. The problem with games like this is in order to trully get engrossed with the story one has to know the lore first. On the first playthroughs seeing weird new words, names of gods, etc. just jumbles everything so it's very hard to follow the story.Now that I instantly know what ""glanfathans"" or ""engwithans"" mean, or know who the heck Magran or Eothas or Woedica is I could just read or play without things going over my head. Now I'm actually enjoying this game.My feelings for the last act stay the same, it still felt rushed on my second playthrough, but it actually felt fun compared to my first. Now I just started with a new character and seeing the details pop out on the flashbacks or the meres, it's wow. Even if practically nothing changes in the game on different playthroughs except your main character this games gets better when replayed.On a different note I hope Obsidian add more to their other game Tyranny. I really want to play that too but based on reviews I see around it's ending feels even more rushed than PoE. It seems like Obsidian always has games that have great stories but they just keep running out of money so their games have always been notoriously buggy on release and, tadah, have rushed final acts.

												I'm new to CRPG, but I have been gaming on commodore as a child up to RTS and FPS on PC and other consoles. So I believe I've got a great idea of a good game and this is a brilliant game! First off, the customisation of your character at the start is immense. Second, much like fable, Mass effect and other RPGs. Your words and choices mean something. But I believe PoE takes the choices to another level!Thirdly I am new to CRPG I have played other ones but found them rather unexcitable. I found for example Baldurs Gate Dark Allience far better then it's PC CRPG older version. Generally due to the PC CRPG version being rather confusing. But PoE is very simple! Also very difficult! It all depends on the difficulty you play the game on and if you enjoy reading the hints/explanations. ProsGraphics are brilliant, kind of old school with a more recent HD and flair touchSimple, but can, is challenging and complex 'abit contradictory but you will understand once you play the gameMusic and voices implimented are imersive and brilliantStorys throughout, even in side quests are amazing 'as far as I've played they have been' ConsI don't know if this will change but I'm finding the areas we can free roam to be medium sized rather than big? I might just be being picky here, but wanting a little more stuff to do within the roaming areas. But remember in this review I've only been playing for so many hours. So may change later on! Overall an amazing game! One of my best buys in such a long time! Couldn't be happier! 10/10 in my eyes!  "

												So I've played Baulder's Gate 1 before.  I'm a pretty big fan of oldschool RPG's and, although a recent release, this game really lives up to that classic feeling.  I'm finding it to be pretty flawless.The story/lore is some of the best I have ever experienced in any game.  I am completely immersed in the goings on, right down to reading the descriptions of every single item.  The voice acting is fantastic, and the script is well written.  The dialogue options really allow me to roleplay my character, as well as my other party members.The music of Pillars is mind blowing.  Sometimes RPG soundtracks can get a little old - but not this one!  It does what an OST should do - it works to really draw you into the game.  The last time that I encountered a soundtrack that did it this well was Skyrim and the Witcher 1.Combat is fun and varied.  All of the classes have well defined differences - and boy, there are a lot of classes!  I really enjoy the mage's spell system, and being able to learn spells from other (dead) mages.  Exploration is awesome, and finding hidden loot is even more awesome - especially since upgrades actually feel like upgrades in this game.Having a stronghold is SO COOL.  It's like Path of Exile's hideouts on steroids... plus it's really nice to see old party members being stationed there, ready for your beck and call.Finally, you really get what you pay for.  I'm 26 hours in and only just now beat act 1.  It's been a great time so far, and it only gets better the more I play.I'd really suggest picking this game up if you're a fan of oldschool RPG's, D&D, or really any pausable combat system RPG.  It's been totally worth the time I've invested in it, and I cherish sitting down to this game every night. "

												I love this game. Its a classic rpg in every sense of the word. You get a ton of different companions with their own side quests and personalities that will help you in and out of combat. If that's not enough you can even go to a inn and create a new adventurer to join your crew. You also get a castle to upgrade and maintain. Any followers that arent in your party are left at the castle where they can go on their own adventures without you.			"

												Pillars of Eternity is like a scrumptious hot fudge sundae made from the highest quality ingredients. It tastes good all the way through. Just don't expect your gustatory preferences to be expanded.PROSInfinity Engine graphics on steroids - Seriously, love the fog effects in the sea port.Great soundtrack - Especially in the first town. Basically, the music there made me want to hang myself in real life. Good thing I didn't.Magic - Interesting abilities that aren't locked to an existing ruleset like D&D. I can chant a drake into existence! Every  battle!Party Characters - All of the characters have interesting back stories and are voice acted wellCONS Plot - I found the overarching plot to be pretty dull, especially in Act III.Melee Weak - Seriously, melee characters are nowhere as powerful as magic users. I kind of wish there was better parity.8/10 - Would listen to Durance refer to everything in his life as a fiery ♥♥♥♥♥ again.			"

												Baldur's Gate 9/10PoE 7/10Finally!I heard about this game in 2012. Now it is finally released.PoE is a trip down the memory lane. I am an old guy and have been waiting 15 years for something like this to happen. I am a big rpg fan, have been playing tabletop and lots of crpg's. So should you get this game. Did you ever play Baldur's Gate? Did you like it? Then get this!!Obsidian pitched this game as a spiritual successor of the old IE games (Baldur's Gate) and it is. The rules are different, as this is NOT D&D. But the feel, the mood, the sound and even the graphics (though very updated, it's been 15 years) reminds me so much of the good old days.That beeing said the game is not flawless. But I have been playing 15 hours with no major bugs. There are many small bugs though, but compared to other releases. it is running quite smooth... Even on my old machine (but I do have problems on the big maps, and with loading screen time)If I should warn ppl about anything, it would be the differences from the old IE games. Yes there are many. The things that I personally find a little strange: *The game is build with Unity, I would have preferred Obsidians own engine. Unity have ALOT of performance issues...*No ammunition. I miss this from IE.*Can't costumize your char in-game. Very bad. Not even change the portrait or voice!! (fixed in patch1.05)*Stash (like your bag of holding) can't be sorted... (also fixed)*Some npc's that join you are REALLY weak*False options in dialogue.*Un-necessary hand-holding*Most chars you can build, are perhaps too similair. I have to play more, thoughI am waiting for Obsidian to release their first patch, and that will hopefully take care of most of the problems. It is certainly their best release ever ...ADDED: So, now that I've played through this, I must also warn about a mediacroe story, and this is not very replayable... There is still some issues with UNITY, that engine is really hard on your CPU, and I guess I am dissappointed in the minimum specs, that kept going up, my PC was brandnew when I bought this (pre) and I can hardly make it run smooth...

												This game has a LOT OF TEXT to read. Let's just get that out of the way, right now. Many NPCs, especially party members, have much of their dialogue recorded as voiceovers, but even significant amounts of that is only available as text.Now then:Pillars of Eternity is the spiritual successor to games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, and such.It is a top-down, pauseable, party-based tactical fantasy RPG with heavy influences from Dungeons and Dragons; however, unlike its inspirations it doesn't actually utilize a modified DnD system.This game does have its quirks and quibbles, and it isn't perfect, but as an avid fan of Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, this game is right up my alley.NPCs have a LOT to say, but much of that is completely optional, and text you aren't interested in or have seen before can be easily skipped with the spacebar. The storytelling in general is pretty interesting, and there is lots of secondary lore you can find in the form of books and papers as well as just delving deep into conversation options and the game's built in ""Cyclopedia"".Combat is HIGHLY dependent on positioning, tactics, and at least a moderate amount of planning, even on the 2nd-easiest difficulty. Which itself is still quite challenging for some encounters, although there's plenty of more difficult options for masochists.Fights are typically over fairly quickly if you make a critical error or are simply outgunned, but retrying it with proper tactics can make a world of difference.You will have to ""micromanage"" your party in combat, although there is a rudimentary and fairly simple ""AI"" feature you can utilize if you want. But given the immense importance of positioning and tactics in this game, directing one's party in combat doesn't feel like a chore or micromanagement, really. You will have plenty to do and your decisions are very important.Overall, I am enjoying it greatly on the ""Normal"" difficulty so far. I haven't yet run into a fight I couldn't win through subtlety, planning, and shifting my tactics, but most ""boss"" type encounters will test your knowledge and abilities to the point that you may need to restart a time or two. Save your game often!This game is excellent and definitely recaptures that ""oldschool computer RPG"" feel, while bringing some more modern features to the table. The in-game encyclopedia in particular, as well as the extensive in-game tooltips--complete with ""wiki"" style internal links, can shed a great deal of light on otherwise obscure mechanics.Obsidian (who were also the brains behind Fallout: New Vegas by the way) did an excellent job.

												When I played another old-school game Divinity: Original Sin I didn't like it. Because after first city the game becomes boring. So I was afraid is this about all old-school games? Of course not. And Pillars of Eternity proves it. 150 hours of gaming and not boring at all. Wow!I enjoyed the story. Enjoyed role playing. You can be very kind or evil; being fair or liar. All quests have different ways to pass them. Game gives you interesting dilemmas. And again, I've been playing for almost 150 hours and was not bored. It was so interesting to investigate all locations, to complete all quests, to speak to each characters.So if you hadn't had experience with old-school games this is a good one to start with.Looking forward for second part. Meanwhile I'm going to play Tyranny. Another game from Obsidian Entertainment.			"

												Pillars of Eternity is a love letter to the old Baldur's Gate and Icewind dale games of the 90s. Instead of AD&D rules for combat and character creations Obsidian has made their own that functions much the same way. You pick a class, race and starting attributes. Then you set off on an adventure with some truly fantastic party members and some meh ones. Combat is handled in a real time manner that you can pause and issue commands. It took me a long while to get comfortable with it but by the end it was a lot of fun.Verdict: Pillars of Eternity stands as testament that the old complex and unwieldy RPGs of yore still have a place in the modern market. If you love D&D or a time back when games didn't ♥♥♥♥ around and you had to actually read to figure out where to go next and didn't just throw a floating marker on everything. Then Pillars is the game for you. "

												My initial impression about this game was that it was doomed to be hated. First, it was hyped by middle-aged men wishing to reclaim their glory days of playing Baldur's Gate. Second, it was made by Obsidian. Third, it's a Kickstarter game (which annoyingly they don't let you forget). And finally, it's made on the Unity engine or some variation therof. However despite all these worries Pillars of Eternity is one of the best RPGs I have played in the last ten years. If you liked Dragon Age Origins, you'll really like this game (which is my only comparison since I've never played Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale).This isn't an MMO, but I still feel like Pillars of Eternity does everything correct what all MMOs do wrong, and I really wish MMOs were this complicated today. I love that it takes me 5-10 minutes to level up one character the reload a save when I realize what I picked didn't work as well as I hoped. This kind of learning curve that makes you want to learn and play is hard to pull off these days, but Pillars does it so well. The story is easily on the level of early Final Fantasy games, except unlike Final Fantasy it actually explains what's going on instead of leaving it to your 'imagination,' which I call lazy story telling. Good on Pillars!I'm also amazed at the customizability of the difficulty. Why can't all games do this? It seems that so many games today want to take away your freedom for every little option, but Pillars allows you to blast through it so easily that it may as well be a Telltale Game or make it so difficult you can't even beat the prologue unless you're used to the D&D level of thought behind each attack.If you're looking for a game that has many reasons to play and keep playing with (as far as I know) a brand new fantasy world that doesn't rely on old names and old characters then Pillars of Eternity is definitely the game to buy.As a final note, I now have a list of two games I can say are successful Kickstarters: Shovel Knight and Pillars of Eternity!

												Pillars of Eternity is a love letter to the old Baldur's Gate and Icewind dale games of the 90s. Instead of AD&D rules for combat and character creations Obsidian has made their own that functions much the same way. You pick a class, race and starting attributes. Then you set off on an adventure with some truly fantastic party members and some meh ones. Combat is handled in a real time manner that you can pause and issue commands. It took me a long while to get comfortable with it but by the end it was a lot of fun.Verdict: Pillars of Eternity stands as testament that the old complex and unwieldy RPGs of yore still have a place in the modern market. If you love D&D or a time back when games didn't ♥♥♥♥ around and you had to actually read to figure out where to go next and didn't just throw a floating marker on everything. Then Pillars is the game for you. "

												I had really high hopes for this game and it started off really great, but...as I have played the BG series and other games of the ilk and massively enjoyed them for their rich charcters and story I had expected that PE would not dissapoint.starting the game everything seemd great and that I was in for a good story but not soon after I realised that I either stopped following the story or that it was really thin, or may I just zoned out? It seemed I could kill swaths of innocent people only to have my rating of how much I was liked go down, there were no guards that would track me down or seemingly no one that would confront me.the people on my team were cooky but mostly in an annoying way and the only one I enjoyed was Aloth, so when missions came up for my chracters they just felt like dull grinds that nothing new was learned from.Some of the spell animation is cool, but the combat in general wasnt quite there.as you can see I played for a fair while and it did feel that around every corner something fun would happen or the story might actualy captivate me, but it never happened.some fun times were had, but not enough for a positive review and not enough to bother with the DLCI'm just glad I got it on sale.

												There are the classics: The SSI Gold Box Adventures, Ultima, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape and Fallout. Now there is Pillars of Eternity and I can offer no greater praise than to add this title to that sacred list.Obsidian really have rolled a natural twenty on this one. It's a polished, smart and beautiful cohesive gestalt of superb art, deep systems and great writing that is simply levels beyond the doggerel peddled in almost every other game (well, any other games that isn't written by Troika / Obsidian).I did just notice that they left me off the Kickstarter Backers in the credits though.

												This is a tale of marvelous and never-to-be-forgotten adventure, undertaken by The Chosen One and his worthy companions. You have to pass a thorny way full of darkness through a mysterious realm that has been perfectly brought to life by Obsidian.Encounters with ogres, spiders, xaurips, shadows, guls, participation in conspiracies and continuous opposition to the forces of evil are some of the occasions that befall the Watcher.It's an old school style cRPG, but it doesn’t play like some kind of anachronism. The game has taken its own place in Hall of Fame among the ranks of the immortal role-playing video games. It’s a complete and glorious story in itself, but it also can become an introduction to something even greater.			"

												Excellent game. If you enjoy RPGs which give you choice, you will likely enjoy this. Not only do you make choices regarding the plot, you customize your party, and the individual characters.There are a few odd bugs. Mostly a couple of interface glitches which appeared here and there over the weeks I played. They were easily cleared away by restarting the game. Nothing game-breaking in my first playthrough. As someone who is easily angered by glitches, I did not find myself getting angry about the few glitches I saw.This is the first great RPG I've played in a long time. I am more happy with my purchase of this game than I have been with any other game I've bought in probably close to a decade. A second playthrough awaits, with new choices, and new characters.Oh, I forgot to mention... Played on Linux. Performance was excellent.			"

												TLDR: Combat is bad. Too much micromanagement needed for the most basic of things. Lovely art and passable story, ruined by tedious combat. Play this on Easy, or not at all.90% of combat is keeping the party in formation, so the enemies don't run past the tanks, and no one gets gibbed. That's it. Your ""choices"" are to initiate combat perfectly to get a good formation, and then pause constantly to keep it together. That's all, and it's not even challenging. When your party formation breaks, it's because you grew too bored to pause often enough, and risked that it might happen. Zzzzzzzzzzzzz.The art is a triumph. To capture the style of classic isometric games, in modern 3d rendering at high resolution, is something you have to see to believe.The story is only passable. There's a lot of ""anti-fantasy"" by jaded writers who no longer enjoy the genre. They hate wizards, so they add guns. They hate gods, so they killed one with a bomb. (Not a spoiler; it's backstory.) There's more grimdark and gothic horror than epic fantasy. Why is it so hard for amateur -- er, ""indie"" -- artists to appreciate a popular style and stick to it? Perhaps games have publishers for a reason.			"

												In this review, I will discuss THE GOOD (things I liked), THE BAD (things that were mechanically wrong or off with the game), and THE UGLY (more general stuff that really just shut me down about it.)THE GOOD:--Plays and feels like a CRPG! Mission accomplished!--Party creation system is cool; you're able to travel around with companions from the story or custom mook-people who were designed in exactly the same fashion as you were. Your choice!--Combat is a bit hard to learn at first, but fun and even a bit tactical when facing enemies on par with your level or higher. --Pretty big game world, but not overly so. --Health system is really good. It forces your party to take breaks from adventuring for fear of permadeath and gets rid of classic ""we've been underground for a month!"" phenomenon. THE BAD: --Healing is at a premium for all classes but one or maybe two. This basically forces you to have a priest on hand. Or a full party of Paladins. It detracts from any sort of party diversity and feels very min-maxy.--As of recent patches, crowd control effects have been nerfed into oblivion. Maybe this is a ""realistic"" choice considering which monsters were buffed, but it makes some classes very uninteresting on some levels and complete garbage on others.THE UGLY: --This game has a lot more ugly for me than it will for others. I'm not trying to start a minor flame war when I say that I think Fallout 4 is a better roleplaying game than Pillars is. You may feel they aren't comprable, but I would disagree. It's a great CRPG, but I will explain later in this section why that isn't enough for me.--Do not get Pillars if you want a coherent story. In the previous incarnation of this review, I stated that it suffers from Clockwork Orange Syndrome; the belief that making up your own language and implementing it willy-nilly is cool, but if you can't execute it properly, it's overwhelming and distracting. That's still true. It gets a little more cohesive later, but it stays pretty murky for quite a while, I felt; far too long for a game that's so hyped up. --The crux of my Dislike: CRPGs often fail to be actual roleplaying games. The problem with MMORPGs, CRPGs, and even some ARPGs, is that they are all about a tidal wave of numbers crashing upon the rocky shore of the coastline of Other Numbers. Your characters will not feel special. Mine certainly never did. I knew nothing about the land I hailed from, I was given a great big bag full of cookie cutter dialogue options to flesh out my character, and nothing I could do made me truly care about him. Because of how foreign and unrelatable the game feels due to its original fantasy setting combined with the absurdly sheer density of lore, I just couldn't penetrate it. Min-maxing is practically a must on any difficulty above the easiest, for you must combat the numbers swarm! That's why they let you hire your own party, it's not to tell any kind of story. Your hirelings might as well be heavily armored, sometimes magically inclined sheep for all the characterization they're allowed.Here's the deal. I'm an avid paper and pencil RPG player. While CRPGs are based off of PPRPGs, they have been corrupted. They are no longer roleplaying games, but rollplaying games. Do you see the difference? In a roleplaying game, character driven story is absolutely the most important aspect. In a rollplaying game, it's all just one big, impersonal clash of the dice titans as math jockeys swing their Holy Avenger +5s around. Pillars of Eternity commits this crime. People complain on and on about Fallout because it doesn't hand them a story about their character; it doesn't force feed it to them. This is why people nowadays like the Witcher games; they have no concept of original, open characters. Not to say that the Witcher games are bad (the first two are), but the point is that I can't play Geralt the way I see him, only a handful of ways in which the developers see him.Fallout 4, to me, is a better roleplaying game because I've played it through three times with characters that were WAY deeper than anything Pillars offered. They weren't deep in the game, but in the only place that mattered: my own head. FO4 exemplifies such an openness for imagination that you can be anything. My first FO4 character started out optimistic and even excited about the chance for a new life and a chance to rebuild the shattered and insane wasteland, but eventually became jaded and nearly suicidally depressed after making some key story decisions later on. My second character was an older man who had married his secretary after knocking her up and didn't ever answer the hero's call, believing that the nightmare of the wasteland was just that: a cryogenically induced lucid dream that let him do almost anything in a playground of violence and nonsense. There were others, but I hope you get the idea. FO4 gives you a tiny bit of backstory, a voice, and that's it. Not that the game doesn't fall flat in a lot of areas, but the freedom to characterize is vastly superior.A true RPG let's you do anything within the reasonable confines of the world. It's a practical sandbox. Pillars forces you into a corner with barely noticable character dialogue. There isn't even a bio screen to write. I'm the kind of player who LOVES Skyrim's journal mod because I would write my characters' thoughts in it. If you skim over this review and decide you don't care about the aspects I've mentioned, I challenge you to tell any kind of significant story with your characters. I doubt it can be done. I don't hear water cooler stories about the imaginative bloom of characters coming to life in Pillars...just of jumbled numbers striking other numbers with their number swords. It's not a bad game mechanically speaking, I just really dislike that Pillars of Eternity doesn't nurture players' imaginations. It, like so many other games, simply placates our wonder while distracting us with admittedly good gameplay.			"

Posted: March 30, 2015
												TL;DR Version: A good but not great throwback role playing game.This felt very much like Baldurs Gate 1 to me.  BG1 was good but not great whereas BG2 is truly epic. BG1 was more condensed with less imaginative locations, fewer epic tales, a main story that is not quite as well told and a villain who is not quite a well fleshed out. I felt much like that in Pillars. The locations, dungeons, monsters and so forth were well done but felt a bit generic at times. There were some good quests but very few I felt were memorable. Companions were there but the vast majority either weren't interesting or were under-developed. They could have done so much more with some of these guys. Itemization wasn't very good and I never did ooh and aah over any new piece of equipment. Now besides this being a somewhat generic RPG, I really had difficulty in two areas that probably hindered my enjoyment of the game more than any others: combat and plot logic.Let's take the last one first. I don't think the plot was particularly well told at times and there's a reveal by a major character at the very, very end that I can't even remember seeing before Act 3. The game kept trying to force me into caring about a plot line in a past life that I couldn't give two shakes about. It's like the game kept trying to say ""YOU WILL CARE"" all the while giving me dialog options that said ""basically, I don't care"". Thus the plot and character motivations are very uneven. Am I undertaking this quest to save the children? For my now-dead God? For my sanity? For my past? There's not just one motivation that the game allows you to stay with and thus your choices seem contrived. Combat mechanics and itemization were also not well explained and I think I was seriously missing some tactical options because I didn't understand them. Spells and skills tended not to fire and I have no idea why. Vulnerabilities and counters to strengths I never did figure out. Given the sheer amount of combat in the game, I know this hindered my enjoyment of PoE. I never could figure out the synergies within a particular class, never mind party synergies. It's a combat system that has potential but it needs a lot more explaining and some simplification. I've been able grasp every different version of D&Ds combat but I found this just a bit too obtuse to really enjoy. Needless to say, I rezzed a lot of characters. :-)None of this means the game was bad. These are just the points that hindered my enjoyment of it. So what worked right? Well, it's the closest thing to an Infinity Engine game that we've seen in a decade. The art style is beautiful. The writing is excellent. The plot isn't bad - just occasionally poorly explained. The world itself is kind of neat. You get a cool keep to rebuild. There are some good dungeons. There's a lot of just solid RPG gameplay and even with the above problems I was compelled to see the next area, the next level and finish the next quest. There's plenty of side quests and they don't always turn out like you anticipate. There are plenty of opportunities to use different skills. It's just a very solid RPG, one that is good enough to overcome the issues I've had with it.It doesn't have the same emotional pull of Planescape Torment, the great character arc of KOTOR, the world-building goodness of Skyrim, the sheer epic scale of Baldur's Gate II or the setting and story of Ultima 7. It doesn't hold a candle to the Fallout series, have the wonderful combat of Divinity Original Sin, the story and universe of Mass Effect, the grim characters of The Witcher or the wonderful emotional quest choices of Dragon's Age. But just because it's not a classic doesn't mean it's not good. Being merely good isn't a sin, either. So if you're a RPG fan, you're probably going to like this and thus I'd recommend it. ...EDIT: I've now played through the game again with the expansions. That's more than 100 hours in PoE. I feel the exact same way about the game. Combat is still obtuse. The plot is still uneven. The game is still good. 'Nuff said.			"

												I never played an old school RPG like this one so I wasn't sure if I wanted to buy it. I am so glad I took the risk and bought it. This is one of the best games I have played in a long time. As always, Obsidian does an amazing job making their characters interesting and unique. Sometimes when you are walking around, your companions will talk amongst each other, and it is most often a hilarious. One time, the hunter in my group yelled ""son of a moosef**ker!"" and the mage (who is a very civilized man) became nervous due to her language. There are plenty more hilarious enounters that happen everytime I play. If you want the best experience possible, do not look up how to do anything on the internet. If you get stuck in a quest for example, try to figure it out on your own. I know it is tempting to look at a walkthrough, but it will be more satisfying when you figure it out by yourself. I honestly don't have a bad thing to say about this game. I can't recommend it enough.			"

												A true successor to the Baldur's Gate genre, except in that the combat is semi turn-based and not entirely turn-based. Whatever is not told to us directly through the dialogue is revealed by exploring the world. The visual backgrounds are comparable to works of art and the story is rich with lore and tangible language.One thing I wish they added to the game are distinct musical compositions for combat sequences in different areas, which is something the developer did previously in Knights of the Old Republic II - instead, they use the same repititive track for every single encounter and it gets dreary after awhile.Roleplaying games are hard to balance and probably shouldnt be (so they're fun), and some classes are going to be invaluable compared to other classes, but part of me wishes paladins had more depth than just walking buffs that heal people, or that Rangers can do more than just single target damage with ranged weapons; they're not bad, but maybe if we had more cross-class options, they could be much better.EDIT: Obsidian is adding a full orchestra soundtrack and multi-class options to character creation in the upcoming Pillars of Eternity 2. I eagerly wait in anticipation.			"

												Pros:-Good visual style, nice graphics.-Story is decent, except for the 4th wall breaking kickstarter content.-Some of the weapons are amusing.Cons:-The stats of your character don't really matter except for combat, and even there, they matter surprisingly little.-The classes are very similar to one another-Combat is extremely repetitive: There isn't much variety on how to build your characters, and once you build them, you always fight every combat in exactly the same way-There is very little or no skill involved in the actual combat: The side which can out-tank the other wins.-The kickstarter content ruins the immersion. You can't even wander the woods without running into some flame-haired ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a ""unique and involving"" backstory.-You can't even talk with those stupid kickstarter npcs. They just stand about everywhere like flame-haired signposts, spouting their fan fiction.Conclusion:It's not a completely worthless game, but if you are in the mood for an oldschool rpg, just play an oldschool rpg instead.

												I can't believe I'm saying this, because I was so ready to love this game, but the game that is essentially meant to be Baldur's Gate III, made 9 years after Baldur's Gate II, fails to be as good as that game. And it isn't because everything seems better when you're younger. There are very specific reasons.Reason #1: You don't have to earn as many things. For example, you can make your own magic items whenever you want, as long as you have some ingredients. You don't even have to be a magic-user. It makes no sense and completely removes the fun of treasure hunting. I used to freaking LOVE hunting through dungeons and final fights not just because of the closure your character gets with that subplot, but to see what cool magical loot you'll find, and which character will find it useful. This has been destroyed. Now finding a magic sword isn't a big deal, because you probably already made a better one. There should never be a situation wherein finding a magic sword is boring. You also get a base in the BEGINNING of the game. Like, a really, really nice one. Like so nice that you can't help but wonder why you don't just retire right then. I remember getting a base in Baldur's Gate II. It was about halfway through the game, so you actually had time to see what it was like without one and imagine how great it would be to have one. Then BOOM, you do a really cool quest and you get one, which was different depending on what class you were. You're a fighter? You get a keep. Your a wizard? You get a cool magic sphere. You're a druid? You get a druid grove. Not in this game. Same one for everybody, right away. Also, you can re-stat your character whenever you want at an inn. Also, you can just make new companions in inns as well and swap them in and out. When a game gives you things instead of making you earn them, you don't appreciate them as much. When it allows you to go back and re-do decisions, it doesn't feel like there's any real consequences to the decisions you make and you stop caring as much about making them. This prevents you from getting really sucked into the game like the previous ones.Reason #2: Weak companions: I really, really hate that they removed the romance aspect of companions. It was a really engaging aspect of Baldur's Gate II that added an extra level to your interactions with your companions. Not in this game, though. In addition to this, I only found two of the companions at all interesting. There are no Minscs or Jan Jansens or Viconias in this game. And these two just weren't able to carry my interest on their own.Reason #3: The combat is not nearly as tactical. You can no longer cast spells outside of combat. And stealth is very different and much more limited. I remember back to Baldur's Gate II when I would stealth a guy, scope things out, summon a couple of elementals, cast my buff spells, take my position near a choke point, then lure the enemy to me and have the fight of my life. In this game you can't do any of that. It makes every fight feel the same and beggs the question WHY NOT? WHY CAN'T I USE MAGIC RIGHT BEFORE A FIGHT? IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.All in all, I didn't hate it. It's fine I guess. But that's it... it's just fine. And I'm sorry I kept bringing up Baldur's Gate II so much, but I was amazed at how many steps back this game took from things they already figured out... 9 YEARS AGO.			"

												First off, I initially got into this game with some bias as I am an old infinity game player, I was already predisposed to this game in that light. After playing it however I noticed the merit of this game in particular. If you've ever played an infinity engine game...this game is identical. Its as if they took the infinity engine and just leveled it up graphically and added a few extra moves to it. I was astounded at how it felt, it was like I was playing Baldurs Gate all over again...but then it differed. The primary difference is of course the law and the storyline. The immersion is there,its very good, I can only hope there is a continuation of this type of game. The lore is unique and intriguing, not your everyday thing but still familiar enough to not be too alien. Learning the lore of the game world was rewarding in its own right. Especially when you replay scenes and you actually understand what is going on.Gameplay is also excellent and well balanced in my opinion, the additional difficulties are also there for the veterans or some might say ""geeks"". There is a ton of customisation in many forms. Simply in character creation there are more options than I've seen in most any game. You select your gender, race, class, background, culture, you select detailed stats, skills..many races have subraces and subcultures and most of these things may have some impact on story progression and interaction with the game world. The balance of your characters statistics affects combat and also interaction...you might end up having a strong focus on combat...only to have difficulty in social interactions. The reverse is also true. Skills also have a large impact, you might have a very unfit mage who falls off a cliff or gets injured because of poor footing, or you could move massive boulders out of your path with raw strength if you are so inclined. The combinations are plentiful and would take many replays to see all the possibilities. If there was ever to be another Baldurs Gate then this was it.  A true spiritual successor.For all my bias and the flowery words about it...I still have some issues with it. If I had not played Baldurs Gate, I may not have seen this as a problem...but the interaction with companions was not as satisfying as I'd have liked. It just doesn't delve deep enough. I couldn't at the end of it all say that I'd really bonded with any of them. It was more like we start as strangers and end as comrades...but not really good friends or anything more. In that sense I might as well play it as a solo character without the need for companions. The companions do have their own draw and they are interesting but as mentioned, there is nothing to keep one interested in them. Once you assist them through their own problems they cease to be interesting and you cannot deepen any bonds. Suffice to say they are very limited.Additionally I did not enjoy the conclusion to the story, this is my deduction but the story appeared to have a thoroughly atheist agenda and I did not find the conclusion satisfying. Thats all I can say without spoiling anything. The writing is however very good, dialogue as well. All in all, this is one of the best games to grace the monitors of the gaming populace of this decade. I heartily recommend it.			"

												Seriously an great game, 8/10I bought this game yesterday and I fell in love with it at the very start. I never played Baldur's gate, but I am a massive RPG and medieval fantasy enthusiest. Anything with swords, castles, knights and magic makes me squeal with delight, and this game is a gods send for someone looking for a new game to get immersed into. For starters the art is absolutely beautiful. It has a really unique and interesting feel to it that I thought I wouldn't enjoy at first, but it compliments the feel and atmosphere of the game very well. The environements are realistic and detailed as well. Where there is voice acting in the game it is good. It doesnt feel like a low budget voice actor who is putting cliche emotion into their characters (see: Lichdom Battle mage). The character creation is quite interesting, giving lore right away about the interesting cultures and combinations of classes available to play.The combat is the only thing I find a little bit lacking because it feels a little bit slow and can get sort of tedious after a while. But what it falls short of in combat it makes up for in content. This game has a massive amount of lore. There are backstories for practically everything, and lots of interesting reading to be done to really immerse yourself into the world of Pillars of Eternity. This is the part that I love the most because in my opinion for a fantasy world to be good, it needs to have a sense of rich lore and immersion. This game does exactly that.If you are like me and a solid 95% of your steam games are fantasy/medieval themed and you love the fantasy genre, buy this game. It is worth every penny and I seriously hope I can find more games that are this rich in lore and history in the future.TL;DR Great fantasy game, worth every penny.			"

												Gave it another try and it bored me even quicker than last time, combat is broken in multiple ways. A shining example of this is that disengaging from combat brings you such severe punishment that it's better just to stick to your position and fight, which depletes you of many tactical posibilities. The only tactical aspect of this game is to choose which damage to apply to the enemy and circle through abilities. Absolutely boring.The so called ""good writing"" pointed by many people is not something I witnessed in PoE. The only well written character is Durance, while most dialogues are absolutely boring and bring nothing apart from walls of text, mostly of pseudo-philosophical nature. Most characters are flat like piece of paper and basically nothing wanted me to engage with conversations with NPCs. Betrayal in Krondor is well-written game, Planescape:Torment is well-written game, this one is not. The good scenario is the one that grabs your throath and don't release until it's over. Here I wasn't even pinched by it. I felt absolutely no desire to follow the main quest, because the beginning of the game is very poor, there is simply nothing that makes you want to follow the storyline apart from journal which tells you what to do next.Graphics are pretty neat and eye-cathing, can't complain about music and sounds either. But that's pretty much it.The only reason I continued playing are good reviews, which made me think ""hey, these people can't be so wrong"". Well, IMHO they're. Life is to short to play bad games and I dropped it. This is the first time I disagreed with RPG Codex who gave this game it's recommendation.If you like Paulo Coelho and blurry morals, this might be game for you, on the other hand, a lot of people seemed to love it. Dunno why, don't see it their way.			"

												I'm a little sad about giving this game a bad review because it looks like a lot of love went into it, but... short version, the gameplay is just not enjoyable.The longer version:Combat uses a strange pseudo-real-time system loosely inspired by the 4th edition of Dungeons and Dragons. You control up to six characters and constantly have to pause the game manually to assign actions or cancel actions to reassign new ones. With six characters using actions that have various use times and ""recovery"" times, this adds up to a level of micromanagement that turns fights into tedious chores.This could have been mitigated by using fewer characters... if not for this game's bizarre experience system. Traditionally, RPGs will let you use whatever number of party members you choose, without penalty, by splitting EXP between characters present. If an encounter is worth 600 EXP, characters in a party of six would each gain 100 EXP, a party of three would see 200 EXP per member, etc. But in this game, where a group of six people would get a total of 600 EXP, a solo character would only get a total of 150; that's a -75% EXP penalty. It's still possible to play with one or two characters, but unlike with most traditional games, you will be severely punished for doing so. Also, solo characters will often talk (in both voiced content and dialogue choices) like they're in a party even if they're not.Loading screens are also excessive. In part because of length, but also because of their frequency; entering a tiny one-room hut will require a loading screen to enter and another to exit. You'll have to go through two loading screens every time you want to talk to an NPC or shopkeeper that's in a house.The game has ""hidden"" stashes of loot, which sounds like a lot of fun, except you generally can't see them unless you're in ""Stealth/Scouting"" mode, which halves your speed. Even if you're a knight in shining and clanky full plate armor, you'll be walking like a Rogue-type character on a secret mission even in the middle public streets, like an idiot... hoping that the secrets you find will actually be worth anything, because a surprisingly high number of them, despite being hidden, only contain near-worthless junk.There were other, much smaller irritants present. Probably not worth listing, but let's just say this camel didn't need more straw on its back.I'm sure there are people who love this game. But as a gamer of 30+ years, I found it to be too severely flawed and I feel that I must warn potential buyers of some of the more critical ones.			"

												Baldurs Gate in a modern engine, without having to be true to a pencil and paper ruleset.NPCs are well developed, conversations with them are entertaining and engaging.Combat is fun, complex, and requires you to think.Story is engaging and keeps you wanting to push forward.10/10			"

												Let me first say I love RPG's. Obsidian is one of my all time favorite game companies. I can't get behind this game. It's so much like Neverwinter/Kinights of the Old Republic, I'd actually rather go and revisit those titles. I find the world and setting bland, and the combat is slow and ripped straight out of the early 2000's. Maybe it's just that I feel like I've already played this game a thousand times. This game is perfect for those 20 something year olds that heard of how amazing baulder's gate and neverwinter were, but never actually played them first hand.As for me I give this game a big, ben there done that out of meh.

												Best thing happened to RPG genre in a long time. Worth every cent.I'm 40 hours in and still in ACT 2. Best thing is that almost every quest got different ways of completion, but theres no good/bad ways they are just different. I sit at work waiting for evening to continue my playthrough - almost forgotten feeling when you are old enough to have family.OK. Now I'm 100 hours in and almost completed game. One last fight against Taos.Pros- Well-made story- Old-school gameplay- Beatiful isometric graphics- Nice tunesCons- Little unbalanced (druids easily kick any a$$)- 12 level cap (reached it in act 2)- Too much money that nowhere to spendHope Obsidian expand this universe. Really would like to play sequel. Day 1 buy - no regret.			"

												I'd give it a 60/100 - its decent, but mostly uninspired and lackluster in everything that makes a RPG great.Relevant cons:- combat pathing is a cluster♥♥♥♥- a Farmville-style Fortress thats devoid of any life no matter what you do - mostly linear, very few places that allow different approaches- sidequests often uninspired. You accept a quest, run somewhere, quest suddenly ends. Poor exceution and lack of good storytelling- way too much combat, which is a problem, since combat is the weakest thing about the game- choices often dont matter at all or very little- an endless amount of loading screens- uninspired maps that often consist of one primary goal and a secondary goal to ""explore"", like loot a corpse or go into a smell templeAll in all this game is busy trying to market itself as the next Planescape and BG, while in reality it falls incredibly flat. It comes off as mostly uninspired and clumsy as ♥♥♥♥, while lacking decent gameplay and charme.			"

												This game had a quadruple budget than the intended, and it still was way worse in almost every aspect than Baldurs gate.To begin, this is a 9/10 of a game, but the comparison here, as in the original video before the kickstarter, is with baldurs gate 2.What annoyed me about the game:There was no engagement on the quests, i never felt the urgency to actually complete a questThe total playable content felt very limitedThe music was really BAD, which is ridiculous in this day and age with 3 milllion extra budget, you got games like the banner saga and endless legends with amazing music, but you just had to go on and ruin this game.There were many flaws that kinda broke the 4th wall. When ingame cutscenes ended, the characters instead of walking out of the building (like in bg2 20 years ago) the screen went black and they suddenly disappeared. This and many other minor overlooked stuff, really brought the game down a level.I wont get into the spells system or the weapons, i never really felt engaged to the weapons or spells, whatever had the highest damage i used, everything looked the same, and i still finished the game in hard.A friend of mine also mad about BG2, didnt even finish this game.What mostly annoys me, is that with another 6 months of developing time, this game could have been an 11/10, without really much efforts, just some different choices in the decision making phase....I was overhyped when it came out, and now im writing a negative review "

												How can I even review this?  It's so good.  I'd call it an homage to Baldur's Gate and other Infinity Engine RPGs, but it's more like an actual successor to them than any simple tribute.  It's really just amazing in every way, particularly with respect to the level of deep customization and personalization you have access to immediately.  The art and music is lovingly done and truly exceptional.  The story is awesome and engaging.  Just, buy this right now?  Do it.			"

												You are from the oldschool, and loved BG, Planetscape or Icewind Dale?This game does not match those legends, but it is the one that get the closest enough since all those years, very close.So yes, it is the best rpg of the new era, just buy and enjoy.Gameplay is immersive and well written, respect DnD rules, and the game is much more enjoyable on higher difficulties. (Recomended at least in Hard mode unless you are not familiar with this kind of game)Some bad aspects would be the lack of consideration for alignements or races, and maybe too few choices on the story, also companions are not all that great and lack of charisma and inteteractions, but you can make all your characters if you do not like them anyway.Well very positive for me, support them, if they make more games, it will definitrly gets better and reach near perfection.

												Pillars of Eternity is, in my opinion, one of the best RPGs to ever hit the market. The stories are excellent, the environments are beautiful, the music is superb, the effects are gorgeous without being overpowering, the combat system feels natural, the spells and abilities are very easy to understand, and it all works together to bring to life a world of magic, mystery, danger, intrigue, and adventure.One of the things that really struck me was the fact that this game, while definitely appropriate for kids (tweens and teenagers), is so obviously geared toward adults. There's some mature content, but it's not over the top or ""in your face"", it's just the right amount of serious for more mature gamers to enjoy things without feeling like they're taking part in some guilty pleasure.  I am also really impressed with the sheer amount of writing involved in this game. There are storybooks, history books, reference books, journals, and diaries, not to mention the scripted interactions, companion banter, and the unique stories of characters with certain gold nameplates which adds to bringing the world to life.Another thing that I really like is the use of links in the UI. Certain keywords appear similarly to URL tags in web pages, you mouse over those words and you get a tooltip explaining what that word means in context. This makes understanding spells and abilities very easy which makes enjoying the game very accessible to those who are probably not as familiar as some of us when it comes to fantasy RPGs. Kudos to the team at Obsidian for catering to more than hard-core RPG fans.The last thing I'll talk about is the Linux support: It's excellent! After Divinity: Original Sin I felt really disappointed in how Linux support was handled (it came over a year later and only in the ""Enhanced Edition"") and didn't have high hopes for yet another game funded by Kickstarter burning me and other Linux users. I was very happy to be proven wrong by Obsidian, to say the least. I didn't have to do anything special to get the game to run, didn't need to avoid certain graphics settings, none of that. The game just works.I highly recommend this game to anyone who's even the least bit curious about fantasy RPGs and especially to those who are fans of the Baldur's Gate series. If you're a beginner with these types of games, Obsidian's development team thought about you and included a ""Story Time"" difficulty so that you can focus more on the story and less on being punished in combat. There's no excuse, the game isn't ""too hard"" and all of the barriers to understanding how things work in previous games have been considered and fixed in Pillars of Eternity. Enjoy!			"

												Well, hello...I grew up playing BioWare's fantastic RPG titles... Baldur's Gate was my favourite game for a very long time.--- Might contain mild spoilers ---Now, for Pillars of Eternity... It is a nice game with quite a few problems, so I'll try to summarize my whole experience...When I started playing it, aside from strong feeling of nostalgia I was stunned by beautiful background graphics (characters are pretty low quality for today's standards, but they do the job)... Interface design is also fantastic...Anyway, I was immersed in game, story was interesting, depressive town of Gilded Vale was... well, depressing, and I really felt that... I started doing all the quests (as I normally do), and enjoyed it...That changed, and after some time the whole game became a kind of chore... I wasn't as immersed as at the beginning, I stopped caring for characters... i.e. I really cared of Calisca and her sister and I generally liked stories of characters in Gilded Vale... After that, I didn't feel that vibe... I probably don't have enough time (as I had 10-15 years ago) to be immersed in the game for that long, but I played Witcher 3 for about 120 hours, and enjoyed every second of it...Od Nua is interesting idea, but I didn't find it to be very important... Endless Paths are just to Hack-n-Slashy for this type of game (and combat), I didn't like it... And that is another problem of this game; It is full of uninteresting and unimportant combat. Some encounters are very easy, and have no point both storywise and for gameplay, but are there to build up playing hours, and then some of them are so hard that it is impossible to complete them (ie when you enter the last fight location, you won't be able to go back and build up your levels, and the last combat is really, really hard... it's ridiculous).Talking about combat, I didn't find special abilities to be special at all... Aside from healing and summoning spells... Damage spells are ok, but you can't use them too often...I really liked other adventurers, and their personalities... Side quests are hit and miss... The main quest starts really strong, but ends up being... well, not as good as the beginning...""Reading"" souls can be frustrating from time to time... It is often written in some kind of riddles or in strange sentences, that I needed a lot of effort to understand them... Or I just don't have as much patience... It has it's strengths; it shows that it is not so easy to read souls, and shows the chaos that is building up in his head, but it was just too hard, sometimes... Of course, for native English speaker, this is probably not a problem...Another problem is tied to travel times... Not so important, generally, but it really damage up immersion... When travelling from location to location that are one next to the other you'll need i.e. 4 (or more) hours... That is not a problem as it is (those to locations might be that far away)... But then, in one instance, you'll actually enter underground tunnel in one location and exit it in another... In about 2 minutes, when not fighting... As I said, not so important, but hurts the immersion...When I speak about locations, it is hard not to talk about loading screens that take too much time... Every little house that you want to enter in game, will take tenish seconds of your time to load... And for you to realise there is nothing in there... And now back, loading the location where you are...------------------------------------------Verdict:Although I wrote many problems about Pillars of Eternity, I think it is a nice game... A lot of these problems that I have now are probably tied to my subjective opinion, and the fact that I don't have as much time as I had when I played Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, etc... Then, again, I liked some parts, mostly because of nostalgia, but we're all very subjective xDAnyway, my final rating would be... 6.5/10			"

												Pillars of Eternity is a solid CRPG with a lot going for it. It doesnt exactly bring much new to the table, but that isnt a bad thing. The game has tons of cool classes that all feel unique and play well. It has a serious Baldur's Gate 1 feel to it, with a very similar pace and style. The story is pretty good, with a well thought out original setting and plenty of mystery. If you loved Baldur's Gate 1, or even Dragon Age Origins, this game is well worth your time. Keep in mind, there is no hand holding in this game, so be prepared to use your brain like in the old days.			"

												As a backer, I really believed in this game, but mayeb that's why I am so disappointed!There are other reviews that describe the problems in detail, but here are some things that are pretty bad:- the abilities/skills of the characters are not distinct enough; it also doesn't really matter what you equip them with- the game is unbalanced, with fights that are way too difficult on normal popping up without warning- the loot is not worth the effort, usually- the reputation system is illogical- you have to sneak ALL the time- most spells can hurt your characters too, so your wizard has to be in the front line- your character is generic, regardless of how you build him/her, and there is no feeling of relationships with the rest of the partyThere's more. These are all problems with the design, so not fixable.There are strange bugs during combat:- party members forget that they are fighting and just hang around after you use one of their abilities. This happens sometimes, so you never know if you need to manage them or not.- abilities don't work as advertised, e.g. the fighters ability that lets him engage 3 enemies sometimes just doesn't register and he is flanked even with just 2.I am not sure if I wil continue playng - it's become quite boring.

												I was sceptical at first to this game, despite having played (and adored) Baldur's Gate. I thought I wouldn't be able to enjoy an old school RPG like this in these times where the RPG genre looks quite different. I was so wrong.+The story is engaging and very fulfilling. It made it close to impossible to stop playing.+Side questing is as epic as side questing comes. No rats in the cellar, no collecting bear asses.+Combat is fun, and difficult. Fights can be extremely tough, which makes it all the more sweeter when you manage to take an enemy down.+Graphics are gorgeous and very reminiscent of old Baldur's Gate games.+Atmosphere! Little notes you find can tell you an entire story if you read them.-A few bugs here and there. Make sure to save often.-There is an inconsistency in conversations when it comes to voice acting. Some conversations have lines that are voiced, and then the next paragraph isn't.I actually have a hard times coming up with cons to this game. If you are at all interested in immersive RPG games and lore, this is the game for you.			"

												It brings tears of nostalgia to my eyes to see what Obsidian have pulled off with the help of Paradox. What was thought to have been a dead genre has suddenly been injected with rejuvenating passion and vigour. A miracle of a game; a diamond in the rough that is a plethora of generic shooting games and uninspired indie shovelware. Welcome home.			"

												Wish they had a neutral review recommendation because honestly thats how I feel about this title. It seems to flirt with greatness but always end up short in the end. The character systems work but thats the problem they simply just work. The writing wavers from very special at portions and then dips to mediocre at other portions but overall the story is solid enough. I just wanted more from this title perhaps better combat systems.Not a bad game, just not great. Now where is that one thumb up one thumb down button.... Not a bad game but it may not be the RPG you're looking for...			"

												I really wanted to like this game, and initially, I did.  I liked the atmosphere it created, especially in the first town (ooh, dark and edgy) and creating my character was interesting and full of possibilities.  But one thing brought it all down for me:  Combat.  I look forward to combat in RPGs and in this game I did not like it at all.  Once the honeymoon of the campaign setting wore off, I kept playing, hoping the sum of its parts would overcome my distaste for the combat.  Sadly, this did not happen for me.Despite how I carefully crafted my characters and selected their spells & abilities, I was not at liberty to use them in everyday encounters... which is where I spent most of my combat time (lots of small encounters).  So I ended up basic attacking (which is boring) through every fight I could, being afraid to expend ""real"" power.  I had a lot of trouble positioning my attacks and abilities.  It made me yearn for proper turn-based combat.  I would carefully indicate what I wanted to happen, but once I unpaused the game my attacks would fire in the wrong place or not as quickly as I had hoped.  The result is that many of my useful abilities ""on paper"" were not easy to use at all. Nevertheless, I liked the music, the story was moderately compelling, and the NPCs were interesting enough... so I pressed on until I had liberated my stronghold, thinking finally, this will tip the balance: I love having a base I get to improve.  And yet, it was not enough.  I still needed to do a lot of combat to make progress, and through clearing the rest of my stronghold I realized I couldn't take the combat anymore.  It's too imprecise compared to true turn-based combat, and rationing my neat abilities may have added to the challenge but it took away what fun was left for me.  If I could have turned on a mode to allow resting and remove resource management, I might have kept playing for the story and the characters (basically trivializing combat, but hey, I didn’t' like it anyway, may as well go for broke).That said, I hope you enjoy the game if you buy it.  It has a lot to like, and just because it wasn't for me doesn't mean it's not for you.  Unfortunately for me, combat is my thing, and this type of combat is not.  :)PS - Why did I have to stealth my entire party to search a room?  I felt like an idiot stealthing in front of people so I could ""search"" their room.  I think search and stealth should be separate actions.  That was my only nitpick worth mentioning, though, which is a good thing.Edit: Typos fixed.Edit 2: Well what do you know, it's not just me.  ;)   http://www.pcgamer.com/why-i-hate-pausable-real-time-rpg-combat "

												Having only heard about this game on the day of it's release, my curiosity got the better of me and I couldn't hold out more than 24 hours before I bought it. I would say the best way to go into this game is to go completely blind, knowing nothing, just the assurance that is is a fantastic game (exactly as I did, no regrets). The writing and story in this game is unparalled, in plenty of games where I am never too interested in the story and am skipping over all the text, I actually feel compelled to read every little tidbit about the lore and history of the world, as it really draws me in. I may only have 6 hours in the game so far, but that is really a testament as to how deep this game draws you in!Made by Obsidian (Fallout NV, KoTor, among others) on kickstarter (perhaps why I had never heard of this game until now), it is a well thought out, sometimes complex (but not overwhelmingly so, everything is explained very well in tooltips) old school party RPG. However the complexity lends itself to variety, in all the classes, abilities, weapons, spells, so that no two playthroughs will be the same, even if you are using exactly the same class as last time.The combat, is first and foremost really really fun. As complex as it is, I never felt like I didn't know what I was doing, and after getting used to it, pulling of really awesome combos of spells and attacks is really satisfying, and I never felt like the game was unfair, any mistakes were made by me, and I learnt from those, for the next fight.I would recommend anyone who is a fan of RPGs in general and good storytelling. Is the game worth it's full price? Hell yes. Did I pay full price for it? ..... Student life.In what other game can I shapeshift into a bear and maul my enemies when sh*t hits the fan?			"

												Over the years the RPG on computers has evolved into something that is a hybrid of FPS/Third Person with an RPG element. Even FPS and Third Person games have begun this transformation taking on RPG elements.Pillars of Eternity is a step back to the pure essence of the early forays of the RPG world into the computer. It takes some of the tech advancementsa we have seen and combines it with the classic style and game play of the early days of computer RPGs. Gone is the twitch gamer mentality that has so invaded the RPG world and in it's place is the slow, methodical game play that drew you into a story. This is a game that will not impress you with eye candy and glitz, it is more than skin deep.If you love RPGs and loved the classic RPGs beofre they tried to become FPS, then you will love this game.

												Pillars of Eternity has a nasty tone. I regret buying it. I played it for a couple hours and struggled to find anything likeable about it. Now, I've played Divinity: Original Sin, Baldur's Gate and many other isometric fantasy games so I *wanted* to like this.The opening story is a railroad. I saved some NPCs' lives but they got auto-killed by ""the plot"".Then I had to start over because my mage couldn't survive fights alone.Once I got into town, an NPC forced me to get involved in a fight with town drunks that he instigated. No matter what I said, the fight started anyway so I was forced to kill them. Nobody noticed the random murder of three helpless drunks in the town square, especially since once you loot them, the bodies disappear.Of course you can go around opening and looting objects that clearly aren't your own. Nobody cares about theft in broad daylight.So if you want your choices to be meaningless, and you want to murder innocents and steal, this game is just for you.			"

												An unfortunate blend of pure combat, overly silly background and a very sad attempt at storytelling, especially given the pedigree this game was trying to recreate.   NPCs tend to fall flat, and it is a very recycled tale of how you, the Chosen One, will completely ignore the special abilites that mark you out as special, the complete lack of consequences that should accompany them (or your actions), and hapharzardly wander to the Overly Tedious Bossfight that has no meaning beyond being the end of your suffering (as a player). The designers made a lot of questionable decisions regarding the utility of abilities, choosing to ape the approach of 4e D&D, where if combat music isn't playing, your class abilities mysteriously don't work, and nothing outside of combat is particularly meaningful.   Unfortunately, combat is a muddy mess of poor programming and bad AI, and the best approach to any combat is find a doorway and exploit the hell out of the repetitive handful of critters.			"

												10/10 This is by far one of the best games like this that I have played (I believe they are called CRPGs, idk). Where to begin... From the good ol' days of Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale; this masterfully crafted games stands side by side with the classics! Outstanding writing and plot, plus amazing characters (and character development). The setting is truly unique, and I feel right at home in this original world. The game is as challenging as it is rewarding, at times I had to do other quests and level up to progress past certain points. It was not annoyingly challenging, just enough to make it feel great when you finally down that tough boss. This game is full of intrigue, diplomacy and other non-combat interactions you would expect from something like D&D. The music is always fitting for the moment, and I thoroughly enjoy all of the music and sounds. The voice acting is great, but be ready for lots of reading (as expected with a game like this). There is so much that I love about this game, and I am unable to describe it all. What I know is that this is an instant classic, and it deserves all the praise that it has received. I am so pleased that this game exists, and I shall continue to support it through the great DLC that they continue to release! Wish you all the best of luck out there, have a blast with this masterwork! A TRUE 10/10!			"

												I've been playing the old isomorphic D&D RPG's like Baldur's Gate (EE) again recently, and compared to Pillars, they still are way superior.It comes down to world building, basically. In the old D&D RPG's, you'd have hundreds upon hundres of NPC's you could talk to and would have funny conversations or possible side quests leading into other side quests; and so on and so forth. That made the world seem real and created an immersive experience.In Pillars however, the number of NPC's who will actually interact with the player are so limited, you're reminded all the time you're playing a game. Same with maps. They're so repetitive and foes are so predictably scattered, it's signaling all the time: 'You're playing a computer game'. Not immersive; boring. If you're looking for this type of game, go play Baldur's Gate I & II or Icewind Dale. They're vastly superior.			"

												Baldur's Gate I and II and Planescape Torment are among my favorite games of all time, Icewind Dale was not great but still a lot better than this.The world feels very lifeless, the first town is full of completely unconnected NPC background stories and nobody other than a few quest givers to talk to.The party system is badly balanced as choosing a class that can't survive and fight on its own makes fights much harder than they would probably be otherwise (in my case I picked a priest). This is compounded by the fact that there is a limit to how often you can rest with the available supplies.There is a lot of lore and system information to remember but the explanatory popups work only in some of the places where e.g. the names of gods or skills appear.Most of the areas I visited so far are just your regular old wilderness spot with evenly spaced enemies and a few plants to collect, making for a very boring gameplay.If you are thinking of buying this game because you enjoyed the old Infinity Engine games I would strongly recommend against it. It is nothing like them and does not make up for it for having either particularly strong writing or engaging combat.			"

												UNINTERESTING STORY - NEEDS MORE NPCS/LIFE - GREAT GRAPHICS - FUN FIGHTS I'm a fan of the Baldur's Gate series (Greatest game and story of all time) and to make this short, if you like RPGs you might enjoy this one though it's not nearly as good as the Baldur's Gate games (which is the standard I measure these games to).It needs a better story, I first tried playing this game when it released and was confused and lost, then after trying again I've now found myself skipping dialogue (something I normally don't do with these games) because the story isn't very interesting.. I don't have the urge to push on, I just kinda play it.. Needs more life... Most of the NPCs are flavor text or just there to make cities and villages look alive...I want more side quests, or random dialouge like in the Baldur's Gate games...The soul stories are even less interesting than the story.Combat is good, and fun though it takes some adapting to if you're used to the D&D style games and rules.Graphics are amazing.If you like RPGs, buy it. Obsidian needs to make a better story for the next game however and build on what they've done successfully here.			"

												It is not bad, but it is so horribly mediocre.Obsidian could have done so much better, especially as they have experience with choice&consequence mechanics, did Neverwinter Nights 2, Fallout: New Vegas and Alpha Protocol (which I highly recommend - an underrated gem).But PoE is their first game that I really cannot enjoy. Why? Because after the very nice character creation and the tutorial the game destroys its atmosphere directly after arriving in the first village.- Boring party members. Boring backstory, no romancing, no depth.- Poor quest design - you get too little information during your quest and cannot ask enough questions, or you cannot select the option that you would expect to solve the corresponding issue. This makes your decisions totally random and unsatisfying.- Some people or factions are obviously evil, you have more than significant proof against them - and nobody cares.- You can be a death Godlike which is usually killed directly after birth as it is a bad sign or sth like that - but nobody makes you feel it. You expect a world with problems, racism, corruption and in the description it is there. But when you play, you don't feel it at all.- Why so many blobs, spiders, elemental fogs or little lizard warriors to kill? Most enemies are horribly boring.- Was it really necessary to put dozens or even hundreds of unnecessary kickstarter backer-inspired characters into the game, which totally break the atmosphere? The story (which doesn't flow well) basically announces a dark adventure, but you find places with lots colourfully styled NPCs... which have no purpose at all. They are just there and destroy the feeling.- The game world doesn't breath as almost nobody cares about your reputation or race. Other games told so much more about individual problems, social topics (racism etc.) and political issues.You find examples for wasted potential everywhere in the game. It feels like a spiritual successor of Baldur's Gate 1, leaving out every innovation or good example in quest design and story telling of the last 17 years.You can make a retro RPG, yes. But is it wise to leave out all the good ideas that Baldur's Gate 2, Dragon Age: Origins, Mass Effect or the Witcher series gave is in the last years? I don't think so.I'd rate this 5/10 if you play it in English, but only 4/10 if you play in German. The German translation is the worst I've seen in 20 years of gaming - a real insult towards my native language. Did those people even know that they were translating a fantasy RPG, or a computer game at all? There are weird mistakes in every sentence, words left out, wrong translations, incorrect formal speech, wrong formulations in the context... You get the strong feeling that the translator(s) had no idea at all about what they were doing.			"

												Still wondering if this game worth your money? YES!This is the game I waited for so many years. If you miss such CRPGs like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, you will love this game! Updated: After playing this game for 20+ hours I only managed to finish the first act, and not because the main quest is long and boring, I was distracted by the great number of secondary quests which are as much interesting as the main story and less cliche. In this game you don't need to go and kill 10 rabbits to get a reputation from some guy. The story here is deep and catch you till the end. As you play you feel that you have much more freedom than in some of the modern RPG. Your choices aren't so evident, most of the times you can't say if it's going to add you the certain reputation or not. You choose by your concious (or your character's). I love how much of in control you feel.It feels like Baldur's Gate by the look of it and it's game mechanics, but it also feels modern, bringing CRPG to the new level. Any character can equip any item, but some classes will handle those items better than others. I love how instead of DnD alignment system they added their own personality system that depends on your choices in game. Like punching people? People will call you aggressive. Or maybe your character prefers diplomatic solution. All those characteristics also open more choices during dialogs.This game is not ideal, it still have some bugs, which I hope will be fixed soon. Your stronghold feels kinda useless, at first I was quite excited and spent much money to build it up, but then it almost gave me nothing and you want more from it. Your companions are great, they are interesting and each has their own story, but they don't have much impact on your story, and maybe I spoiled by BioWare games, but you don't feel so bound to them, they are your companions, not friends. There are no fightings between them like there was between Viconia and Keldorn. You can't romance them too. Pros:+ Freedom of choices+ Great secondary quests+ Huge beautiful and interesting world+ Roleplay+ The gameplay you know from BG series, but now it's even better!Cons:- Stronghold that you don't really need- Your companions are interesting guys but they have almost no impact on the story- Some minor bugs			"

												My opinion is kinda split on this one. the one hand the writing is compelling, the character and party options are staggering, the art is pretty, the quest solution options are plentiful, and the dungeons have a decent variety of traps and secrets.However, there are some issues that dragged down my enjoyment of the game.  Melee is based around ""engagements"" where a melee unit gets a free attack if an enemy tries to retreat from it. However, this also applies if the enemy tries to shift at all.  This is... problematic in the narrow corridors and dungeons that make up half of the combat arenas, with maybe one or two of your units clogging a doorway that could fit four if engagment allowed shifting of positions.  I now loathe this mechanic, which could be fixed by simply allowing units to slide around each other without breaking engagement.The interface is muddy at best.  Battles are obscured behind a cloud of muddy particle effects that don't settle until one or the other side is dead, leaving you looking at a cluster of indistinguishable green and red circles and imagining the epic battle that must be going on under the looney-tunes cloud of dust. I'm a fan of taking tactical advantage of terrain in a fight, and this game did nothing to scratch that itch.  Different dungeons are tactically interchangable.  I was particularly disappointed by several abilites with strong pushback being thwarted by the fact that every deadly cliff and pit of acid is guarded by an invisible wall.  After a while I found myself using the exact same opening combo of brute-force abilties to defeat mooks and bosses alike, leaving the majority of my characters' talents unused.I wish I could recommend it wholeheartedly.  But I'm not sure slogging through another dozen fights to catch the story are worth it.`			"

												The full review can be found on Start 2 Continue[start2continue.com].Excerpt:I will admit, I was but a wee lad when Baldur’s Gate first came out back in 1998. I watched my father play it and gave it a try myself (as good as a six-year-old could, at least) and I remember being so enraptured by the story and universe. Aside from the lore of Warcraft, it was Baldur’s Gate that helped shape my understanding of high fantasy--not Lord of the Rings, as many people seem surprised by.Since then, the original developers of Baldur’s Gate have shuffled around the past few years, some of them sticking together, others branching out on their own projects, though it seems to be common to equate Obsidian Entertainment as the most direct successor of the original Black Isle Studios. Obsidian’s known for some pretty high profile stuff in recent years: South Park: The Stick of Truth; Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II; Fallout: New Vegas (and, in a past life, the original two Fallout games), among others....I definitely recommend Pillars of Eternity to any and all gamers, especially those who have been yearning for an RPG like the good ol’ days. Though it was made with a target audience in mind, the fact that this game is easily one of the best games of 2015 thus far, but its achievements and what it represents for Kickstarter projects, crowdfunding, and honoring quality and the passion of game development, as well as the amount of power we gamers have, keeping Obsidian afloat in what seemed to be a last ditch fundraising effort… this is one for the history books.I’d be so bold as to say that Pillars of Eternity is the cRPG equivalent to Skyrim: it exhibits mastery, charm, and a standard of excellence that ought to make Obsidian proud, and that other developers should strive for.

												It's a role playing game that stomps out any sort of role playing or fun.  It's all about meta gaming and ignoring the poorly thought out game mechanics.  All the best stuff or stuff that even works, involves doing something boring, like playing 4-6 characters all of the same class.  You go on any forum full of veteran players and ask them what the best party comp is, and it'll be something stupid like 6 rangers, or 2 fighters and 4 rangers.  Or other asshattery.  There are tanking classes and builds, but they're worthless in every sense, pretty much just wasting a party slot with an otherwise gimped character.  When I beat path of the damned dificulty, the games hardest, I didn't even use a tank.  But my roleplay party that I wanted to do for fun with my own characters in a 3 man party can't even beat normal because I brought a tank.  The way ""tanking"" works, is by a poorly done ""engagement"" mechanic.  It works a bit like attacks of opportunity in D&D, your tank, with talents that allow them to engage more then one enemy, runs up and engages the group of enemies, discouraging them from just running by and attacking your squishy DPS characters. EXCEPT THEY DO ANYWAY.  Because all you get for disengaging, is a free attack from the character who is engaging.  So basically, the tank lovetaps them with whatever pathetic amount of damage and whatever worthless one handed weapon you put on them and probably misses or grazes due to their pathetic accuracy because of all the armor and lack of perception.  I put all the talents I could for engagement on my tank, ran up to aggro a group of six mobs, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM STAYED BEHIND TO FIGHT THE TANK.  All the rest of them just filed past, each taking one engagement free hit for♥♥♥♥♥♥damage and just running to my backline.  So the only way to properly tank, is to use funnels and corridors that are only one body wide, or use two tanks in wider corridors, which makes the whole engagement mechanic useless anyway, because you're physically blocking them from going past.  When Pillars of Eternity 2 comes out, I really hope they rethink disengagement, because the whole mechanic is just terrible.  A free hit is nothing, even if you have to disengage from a DPS.  The AI knows this, and abuses the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it, especially on your tank.  There needs to be a talent that causes disengagement hits to have a large chance to knockdown, daze, something, even just remove it entirely would be better and rely on positioning for tanking, because an engaged tank is a tank that can't reposition without getting melted by six free hits just by stepping slightly to the left.  Because as it is right now, it's pretty much use all fighters, or use no fighters.  The strongest party compositions are ones packed full of multiple amounts of one or two diferent classes, rather then a mix.  And I find this infuriatingly boring.I've been told a lot that the solution is to just trim the dificulty down, but it's just extremely unsatisfying when you do.  Like, there might as well only be 3 dificulties.  Easy, Normal, and Path of the Damned.  There are two other dificulties that I honestly could not tell the diference between.  Story, which is supposed to be easier then easy, but I sure couldn't notice.  Hard, which is supposed to be harder then normal, but again I couldn't notice.  The gap between easy and normal is utterly ridiculous.  In normal, an encounter would be like one or two boss mobs, with 4-6 minions with him.  In easy, the same encounter would be just one or two regular mobs.  Thats a HUGE diference.  A ridiculous diference.  You couldn't make anything between that?  Don't get me wrong, I still like the game and what it's trying to do.  I bought it on gog, and then on steam when it was on sale with the white march expansion, but I'm really hoping that they see stuff like this and fix it for the sequel.  There's just nothing satisfying from watching your unique self made characters of a variety of classes, builds, backstorys that you roleplay out get destroyed, only to finally break down and reroll something stupid like 6 rangers, and boringly and utterly roflstomp the game in the hardest dificulty.

												If you're a fan of isometric RPGs, this is a must-have.That being said, if you aren't a fan of Iso-RPGs, or you don't know enough about them - this is an excellent game to start the genre with. It's not as brutal as Baldur's Gate straight out the door, unless you want it to be brutal as hell. The difficulty customization is extensive as all hell, from generic difficulties to Iron Man to even more customizations in expert mode settings. You can set the game up as hard as you want, and the actual in-game customization options are intuitive for new players as well.An excellent addition to the Iso-RPG genre, and I hope we get even more!

												If you like old school RPG's or if you want to try one but with modern graphics then I fully recommend PoE. The story is great, combat is deep and challenging, the world looks fantastic and theres potentially hundreds of hours of content.Right now the game is on sale for just under £15, at this price I would wholeheartly recommend getting PoE even if you havent played similar games. At its full price you may want to do a bit of research before paying £35 as this style wont be for everyone, the game is challenging especially if you're new to the genre.Updated: I never managed to bring myself to finish PoE, I believe this is because while I did enjoy the graphics, combat and elements of the main story, I felt the world building left a lot to be desired. The problem being that despite having played similar games with PoE I could never truly get into the lore or gain an understanding of the overall world because it simply didn't hold my interest and at times felt a tad like generic fantasy. Plus the NPC's and gravestones created by the contributors to the kickstarter are just plain horrible, rarely holding useful infomation and often breaking my immersion, its always dissapointing to see an interesting looking character and find out its another of these contributor made NPC's. The game would be better of without them, they add nothing but constantly break immersion.I would still recommend the game when on sale but I wouldn't recommend it for full price.			"

												I just cannot put this game down! My first attempt didn't go so well since I had made some critical errors on my class decision and I didn't want to put it on Easy mode for any portion of the game. Second attempt has got me loving the Druid, I mean... game, more than ever. To help out I recommend reading some non spoiler guides from the lovely folks on the discussion board since there is quite a learning curve with this game if you're not familiar with the type. The community for this game has been great from what I can tell so far. Personal recommendations: Save often. Take time to really try out every single spell you have in a fight, re-load it and try it all over again with new spells. Reason being, is that I didn't understand most of the spells initially and whether they would have friendly fire, etc, so give em a shot, you'll be glad you mastered your lvl 1,2 spells even at the end game. Watch your positioning - tailor the custom formation to maximize party. These are just a few key things that had barred me from continuing the game initially and I don't want anyone else to lose out on this game because of it. Above all, be prepared to dive off into a story that'll have you thinking about it every time you exit the game!			"

												Good:+ Engaging story. I even read some of the in-game books, unlike in Elder Scrolls games.+ Fantastic companion voice dialog.+ Morally ambiguous decisions and factions.+ It's stable. I've had it crash on me once in 45+ hours of play.+ Just an addictive and rewarding play experience.+ Lots of game for your money. I'm 45 hours in, and estimate that I'm less than halfway done. And there are chacter classes I haven't even tried yet.Bad:- Terrible framerates and loading times. - Not enough graphics settings.- Not nearly enough variability in terms of character and gear appearence.- NPCs don't feel real, They don't follow daily routines, just stand in the same place forever.- Obnoxious kickstarter-related content.- Your party members will sometimes get stuck or wander away from battles at the worst times.Overall, it's a very good game that could be made into an excellent game if more work is put into optimization. This is 2016, I shouldn't need to sit through a 15 second loading screen just to enter a one-room hut, and then again when I exit. And a system that can run Skyrim smoothly shouldn't struggle to achieve 30fps with this game. I'm hoping for a good optimization patch. There should also be an option to disable kickstarter content, because the game world is infested with NPCs that can't talk, and tombstones with immersion-destroying text. With all it's flaws, though, I still think it's fun as hell.			"

Posted: March 3, 2016
												After supporting the game on Kickstarter (one of very few games I supported), after patiently waiting for two part expansion to get released, I finally played Pillars of Eternity in it's complete current 3.x version and it was an amazing adventure to have. All of my expectations were met and exceeded and not just because we sadly lacked games with truly great stories for the past decade, but because even if there were many, Pillars would be just as great. It's everything you loved about Black Isle, early Bioware, Troika and, of course, Obsidian themselves, but perfected, taken to a new level, despite the very nostalgic interface. It's simple enough to get sucked into it, but complex and deep enough not to be a very fast food-ish feeling game a lot more recent AAA RPGs have become.So what is Pillars of Eternity with both parts of White March expansion and latest patch? It's an RPG with an active pause and Infinity Engine-inspired aesthetic. But where Infinity Engine felt restrictive in later games, both technologically and storytelling mechanics-wise, where D&D rulesets felt restrictive for the stories BioWare and especially Black Isle wanted to tell, Obsidian made something perfectly suited for their needs. The inteface is highly customisable and smart, technologically the game is much less restricted and the ruleset they created for their world is a joy to play with. You pretty much cannot create a ""bad character"" unless you try to (and if you do something you regret you can respec easily). All mechanics and ideas complement the concept of you playing the game the way you want and shaping the story the way you want. It isn't as freeform as what Fallout tried to be, but wow it is trying and is much more flexible than even Planescape: Torment. As an example - combat itself doesn't give you experience now, so you never feel like you NEED to kill everything you see and doing things in other ways is perfectly viable. And the idea of very text adventure-like segments that focus even more on your deeds and abilities to do things normal gameplay wouldn't allow is an incredibly smart decision.The adventure itself is structured close to how the original Baldur's Gate worked (a region where you open new destinations on the world map to go to), but every map tries to bring something new, something unique, something exciting to learn and do. The world lore, the main story, mini stories, companion stories are very fun and try to ask interesting questions and put new perspectives on what you think you already know. In the way how deep and amazing story is, I wouldn't even compare it to Baldur's Gate games, but more to Planescape: Torment or probably a bit of Arcanum. Now, in the White March part 1, story is considerably simpler (and the events take place as an extension of the main story, not as a post-game thing), but part 2 brings back the excitement of the main game topics and questions game asks of you, even if it's still not as great as the main game.There are, of course, some nitpicks to be had. Loadings for every map, for example, do become frustrating even if it was the only way to preserve the pre-rendered beauty of the backgrounds, especially since as you play longer game seems to start becoming ""heavier"" for the system. There are rather frustrating AI things as in the fight all party members seem to follow very simple pathing algorithms and can block each other without any logic to go around or shuffle to the side without breaking engadgement with the enemy. The party AI and presets, on the other hand, are very good most of the time, so it's just weird to see pathing being so much of an issue. And there are also some occasional glitches - wrong script triggers, character getting thrown over the path boundries and getting stuck there forever, controls just refusing to work suddenly and even few crashes. These happened VERY rarely, but they did.These things aside, however, I had fantastic time with Pillars of Eternity and it's two-part expansion and I'd recommend the game to anyone who loves a really great story that you help shape the way you want. One of the best RPGs in a decade, probably best game from Obsidian so far and and adventure to be had. I really wish there will be more games in this universe.			"

												I learned about ""Pillars of Eternity"" when it was already done and it took me by surprise. In 2015 being able to play a classic RPG from the creators of Fallout, Arcanum and Baldur's Gate is a real treat.Overall I had a good time playing ""Pillars of Eternity"". The main storyline is quite interesting to follow. The world is very detailed, has its own history, gods, nations. There are very different characters you can travel with, each having goals and views.Graphics, music and sound effects are superb!The game has A LOT of text. It is very well written and most of the time interesting to read. But sometimes it adds nothing to the story and is just boring. In that case you can always skip it. You won't miss important information because it is recorded in the Journal.I've found combat system to be difficult to understand. Never learned how to use enemy vulnerabilities against them. It helped that I played on ""Easy"" and so didn't have many problems killing the monsters.The most annoying thing for me were long loading screens. Even when you go to the other floor in the same building a loading screen shows up for half a minute. It is unaccaptable in 2015 with all the resources current computers have!I don't think ""Pillars of Eternity"" is as great as its predecessors, but it is very good and is very much worth playing if you like good old RPGs.Now waiting for the documentary to come out!

												I'm not typically one for top down RPG's nor am I a fan of squad or party managment. But I have to give it to the kickstarter community on this one. I freaking love this game. I'm playing on easy expert and I don't really know what I'm doing at this point. However the reason I love this game so much is because it's not about getting to the end, grinding, or blindly rushing into fights. It is instead an adventure at the core. I stealth around dungeons because I don't know whats waiting. I cautiously talk to npc's read through the text and lore looking for clues. I really feel like its an adventure and not just something to waste my time at. I'm driven by the unkown in this game. The mystery and the oh so amazing sketch's and text when doing actions. My imagination is being driven wild and I love every moment of it. In summary if you enjoy challenge, and adventure than this game is for you.			"

It's the ""Baldur's Gate 3"" that never happened and much more, features multiple ways how to solve a quest, heck, there is no best way how to play, there is just one of many ways. So: love it.

												Pros:- Nice environments, good level design, beautiful backgrounds.- Great music (!) and sound effects.- Great storytelling, writing and atmosphere. The world calls out to be explored.- The main plot is mature and engaging, the world well built, the lore rich and deep. More in line with Planescape: Torment than BG or Neverwinter Nights.- Voice acting is a bit of a mixed bag (Grieving Mother, Kana, Aloth), but mostly good (Eder, Sagani, Durance, Lady Webb).- OMG moments, like entering Gilded Vale for the first time, or talking to Uscgrim or the animancy hearing at the Duc's.- Chanter's 'The Thunder Rolled like Waves on Black Seas' invoked that badass feeling no other iso game ever did for me.Cons:- Combat may get boring after a while, as the vast majority of encounters feel repetetive. You gain access to several classes and a crapload of abilities, but in the end it all makes little to no difference on the actual gameplay. Sometimes less is more. Original Sin it isn't.- The engagement mechanic, coupled with terrible pathfinding, dumb collisions and your own party members blocking each other is more of an annoyance than anything else.- Random difficulty spikes, eg. Sky Dragon or the final fight...- ... yet paralysis/petrificacion + spell nuke will easily win every boss fight within seconds.- Certain parts of the dialogue tree are voiced while others are not. Additionally you get a lot of written storytelling in between, which is totally ignored by the voice actors. The game can't really decide whether you should be reading or listening, and this in turn breaks immersion a lot. - A minor gripe, which is the Kickstarter content, eg. meaningless NPCs stories and cheesy tombstone memorials. Makes you ignore most yellow NPCs after a while.- The Keep feels like an afterthought.- Bugs. Played it twice, the first time on hard but got stuck in the final dungeon due to a bug. Second time on normal+expert mode. Overall an enjoyable experience, writing and atmosphere is where the game really shines, while what it lacks is some meaningful, well designed combat encounters. Never been a fan of the BG series, so I'd place it before BG1 and BG2, but certainly after PS:T. Verdict: 8/10			"

												To anyone wanting to get into the CRPG genre, then I can completely recommend this game. I grew up with RPG's in the vain of Skyrim and the modern Fallout's and while these were good games, there was something missing from the experience. I felt this most acutely from Fallout 4, where many of the key role-playing aspects and the impact of your choices in the world felt incredibly limited. Seeking out a more true role-playing experience, I decided to give Pillars of Eternity a go, despite having never played a game in the CRPG genre. I'm very happy I did. This game offers you a great story, an original world, interesting characters, fun quests, Obsidian's brilliant writing and impactful choices. The combat is a bit clunky in places, but it didn't come close to ruining the experience for me. If you want to experience a true RPG, then look no further than Pillars of Eternity.			"

												I do not have too much experience with CRPG's, but I fell in love with this game. I like to compare it to Dragon Age Origins, the first and best game in the trilogy, or Knights of the Old Republic but with a top down isometric view. The action is very satisfying and complex. I really like the ability to pause or slow down the action at any time because my god there is a lot going on. You can have up to 5 other companions and the party compisition is limitless. Do you want 6 rangers with 6 bear companions? go for it. How about 6 Fiery Godlike fighters, soaking up massive amounts of damage and hardly losing any health. Do you want to be a good guy in every conversation, or gain some dark side points and be a d*** to everyone, the choice is yours. Give the game a few hours and if you like RPG's at all, you will fall in love with Pillars too.			"

The way they put together these worlds and the lore behind them is very well done. Speaking of lore, just like the Elder Scrolls Games, there are a whole crap ton of lore books if you wanna read them (for all you lore nerds).ALSO YOU GET TO ACTUALLY CREATE YOUR PARTY MEMBERS THROUGH A HIRING SYSTEM AND I FRAKING LOVE IT!!!!The story gets more and more interesting as it goes on. I don't want to spoil more so you are just gonna get out your wallet if you want more of the story.No not to buy the game, to pay me you dipstick.But seriously, great game, good character design, story is muy gooderino, worth the 30 bucks I payed for it (it was on sale lol)			"

												This game is the closest thing to the RPG of old that I've been salivating to experience again after almost two decades. Everything, every part, every detail falls into place perfectly. The plot, pacing, and main story grips you the minute you get into it. Character building is as good as role playing is going to get. While Baldur's Gate 2's RTwP combat was fun for its time, this game needed to be better and modernized and they delivered exactly that experience. If the old infinity games were to be made today, it would have been Pillars of Eternity.9.5. Amazing game.			"

			Subscribe: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheTroublmaker/ From Obsidian comes Pillars of Eternity, the latest in isometric RPGs.		

If you want to tell people that you played Baldur's Gate growing up there's no better way to fulfill that lie by playing a game like Baldur's Gate first.  No this is not Diablo light.  That would be Torchlight 2, which some would argue has now made Diablo 3 into Torchlight Light.  This is a game that is going to be closer to Fallout/Skyrim than it is going to be to Diablo.In it you control a party of heroes with a fully customizable adventure from what missions you choose, what results you pick, dialogue that effects how people interact with you, fully customizable 6-member party, fully customizable classes and simple and intuitive controls.The game is not beautiful.  I'm certain this game isn't even in HD.  But that shouldn't dissuade you from giving this mentally handicapped game a try, it's a lot of fun.ARE YOU INTO CRAFTING?  Yes, it has crafting.  And much like similar titles you gain experience through just about every single thing you do (except for walking because that would be really dumb).  Unlocked a door, awesome level up.  Better put more points in that door unlocking so I can get more experience from unlocking doors!It is truly a choose your own adventure game that you can play many many times with differing results.  In my first playthrough I played the role of the warmonger running around sweeping down enemies.  In my second playthrough I'm peacefully moving around looking for middle ground solutions to resolve everyone's issues.The biggest downside to the game is that you can't 100% it.  Apparently simply buying it doesn't mean you support the game.  Apparently only people who contributed to the initial kickstarter campaign are allowed to 100% the game.  Other than that (which seriously developers go ♥♥♥♥ yourself) the game is amazing.			"

												I don't consider myself a person who easily identifies with some pre-phrased choices given to me by the authors of an artificially constructed phantasy. I'm a person of science, never were a believer, and I certainly don't put a lot of value in certainty. Yet this game, with its story about belief, certainty and purpose manages to put tears into my eyes because during its final moments I'm suddenly overwhelmed by this sensation of being understood, because among all the fixed categories I'm given the option to deny categorism. Because while I'm making these choices, my faith in not putting blind faith into authorities is actually being tested. This is a game that has put questions into my mind, and I daresay I normally have very straight answers to the wannabe-challenging issues raised by people with a philosophical agenda. Given this dimension of storytelling, it should be obvious that this game is a literary work with a deep relevance to the questions of our time, and the fact that I can actually discuss it on this level makes it one of the most impressive games ever made. That said, you obviously have to be willing to deal with the game on some kind of intellectual level to be able to enjoy these things. I'm not even talking about technicalities like mechanics or graphics, which are also great btw.			"

												Has no proper highlighting of your active character in a battle. Pathfinding in combat is awful. No way to set up some abilities to auto-attack mode. No quest tracking and no proper descriptions in quests. Castle's facilities feel like a nice feature at first, but then you realize most of those don't bring anything. Silly trips around the global map to get a buff you need for a conversation but then it throws you into a dead end.With all nagging aside, a really good game, highly suggested. Divinity: Original Sin was still better though.			"

												A game made perfect by the dedication of those involved with it and the support of fans. The writing alone sets it apart, as it doesn't ever feel any need to pander to tired clichés or cater to the whims of ignorant marketing departments. It will surprise you. It will shock you. It will build you up and then knock you down, and you will never see it coming. It will give you triumph, and snatch it away, because a true story is never quite so simple as that.Are you still reading this? You should be playing this game for yourself.  What are you waiting for?It's not entirely without its flaws, as there are some bugs and other issues that mar it, but honestly, it's better than any triple-A title you could name in every way, shape, or form. You're still reading. Why?			"

												For all those who started out with the Baldurs Gate series, and been longing back to that, this is the game to pick up. It's the same backbone layout, a new story, and improvements to the gameplay that actually feels ""Baldurs Gate"". The only issue for me is that I played the BG games too much, so my progress in this game is very slow since I only play it for some time once in a while.There's alot of stuff to explore though it seems, alot of features to use, and for players used to the old Interplay RPGs the new features are very intuitive.

												While Pillar's of Eternity is a good game, and I bought it to support the genre, I do NOT recommend it to fellow CRPG fans on a tight budget. As many reviews suggest this game could be seen as a successor to Infinity engine games (ie Baldur's Gate), but only from a mechanical standpoint. Saying this game is the _spiritual_ successor to games like Baldur's Gate is an overstatement, and maybe even offensive..With that in mind, I will anchor my review to two key Infinity engine games (Baldur's Gate 1 and 2) to show what is missing. There are lots of reviews highlighting what's good in this game, but I hope this comparison gives a better picture of what NOT to expect.- To start with don't expect an immersive story. It's very difficult to justify and be part of the main quest. Without any spoilers, certain things happen to the PC, but it's absolutely not worth going through life dangering situations. Like, really.. This leaves you doing stuff because the journal says you should, not because you are interested.- Characters are very shallow and predictable. Banter options are limited, Remember unforgettable party members from BG 1 or 2? Not gonna have them here.- The main villian isn't interesting and doesn't feel like a real threat. Jon Irenicus (or also Sarevok for that matter) were scary mysterious figures. Both were real threats and hooked the player into the game. Same cannot be said for this game's villian.- Quests aren't interesting or satisfying. Yes, there are different ways to solve almost every quest, and that is a fresh new take, but the actual content of most side quests is just meh. There has been way more focus on giving the player options, but the developers haven't seem to have thought as much about why you would want to be involved in the first place.- Walls of text, everywhere. While the writing is impressive (and I thought hard whether I should even mention this bullet), everything is extremely wordy and sometimes reading all that text on a screen becomes so exhausting, it makes one think whether there is something as too much content.- Worst of all, there are a crapload of features that are just Kickstarter bonuses and all of them come at the expense of immersion. And the only response to ""why?"" is ""because money""..For these reasons, I do NOT recommend this game,  unless you are a fellow fan of the genre or the game goes on a crazy discount.			"

												Pillars of Eternity is an uneven, yet excellent game.  Without spoiling anything, the story follows your made character as they get exposed to, basically, dark magic and is granted the ability to read souls. From here, you pursue your Nemesis across the realm in an attempt to find meaning and answer.At times, Pillars is completely brilliant. The first 1 1/2 acts of the game is some of the best I've played. The story is riveting, the characters are interesting, the combat is complex and there's promise of some cool upcoming features that are hinted at in these early segments.Unfortunately, the game mostly falls apart about halfway through Act II. The game loses any semblance of challenge it had, the story and characters and insane amount of side-quests all kinda boggle among themselves and the writing drops a few notches. You'll likely find yourself starting to get bored nearing the end of Act II (also right when I hit the level cap) and rush your way through Acts III and IV. There are some cool features that I was excited about that don't seem to go anywhere. Building your own keep was a cool idea I haven't seen implemented anywhere in a game like this, but it actually does absolutely nothing in the game. Money is pretty infinite by the time you start building your keep. At that point, it's just time-gated. You can take prisoners.. but why? They just sit there doing nothing, occasionally offering bribes to be released. The crafting and enchanting systems are useless. Consumables are a joke (often taking longer to consume than they heal or buff). Some spells are ridiculously overpowered (Level 5 mage Charm is insanely powerful). Even with all of this, I highly recommend this game. The visuals are fun, the characters and plot are largely interesting. The dialogue paths numerous and the endings multiple. The combat in the first half of the game is near perfect until you start getting overpowered. Tl;dr: Pillars of Eternity has a slew of great ideas, some poorly or half implemented. But the core gameplay is amazing, the story is fantastic and the characters are interesting. The game is also 65+ hours long (supposedly 80-90 if you do all the content, but I rushed Act III and didn't do much in the way of side quests) and has a ton of content. B+			"

That's the ideal point to start the DLC so you have some time to decide if you like the game or not before buying The White March. (Part 2 is absolutely epic.)			"

You can learn as little or as much as you want about everything (e.g. by talking with your companions, reading the books and item descriptions, doing side-quests...) I really appreciated being able to resolve quests and problems using other skills than always Might/violence, and the game mechanics reward this well in general as XP is given for making progress in quests rather than simply going on rampages - though that's an option too, of course.

												Excellent successor to Baldurs Gate. Took me nearly 80 hours to finish (with White March) and I don't claim to have done all the sidequests.Pros:- Atmosphere, story, art- Usually (in sidequests) there is no clear 'evil' or 'good' which side you can take. For example: Animancy is the study of spirits. Animancers try to find the cure to the disease that plaque Dyrwood. But it is also very close to necromancy. When do the deeds they make to further the study into the disease get 'evil'?- Black & White text- based scenes- Weapon enchanting, crafting from the loot/herbs- New ruleset (non D&D). Especially differentation of endurance from health is great idea!- StrongholdCons:- Loading times between maps are quite long (2.01)- New rule set (non D&D). Takes some time to get into. To see what attributes matter to what classes etc etc. Gladly the White March expansion lets you rebuild your character- Stronghold. Could have had something more to make the place livelier.Also could have some better indicator which map/dungeon is for which level characters. Got stomped a few times when venturing forth to a wrong area at a wrong time (especially in WM dlc)Rating: 9.5			"

												Pillars of Eternity set about to be the spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment.Nailed it.Offering a wide variety of difficulty options and many ways to play, this game is both a reminder of our past for those of us who enjoyed the afforementioned games as youngsters, and a great primer for the genre (and, dare I say, a possible fresh start for the genre?) for neophytes to it.If you enjoyed the old D&D games (or similar ones, such as Arcanum) you'll want to experience this fantastic journey.If you haven't played any of this genre before, but like epic story telling, challenging tactical combat, some of the best voice acting *ever* in a video game, and gorgeous immersive worlds, give PoE a try. It will test your tactics and your morals in the best possible way. Expect some small stumbling blocks if you've never played a game like this before, so if you're not comfortable getting used to a new style of game you may not want to pick this up before watching some let's plays of it. By an hour or two in you'll be as comfortable with PoE mechanics as you've been with any others.Story: 10/10Strong, engaging, exciting.Music: 8/10Fantastic sound track, only complaint is that there's not more of it.Art/World: 10/10Mind bogglingly gorgeous in every possible wayCombat: 7/10Can be heavy on micromanagement on harder difficulties, may take some getting used to the unique systems, otherwise greatRoleplay: 10/10Immersive roleplaying with tons of dialogue options that help you really connect with your character. Choices make noticeable impacts on the game world and often have ramifications down the roadOverall: 9/10One of my all time favorite games already, and I still have tons left to explore. In a word (well, two): Buy it.			"

												I'm still working through this game after about a year now. I really like the engine, most of the lore, and a lot of the interactions in the game including character development, text based challenges, etc. The thing that really holds this game back is the horrid combat. Perhaps it is more accurate to call it a spiritual successor to Torment than to Baldur's Gate games, as the combat is just in the way of everything else. The pace is ridiculous, you can't tell what is going on half the time, the spells are all random combinations of any of 20 friggin' status effects (do we really need stuck, dazed, prone, stunned, and paralyze to be separate things?). On top of that, you can't even prepare for battle beforehand, which was one of the most important aspects of Baldur's Gate. Honestly, what is the point of stealth if you can't scope out the area beforehand and then buff?Finally, the enemies, while beautiful, are irritating as hell. No matter how hard you try to prepare and protect your squishies, they can literally teleport on top of them OR teleport them to themselves without any way to stop them. Also, there are enemies that literally stun with every hit, which permastuns anyone they attack. I can't comprehend that the developers actually played through their own game and found combat fun.I really hope they slow down the pace of combat, allow preparation, and generally make it more like Baldur's Gate combat if they decide to make another game. And FFS, allow coop.I would only recommend this game if you are the biggest CRPG fan out there, and even then it will disappoint you with some of the design choices.			"

												I had high hopes for this game. Added it to me wishlist back when it first showed up on Steam.  I did not pick it up however till it was on sale for 50% off. It had many good reviews, so I gambled and bought it.  It's not a bad game, the story is decent enough so far. I can't say it really grabbed me, and made me not want to stop playing like other games have in the past. Some of the game mechanics, while novel, I just don't care for.  Healing your health is only possible by camping or spending the night at an Inn.  This is seperate from Endurance, which I believe everyone can heal at some point in the game with magic, talents, or abilities, etc. I have heard there are healing potions, but, as of yet, have not found any myself. It might just be the old school RPG player in me, but, this system seems very counter intuitive.  If I just got mauled by a bear, how is spending the night in an Inn or camping in a tent going to heal those wounds up, and yet the classes that in most RPG's online or pen and paper, that can traditionally heal with magic, can't do anything but restore endurance...which is what I consider to happen while resting in an Inn or elsewhere, to do. I have seen several comment on this in various forums, saying it creates a challenge, or finite resource, yadda yadda.  It's a deal breaker for me.  I'm not playing an RPG, for the challenge of deciding how to reduce how many times I have to go stay at an inn or buy more camping gear. But, that's just me I guess.Visually, it's a good looking game. Some of the maps are a bit small, but, everything I have seen so far, looks good. Spell effects and lighting are well done.Character creation is fairly in depth.  Various choices can create different play styles from the same class. Classes are not restricted to certain weapons and armor, which I did like.  The weapons and armor do have tradeoffs, such has speed of attack, recovery time after using abilities, etc. This in itself creates a new challenge of optimizing your gear to suit your abilites and combat/play style. One of the concepts that I could work with.Combat is fast paced, and had many options to autopause on various events happening. Also several options for the AI behavior during combat. Although a few times, it seemed like the AI was doing it's own thing, regardless of the settings I had selected. Overall, just not my cup of tea I guess. Would rather play Balders Gate again or fire up Neverwinter Nights.  I wish I had done a bit more research on it. But that is just speaking for me.			"

												This is without a doubt one of the best games I have played in a long time and I've only clocked 11 hours of playtime.The soundtrack is just amazing and it really sets an atmosphere for the game, especially at key story moments and in combat, the wide variety of combat tracks is impressive on its own. The visuals are brilliantly crafted, in my personal opinon making it look better then most games these days simply because of the brilliant art style that obsidian have used, it  truely is nostalgic and gorgeous.The character creation is also extremely impressive for a game which doesnt even allow you to see your character closely except in the inventory menu, allowing you to give your character a personal touch, from a variety of races, cultures,classes and backstories along with a generous amount of voices to choose from.The lore of the universe is also extremely interesting along with the intriguing storyline which I have yet to unravel.Overall I would recommend Pillars of Eternity for anyone who is a big RPG fan, especially of old-school RPGs. This game truely has restored my love of RPG's as It has been too long since there was one as great as this.			"

												I know I just scratched the surface so far but... holy crap is this game awesome! The look is just gorgeous and it takes you back to the younger days of PC gaming where the games were hand drawn and they had ""a soul"" (no pun intended). The gameplay is just right - meaning it IS hard and you will be punished for blindly running into the fights. However, it's not as clunky as the fights in Baldur's gate were, and having the fights in real time instead of turn-based makes it even better.Pausing the fight is a must and there's no way you can kill anything in a group larger than 2 without some tactics. Especially in tight areas or smaller rooms where you can't fit your whole party. There's a decent number of side-quests and lore, as well as side-characters that have their own stories to discover. The only remark I have are the long loading screens you encounter when you leave/enter each zone. But it's not a big deal.If you consider yourself a RPG lover, and you want a huge nostalgia fix at the same time, just stop reading this already and get the game.			"

												I played through the game but didn't find myself enjoying it. Cannot recommend.Here are some reasons why:Exposition is overwhelming.Very combat oriented conflict solving. I expect more from CRPGs nowadays.Endurance/Health: Overly complex HP system. I understand the purpose but didn't like the implementation.World lore is kinda cool but often forced fed to the player and presented in places where it doesn't really seem to fit naturally.Main plot line doesn't direct the player to do sidequests, gain xp or improve gear; even though high level and decent gear is required for the final battle. Following main plot only results you being in the final battle with inadequate means to solve it.""Upgrade your castle""-minigame felt unnecessary and tacked on. I felt like I should care but main plot seemed to forget it right after introduction. "

												If you like Baldur's Gate, play this game. If you like infinitely non-linear, richly detailed, story-driven experiences, play this game. If you like complex, strategic party-based combat, play this game. If you like to get straight into the action or prefer to spend hours sinking your teeth into every fine detail, play this game. And if you have doubts over crowdfunding, play this game.			"

												The beauty of this game is not measured in its engaging and engrossing gameplay. Not measured in its old-school, yet wonderfully painterly visuals. Not measured in its thoughtful and expansive story and writing.The beauty is that publishers the world over said a game in this style, inspired by the Infinity Engine, would not be successful, and they were proved wrong.

												At launch I might not have recommended it, but after a good chunk of patching it's an acceptable Infinity Engine-like. You should play on hard/very hard and with ""Expert"" mode to be closer to proper, but it's an alright game. Your choices matter very little in terms of the story (Even worse than the Baldur's Gate games. For example, PoE party members won't attack you or leave the party based on your actions/inaction) but for a party-based combat game s'ok.			"

												Grade: 88/100I love this game.  It isn't perfect.  However, besides Divinity Original Sin, this is the best thing since toasted bread.  Nothing is better than throwing the difficulty all the way up, and setting it for trial of iron.  Nothing like really caring if your character dies (No pause/task manager quits either).  It isn't perfect, but it's great.  Pros(1) strategy - depending on the level you play at, you better take a moment to seriously consider how you are going to win a fight.(2) Party makeup choice - I have played with several different party make ups, and there really is no right way to play.  (3) customizable/toggleable difficulty(4) detail(5) There are some cool things to try - for example kill everyone at the initial camp site and be amazed at the gem you get for that accomplishment.Cons(1) The game has a very convoluted plot.  I'd say that it has as much or more backstory as the Dragon Age trilogy all stuffed into one game.(2) I don't feel that the choices are as meaningful as they should be.  I say that despite some choices leading to some straight-forward different consequences.  But in a game where you can kill a mad duke, there should be some more serious world shaking consequences.(3) Some minor things: No multi-classing, bizarre over-complicated health/stamina system; and No Romance(4) My personal pet peeve in an RPG - the game doesn't respect rogues.  I think the the the entire rogue system is broke.  Everyone can sneak.  And the rogue has significant functionality in the game.  I recommend this game.  And it deserves a few play throughs.			"

												Lets face it: if you're looking at reviews for this game, then you either:A) have never heard of itB) don't know what cRPG or BG meanC) aren't going to buy itYes, it's a ""typical"" Obsidian game. It HAS a lot of bugs, BUT it has a TON of GREAT content to counter. The devs are actively working on ironing out the most serious bugs, so don't be worried. This is clearly a labor of love for them.The game has many welcome additions to the genre and the off-shoot from DnD means we get to experience some interesting mechanics. The AoE/distance marking(capable of being turned off) is truly awesome and helps greatly with setting up tactics on harder difficulties.At the end of the day, it brings me back to many old school games and fits right in(bugs and all). So if you're a fan of old classics like BG, IWD, basically ANYTHING on IE...then this is a game for you.			"

												The end of this game was so bad that I felt like I was watching Indiana Jones 4. If you want to make good game - try to invent good story first. If you can not do that, do not try to make a game. Also it was so funny when I got stuck in the end-game boss fight, because in this game - you have to be level 12 in the end of the game, or the boss will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ I was playing in the Iron Mode (only one save) and the game decided to save just before the fighting stated. Great. Just great. This game was not completely bad, but the story was so great disappointment to me, so I have to give this game only 6/10. And that verdict is that high because of Edér and Lady Webb (and good characters like those) and the beginning of the story and the good tactical-party based combat (before the end-game boss.)			"

												Excellent CRPG ""feel"" which includes fast (and sometimes chaotic) combat. Tons of customization for your character. Absolute industry best writting in a fantasy genre. Obsidian has also maintained support for Pillars of Eternity over the last year which includes 2 expansions that tie into one another. The White March. Additional support has comes in new abilities, NPC AI, new quests and on going balance and fixes. Obsidian is the type of developer you want to support in these days of big promises and shallow delivery. They have made a modern classic RPG that will be the bench mark of comparison for upcoming titles. My only negative perspective is that this game not meant for a casual gamer. It's clearly aimed at fans of RPGs who enjoy slow , built up story lines that require a LOT of reading. As a potential customer , you should be aware this game plays like an interactive novel more than Mass Effect , which I consider a action RPG.  "

												Crappy english incoming, you have been warned:(Skip this paragraph, if you don't care for my shattered dreams, please *sob*)I was so exited for this game... I fell for the crazy hope, that PoE would be like Neverwinter Nights 1/2, just better. I also played Icewinddale and Baldurs Gate (don't remember if 1 or 2). Both of them only for a bit, as they weren't my cup of tea at this time. But even though I didn't play them very long, I had way more fun. I actually remembering that until today(!).Like many other critics I really tried to like this game. First I thought it was kind of my fault for playing PoE the wrong way. So after some reading I tried it again (hence this amount of hours), because that always helped in the past. This time it didn't help. At all.I realised something:I just didn't care about my character, I didn't care about their companions and the 'plot' was like: ""Well, actually there isn't much plot, sweetheart, but you see, we had to kinda... stretch it for those 3 acts to fit in!""Sadly those things are exactly what is most important to me...This is just my opinion/experience. I can't tell you, if it will be the same for you. If you have to be economical (like me), don't buy it at full price. It's less annoying if you don't like it.			"

												This is the first CRPG of this quality since Mask of the Betrayer. It's well written, has tons of customization options and replay value, challenging optional encounters for hardcore players, but also with enough easy options for newcomers. The game is roughly 70 - 80 hours long if you try to do all of the content, so it's definitely worth its dollar value. I highly recommend this game to any longtime CRPG fans and anyone who is interested in getting into the genre.			"

												As a kickstarter backer of Project Eternity, I am swooning with joy right now!   After playing the public beta for a while and seeing how responsive the Obsidian devs were to some truly fantastic backer feedback, and by fantastic I mean there were some who really delved deep into the guts of the combat system, which initially wasn't received well at all, and in a mathematician kind of way that would make my eyes cross whenever I attempted to read through it,  I had a really good feeling about the game just from that, and when the launch date was pushed out to work on it some more for extra polish, I felt even more reassured.Then today when I launched the official game for the first time and played, as corny as it sounds, it really did feel like I was home again. It totally brought me back to the days of Baldurs Gate 1 & 2, the Icewind Dales, Planescape, etc . the games that would make hours seem to disappear in  minutes.  It's good to be home.			"

												Wanted to like this game but another one of those where you will end of saving every few seconds and some ways of implementing things that just make the game the opposite of fun.-Spell use - limited by number of casts between sleeps (meaning you better carry tons of firewood) .  Reminds me of C&C 4 and the depature from typical RTS.  Just makes the game un enjoyable. Some say they do this to make it more challenging and or casters are too powerful. I personaly would rather see less dmg on a caster with the ability for me to actually cast without having to rest.  Never knew micromanagement could be done in an RPG - these programmers found a way for that.- Gone with the Wind type texts for everything.   Overwelming amount of texts for the most simple things.Way overly compliacted.  You have 5 main upgrade choices on levels. Lore Scroll reading, Survival (consumable duration), Stealth,, Mechanics (lock picking), and Athletics.Typical RPG's use INT / STR / DEX / CON etc where you apply points into these when leveling - not here.  I only found gear could upgrade those and very modestly.  Items / Gear upgrades are very anti - exciting as you realize that any low level item can be ""enchanted"" to Exceptional / Superb which is the same as the drops you get from bosses - making the boss drops nothing special.  Endurance is now part of the equation similar to ""health"" - when your endurance hits zero you pass out (in a fight) but your health doesn't improve.  There is no healing or health potions - just endurance.  But you can die apprently if your health goes to zero. Not sure why not just sticking to basic Hitpoints was a bad thing.MOBS you kill give you virtually no xp - experience gain is mainly quest driven. The items dropped are just an overabundance of useless items maybe for potions or vendor trash.  One aspect I liked was owning a ""stronghold"" so you can rest there and get bonus'.  Initially it was great until you realize it's nightmare always attenidng to ""unwanted visitors"" that you have to pay off to not stay (it brings negative prestige) or escort and are constantly getting invaded that I have to go back to the stronghold (2 days travel) to fight.  You can have it auto resolve by hiring defenders that get paid but that means you can take damage to your stronghold.  Good idea that turned into more micromanagement.Some may like this unobvious level of micromanagement throughout the game- but I hated it.  I will almost guarantee most any person that plays this game will saving every few minutes if that gives an indicator of frustration.    The dragon fights (possible 3)  - I never got through any of them - not even close to defeating one (i was level 12 the max level).  The main battle at the end same thing.  I got to the end - but game so frustating - uninstalled the game with only 1 boss to kill at the end.			"

												Worked in Windows 8.1 with both nVidia and AMD cards.3/5 stars, but thumbs down (details below, includes minor spoiler about the existence of a game location).I paid $22.50 for this on sale, expecting something akin to a Baldur's Gate 2 experience. What I found was a strange ""fantasy"" story with inconsistent and not entirely logical insertion of low technology and Celtic references. The tepid story already had me on the fence as to whether I wanted to continue or not, but when I got to the  - Minor Spoiler - ...castle with the so-called ""endless"" dungeon underneath, I got annoyed and stopped playing. Now, don't get me wrong. I don't have a problem with dungeon crawler games per se, and I own a few rogue-likes; sometimes you just want to beat up some monsters. But this is supposed to be a story-based game, and a 15-level dungeon filled with a menagerie of monsters with no cohesive fictional basis for being there completely breaks any real immersion. Ogres on level 3! Vampires on level 8! Oozes! Beetles! Undead! A dragon on level 15! Can you imagine a 15-level dungeon filled with 22 different kinds of monsters underneath King's Landing in the Game of Thrones universe? Under Mount Doom in Middle-earth? It would feel silly. The ""endless"" dungeon in this game screams ""filler content to artificially increase play time"", not ""great fiction."" That gets my thumbs-down at the current price point of $45, as well as the $22.50 I paid. This is a thoroughly average $10 game.			"

												I wanted to like Pillars of Eternity. The thought of an independent, modern party-based RPG with pausable real-time combat was very appearling. The reviews that buzzed about the ""depth"" of the fantasy world in which the game had me looking forward to the experience of playing the game. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to the hype. Part of the problem is that the rich history (and it is rich, to be fair) of the world, Eora, is neither properly explored nor suitably limited in the beginning of the game. The character is posiitioned in a caravan travelling from somewhere to somewhere else and has no particular purpose for the journey, which makes some of the conversations strange and stilted. A strange storm then gives our character some special powers, including the ability to ""talk to souls"". This manifests as characters during the game about which the player is able to glean some (often beautifully-written) history. However, it is not possible to interact with these characters in any other way, making the whole thing seem very gimmicky, although it does provide the essential motivation for the ongoing story (the player must seek out someone who can help them understand this power). The additional characters are fleshed out to some degree, but lack of context makes it difficult to form a real attachment or sense of either world or personal history. There are vague references to a ""dead god"", Waidwen, who was apparently killed at the hands of humans and left a curse behind which causes some children to be ""hollowborn"", but it's not even particularly clear what that even means, and the story of why humans would want to destroy a god is mostly unexplained. With all that in mind, the story just doesn't grab me. Additionally, gameplay has some flaws; combat seems to require significant and unrewarding micro-management in order to use the array of skills available; it's possible quite early to find areas which are simply too difficult for low-level characters, with no suitable warning. You just end up dying repeatedly before you realise that you need to go elsewhere. It's unsatisfying and tedious. This game is ok if you love hack-n-slash, but it's no Dragon Age and barely makes the cut of Baldur's Gate IMO.			"

												The writing is Exeptional. This is the best writing I've ever experienced in a video game. I have read a lot of books that couldn't even come close to the imagery that some of the dialogues in Pillars imprint on my mind. Just incredibly high quality dialogues.The story is very good, and it has kept me interested for 60 hours. But it's the way that it is delivered that's amazingly gorgeous. I feel for my companions, I am attached to their dilemnas and their hardships. Their personalities are so fleshed out and enthraling. The gameplay is almost perfect for my taste. These hard to come by levels and the boost they give your characters when they do come makes me feel like I'm playing baldur's gate again. I finaly remember why I loved BG and BG 2 so much. Although some classes are a bit imbalanced. Graphics : Well you know already what you're getting into. This is my GOTY. And it's pretty much my Game of the last 10 years.			"

												This game has no edge. Icewindale 2? The story of twin Demons kicked out of hell, who decided to go on a rampage because the human world rejected them? That's edge. Min/Max stats for godly mages/fighters, edgy. Fun.Pillars is, the higher your level, the more overpowered you become, end of story. It gets to a point where your six-peon squad is so deep in DPS that you stop casting spells, buffs, and mostly just watch your team go to town while using a handful of abilities to kill everything, at all times. Pre-buffing was eliminated. Tweaked? Nerfed? No, gone. Armor restrictions as well, which makes for awkward scenarios where I have a Druid in full plate swinging a giant mace in the middle of a fight with the rest of them. I got half way through the game with that character and thought, wait, that's a Druid?In Wasteland 2, when I make a team, they have character, my sniper can't move, but kills everything and can take weapons apart to boot. My run and gun is a team leader with great charisma and great bomb disposable skills. My specialist knows the ins and outs of computers, locks, and safes, while being a smart♥♥♥♥♥ but dose the least damage.My fighter eh.. uh. My fighter, is in a DPS race with my rouge, and my cipher. Everyone else just kinda stands around taking up space. In pillars I can't latch onto anything I create because the system isn't integrated enough with itself, or with the world it occupies. I have 200 hours and beat the game once, because once you hit lvl 10, you know that's as much fun as you're going to get, and the rest is just talking to uninteresting people, and slogging through what's left.I dunno, what's going on Obsidian? Where is the beef? Why didn't you just make the god-bomb plot the story of your game? That was edgy, exciting, instead it's background info. What's better, the reincarnation of a god going toe to toe with locals and ending the game with a big frickin' explosion? Or playing as some guy chasing down another guy, cause he has voices in his head? Please, get some bolas before you make Pillars 2.			"

												I love games like this. I grew up on them and played them for hundreds of hours. This feels like uninspired garbage. 24 hours of play, multiple starts, tried about every class/build, and it still feels lacking. I feel like this is a ripoff of the old games with a slightly new skin, just executed in a pretty pathetic way. Yup, lets remake an old goodie. When we do it lets rip out its soul and ruin everything fun about it!Combat is lame and unispired. Not to mention the really stupid mechanics. Itemization in the game is horrible. The magic system made me want to throw things. Mages were my fav in BG2. They are pitiful in this game. I feel like there aren't any real differences in the classes/character builds other than the animation that executes.Also seems like you end up with 3 types of character: 1. Glass cannon that gets munched in one or two shots. 2. Tank that would lose in arm wrestling to a three year old, but can take a beating like a porn star. Oh, yeah, they don't get any effective combat management skills either....3. Middle of the road that ends up not good or bad at anything (but you miss all of the dialogue options without having at least one buff stat). Seems like you spend a lot of time building a character to not have it mean anything. It really torqued me that I coudn't build a chracter that did what I thought it would do.Loading screens... With a modern system and SSD's this game shouldn't be such a slug. I like to read but there are ridiculous walls of meaningless text less interesting than a high school social studies book. Meh. End rant.			"

												The most frustrating part about it all, is that the game has a lot of truly incredible things going for it. If it wasn't for the god awful combat system, this would be a masterpiece of a game. When your combat system relies solely on stats and not on clever enemy A.I and strategic planning, your game runs the risk of becoming incredibly shallow and grindy, which is exactly what happened to Pillars of Eternity.

												Unfortunately I was dissappointed by this game. It appears to be a well put together and modern take on classic PC RPGs but a lot of that is on the facade. Combat is the same boring thing over and over, the game is oversaturated with content to the point that I literally could not figure out what the quest was for the actual main plotline. It's just too messy, the plot gets subsumed by uselessly large amounts of content and it never shines that much from the start. 21hrs in and I still had no idea what was going on and was not at all driven to continue.

												Let me start by saying I was one of the backers for this project, so I am very into this sort of games. That being said, I can't force myself to finish this one. I was going back to it from time to time but it always ends up the same - combat, leveling and magic is just plain wrong.Maybe this type of combat experiance is cool for someone who loves to micro manage every move of each team member - and you very much have to do this even for ""trash"" groups - but not me. I like to focus on managing my main character and set other party member AI scripts and let the PC run them - except for the hardest fights. In this game it is simply not possible as the team AI is dumb, while on the other hand enemy AI is sharp as a rezor. There were fights where my mage was dead before he was even able to cast a single spell. Add to this that you absolutely cannot pre-buff for a fight - like who on earth thought this would be a good idea, it makes no sense?!Same goes for the stats system. I have over 90h in this game and I still don't understand what half of the things do. You can compare items with the ones you are wearing but there is no indication of how it will affect your statistics - and believe me - it is not easy to determine this on your own because most stats doesn't stack. Thats right, you have to remember what bonuses all your other items have to know if the item you are looking for is an upgrade or not.Level balance is yet another issue, before the expansion came out I maxed level on each of my character by the end of act 3 (out of 4 in total) and I was pretty much looking at 1 full act worth of game being robbed of the character development aspect of the game. Seriously, no one calculeded avaialble XP to predict this can happen to somone who compleates all the side quests?Another problem is that sitting max level, I did not felt as a hero who laughs at any danger ahead and is destined to save the world from certain destruction - especially since I was playing severely underpowered mage. I was hoping for that excitement you get from casting Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting on room full of enemies but it never came. Spells do look very appealing but their effect is - well - underwhelming to say it diplomatically.The other thing is that despite the story being interesting and writing good, the places you visit just don't seem alive. I see absolutely no reason why old school style RPG would abandon all the advancements that were introduced in the genre since Icewind Dale 2, especially knowing that Obsidian was working on projects like NWN2.While I still have no regrets that I backed this game, and no regrets that I got the expansions, I can't simply say it is a good game. It has serious gameplay mechanics issues at the design level, and I am not suprised because Obsidian tried to match complexity of modern AD&D system having maybe a year to achive this.			"

												I'll be blunt. I had High Hopes. All the Reviews and sites said this game is amazing. But it's not. What passes for a plot is pretty ho-hum.  The combat is boring and uninspired. Oh yeah, and the games first 'major' quest where you *HAVE* to clear out this castle in order go ANYWHERE else but the starting points? Real great. No, seriously though Why would you restrict movement and exploration off the get-go? It makes no sense. Oh, Let's not forget said quest for permission to continue exploring has enemies that are easily 3 or 4 levels higher than you, and curbstomp you, and on normal difficulty. I expect some saying ""ohh you're not playing it right"" or ""lol n00b"" but whatever a game is supposed to be challenging and fun, not irritatingly impossible from the first get-go. if you must have this game, wait until its like 75-80% off.

												I enjoyed BG, BG2, NWN, NWN2, Jade Empire and I liked playing this game to a point, but then it became incredibly boring due to the lack of depth in NPC RP and PC's choices affecting the very vanilla storyline. The lore is great, the world is very detailed, but there is nothing compelling me to complete the game. The characters are just blah.The game needs an alignment system that actually affects the progression of the game. Also the Party wouldn't travel together in a normal RP environment due to motivation conflicts. There is no glue to the PC that is founded in RP. What are the loyalties of the Party to the Main Character? It feels like the Party Members are just bored or avoiding something so they decide to tack onto this foreign traveler.If you want better emersion from a game, stick to the old gems like Icewind Dale or play a decent MMORPG with good lore and a solid community.

												As evidenced by my time played, I really love this game. That being said, in battles when you need to keep track of so many things, the bouncing font bug is almost a deal breaker. Trying to keep track of buffs and debuffs with shaking vibrating font is very tiring to the eyes and the brain. If this ever gets fixed, I'll change my review. But it's one bug of many and there is no reason it should'nt have been fixed by now.I literally need to take a break and come here to complain this bug is so annoying. It's that or rage uninstalling. Trying to read 10 shaking timers make me nasueated.Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing Christ. How does a game where reading is maybe the most important aspect ship with this mind shreddin bug. I cannot support POE 2 when something so easy to fix is completely ignored. I'd hate to get 100 hours + into that game and be forced to take breaks from battles due to getting naseated.			"

												Before 2.0 I would have given this a recommendation. If they fix 2.0 I'll update it with a recommendation.Until then, steer clear, because:-Pathing in combat is broken. Your characters will refuse to go where you click, often going an entirely different direction if they move at all.-Various spells and powers don't work without setting AI to Aggressive (I don't want AI on at all), which is just silly.-Enemies randomly stop attacking and begin regenerating endurance rapidly. Sometimes combat music stops when this happens. Sometimes the re-aggro. Sometimes they don't.This is the majority of the problems, but there are other small issues that were introduced as well.I hope it's fixed. I really want to recommend this game because it was really good when it was playable. It's just a total mess right now. Combat is unavoidable at various points for many quests, so the whole game is borked at the moment.EDIT:I'm not removing the above, because the fact that it happened at all is a travesty, and should not be forgotten.I'm still leaving a negative review, because I realised something: I just don't care any more.The loading screens... by the time the next area loads, I've lost the will to live, let alone keep playing, and you'll see them A LOT, especially once you get to the city.Ye gods! The city. ""Yaay, made to the city! Might be able to get some cool stuff, meet some important people, do some stuff!""""Go run errands and fart around, then fight a horde of undead and necromancers that are nigh-impossible to kill until you level up. You'll need to run many more errands to become strong enough to fight them"". I liked 'no combat xp' until this sort of thing kept happening. FORCED meta-gaming. THANKS.The stronghold is just... VIDEO GAMES! Why can I just spend money from a menu? Because VIDEO GAMES! Why do huge stone things just get fixed in days? Because VIDEO GAMES! Why do I just get _handed a castle_? VIDEO GAMES!The quests all start out sounding interesting, and end with some petty quibbling, a heavy-handed 'moral decision' that affects nothing, or some combat. That's it.All these cool mechanics. All this great lore... for a generic, two-dimensional (metaphorically speaking) game.Oh, and Obsidion relased 3.0 and changed just enough of the base mechanics of the game that I'd want to start over. Then I find out they're working on a licensed digital card game for ♥♥♥♥ing Pathfinder, when I knooow more bugs will creep in.I don't care any more, Obsidian. You've squandered the potential this game had.			"

												WARNING BEFORE YOU BUY THIS GAME; TL;DR - Incredible gameplay and story, with heartbreaking loading times FOR SOME COMPUTERS. Download a third-party mod to disable auto-saving for a semi-fix.Due to the auto-save feature requiring the saving of extremely large file sizes (gets worse as the game progresses) each time you load up a new or old area or even a house within that area there is a 1-2min load time. Sounds small, but there are a lot of areas in this game. This is so bad that there is a fairly successful mod designed to simply enable the ability to turn off the autosave feature - this mod has been updated 73 times (upon writing this). A simple fix of allowing the option disable the auto-save feature would make this game playable without mods. Note that mods are made redundant with each new update to the game - avoid updating the game until the mod is updated... THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO ALL COMPUTERS - check online first to see if someone else has had this problem with your system. I experienced this on a fairly old Mac, however I've read this happens with better systems as well. A quick bit of research could save you 20-50 bucks. The few hours I put into this game were incredible. The story, the combat, the difficulty and the progression are amazing. It's a shame that I had to cut it short because I don't feel like spending half my play-time on loading screens. Around about 15-20 hrs into the game the load times become unbearable.  It's a shame that the publishers decided to promote expensive DLC before doing (presumably) simple playability fixes on a game they've obviously put a lot of love into.			"

												Really, really frustrated with this game. Having been obsessed with the previous incarnations of the infinity engine, this the most recent, and by far the most disappointing of all of the gamesThe good:A well balanced class system, and a feeling of fairness in how mechanics work here.Owning a keep was fun.The bad:ENDLESS text wallsClunky and underdeveloped story (To be very clear, adding a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of useless information, doesn't constitute a story)The offensive comparisons to baldur's gate (Baldur's gate was/is so much better than this game I am rather shocked.)Why is it offensive? Because the story-line of Baldur's gate is epic, in an incredibly uplifting way. You feel awesome, your part god, and not just part god... you're partially the god of murder, and you can ascend to godhood. In this game, you have a strong soul, and you survive an odd soul storm. Your major goal in this game is to take that event...and undo it. I repeat, your goal is to undo the only thing that make your character unique. That is not exciting, and if you backed this game with high expectations... your probably going to have to hope Tides of Numeria does a better job.The constant feeling of the game being unfinished. Whether it's the nearly empty locations you can go to, or the party member quests being both tiny, or part of the main quest, you are left wanting. I repeat from above, comparing that to the 2-3+ hours you could spend on some of baldur's gate companions is offensive. Jaheria's quest/story-line in BG2 should be proof enough for that statement, see the rest of the BG cast for additional proof.The fact that I have been so frustrated with this game, that I wrote my first negative review, ever.I could continue, but 50$, and the time it's taken to hate this game, and to write this review is just making me more sad I pressed ""Purchase""			"

												Ugh, i really wanted to like this game, but it's not for me. I've been a huge Baldur's Gate fan since forever ago, and i'm really happy that the genre legacy continues (since stupid Dragon Age keeps moving further and further away from it, i'm glad at least someone still tries making these types of games). But I just couldn't get into this one. I think if you're into hardcore d&d and read a ton of that kind of literature - you'll love this. For me the appeal of these games is combat and strategy and it just wasn't enticing enough here. I got so bored towards the end that i rushed through everything, skipping through every dialog.On an unrelated note i thought it was funny that they had that combat music that's pretty much straight out of De-Arnise keep (BG2). And Twin Elms had a theme that was very Kuldahar (Icewind dale).Pros: Baldur's gate gameplay. Story is not stupid and cheesy.You can create your own party and not have to use official companions.There is a bit of that keep management stuff (although not much).Decent amount of content.Some interesting combat ideas but read on for cons because those mechanics get meh further into the game.Party members have decently unique personalities. Even the bland♥♥♥♥♥elven mage was spiced up with a secret.Cons:Wayyyy too much reading: paragraphs and paragraphs of text on every dialog. That may be a pro for some people, but i've read enough in my lifetime and i'm tired of it.Combat mechanics too complicated (too many different defenses/resistances/stats/conditions, it may not be more complicated than modern d&d rules but d&d rules have been building up slowly for a long time, while this game just jumps straight into complicatedness.) And i either never found much explanation on how stuff works as far as damage application goes, or i found it and it was more paragraphs of text and i got bored reading it.Party members join up too easily and will never leave you, so there wasn't that much roleplaying with them, and also no alignment thing that dramatically restricts how the world perceives you, (yeah yeah there is reputation with different factions but i didn't notice much gameplay difference with that).Unique items: that's one of the main complaints i have. They weren't amazing enough or hard enough to get. I want stuff like Carsomyr +5 (BG2). You had to kill one of the hardest enemies in game for it, and only a specific class could use it, but once you get it - it makes a huge difference, (and then you can go after Kangaxx! :P). Here - i got so many clutter drops from enemies and every once in a while there was a small upgrade but it never really made a big enough impact.Anyway, overall this is not a bad game, and if Steam used a number rating i'd give it a 7 out of 10 maybe. But i didn't love it, i have no desire to replay it, and i wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends. It was like going to steak and shake late at night. Nothing else is open, and the milkshakes are good, but the service was mediocre at best and if I had a choice - i would have gone somewhere else.			"

												The good- Animations were top notch- The dungeons held a lot of neat secretsThe Bad- Most quest lines end up you just killing everyone- There is a ""optimum"" way to play- The stronghold is a huge waste of time and money- The story is VERY word heavy, the creators really don't understand the concept of show don't tell.- The resolution of most of the art is way to tiny, you're most often just gonna see lots of flashing lights and red pixels.- The class's are bland and unbalanced.- The backer NPC's may or may not ruin your experiance (varies from person to person)- Your party will only activly spot traps in scout mode- Scout mode is super slow- Party AI is is pretty bad, you will have to manually control them through a lot of the fights.- Party AI does not know how to use healing items, or items with special abilties- Party AI dosn't really know how to use healing spellsI may or may not have missed more good and or bad things to list, but it comes down to this. If your on the fence about buying this game, don't buy it. If you like reading lots of descriptions of characters features and actions, not to mention reading a lot of ingame books and in menu lore, read a book.If you like reading descriptions of people, places, and things, and indepth desciptions of people, places and things, then this is the game for you.

												First of all, I love RPGs in general and I do enjoy games with lots of well-written and interesting text.But in my opinion, Pillars of Eternity's writing is neither really good nor is it interesting. I have played for about 20 hours and the main plot still is completely boring. My party consists of six members and only two of them have at least some personality. Most quests so far are shallow and don't feel impactful at all. It seems like every other NPC wants to tell you the story of his or her whole life for some reason, but when it comes to topics that could possibly be interesting or intriguing, they suddenly fall quiet and sparing with words.Overall, the conversations feel just far too wooden and humourless for me to be enjoyable. I'd definitely recommend you to watch a few videos about the game, so you can make sure that you actually like this style of writing. Otherwise playing such a text-heavy game will just be exhausting.			"

												Cannot recommend it. Can not hold a candle against old school RPG's like Baldurs Gate or the Black Eye (the very very old one). It looks okay on the first glance, but the deeper you go the more boring it gets. Sure, there's a ton of spells and recipes and skills. But all the spells are for damage or protection, the enhancements is just luck about what you will find (no foraging skills or anything like that). The levelups are to far between. The whole thing is more trying to confuse you in quantity instead of quality. That is also true for the group. 6 guys plus 1 pet and if you have a few creature spells you are with 12 guys in a fight. It's just to much. The AI is dumb as f*** and no matter what you activate, if you don't control each one of these guys by hand and tell them to use a special attack they really won't be efficient or use it clever at all. And so the fights become more of a bore then fun. And really, without the fights there isn't much left. The world feels stale. Characters just stand around doing nothing. Also finding quest givers is hard work, there is no indication where they could be.I can only imagine that the high ratings for this game come from the fact that there is simply no alternative if you like remotely this kind of game. But really, I prefer to pack out Baldurs Gate again then playing this crap any further.			"

												I really want to like Pillars of Eternity.  I really do!  I'd even go as far as to say that I've had lots of fun playing it, but having gotten this far in, I have to say, I don't think they finished this.  Let's go down the list...PROs: Character creation is robust and fun! It offers a lot of options, bonuses for character background, race, lots of standard and original classes, Really great on all levels, and the choices you make feel like they matter in a real way, being used not only to determine character stats, but NPC interactions and events in the world. The visuals are stunning! Arguments could be made as to why they would go back to prerendered backgrounds instead of a full 3D world, but whether for nostalgia or not, the end result can't be denied, the game LOOKS GOOD, and the world feels real, and lived in. Combat is engaging and tactically satisfying! Once you get a propper party together, it feels like a great accomplishment and mastery of the characters and classes you include feels meanigful and rewarding. When you take down that ogre or dragon, you know it was because of good decisions leading to that point, and it feels like an accomplishment. Party building! While you meet a lot of interesting, and thankfully not trying-too-hard-over-the-top characters along your journey, you can fill out the rest of the spots on your team with characters you build yourself. I was super excited when I discovered this! I've always loved character creation, and building adventuring parties, and this is a perfect example of it! Conversations that matter! While not always perfect, and often being wall of text-y, the conversations with NPCs seem to offer a lot of options, and are generally a really fun part of the game. Also, the long conversations or reserved for when they DO matter. No going through 5 pages of text every time you want to see a shop keeper.  The voice acting that's inclused for certain parts of the story is generally pretty good too.Now, the CONs: The ""powers"" you character recieves as part of the plot don't seem totally fleshed out. The parts that have to do with the main story, or quests seems fine, but there are various NPCs in the world you can use them on too...for no reason. They exist as nothing but walls of text. I guess if you really like reading short stories, it's alright, but none of it ever goes anywhere. There's no option to talk to any of these people, just ""touch their souls"" which leaves me wondering what all these characters think of some random person coming up and staring at the silently, them walking away. Nothing is well explained. I had to figure out a lot on my own, such as that I could even CREATE new characters for my team, or set my own party formations. Now, I'm old school, almost 40, and I've been well aquainted with Obsidian's past works, and am not adverse to opening a game's instruction manual, but a lot of these mechanics, integral to gameplay, should have been spelled out somewhere in the game. The stronghold, while an awesome feature, just isn't finished. I and many others have already run into numerous bugs and incomplete features when dealing with the stronghold (guards being ""Currently Unpaid"" seems a big one)  If there's something we should be doing different, it's, again, never explained anywhere, and just generally confusing.Now, while the pros definitely outnumber the cons here, the cons' existance is baffling to me.  When Obsidian announced that there game had gone ""GOLD"" I assumed these things would have been taken care of.  I, as a Kicksatrter backer had to wait a FULL YEAR longer than promised to play this game while it sat in Early Access, available to anyone who came along after the fact. The damaged customer experience that caused aside, this game frankly still feels like it's there.  Full of potential, but not quite complete.All in all, I could call it a decent game, but that's weighing in that I only paid $25 for it.  At $45 or more, it feels like the customer can expect a little more polish. With the Early Access thing,a nd this surprizing price tag, it just fels like Obsidian got greedy somewhere along the way, and maybe pushed the game out a little early to keep that money flowing.  I would have happily waited another year for a game that felt complete.  I just can't reccomend Pillars of Eternity as it is. "

												A game in the vein of Baldurs Gate and Planescape: Torment sounds really awesome, but unfortunately it's not this one. It's not a bad game in itself, but considering the developer and their claim to fame it's quite a bit of a disappointment. If they had left out the references to Baldurs Gate and Planescape: Torment, kept expectation low and called it a ""spiritual successor"" to Icewind Dale all would be well. Compared to  Baldurs Gate this game lacks interesting characters, romances, combat mechanics, character scripting.. It's a long list, really. Cut short: The only thing these two games have in common is graphical by nature like graphic style, dialogue windows, fonts and loading transistions. Quite superficial.Compared to the masterpiece Planescape: Torment, this game feels like a fumbling rookie. There is a massive amount of content of which a lot is just useless filler, longwinded, dull and uninspired. Sometimes it feels as if the game was supposed to be a text adventure, because it describes everything you see. It suffers the same weaknesses as in the comparison with Baldurs Gate, the game simply lacks the passion, drive, point and intriguing gameplay. So what do you get? You can make a character from a wide array of classes, races and backgrounds of which nothing really matters. Along the way you can have people join you or you can go to an Inn and create all the characters you need by yourself, but the self-made ones don't have companion quests, of course. Each companion has a quest of a kind, but the characters themselves are really quite balanced, ordinairy and mundane. You will not find a Minsc, Edwin, Viconia, Korgan, Imoen, Dakkon, Morte or Annah here. There are no romances and all the companions are like wallpaper, somehow, without colour, edge or character. Combat is.. never gratifying. Mostly just a mess. Some builds work and some really don't. The leveling system is horrible. Combat is the meat of the game, but somehow it's mummified. You get virtually no Experience from kills and not really that much from quests either. It feels quite linear, that way. Sound is okay..Graphics are pretty, but dull and lifeless. Loading is slow even on SSD; I am confused. Tilt: Since I finished it. I have had absolutely no desire to play this game again. I played Baldurs Gate a least a dozen times, both good and evil and tried out pretty much every combo of companions, married them all or ditched them all.. Planescape: Torment; I finished at least a half a dozen of times and I really loved Annah.. There were some dialogues that really left me breathless.. This game is total crap in comparison. Shallow, boring and forgettable. What was it again?!Take away all the references to past awesomeness and you've got a fairly average follow-up to Icewind Dale. Why didn't they just slab an Icewind Dale 3 sticker on this game? Probably,  because it's not taking place in Icewind Dale, but seriously, why should that be a limitation for a game so limited?-- Edit: fixed a few minor typos and grammar ---			"

												I like this game, and it has a ton going for it. It's a fun RPG setting and an interesting story. I spent a lot of time on it (which makes #2, below, so bad). You can tell a lot of passion went into it.  It's very close to a 'yes' recommendation.But...  here's the reasons for a 'no':1) Loading screens and load time. It's way too much too often. 2) A very bad bug that occured  late in the game. One of my main NPCs (Eder) I took out of my party for a little bit, and when I put him back in, all of his gear was gone, he was level 1, and the next time I loaded, he was missing from my character roster completely. Losing an entire character with a lot of time-earned gear was very frustrating.3) The lore comes at you with an assumption that you already know some of it, or so it seems. It can be a bit overwhelming at first, throwing names of regions, races, gods, historical events, etc, at you. It might be a bit better paced, but that could be preference.4) Minor, but... The kickstarter backer NPCs. They're pointless, and they're all over the place (the first town is especially bad). I wish I was warned about them before reading like 15 of them (which I did because the 'soul reading' mechanic made me think they were important.)			"

												Good game, I deffinately recommend it. Feels similar to Baldur's Gate/Arcanum.Pros:- Solid combat mechanics, reasonably difficult.- Well scripted side quests and main quest.- Good atmosphere (lore, level design, secret areas etc.).- At least 20h of game content.Cons:- Combat mechanics might feel to complicated for new players. Tactical pausing necessary in combat. - Average lookong graphics.- Some dialogs are text only.- Very basic crafting. "

												So, if you're a fan of the classic Infinity Engine games such as Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale then you're bound to feel at home here. A self-proclaimed spiritual successor to those titles, Pillars takes from them an enormous amount of what is good and familiar and applies a sleeker, modern veneer alongside a multitude of quality-of-life improvements.You probably know that already, though.So I'll just hit on a few things that I think worth mentioning:- Even though I was expecting something very familiar, the similarity to old IE games surprised me still. It really feels like they went out of their way to re-create that experience piece-for-piece.- The game took me just over 50 hours to complete, including all 15 levels of the Endless Paths of Od Nua and most (not quite all) side quests. This isn't bad, but it's not quite up to Baldur's Gate 2 in sheer scope of content, either.- The storytelling and art compliment each other well. The game is dark and atmospheric with a story that generally feels quite heavy while managing to avoid many fantasy RPG cliches. As far as the quality of narrative goes, this is one of the best in recent memory; better, I'd say, than nearly all D&D games.- I encountered a bug or two, but as of the time of this writing, nothing game-breaking.- I played on Normal for my first run through, and the difficulty seemed right on-par. Some encounters were challenging, many were not. The bosses weren't overwhelming, but didn't feel like complete push-overs either. Options exist to scale the difficulty upwards quite steeply, for those who do want an extreme challenge.- Many people are saying that the stronghold feels tacked-on. They're right, for the most part -- building it up doesn't feel terribly useful or rewarding. It's still neat, though. I'd rather have it there than not.- The way that combat experience works, you're awarded experience for killing new creatures up until a certain point (once the beastiary entry is completed). This is an interesting attempt to balance passive and aggressive play styles. It does seem to accomplish its goal, but I still think I would have preferred a traditional 'kill a mob, get some exp' system with a higher level cap. I hit 12 before the end of the content, after which fights began to feel a little more tedious.Overall, this is my favorite new game that I've played in a long time. It was great to be able to take (most of) the things I love about my favorite classic CRPGs and experience them as applied to a modern game and a new, awesome story.			"

												I'm an oldschool rpg-fan with tons and tons of hours in Baldurs Gate and the like. So, of course I also bought Pillars of Eternity, but I have mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, they did a good job, I won't deny that. Loading Screens wherever you go is a HUGE pain in the a** but otherwise it is fine. Pathfinding in Combat could be better, too. I hope both will get better with later patches.I won't go into detail about the graphics. You like the look or you don't. It is obvious from every single screenshot or video available that this isn't the witcher 3. In my opinion they capture the spirit of the game very well.  The story is ok. I'm intrigued enough to read it and not just click away the pages, but I can't say that I feel a sense of immersion. The same with sidequests, solid, nothing too fancy. After some patchs a very good german translation btw. also I swithed back to english anyway.Combat is decent, although I feel like I'm using the same few moves over and over again. Than again I'm only Level 6 or 7 on normal difficulty, so I won't complain on that matter.The depth of character design is a bit overhyped in my opinion, as the idea of everyone being able to learn everything (not concrete skills, but things like mechanic, lore etc) makes planing in a complete party rather unnecessairy. The ""exotic"" chars like cipher or their version of the bard aren't exactly that new as the idea of building up one ressource (or time) to use special ability has been around at least since...well...forever I guess. I'd call the charaters solid again with some nice special abilities on the different races but nothing really innovative.So, what are, on the other hand, my problems?First of all the maps outside the villages feel rather empty. In BG2 there was quite a bit to discover, most (not all!) maps had their own little story. In PoE there seem to be a lot of ""filler maps"". Not saying that there aren't any tasks, but most of the maps I've visited so far required me to sneak on speed mode until I find a group of monster, kill it for various components and continue to the next group. Second point is the need for micromanagement. Yes, of course, I'm leading a group and it is supposed to feel oldschool. But why they had to go one step behind Baldurs Gate and remove the archetype automatics like ""healer"", ""DD-Mage"" and so on is beyond my grasp. Hack, even the automatic attack doesn't work half of the time. While I'm very sceptical of modern gaming in general, the posibility to assign a solid makro to your group and so reduce the tedious part of tactical planing to a pre-combat phase is something I really liked in games like the Dragon Age series or FF XII.Third point is that I somewhat dislike the choices they made for NPCs. Hard to explain and completely due to my own taste, but I simply don't care for them like I did for Minsc and Co. Could be a problem of being older, though ;)I compared PoE to B♥♥♥♥ lot because in my few BG2 is still the benchmark for epic group rpgs. In the end, I'd say PoE is one step forward from(technical issues, crafting, attitude system) but also two steps backwards. So, do I regret buying this game? No, absolutely not. It is fine and once I'm in the right mood I'm sure I will add something like additional 20 hours to finish my started playthrough and I will feel entertained while doing so. The devs definitely deserve my money for that, especially the ~20€ I paid for the hero edition on a sale. It is simply not what I hoped it would be.			"

												What started out as a relatively fun callback to classic isometric RPGs quickly becomes a very frustratingly dense experience. In the end, Pillars of Eternity taught me why a lot of these old RPG tropes have become extinct.I had fun with the game, relatively speaking, but in the end I spent way too much time being stumped by the way this game seems to enjoy complexity for the sake of complexity. There is so much reading to do in the initial character creation that it nearly turned me off, but I gave it a fair chance. The game seemed to be deep and it looked like a lot of fun... and then I had to restart my entire game because somehow I had gimped my character and the first actual combat I came across post-tutorial was completely unwinnable.By the midgame, I had grown incredibly weary of spending hours in each quest hub reading seemingly endless dialogue. It took me a few hours just to gather sidequests and orient myself. The story was convoluted, dry, and appeared to be going nowhere. The stronghold was a nuisance, rather than anything interesting. Combat had switched from a terrifying problem to a boring chore.By the endgame, combat had become more of a chore than anything, especially coupled with the amazingly terrible combat AI your party is equipped with. They don't like to listen to your directions, and they don't like to do anything that makes sense. The story had become so amazingly cloudy that I wasn't sure of the motivations of any of the characters. The final quest hub area was a pain. Combat was totally simple.And then, suddenly, the final boss battle was stupidly difficult and caused me to rage quit the whole thing altogether.I don't think this game was meant for me, even though I'm a fan of classic PC RPGs. It seemed to have all the weaknesses of Obsidian games with none of the strengths. I guess I endorse it because it is clearly a labor of love on the part of Obsidian, but I wouldn't put my full support behind it.			"

												Worth playing, with reservations.I backed the Kickstarter and feel I got more than my money's worth. If you've never played a CRPG before this would be a good one to start. There is a bit of a learning curve on the controls and you might want to customize and play around a bit, but once you get a handle on things the game flows and feels really good. My recommendation is to create custom NPCs as absolutely soon as you are able. The standard NPCs are not bad, but the more you can beef up your party in the early game the more fun you'll have with the battle system. Inventory management is adequate. The bottomless stash is a great concept, but there's still a lot of menu micromanaging. The story so far (about midway through Act 2) is solid enough, but pretty much all the dramatic context is buried in text. As such it requires real effort on the player's part to give a ♥♥♥♥ about what's going on. Even if you stop caring entirely, the battle system is still fun enough to justify playing. There is a ton of replay value in trying out different parties, builds, and choices. Ultimately an 8/10, and a solid 9.5/10 when you consider it was made on a Kickstarter budget.			"

												It is very honest and well executed successor of the Baldur's Gate series, but there are a few things that I find a bit disturbing:- the game mechanics when it comes to battle are a bit too fuzzy for my taste.You don't often get a sense of ""whoa, I want this weapon"" or ""nice armor"" that was one of the biggest things in Baldur's Gate series. In Pillars of Eternity it's more like ""meh, I really don't know if this is an improvement or not and I don't really know what caused us to win the battle"". It is a bit too fuzzy and unintuitive when it comes to battle mechanics. I enjoy more clear systems where +1 means something and you know you don't have enough points yet.- too many npcs in comparison to party size. I hate it when you have 3-4 characters waiting in line and you want to have chat with each one of them and play the story with each one of them but you can't because they don't fit in your active party. I'd either have fewer more intricate characters that I can play with at the same time instead of excess amount of characters that I have to juggle all the time in and out of the party to get everything out of themBut still recommended as the storyline is well written and atmosphere is really close to what made BG series so good. But doesn't get to Planescape: Torment level.			"

												I was a kick-starter backer for this game and am very happy with the end-result. Being a big fan of story-driven RPGs with nice gameplay elements this game fulfills both niches. A throwback to the 2d isometric hand drawn environments for those of us who are fans of nice illustrations.This is not the typical RPG we may be used to where we ""kill ever bad guy or enemy"" we come across. Albeit you can play it like that (I am heh), you'll just find it very difficult if you do if you're also on the hardest difficulty setting. For those who enjoy challenges this will definitely scractch an itch. But one may equally talk their way out of many hostile situations or simply avoid them.My only complains is that there's a bit too much side-content that draws me away from the main story for too long. Being a completionist I like to do every side-quest but occasionally I found myself rushing through them because I really wanted to get back to the main story. The fact that certain achievements are tied to these side-quests didn't improve matters, but hey I'm probably the only person who'd complain about too much content.If you enjoyed old-school rpg series like Buldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Torment you will definitely enjoy this game as well. Kudos to the devs developing a unique mechanic system since they couldn't very well use DnD rules :P.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. I'm glad to see good old CRPGs having such success. The story was interesting, it made me curios to find out more and more. I'm a completionist so I did every quest/task available. Some of the quests were a bit meh but overall it was ok. The companions were interesting and diverese. Shame they don't have much interaction with eachother. They were fairly quiet. One thing that really bugged me was the companions AI. They need a lot of micromanagement since they will get stuck on every obstacle on the way to the enemy....sigh. Apart from that the game was very enjoyable. In the future I'd like to see more roleplaying elements into it. Combat is all well and good but something feels meh. I also liked Tyranny, I hope there will be an expansion to that as well, hint hint ;)  "

												There should be a ""maybe"" or ""depends"" button on whether to recommend the game. Pros:  Awesome customization of characters that act and feel differentYou can create you own charactersThe difficulty is actually doing a good job of showing the difficulty.  Not like Wasteland 2 where it seemed like BS magic. The game is huge and in the cities at least, diverse.  You get your own castle.Fighting is fun and challenging.  Cons:  You can create your own characters and thus the characters you can pick up seem static and not worth talking to.    I like the old Baulders gate where your companions where unique, but here they are all the same.  Sadness.  Lack of good side quests.No ability to find stuff on the map.  You can get quests which take HOURS and HOURS to complete simply because you didn't talk to the right people in the right order.  So annoying.  This makes the game longer but not in a good way.  Bugs.  Lots of bugs.  At least when I played, I found several bugs such as the infinite fireball, that loaded back in when I came back to my keep.  I can thus never own my keep, because a fireball is going off in my dungeon all the time.  LOL.  So ya, if you have lots of time.  I HIGHLY recommend this game.  If you are going to only play an hour of this a night.  Stay as far away as possible.  The lack of map help for the quests is a killer.  Only a few quests I found ever showed up on the map.  It may sound lazy, and it is.  But I don't care.  I want map help.  I play for the story and fighting, not fetch quests.  My name is not Rover.  Sorry fan boys.   "

												You have to imagine that people have a very wide range of expectations about how a classic RPG should look like. PoE satisfies most of those by including a massive amount of optional content. Those complaints I read of in other reviews that aren't complete nonsense (due to that high amount of optionality), are  about the main story. For a large amount of time you will not know why you are doing what you are doing or how that would be helpful for solving the main quest. Partially that is because you are fighting a secretive organization with unknown goals, but it can be annoying nontheless. Or maybe its just a general problem with big RPG games, where people interupt the main story to fininsh side quests. So when you contine your main quest again after hours of side questing the story will not be as immersive as when you actually had to follow the main story strictly.  "

												The game plays brilliantly. You can spend hours exploring the maps, reading books (and I actually WANT to read books here, I never do in any games!), talking to people, exploring side quests, and you still have all of the main story line to go. The world is wonderfully atmospheric thanks to the level design. The characters you encounter are well written and the fact that there is not only voice acting involved but that the text is also written at the bottom of the screen (with annotations to the characters' facial expression, mood, change of tone etc) makes it feel a little like reading a book. If you can afford it, do get it at the regular price, you won't regret it. The current 60% off sale offer is SO worth it. The only thing that I don't like so far are the loading screens. They're a little bit too long. It doesn't break immersion for me, but it is noticable. Forget about any responsibilities you might have had - your only responsibility now is this game :D			"

												I'm a huge fan of CRPGs, played all the Baldur's Gate games, NWNs, Arcanum, DAs, Ultimas (Back in the very old days)Crazy fun and good. Every battle can take loads strategy with pausing and issuing commands. Very diverse with skills and items.I took the fighter and made him the tankiest guy THIS side of Defiance Bay and he is almost immortal now, send him in first and everyone starts focusing him, then send in the AoE mind flaying and stats lowering spells.. at last the DPS. Good recipe.Combat is amazing but it can take awhile to get into the lore of the game, there LOADS going on in regards with lore. You may feel bombarded at first but later on you get the story. There's also an in-game cyclopedia that can help lots if you don't know certain names or need to revise.Too much to talk about here, just play it and you'll see.If you love CRPGs then you should get this ASAP.

												I'm an oldschool rpg-fan with tons and tons of hours in Baldurs Gate and the like. So, of course I also bought Pillars of Eternity, but I have mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, they did a good job, I won't deny that. Loading Screens wherever you go is a HUGE pain in the a** but otherwise it is fine. Pathfinding in Combat could be better, too. I hope both will get better with later patches.I won't go into detail about the graphics. You like the look or you don't. It is obvious from every single screenshot or video available that this isn't the witcher 3. In my opinion they capture the spirit of the game very well.  The story is ok. I'm intrigued enough to read it and not just click away the pages, but I can't say that I feel a sense of immersion. The same with sidequests, solid, nothing too fancy. After some patchs a very good german translation btw. also I swithed back to english anyway.Combat is decent, although I feel like I'm using the same few moves over and over again. Than again I'm only Level 6 or 7 on normal difficulty, so I won't complain on that matter.The depth of character design is a bit overhyped in my opinion, as the idea of everyone being able to learn everything (not concrete skills, but things like mechanic, lore etc) makes planing in a complete party rather unnecessairy. The ""exotic"" chars like cipher or their version of the bard aren't exactly that new as the idea of building up one ressource (or time) to use special ability has been around at least since...well...forever I guess. I'd call the charaters solid again with some nice special abilities on the different races but nothing really innovative.So, what are, on the other hand, my problems?First of all the maps outside the villages feel rather empty. In BG2 there was quite a bit to discover, most (not all!) maps had their own little story. In PoE there seem to be a lot of ""filler maps"". Not saying that there aren't any tasks, but most of the maps I've visited so far required me to sneak on speed mode until I find a group of monster, kill it for various components and continue to the next group. Second point is the need for micromanagement. Yes, of course, I'm leading a group and it is supposed to feel oldschool. But why they had to go one step behind Baldurs Gate and remove the archetype automatics like ""healer"", ""DD-Mage"" and so on is beyond my grasp. Hack, even the automatic attack doesn't work half of the time. While I'm very sceptical of modern gaming in general, the posibility to assign a solid makro to your group and so reduce the tedious part of tactical planing to a pre-combat phase is something I really liked in games like the Dragon Age series or FF XII.Third point is that I somewhat dislike the choices they made for NPCs. Hard to explain and completely due to my own taste, but I simply don't care for them like I did for Minsc and Co. Could be a problem of being older, though ;)I compared PoE to B♥♥♥♥ lot because in my few BG2 is still the benchmark for epic group rpgs. In the end, I'd say PoE is one step forward from(technical issues, crafting, attitude system) but also two steps backwards. So, do I regret buying this game? No, absolutely not. It is fine and once I'm in the right mood I'm sure I will add something like additional 20 hours to finish my started playthrough and I will feel entertained while doing so. The devs definitely deserve my money for that, especially the ~20€ I paid for the hero edition on a sale. It is simply not what I hoped it would be.			"

												What started out as a relatively fun callback to classic isometric RPGs quickly becomes a very frustratingly dense experience. In the end, Pillars of Eternity taught me why a lot of these old RPG tropes have become extinct.I had fun with the game, relatively speaking, but in the end I spent way too much time being stumped by the way this game seems to enjoy complexity for the sake of complexity. There is so much reading to do in the initial character creation that it nearly turned me off, but I gave it a fair chance. The game seemed to be deep and it looked like a lot of fun... and then I had to restart my entire game because somehow I had gimped my character and the first actual combat I came across post-tutorial was completely unwinnable.By the midgame, I had grown incredibly weary of spending hours in each quest hub reading seemingly endless dialogue. It took me a few hours just to gather sidequests and orient myself. The story was convoluted, dry, and appeared to be going nowhere. The stronghold was a nuisance, rather than anything interesting. Combat had switched from a terrifying problem to a boring chore.By the endgame, combat had become more of a chore than anything, especially coupled with the amazingly terrible combat AI your party is equipped with. They don't like to listen to your directions, and they don't like to do anything that makes sense. The story had become so amazingly cloudy that I wasn't sure of the motivations of any of the characters. The final quest hub area was a pain. Combat was totally simple.And then, suddenly, the final boss battle was stupidly difficult and caused me to rage quit the whole thing altogether.I don't think this game was meant for me, even though I'm a fan of classic PC RPGs. It seemed to have all the weaknesses of Obsidian games with none of the strengths. I guess I endorse it because it is clearly a labor of love on the part of Obsidian, but I wouldn't put my full support behind it.			"

												The combat system in this game is fresh and innovative; nearly all encounters are challenging and tactically fair. The difficulty is in line with BG, Wasteland, IWD, BG2, NWN, TOEE, Oblivion, NWN2, Fallout3, Skyrim, and Wasteland 2.I was nearly killed during my first Triple Crown (permadeath + 50% enemy stats + reduced metadata) attempt by equilevel enemies (sp Ogres), The priest was crushed to a pulp by the final-standing Ogre, following a relentless assault on Magor's fortitude. Man, I'm high strung, but my adrenaline was pumping as Eirglass kited that last Ogre with less than 20 HP. She was in this several-minute long kite that I wasn't sure she could succeed -- after all, the polygonal pathfinding of the AI in this game is second-to-none, which is to say, the pathfinding algorithm has been optimized to satisfy the most trivial case. Moreover, I suspect the game uses an inefficient purely functional game state (which despite it's many technical and political advantages, has managed to lose me at least a Belt of Might +3) which is slower than O(1); indeed I have an i5, GTX 570, and 600MBps SSD.Armored lightly by a robe, his service was succeeded by Walter the Holy Nut-Puncher, an unarmed priest of Wael,The first Moon-Goddess chanter Luna was slain, after which her more constitutional Lunie chased the party to achieve the justice unobtainable by Eder or that other priest of Magran. I mean. these other guys have a lot of excellent things to say. Most of the time, the dialogue between Kana and the druid are preferable to the quiet between Mr. Mage_A and Mrs. Cipher_B.Either way, I can be blamed for expending more than 200W * 200 Hours= 40kWH on this game. I'm still enjoying it.If we have to wait a year for the sequel, that will be evidence that the CRPG genre is dead. This is genuinely an excellent game, even if it's lacking the storytelling authorship of a Stephenson/Baxter/Vonnegut/Geothe/Shakespeare/God.If you have thought about your D&D tatctics for more than a half hour out of character, then there is no question that you will enjoy this game.BRB, gonna go get the best Arquebus in the game.

												I don't write reviews for games because I feel the need to keep my opinions to myself and let people exprience games for themselves and not be influenced by others to find themselves as a gamer. That beign said here it goes.I remeber playing thousands of hours just playing Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast and Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and it's expansion Throne of Baal. I remember Icewind Dale one and two. I remember playing Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor and other countless D&D and RPG titles like Niverwinter Nights. Very selddom does a game bring me back in a way to the feelings I had about those games. I love RPGs they, to me, embody what a game should be. It sucks you into your own world that is just yours, the decisions you make effect you, charatcers that have a special place in your heart, I'm talking about you, Minsc and Boo!This is one of those rare games that I play and I feel the magic I felt about games when I was a kid. The trail and error, the building a character and finding what playstyle works for that class, the dungeon crawls that I play for hours and don't realize it is time to eat. Instead of my mother calling me down for dinner it's my wife, or my kids sitting next to me going ""Dad we are hungry can you pause it after you kill this monster?"" and when I pause it they groan with annoyance that it needs to stop. Now instead of playing solo like when I was a kid I have 3 of my own to share the magic with, and the memories I make I now share with them. I hear their laughs as the characters banter as you walk through the cities and caves and forests.My oldest is now trying to battle her way onto my computer to play this game bcause it is like the games I loved when I was a kid. Simple yet complicated, easy yet hard, and it has all the makings of a classic. If you are a RPG fan or a fan of any of the Baldur's Gate games or Neverwinter Nights and you don't buy this game your are an idiot. This game will take you back to a time when games were amazing and not just good. I know I might catch some flak for that but how many games that have come out in the past 8 years have made you wanna go back and play them through 20 times? I can count the number on my hands. Yes there are fun games to play that are good for one maybe two play throughs but seldom suck me into my own world for hours and hours and hours of gameplay. I have about 50 hours on this game and I got it just a few days ago. I can't get enough and niether can my kids.While it has it's drawbacks like any game and they are few and far between, such as the double clicking inventory bug, but they are so few I have yet to find one that is game breaking. you can't even say that for Skyrim or any other RPGs that have come out within the past 5 years. If you don't like RPGs then this game is not for you, if you never played Baldur's Gate and never will this game is not for you. But if you love them and want a game that takes you back then get this game.			"

												So good. So so good.If you like Bauldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Divinity, or tabletop RPGs, I cannot recommend Pillars of Eternity enough. Accompanied by a cast of unique, unforgetable, voice-acted characters, you will journey across the land on an epic quest. If you don't like the provided characters, you can go to an inn and create your own, customized party. The balance is extremely good, and no class feels ""overpowered"" or ""too weak,"" and the health system is innovative and briliant. A bit expensive, but if it's your kind of game it's certainly worth the cost.			"

												Ah fantastic! Obsidian allowed to create a great RPG experience without interference and deadlines from a publisher thanks to Kickstarter. And it's good, really good. Baldurs Gate 3 after such a long wait.Personally I would prefer the combat to be turn based (no one has bettered ToEE combat system in an RPG in my opinion) but the RTWP works well once you get into the flow of it.I'm about half way though now, and each session I enjoy it more and more. It's pretty hard compared to RPGs over the last decade or so, and with unfamiliar lore & systems it takes a few hours to get into, but it's so worth it!! So far in about 20 hours seen one bug so inconsequential that I can't even recall what it was.Here's hoping for many more brilliant games from Obsidian where they're masters of their own destiny.

												A game I see myself replaying in the future; a well-crafted classic with just a few snags.I have come into my own as a gamer playing Baldur's gate II and Planscape Torment and spent good part of growing up with 3rd edition Dungeons and dragons. Even before this game came out, I enjoyed reading up on the dev's updates and how they were planning to tweak the game mechanics. A lot has changed since BG II and the game presents us with polished and improved battle mechanics that have less exploits and frustrating bits. That said, the devs did not try hard enough to make the game accessible to an inexperienced audience - the easy difficulty leaves the monsters' stats and battle rules unchanged, which means you still need to understand the mechanics and be able to adjust your strategy with every battle. On the other hand, the games offers several ways to scale up the difficulty, if that is something you desire.One of the goals this game set for itself was ""mature storytelling"" and I think they succeeded well enough. I mostly paid attention to the main story it and enjoyed it, which is rare for me. I tend to skip over text and not care that much what is happening between the banter with my party and all the monster-killing. One unattractive blemish is the issue of hollowborn children - basically a metaphor for disabled people who are nonverbal and need help with daily activities. In the game, these children are like this, because they are soulless. As a cognitively and developmentally disabled person I did not enjoy reading about people resembling me and my friends being inhuman. Unfortunately this is part of the main plot and as such unavoidable.The characters, which are one of the main draws of a game like this, were well executed. They range from cute to intriguing to deliciously hateable. Their personal stories are interesting, if a bit short. What I felt was lacking, was the depth of interaction you have with them as the PC and the interaction they have between themselves. The banter is funny, sure, but I am used to drama complete with hissy fits and threats of leaving the party (now I miss BG II).All in all - a good staple for those long weekends where you don't feel like doing anything.P.S.: At the time of writing this, I am almost done with the game. A few days ago White March II has come out, with a patch for the regular game. Unfortunately I can't comment on the changes right now, because there is no time left for me to explore them. "

												Let me just preface my comments about Pillars of Eternity by saying that I played and completed Planescape Torment long ago, but still hold that game's story as the best that I have ever encountered in any game, RPG or otherwise. I am forever spoiled in that regard. Pillars narrative comes close, but does not quite hit the mark. There is a slight disconnect (perhaps by design?) that keeps it from hitting me in the gut the same way Planescape Torment did. However, it is much more complex, well-written and different enough from the usual run-of-the-mill plot you will find in it's peers. This is a rich, deep storyline, one in which the decisions you make as the player will determine the outcome. The isometric point-of-view provides value: strategic real-time combat that can be paused at any moment to issue orders (a must really), and an old school RPG feel that will give fans of Planescape Torment, the Baldur's Gate series, and the Icewind Sale series a tinge of nostalgia. You will encounter various NPCs, called companions, who can accompany you on your journey. Each one has a narrative that you can explore; this makes for a richer experience. While all are well written, some truly stand out, such as the Grieving Mother, Durance etc. The artwork in this game is fantastic. From the carefully crafted maps, the detail on the characters, and wonderful particle effects.Sound wise, I have no complaints. The soundtrack is atmospheric and the voice acting (especially for the companions) ranges from decent to excellent, nothing is subpar. If you are tired of saving the world from some great evil out to conquer it, time and time again, play this game. While the story won’t leave you thinking about it days after you complete it like Planescape Torment did, the journey is well worth it.			"

Younger RPG lovers should also get it.Now I'm a seasoned Planescape and Baldur's Gate (also NWN) expert so I'll use those classics as reference in mind.Graphics are nice but old style, Divinity looked more modern but still every equipped armor shines neatly.Music is Conan style, no surprises but good and fits. Sounds like Baldur's Gate.Voice acting - good but we expected this.World and lore is a copy of forgotten realms essentially. Standard fantasy you'll feel right at home.Rule system is somewhat on par with D&D2 and slightly inferior to D&D3, no multi-classing either.Party, choice of the assorted fleshed out companions, those have a lot of personality, bicker as always and come with a quest. You can also create more adventurers for small coins if you rather want custom characters. Companions are on par with the averagely made Baldur's Gate companions say Corgan, Keldorn or Mazzy and better in cases. No Minsk, Imoen, Morte or Annah though.Quests - those are very good. The main story is high above average game standards. Souls, reincarnation, unearthing the past, all of that. After reaching act 2 the plot gains some depth.Yeah the game tends to the casual player, quest givers are conveniently next to locations, companions can hardly be missed, game is not really punishing, skill reset possible.  I hardly got lost and there are no riddles. You can out-level hard battles. Still you can break quests like by force-attacking friendly people which is even an option. I haven't seen such for years now. Still you can win battles by the skin of your teeth - I like that a lot.There's no good/evil but a Divinity like stoic/rational/passionate etc. rating system of character, those are heavily used in dialogues as are skill, attribute and background checks where Torment fans feel at home.Formations are in, companion AI is in, most gamebreaking is ironed out. One hang in all my playtime. Several difficulty settings, one deep optional dungeon, ton of loot. Stonghold - check. Crafting is in but really an afterthought.

												This game is for players who are looking to dump 100+ hours to complete an rpg game from 0-100% with little guidelines on how to do so.  The game expects you to talk to everyone, use every dialogue option and explore every nook and cranny of its relativly linear open world for a complete experience. Though the game has great dialogue options it feels that to get the ""perfect"" clear you have to play a nosey white knight that has a wiki in their back pocket telling them were to go, who to talk to and when to talk to them. Were I prefered rgps to have less guidelines and more open quests the game feels like it has some parts that are over developed and some parts that recived far less developement, starting areas and certain companions had a plethera of interesting interactions, well designed quests and fun easter eggs that you could find. I recomend taking an hour or so before you play the game to read indepth what each class gets and the recomended way to play them, this will allow you to make your ideal party and plan for level ups far into the future. Overall this game is about a 3/4 and though I wouldnt kick it out of bed for crackers I wish I could have seen so much more.			"

												100% amazing game. Very similar to BG series but with a slightly different system than the typical DnD and graphics/controls/physics from 2015. Story was very solid and voice acting was excellent. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys the CRPG genre. Only bad point is that a straight playthrough of the story took me only about 20 hours but I did leave alot of side areas unexplored because the story was too epic to get sidetracked.			"

												This game cemented the return of the infinity engine CRPG (for those that don't know what this is, it's a real time battle system that allows pausing to issue commands to a team of 4-6 adventurers of different classes to make a well ballanced killing machine)I had not played an IE game before this one, but I grew up on table top wargames so it appealed to my straight away.If you, like me missed Baldurs gates and Ice wind dales the first time around, but want to see what it's all about, Pillars of eternity is the perfect starting point as it's not hindered at all by out of date UI's and such.I fell in love withn the game almost imediately, it's beautiful hand draw invironments, the in depth class system and well written story, detailed lore, it's all here.Since the sucess of this game, more games are starting to appear like sword coast, using a siumilar system. PoE is the original in terms of bringing back an almost dead genre. Whether you're new to IE or a vet who played all the originals, you will feel at home here.For a nos BS, roots RPG experience, look no further. My game of the year so far and also one of the best combat experiences I've had in any gameIf you're tired of AAA, watered down nonsence, all our old favourites being made more action orientated to appeal to the masses, get on board with a real game like Pillars Of Eternity and show the devs some love..If you want a future of gaming that isn't shaped by COD-loving teenagers, ""Frag-Master-Camper"" get on board with the Renicance revival, buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥now, smoke a fat bag and enjoy.thank me later.

												What started out as a relatively fun callback to classic isometric RPGs quickly becomes a very frustratingly dense experience. In the end, Pillars of Eternity taught me why a lot of these old RPG tropes have become extinct.I had fun with the game, relatively speaking, but in the end I spent way too much time being stumped by the way this game seems to enjoy complexity for the sake of complexity. There is so much reading to do in the initial character creation that it nearly turned me off, but I gave it a fair chance. The game seemed to be deep and it looked like a lot of fun... and then I had to restart my entire game because somehow I had gimped my character and the first actual combat I came across post-tutorial was completely unwinnable.By the midgame, I had grown incredibly weary of spending hours in each quest hub reading seemingly endless dialogue. It took me a few hours just to gather sidequests and orient myself. The story was convoluted, dry, and appeared to be going nowhere. The stronghold was a nuisance, rather than anything interesting. Combat had switched from a terrifying problem to a boring chore.By the endgame, combat had become more of a chore than anything, especially coupled with the amazingly terrible combat AI your party is equipped with. They don't like to listen to your directions, and they don't like to do anything that makes sense. The story had become so amazingly cloudy that I wasn't sure of the motivations of any of the characters. The final quest hub area was a pain. Combat was totally simple.And then, suddenly, the final boss battle was stupidly difficult and caused me to rage quit the whole thing altogether.I don't think this game was meant for me, even though I'm a fan of classic PC RPGs. It seemed to have all the weaknesses of Obsidian games with none of the strengths. I guess I endorse it because it is clearly a labor of love on the part of Obsidian, but I wouldn't put my full support behind it.			"

												The combat system in this game is fresh and innovative; nearly all encounters are challenging and tactically fair. The difficulty is in line with BG, Wasteland, IWD, BG2, NWN, TOEE, Oblivion, NWN2, Fallout3, Skyrim, and Wasteland 2.I was nearly killed during my first Triple Crown (permadeath + 50% enemy stats + reduced metadata) attempt by equilevel enemies (sp Ogres), The priest was crushed to a pulp by the final-standing Ogre, following a relentless assault on Magor's fortitude. Man, I'm high strung, but my adrenaline was pumping as Eirglass kited that last Ogre with less than 20 HP. She was in this several-minute long kite that I wasn't sure she could succeed -- after all, the polygonal pathfinding of the AI in this game is second-to-none, which is to say, the pathfinding algorithm has been optimized to satisfy the most trivial case. Moreover, I suspect the game uses an inefficient purely functional game state (which despite it's many technical and political advantages, has managed to lose me at least a Belt of Might +3) which is slower than O(1); indeed I have an i5, GTX 570, and 600MBps SSD.Armored lightly by a robe, his service was succeeded by Walter the Holy Nut-Puncher, an unarmed priest of Wael,The first Moon-Goddess chanter Luna was slain, after which her more constitutional Lunie chased the party to achieve the justice unobtainable by Eder or that other priest of Magran. I mean. these other guys have a lot of excellent things to say. Most of the time, the dialogue between Kana and the druid are preferable to the quiet between Mr. Mage_A and Mrs. Cipher_B.Either way, I can be blamed for expending more than 200W * 200 Hours= 40kWH on this game. I'm still enjoying it.If we have to wait a year for the sequel, that will be evidence that the CRPG genre is dead. This is genuinely an excellent game, even if it's lacking the storytelling authorship of a Stephenson/Baxter/Vonnegut/Geothe/Shakespeare/God.If you have thought about your D&D tatctics for more than a half hour out of character, then there is no question that you will enjoy this game.BRB, gonna go get the best Arquebus in the game.

												I'm a huge fan of CRPGs, played all the Baldur's Gate games, NWNs, Arcanum, DAs, Ultimas (Back in the very old days)Crazy fun and good. Every battle can take loads strategy with pausing and issuing commands. Very diverse with skills and items.I took the fighter and made him the tankiest guy THIS side of Defiance Bay and he is almost immortal now, send him in first and everyone starts focusing him, then send in the AoE mind flaying and stats lowering spells.. at last the DPS. Good recipe.Combat is amazing but it can take awhile to get into the lore of the game, there LOADS going on in regards with lore. You may feel bombarded at first but later on you get the story. There's also an in-game cyclopedia that can help lots if you don't know certain names or need to revise.Too much to talk about here, just play it and you'll see.If you love CRPGs then you should get this ASAP.

												So good. So so good.If you like Bauldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Divinity, or tabletop RPGs, I cannot recommend Pillars of Eternity enough. Accompanied by a cast of unique, unforgetable, voice-acted characters, you will journey across the land on an epic quest. If you don't like the provided characters, you can go to an inn and create your own, customized party. The balance is extremely good, and no class feels ""overpowered"" or ""too weak,"" and the health system is innovative and briliant. A bit expensive, but if it's your kind of game it's certainly worth the cost.			"

												One of the retro RPG games quite similar to Dragon age Origins. You command created character (you) that travels through the world to uncover deep mystery. While doing so you do many side quest and tasks and find (or create) other companions. You can go with up to 5 another champions in your adventure party (total party size is 6) while others take care of your keep which you are repairing from by enemies infested ruin to glorious castle.>> Pros+ Deep characters system (stats, classes, etc.). You even develop reputations (like honest, diplomatic or aggressive) by way you interact with NPCs.+ Way you created and developped your character is reflected in conversation choices available to you. This means if you create different type of character you can have different experience while playing again.+ Story is strong and well told.+ Combat feels balanced and rewarding.+ Graphics is simple yet nice with no extreme hardware requirements so you can play it on notebook.+ No internet connection required for play.+ Several difficulty settings that can be combined. It is not just basically divided into easy->hard options but you can turn on or off several difficulty features as well.>> Cons- Sometimes too many text to read.- Only few texts are voiced (some texts are only part voiced which feels really strange).- Extremely stupid AI of both your companions and opponents in combat. Characters stucking when available path is just next to them, going somewhere for no reason or just staying idle while few meters away there is battle is shamefully frequnt.- Poor auto management of characters automatic behaviour in combat. You can't tell what abilities your character can use like in Dragon Age but you can only pick template like ""Aggresive"" or ""Support"" which mostly doesn't meet your expectations and you are forced to handle all champions yourself, which is exhausting after several time.If you like to care mostly only your character, 2 last points above are really irritating. If you like to manage all your champions yourself they hardly matter.>> Pros or Cons? (depends on your personal taste)o No free world. You have system of little maps connected by their borders. In the end there is very little of true exploration because on every piece of living space there is something.o Nothing hold your hand in terms of quests means no arrows, question marks or explamation marks. You must find your quests by talking NPCs around and if you wish to not miss any you need to talk them all through. It's similar to Divinity Original Sin.o I personally found crafting useless except enhancing weapons which is exact opposite and is necessary.If you like those types of RPGs it is a good choice. If you like retro type games (no hand holding) do not hesitate a second, you will love it. It is not game for everyone though as it may seem slow and boring for modern type gamers used to Diablo 3 or Dragon Age Inquisition like games.			"

												Great game. Much more interesting combat system than in Baldur's Gate. Though it is not polished well so sometimes battles look like you are a lumberjack in the woods. Relatively complex class and abilities system sometimes require good knowledge of those to finish the fight but those happen only occasionally. Access to almost all the map from the beginning result in good battles scattered through the world which in late game on higher lvl makes most regular encounters very easy to beat. Battle AI is very usefull and sometimes gives insights into winning battles especially on Hard. I should admit that those rare battles which finish with half of your team lying unconsious and almost all with low health are unforgettable especially if you manage to do them from first try. And that trully pays for regular grinding. The plot raises some questions about religion so some might consider playing it for some theological interest.  Nicely polished dialogs and great sound!

												First, let me start by saying that this game is not for everyone. If you have never played an isometric CRPG before I recommend looking at videos as well as user reviews. This game, even on normal mode, can be very intimidating considering the amount of combat mechanics. The game goes over the basics, but many things either fly over your head at first or are not explained at all. However, once you are able to understand the core mechanics the game truly becomes very addicting, or it did to me.The story is also very good. While there is voice acting for some diaglogue be prepared to read quite a bit if you want to truly understand the setting and world youre in.I heavily recommend this game to anyone who wants something that different than the AAA market right now despite the few faults.

The gameplay is similar to that of Dragon Age (turn-based). There is so much to this game and I have only just begun to play, but I can see myself giving many more hours to PoE.

												Let me just preface my comments about Pillars of Eternity by saying that I played and completed Planescape Torment long ago, but still hold that game's story as the best that I have ever encountered in any game, RPG or otherwise. I am forever spoiled in that regard. Pillars narrative comes close, but does not quite hit the mark. There is a slight disconnect (perhaps by design?) that keeps it from hitting me in the gut the same way Planescape Torment did. However, it is much more complex, well-written and different enough from the usual run-of-the-mill plot you will find in it's peers. This is a rich, deep storyline, one in which the decisions you make as the player will determine the outcome. The isometric point-of-view provides value: strategic real-time combat that can be paused at any moment to issue orders (a must really), and an old school RPG feel that will give fans of Planescape Torment, the Baldur's Gate series, and the Icewind Sale series a tinge of nostalgia. You will encounter various NPCs, called companions, who can accompany you on your journey. Each one has a narrative that you can explore; this makes for a richer experience. While all are well written, some truly stand out, such as the Grieving Mother, Durance etc. The artwork in this game is fantastic. From the carefully crafted maps, the detail on the characters, and wonderful particle effects.Sound wise, I have no complaints. The soundtrack is atmospheric and the voice acting (especially for the companions) ranges from decent to excellent, nothing is subpar. If you are tired of saving the world from some great evil out to conquer it, time and time again, play this game. While the story won’t leave you thinking about it days after you complete it like Planescape Torment did, the journey is well worth it.			"

I only regret that there is a level cap and if you play the game thoroughly and with expansions (White March I, II), you'll reach it relatively soon. But in spite of that I was eager to finish the game and see the story end, which was quite interesting. Anyway, I consider this game a jewel for RPG fans and I am looking forward to playing more games of this ressurrecting genre in the future!			"

												I guess the first thing you would notice is that I have very little time with this game. That is true and that is why I'm writing this review now. I have tried five or six times to get into the game and found it just wasn't for me. To me, there is nothing worse in game reviews (or any review) than ""this game sucks"" or ""I wasted my money"". That is not helpful to anyone and incredibly short sighted. This game is exceptional for what it sets out to be. I don't have enough time with it to speak to bugs or issues within the game itself. As poilished as it is; I suspect there aren't many if any at all.So look, the fault lies with me. It just didn't fit my likes for RPG type games and that in no way reflects on Obsidian or Pillars in any way. I know other reviews have criticized people like me saying that we just cant be bothered with reading and maybe there is something to that. I read science fiction and fantasy books, started out gaming on Infocom titles that were text only in the 80s, and somewhere along the way found that stopping the game minute after minute to read a page full of storyline takes me right out of it. That's just me.Pillars to me was a heck of a lot of reading with brief snipits of combat thrown in. I felt more like I was reading a ""choose your own adventure"" type book than playing a game. The combat to me was not what I enjoy in a game. I'm sure others love it, but I don't need to pause and use this, pause and do that. That's just me. :)I don't think there is any question that Pillars is far deeper and far more story driven than most other rpg's out there. But, we all have different aspects of a game that matter to us the most. I tend to enjoy faster paced games that move out. I enjoyed the hell out of Titan Quest, the Diablo series, Torchlight 1 and 2, and I'm loving Grimm Dawn. Those (I think) tend to put more ""A"" in arpg.Regardless of what I spent on this title, it was in no way a waste of money to me. I tried it, didn't like it, moved on. It's not the fault of the game or the development team that my tastes differ. Bottom line: If my purchase in some small way helps promote the development of role playing games going forward...I'm all for it. We're all better off as a result.All that said, I am absolutely recommending this game because it is a great game. I have nothing bad to say about it. Fantastic job with the bits I saw in game. But, if you are into action rpg's and you identify with the games I've listed above, I'm not sure you'll feel at home here.			"

												After spending around 60 hours with this game, I'd have to say that I absolutely love it. Having not played any of the decades-old isometric rogue-like games, I didn't have much in terms of nostalgia for this type of game to bias my initial opinion, though I very much loved Divinity: Original Sin which came out much more recently. Plain and simple, this game is not for everyone. The combat is hard but very deep and rewarding once you learn the ins and outs of the mechanics and statistics. I've put in almost 60 hours, with one restart after the first 5 hours or so to try a different class, and I've only gotten through 2 of the 4 acts of the game. The game world is large, yet incredibly packed with stuff to do, people to meet, and big baddies (or goodies) to kill and loot!The only real cons in my opinion are:1) The AI pathing is kinda totally borked. In tight spaces, you and your companions rarely take the route you expect them to take, and while this is slightly frustrating on its own, it wouldn't be so bad except when combined with...2) ""Engagement"" - People who haven't played yet won't understand this much, but essentially during combat your characters are locked in place with the first melee fighter they come in contact with, and if you move your character away, the enemy gets essentially a free, immediate, hit. I wouldn't mind this mechanic if there were a way for your melee classes to pull aggro off of other characters so that you can attempt to control the battlefield better, but this seems to not exist (although admittedly I haven't played all variations of all classes, so the talent may be there somewhere, I just haven't seen it). Needless to say, combined with #1, it is frustrating to attempt to position your characters during a fight so that your melees engage the enemy melees, then have your glass cannons in the back accidentally be engaged because whoops now they're in the front because your melee character decided to go frolick in the flowers.3) No friendly combat AI option available. This one is a nit-pick, but for me there were many fights which didn't need my direction every second, but I wish the companions would use their abilities as necessary. I wish there was at least an ""enable companion use of 'per encounter' abilities"". Micro-management is fun during tough encounters, but for the more trivial ones, I wish there was more of an autopilot setting.4) No monk, barbarian, or rogue companions unless you hire them as adventurers (with no dialogue). Particularly monk and rogue companions would have been a great plot addition in my opinion.9/10			"

												If you loved Baldur Gate series then this will be the game you're looking for.  From it's beautiful rich environments, great story line, and intriguing companions, the game brings you into a great new world to immerse yourself in.  Some small game mechanics are still a bit wonky (pathing for your companion AI is one) but it barely bothered me.  The new system with Endurance vs. Health was strange but refreshing and by the end I actually loved the idea of it.  One of the biggest problems I had in BG series was the need to rest everytime I had my wizards use their spells, however in POE that wasn't an issue at all.  The same problem applied for health in BG but again, in POE with the Endurance vs Health system it drastically cut the need for me to be resting all the time to replenish 'health'.Another part of the game I loved was the different routes of personality you could take in this game.  The many different options to reply ingame allowed for multiple ways situations could play out.  Also if you didn't care for any of the ingame companions AT ALL you could hire/creat your OWN PARTY.  I don't know why you'd want to do that though...Eder/Aloth/Durance for life.			"

												I personally loved the game.  It certainly captures the feel of the IE games, particularly the first Baldur's Gate.  The art style is gorgeous, particularly when water is on the screen.  Your companion characters are interesting and well written.  I feel like Eder in particular is likely to become an all timer companion.  Make sure to use a variety of them, their responses in conversation with other NPCs can be great, particularly Kana.  The game handles well, although at times the combat can get a little chaotic.  Make sure to use the auto pause options to slow things down if you need to.  The main story is also great, dealing with the Gods and a curse effecting the region's children.  Basically, if you like the IE games, or just well written party-based RPGs, be sure to give PoE a try.			"

												A wonderful walk back to the days of issometric non 3D cRPGs. Wonderful draw graphics, great music and enviroment. And a not too bad story. Overall not perfect, but what is. Still I really enjoyed it and I also enjoyed finishing it and it never felt like a real drag.My really negative points here are mostly the constant load screens when switching areas. This can get really tedious when you are in a city and need to go from the second floor from one building to another in a nother district. That is five load screens. And I do no think that would have been necessary. Divinity: Original Sin did it without.Second would be the spells. There are too many and a lot of them feel just too similar with no big difference. You pretty much use you standard spells and thats it. There is no need to change or use different ones because the enemy has some certain high protection against it.The path finding can be really atrocious and often very hampering during battle. Too often one character is stuck because the AI is too stupid to walk around some object.Still, with all those complaints, I would highly recommend it to anyone who like cRPGs. I hope we get some really nice extensions to this. Or even something like a part II that will be so super awesome like Baldurs Gate II was over Baldurs Gate I.			"

												While I haven't had a lot of time to spend playing and considering I have been under the weather the past couple of days, I have to say Pillars has been some good medicine for me.   I can't wait until I am feeling well enjoy to actually play it longer but based on my 90 minutes so far, OMG this is the CRPG I have been waiting for.  Obsidian hit the nail on the head and I am loving the game so far.

												(NO SPOILERS)EDIT: I have since played Pillars to completion multiple times, and can now offer a more satisfactory review. STILL, I'll leave the old review down here for future reference.>>OLD REVIEW<<<This is a great game that combines many of the aspects we enjoyed from old-school CRPGs like Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights... ...except, I found myself that I am too old and lacking in time to enjoy games such as these anymore. And it is a crying shame, because from what I've played, Pillars of Eternity gets the formula just right, as expected of Obsidian. As such I must warn you that I barely even scratched this game's surface, but from what I've played, it's stupendous.>>NEW, UPDATED REVIEW<<It's great.I just didn't enjoy it.It's the mechanics, mostly. They just didn't click with me. It's to be expected. I unfortunately completely missed the Infinity Engine games when I was young, and so didn't develop an early taste for the classics, such as Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment and all that.So - yes. The moment-to-moment gameplay felt like a chore to me. This is a COMPLETELY SUBJECTIVE NOTION and shouldn't be taken as an absolute. That's the reason I'm still giving this a positive review, and with a wide berth at that. Yet - I -had- to play it. I loved Tyranny to bits. It felt like Pillars-lite to me, and the mechanics clicked nicely with my preferences, even though they're not THAT different from it's spiritual predecessor. However, I realized that that game would probably never get a sequel, right around the time that Pillars 2's crowdfunding campaign came out. When I learned that it would import saves and decisions directly from the first game, I just had to buckle up and play it - four times, to be precise.It is with no shame at all that I'll say that I cheated all the way through. That's why I have no achievements, even though I spent quite a bit of time playing it. I had no love for the mechanics - I was just there because I'm a huge sucker for Obsidian's storytelling. In that, I can confidently say that Pillars did not disappoint. Not even a bit.My main, not-so-subjective criticism: Pillars isn't your babies' first medieval fantasy. There's a lot of very interesting lore all over the place. The problem being, that the game's first act is painfully, grindingly slow, and takes a while to hook you in. That's what turned me off in the beginning. Once I got past that, I was in the clear, and every morsel of lore felt like a reward.That's it, really. I won't spoil anything, so I'll just go ahead and say that the journey was long and at times painful - but definetly worth it if you're a fan of Obsidian's stuff. The story is compelling, the characters are universally fun and well-crafted (Well. Some more than others - looking at you, two characters written by Chris Avellone that are really hard to NOT keep in my party), and if you're a fan of the Infinity Engine cRPG formula, you're in for a blast.

												Probably the best RPG experiences I've had to date. My first playthrough was on Hard difficulty, and I'm working on a PoTD playthrough. Pros: -character building is impactful, unique (the interaction between stats happens in a way I haven't seen before), and fair. There are a lot of viable ways to build your party. The key is balance and having ways to solve certain types of puzzles. -Story is pretty good. and the choices your pc makes affect what happens in the world pretty significantly. I really enjoyed the ending :) -Fights are (in my opinion) quite fun in a technical way. Some of the basic mobs have really ""interesting"" traits that force you to think a bit. It's hard to cheese unless you build your party specifically for hit and run strats. Additionally, the game does a good job of mixing the mob types and environments to present some surprising challenges. Particularly in the expansions.-No experience for killing people, avoiding the common rpg pitfall of ""complete the quest then kill everyone"" with a gating mechanic. -Lots of well written and interesting side quests-Dev commentary is cool! -Puzzles that you can actually solve without a wiki ::glares at divinity::Cons: -NPC attributes are locked in. This feels bad, since the NPCs are so much more interesting than custom characters. -Last area feels like it's not fully fleshed out. -DLC content throws off the scaling of the game. You can adjust to improve enemy strength, but either way a well built party will make the game trivial later on (besides bosses, which always require planning + attention). I felt that the balance of the game was spot on before doing WM. -Lack of good attribute choices at the highest character levels. In a lot of cases you'll end up just taking stuff you ignored for better things at previous levels. Definitely recommend for anyone who likes a mental challenge and doesn't mind a lot of reading.

												PILLARS OF ETERNITY a fabulous rpg which has tons of stats and classes with layers of graphical depth to make one's character unique and their own in every way possible. Exploration and combat are excellent with graceful smooth interaction which enhances the magic and wonder of discovery with the contrasting explosive tense combat. It is a much welcomed evolutionary step up from the BALDUR'S GATE series of old.Music is soothing and transcending touching the mind with soft kisses from another world. Graphics are thick with endless variety and detail making the world feel alive with sensual delights and death threatening terror. Lighting is a mixture of the surreal, eerie and haunting casting a shimmering glow upon dungeon walls and lighting wooded areas with torches that can also be used in combat to set enemies on fire. Ancient machines glow with futuristic energies from unimaginable dimensions where time seems to have been shattered as glass into a nullified state where it has no bearing. Nights are a spooky neon blue or romantic velvet blue for the lovers out there.Voice acting makes me connect with my character and the npcs of the world triggering emotional moments whenever the unexpected happens. Alongside the incredibly well written grim story and theatrical effects like dramatic music while cutscenes play out or a battle is about to begin these are some of the best things about Pillars Of Eternity.I love how pausing was implemented during combat and how it can be turned on or off in the options menu. Combat is very fluid along with movement and has a certain action packed motion to it making one thirst for more battle which in turn made me want to explore every nook and cranny of the world not only for treasure,alchemy ingredients,supplies,npc interaction etc but for lethal visually stunning death dealing encounters.Another great thing are the options for people who suffer color blindness as well as font scaling to make text bigger which is great for.. older eyes :) You can also set up the pace of combat and many other things in the options menu to make things as comfortable as you want them to be according to your play style.Writing is truly stunning in its excellence. Its on a level of high caliber literature bringing the story home with the sizzling steak appeal of a LORD OF THE RINGS movie. Characters come across with endless range of personality making them very likeable even if they are scoundrels. Best writing i have seen in a rpg in ages since PLANESCAPE TORMENT complimented perfectly by top notch professional voice acting.Indeed PILLARS OF ETERNITY is a beautiful and shocking harsh world which draws one in and does not let go in its seductive hug er i mean grip yea BONE CRUSHING GRIP. Before i knew it three hours had passed and i was still hankering for more but alas real life needs a chore or two done :)If your looking for a very intense modern day Baldur's Gate style experiance with a different combat system with its mix of pause/turned based action Pillars Of Eternity is the rpg to satisfy the dnd fever in you with mind blowing writing fleshing out a grueling story of a brutal world where every day is a dark journey to survive.Thank you OBSIDIAN and congratulations on your magnificent creation.

												Old school RPG for the modern times.You will feel right at home if you ever enjoyed games like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale and the original Fallout. If you never played such games, here's what you need to know:This a Classic Isometric RPG and it doesn't focus on action, but rather STRATEGY and MICROMANAGEMENT. As such, it could be overwhelming to those new to the genre, however the developers have managed to make it accessible to everyone with a wide selection of difficulty options that range from ""almost godmode"" to ""dark souls on cocaine"". Also the narrative is delivered through text. A LOT OF TEXT. Seriously there's enough to read here to fill a novel and if you don't like reading, you'll be in trouble. The plot is good, albeit not mindblowing, but what is worth praising is the detailed Lore created for this game.PROs+ Amazing pre-rendered 2D backgrounds packed with details+ Music fits perfectly with the high fantasy genre+ Loads of details in the lore and narrative+ Lots of hours of gameplay, especially with the expansion+ Works great on older systemsCONs- The lore is dumped on you quite abruptley and can cause confusion in the beginning (it gets clarified later on)- Central plot could've been more interesting- Minor inaccuracies in the in-game descriptions of items and spells- Steep learning curve on account of the lackluster tutorialsEasy to find at a decent discount these days, worth every cent!

												This game is huge and it gave me many hours of pure RPG fun. It is well made - I love the graphics, game mechanisms, the lore, characters and their interactions.. everything. I only regret that there is a level cap and if you play the game thoroughly and with expansions (White March I, II), you'll reach it relatively soon. But in spite of that I was eager to finish the game and see the story end, which was quite interesting. Anyway, I consider this game a jewel for RPG fans and I am looking forward to playing more games of this ressurrecting genre in the future!			"

												Played the game 3 times through. Twice without the addons and 2 times on PotD. I ♥♥♥♥ing loved it!The gameplay is great! Wonderfully created locations, rich with detail and supported with beautiful music that let's you immersively sink into the INSANELY deep lore. Characters come across differently, you earn a reputation and make decisions which change dialogue options and events as the game goes on. Combat is great and challenging. Encounters feel different every time. 2/3 runs of mine were on the highest difficulty and it was always fair. You had to plan everything, make use of traps, potions, crafting, scrolls, debuffs, etc but at NO point ever was it unfair. I always went for immersion, none of my 2 PotD chars were minmaxed!9/10-1 point for little details, that could have made immersion a little little bit better. Like the choice to make AoE completely INT-based, which meant that barbarians had high Intellect (RP-wise nonsense). Same for various reputations which got seperate numerical values. So you could have Deceptive 3 and Honest 4 and get a comment on your deceptive 3 or honest 4 reputation rather than a Honest 1-comment.But after all I would TOTALLY recommend this game! It'll be a great experience!			"

Characters are interesting, dialog is well written, and so many choices as far as how you want to build your character.And it has the famous line, ""You must gather your party before venturing forth.""

												I guess the first thing you would notice is that I have very little time with this game. That is true and that is why I'm writing this review now. I have tried five or six times to get into the game and found it just wasn't for me. To me, there is nothing worse in game reviews (or any review) than ""this game sucks"" or ""I wasted my money"". That is not helpful to anyone and incredibly short sighted. This game is exceptional for what it sets out to be. I don't have enough time with it to speak to bugs or issues within the game itself. As poilished as it is; I suspect there aren't many if any at all.So look, the fault lies with me. It just didn't fit my likes for RPG type games and that in no way reflects on Obsidian or Pillars in any way. I know other reviews have criticized people like me saying that we just cant be bothered with reading and maybe there is something to that. I read science fiction and fantasy books, started out gaming on Infocom titles that were text only in the 80s, and somewhere along the way found that stopping the game minute after minute to read a page full of storyline takes me right out of it. That's just me.Pillars to me was a heck of a lot of reading with brief snipits of combat thrown in. I felt more like I was reading a ""choose your own adventure"" type book than playing a game. The combat to me was not what I enjoy in a game. I'm sure others love it, but I don't need to pause and use this, pause and do that. That's just me. :)I don't think there is any question that Pillars is far deeper and far more story driven than most other rpg's out there. But, we all have different aspects of a game that matter to us the most. I tend to enjoy faster paced games that move out. I enjoyed the hell out of Titan Quest, the Diablo series, Torchlight 1 and 2, and I'm loving Grimm Dawn. Those (I think) tend to put more ""A"" in arpg.Regardless of what I spent on this title, it was in no way a waste of money to me. I tried it, didn't like it, moved on. It's not the fault of the game or the development team that my tastes differ. Bottom line: If my purchase in some small way helps promote the development of role playing games going forward...I'm all for it. We're all better off as a result.All that said, I am absolutely recommending this game because it is a great game. I have nothing bad to say about it. Fantastic job with the bits I saw in game. But, if you are into action rpg's and you identify with the games I've listed above, I'm not sure you'll feel at home here.			"

												I was a kick-starter backer for this game and am very happy with the end-result. Being a big fan of story-driven RPGs with nice gameplay elements this game fulfills both niches. A throwback to the 2d isometric hand drawn environments for those of us who are fans of nice illustrations.This is not the typical RPG we may be used to where we ""kill ever bad guy or enemy"" we come across. Albeit you can play it like that (I am heh), you'll just find it very difficult if you do if you're also on the hardest difficulty setting. For those who enjoy challenges this will definitely scractch an itch. But one may equally talk their way out of many hostile situations or simply avoid them.My only complains is that there's a bit too much side-content that draws me away from the main story for too long. Being a completionist I like to do every side-quest but occasionally I found myself rushing through them because I really wanted to get back to the main story. The fact that certain achievements are tied to these side-quests didn't improve matters, but hey I'm probably the only person who'd complain about too much content.If you enjoyed old-school rpg series like Buldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Torment you will definitely enjoy this game as well. Kudos to the devs developing a unique mechanic system since they couldn't very well use DnD rules :P.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. I'm glad to see good old CRPGs having such success. The story was interesting, it made me curios to find out more and more. I'm a completionist so I did every quest/task available. Some of the quests were a bit meh but overall it was ok. The companions were interesting and diverese. Shame they don't have much interaction with eachother. They were fairly quiet. One thing that really bugged me was the companions AI. They need a lot of micromanagement since they will get stuck on every obstacle on the way to the enemy....sigh. Apart from that the game was very enjoyable. In the future I'd like to see more roleplaying elements into it. Combat is all well and good but something feels meh. I also liked Tyranny, I hope there will be an expansion to that as well, hint hint ;)  "

In a lot of cases you'll end up just taking stuff you ignored for better things at previous levels. Definitely recommend for anyone who likes a mental challenge and doesn't mind a lot of reading.

												If you want a modern version of a game like Baldur's gate, this is your answer. This game DELIVERS. EASY but good craft system, loot system is alright, the graphics and spell effects are very good -- there's a LOT to try and to enjoy here. More classes than you can fully expore in a playthrough -- more spells then you can shake a stick at. Multiple caster types, all of which play differently. Fun and simple leveling system that also has it's subtleties in build creation. Story? It's got STORY for DAYS -- literally! Quests everywhere you explore, with multiple factions in each area with a reputation system that effects your dealings with them and has a genuine effect on the endgame. The game keeps a BIOGRAPHY of your character you can read like a story of your adventure -- All sorts of little things like this make this game a splendid example of the genre, but in addition to that there are little improvements here and there that just make it a better game than you're used to playing regarding games of this type. Your character's race/class/religion/etc really factor in to many exchanges and I felt like I got an ending which reflected the decisions I made -- with better detail than any game I can think of previous, and not always in ways I expected! In short, a real fun game, and despite it being a long ride I might actually play it to win it a second time... Not all RPGs can boast that. Combat is fun and strategic. Any cons? Sure -- I wish othere characters than the main character had more participation in dialogues, especially for a game where the dialogues are so strong. Beyond that, the game can be a little text-heavy in places -- long flowery descriptions of places, or dialogues that are longer than we might be accustomed. HOWEVER, I can't really gripe about having MORE content -- just be ready to read if you get into the game as much as I did. THOROUGHLY recommended.			"

												A resurgance of traditional RPG gaming on the PC. Taking the core gameplay style of the original Baldur's Gate, combining it with the storytelling of Planescape Torment and creating a whole new world with new character classes, skills, magic, and abilities. Obsidian have managed to create a new classic and benchmark for RPG games in this decade. One of the great features of the game is the way that skills, character class, race, past choice in conversations etc. all give you different options in conversation with NPCs and especially in scripted moments. Being without a particular skill is never game breaking but they can give you an edge when exploring, dealing with a villain or looking for loot. The game itself is huge with lots to do, many side quests and enormous replayability with the way that the main story unfolds. It incorporates morality, the nature of religion, good vs. evil and the player character in a closely interwoven development that has you almost wanting to skip the side quests just to findout what happens next. A must have for RPG fans.			"

DO NOT rush through this game it is horrible if you do, there isnt much in terms of replayability unless you like the old school style turn based combat on harder difficulties (i do) and if u do rush through this youll probably finish it in like 20hours or less (probably much less) in which case youll feel like you didnt get enough for your money. if u love isometric rpgs with amazing storys then get this regardless of a sale. if you just want a good story but dont like this games kind of combat just wait for a sale and set the difficulty to easy or story mode so you dont have a tough time with it because it can get quite challenging especially early on and on the higher difficulties since u might accidentaly stumble on a high level dungeon or area and just be completly outmatched by the enemies there.

												If you're an RPG fan like me who loves the classic RPG games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape Torment, then you will love this game. The party characters are likeable and you get to have conversations with them whenever. Sadly there isn't any romances, but I was okay with pretending I was in one with Aloth. The gameplay is fun and challenging even on easy mode. You find yourself strategically playing the game and pausing a lot, which is a neat change in comparison to how I played Baldur's Gate. I love the storyline and all the lore in this game as well as the enemy. Having your own fortress that you build up and protect is pretty awesome and then the neat dungeon system underneath is even cooler. While it didn't last as long as Baldur's Gate and other Forgotten Realms games did, it was well worth playing and I will definitely be playing it again. While I was broke and only had $1 to give, I was glad I helped Kickstart this game. I definitely look forward to more games like this in the future. :)			"

												Let's get the bad things out of the way first.Cons:- Terrible default controlsThat's about everything I hated in this game, but after much strategizing and rebinding, which involved: - Moving the map scroll keys from the directional pad to WASD- inventory to C, - map to TAB- next char/prev char to Q and E respectively, - reveal interactable objects to VAnd a whole bunch of other QoL improvements. The general idea is to completely remove my reliance from the other half of the keyboard, particularly the right side since I am right-handed and that's reserved to my mouse. Infinity Engine games needed this option like real bad. My settings are not intuitive for the casual gamer, but Diablo 3 taught me there were better ways to access my inventory besides going all the way to I. And Diablo 3 is pretty casual.But once all these are set, and I got used to my own controls, I am able to immerse myself in the game completely. No more glancing on the keyboard, no more groping for the right key - my eyes are on the game 100%, enjoying the sheer narrative bliss, the engaging tactical combat, and the captivating story that keeps me at the edge of my seat.This is a true successor to the infinity engine games. I would love to see Baldur's Gate on this engine, with its stunning visuals, pleasant to the eye yet evokes the imagination. This is the enigma that Bioware left behind instead of improving upon. While Dragon Age: Inquisition is a glorious adventure in its own right, my heart belongs to Eternity!Long live Obsidian!			"

												People spend a lot of time reminiscing about their gaming past. Few sub-groups do this as vocally and with as much affection as fans of traditional RPGs like the near-legendary Infinity Engine games: Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter, etc. This might be because so many of those gamers found these games in tandem with traditional pen-and-paper RPGs, which is understandable when you see how much similarity there is between the two. Publishers and developers of course play on this nostalgia and claim that their title will be the game that ushers in a resurrection of the classic RPG - a grand return to the days of high adventure. And of course they are consistently wrong because pitching a 50+ hour game with thousands of pages of text to read through is a hard sell.Fear not these false prophets, though, for Obsidian has delivered unto you a second coming of traditional swordplay, wizardy, and esoteric lore. Lead us not unto Dragon Age. Deliver us from The Witcher. For Pillars of Eternity is the power and the glory. It's every D&D session in a moldy basement, every late Saturday night in the cold glow of a CRT displaying Icewind Dale, distilled into one game and freshened up just enough to make it more functional to a current audience. And that's it. It's a very *pure* experience. I can't give it better praise than that.This shows you what a team can do when the budget isn't being poured into marketing, graphics, and bloated staffs. Exemplary work.			"

It said the Crucible Knights no longer wanted to work with me yet they invited me to join their delegation but when I went back to lady Webb to report all I could do was say i had burnt my bridges with all parties.  This is not the case though.  Also combat your party tend to get stuck or forget that they are fighting at all.  And why do all enemies head straight for your casters even though the fighters are in front of them??  They seem to ignore them and go straight to the mage.The game is still enjoyable and hopefully these annoying bugs will get fixed soon			"

												I'm about 40 hours in and enjoying it very much.  You can see the love and care that was put into the game  - something Bioware lost between Dragon age Origins and Inquisition.  Despite the flashy graphics of DAI, this game really makes you realize what an empty vessel that game is.The side quests are all very well done, no fedex here.  You are also given the ability to shape your character's personality whatever way you choose  - complete jerkass to saint.I also love collecting all the little pets along the way. The cat's walking animation is spot on.If you like the old school Baulders Gate type games, get this.I give it about a 9			"

												In the first few minutes of play alone I am brought back to the game that began my love for RPGS: Neverwinter Nights.Pillars of Eternity not only puts the player in the middle of the conflict, it makes them a part of it. While that may seem like trivial semantics, the sense of involvement it creates for me is phenominal.Unlike other ""classic"" RPGS like Baldurs Gate and Wasteland 2, that special sense of attatchment you feel to the first character you roll up doesn't get taken away by an overbearing story you are being told. Nor is your party just a bunch of different stats you chose to make up for the weaknesses of other party members. Like a true session of table top role playing, you are given a situation and asked to participate. Just keep in mind you aren't participating alone, despite this being a single player game.If you are a fan of interesting stories and characters, consequential decision making outside the good and evil spectrum, and RPGs in general, this game is for you.If you enjoyed The Witcher, Neverwinter Nights/NWN 2, Starwars: Knights of the Old Republic, or Dragon Age: Origins, you will enjoy this.

												Let's get the bad things out of the way first.Cons:- Terrible default controlsThat's about everything I hated in this game, but after much strategizing and rebinding, which involved: - Moving the map scroll keys from the directional pad to WASD- inventory to C, - map to TAB- next char/prev char to Q and E respectively, - reveal interactable objects to VAnd a whole bunch of other QoL improvements. The general idea is to completely remove my reliance from the other half of the keyboard, particularly the right side since I am right-handed and that's reserved to my mouse. Infinity Engine games needed this option like real bad. My settings are not intuitive for the casual gamer, but Diablo 3 taught me there were better ways to access my inventory besides going all the way to I. And Diablo 3 is pretty casual.But once all these are set, and I got used to my own controls, I am able to immerse myself in the game completely. No more glancing on the keyboard, no more groping for the right key - my eyes are on the game 100%, enjoying the sheer narrative bliss, the engaging tactical combat, and the captivating story that keeps me at the edge of my seat.This is a true successor to the infinity engine games. I would love to see Baldur's Gate on this engine, with its stunning visuals, pleasant to the eye yet evokes the imagination. This is the enigma that Bioware left behind instead of improving upon. While Dragon Age: Inquisition is a glorious adventure in its own right, my heart belongs to Eternity!Long live Obsidian!			"

												People spend a lot of time reminiscing about their gaming past. Few sub-groups do this as vocally and with as much affection as fans of traditional RPGs like the near-legendary Infinity Engine games: Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter, etc. This might be because so many of those gamers found these games in tandem with traditional pen-and-paper RPGs, which is understandable when you see how much similarity there is between the two. Publishers and developers of course play on this nostalgia and claim that their title will be the game that ushers in a resurrection of the classic RPG - a grand return to the days of high adventure. And of course they are consistently wrong because pitching a 50+ hour game with thousands of pages of text to read through is a hard sell.Fear not these false prophets, though, for Obsidian has delivered unto you a second coming of traditional swordplay, wizardy, and esoteric lore. Lead us not unto Dragon Age. Deliver us from The Witcher. For Pillars of Eternity is the power and the glory. It's every D&D session in a moldy basement, every late Saturday night in the cold glow of a CRT displaying Icewind Dale, distilled into one game and freshened up just enough to make it more functional to a current audience. And that's it. It's a very *pure* experience. I can't give it better praise than that.This shows you what a team can do when the budget isn't being poured into marketing, graphics, and bloated staffs. Exemplary work.			"

												I'm getting all emotional over this game now. It's like Baldur's Gate 2 but way better. This is like Baldur's Gate 3 with enhanced visuals and game mechanics to make it smooth and fun to play on modern systems. The game is challenging, but it gives you multiple ways to complete your objectives.What changed from Baldur's Gate 2:+ 3D models+ The stat system has been reworked (It got better)+ There are multiple ways to complete your objectives while still keeping the game challenging (more immersive, better)+ It's slightly harder. (I've only played the game on hard difficulty) (I like it)             An ogre for example looks more dangerous and hits harder too.+ Classes and skills have been completely reworked to make every class viable. This is a huge difference and major improvement. The bard for example used to be a silly character running around playing his harp in battles. The chanter from pillars of eternity on the other hand is totally badass.Obsidian has succeeded in making a game that gives you that same awesome look and feel you had when you were playing Baldur's Gate 2 on release day, and made it possible to enjoy this on modern machines with modern mindsets.The only negative point I can think of in this game is that at some point in the future I will finish it, which is sad because I want this experience to last.I've read some negative reviews to see what people could have issues with.I'll comment on some of them based on my experience (Check my playtime)Here are their gripes:-  Game is bugged.      -> I have only encountered 1 bug, The game completely crashed once.          Starting it back up I was able to replicate the issue, but it was easy to get around.          For a game that has just launched it could be a lot worse IMO- I'm stuck and had to go hire some toon to get my mechanics up     -> The  developer had apparently anticipated this problem and           they have actually implemented multiple ways to complete objectives.           This problem does not exist in the game in my experience.          Use your head and think of other ways. The game challenges you.- The combat is slow and it sucks    -> It's not an action RPG. If you have never played a game like Baldur's Gate, I suggest perhaps watching a tutorial video, but it really isn't that hard.That's it for my review. This is the best game that will come out in a long time still. "

												I'm one of the old school RPG fans and a KS backer.To be perfectly honest, just because it was a crowdfunded project, my expectations weren't very high.But here we have THAT game of our generation. Generous story, great art, well thought classes, smooth interface - everything that next game (BG3, PS:T2 or IWD3, whatever you wanna call it) needs to be.First off; the negative reviews, I believe they are written by people that are old time RPGers but are bored of the genre now.As for my expectations and what I got:* Setting: The setting is brand new, and backed up with an amazing historical background. It's rather too ""normal"" for my taste but Obsidian has done a respectable work in just 3 years. 4/5* Story: It never let's you go. It has tons of cliché moments in it but it manages to surprise you time to time as well. I could do with a more personal story but guess customized characters don't allow it. 4/5* RPG mechanics: These are new too. They work quite well, and there are almost no trash stats at all. Perks and talents are quite interesting as well - I just wished some fun perks or traits but it can come in a later expansion. 5/5* Interface & gameplay: This is probably the strongest side of the game. The interface works flawlessly, especially when compared to older IE games. 5/5* Visuals: To put it simply; they're amazing, in terms of quality. The map designs may be a little too bland for some people's taste but the customers asked for a better version of Baldur's gate series and they got it. 5/5* Music: Very atmospheric. It's not everywhere but when you hear it, it makes a difference rather than making background noise. 5/5* Companions & NPCs: Both your companions and NPCs are very detailed and involve unreadable amounts of text. Your companions are interesting enough, so you don't really want to make a custom party. However as a PS:T fan I was expecting some extreme characters such as Morte or Nordom - with unique non-class based mechanics. But now I'm not sure this franchise is going that way. 4.5/5Final: This is an awesome, huge, fresh game for all RPG fans but targets especially BG fans, which I'm not. I mean, Baldur's Gate is a Bioware franchise and Bioware games are rather bland and dull compared to Black Isle/Obsidian. Still they have colored this new ""BG world"" with lots of Obsidian colors and they managed to capture me easily. It's better than all past Bioware games (BG & DA series) but a little duller compared to past BI/Ob franchises. Best game I've played in the last 2 years and one of the top 10 RPGs of all time. 4.8/5All we need is Obsidian to make xpacs & sequels to this game - preferable a little more courageous.			"

												Simply a great game. I see people saying stuff like it's the ""best since Baldurs Gate"", but in my opinion, that's wrong. This is better than Baldurs Gate. I'm not aware of any current RPG that can match this game, neither in story nor gameplay. It's very deep in the character customisation, which is what's lacking in most modern RPGs, and the most important thing for me when it comes to these kinds of games.I'm not sure I like the game setting all that much, though. It is a bit lacking in atmosphere. The races and classes aren't very inventive either. You get the impression they feel they need to be original and have to make up their own stuff, but in the end they really might have just as well gone with the standard elves and halflings and all that - their inventions really don't add anything to the experience.Those are obviously minor problems. The game setting is a bit boring, but not annoying like the Elder Scrolls one for example. The good really outweighs the bad here. There is also a lot of emphasis on exploration, which is another thing i enjoy in games, and I think the solution to the balance between exploring and fast travel works well. Also, the music is wonderful, which is allways a great plus and increases immersion in and enjoyment of the game.I would most definately recommend this game to any fan of rpg-type games, for the reasons stated above.

												I am an oldschool RPG fan, and I have to say that I played every big RPG back in the days and some I have finished multiple times like Planescape Torment, all Fallout games, all Black Isle games like Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale etc. so I think that I am a person who can give a really sober and neutral review for someone who needs the kick before buying the game.The first thing that caught my attention after starting the game were the visuals. The graphics are just amazing. I was really amazed when I saw it, especially after I re-played Icewind Dale the so called HD edition. That graphic compared to Pillars is like from B.C. Pillars look gorgeous. I really really appreciated the zoom in/zoom out featuire which these types of 2D isometric RPG's were always lacking.The music is also very good, and some songs are epic. Remind me the good old times from Baldurs Gate. Fits very very well to this fantasy world. My only problem here was, that after a while it felt repetetive. I am not sure of the songs are just similiar or there arent many of them ( didnt heard the ost ) but I had the feeling when I entered a map that the same music is playing .... again, or atleast a very similiar one.The story overall, is basicly what makes these games so good. The story is always huge and complicated in these games. Yes, you read a lot in this game. I am a person who not only read in games ( RPG's ) , but I also read a lot of books and not only fantasy. I must say that the story in Pillars for me was mediocre, or below avarage at its best compared to other games aswell, like Final Fantasy, Baldurs Gate, Planescape Torment ( one of the best ). Pillars just doesnt catch up here. People who never played a good story based game, or never read a very good book... they might like Pillar's story but dont expect something mind blowing or something that gives you chills everytime you think about it. It's just not there for me.Speaking asbout the story, I think that the NPC's I had in my group or Castle ( waiting for me to pick them up ) werent interesting. Eder ? Aloth ? I really wanted to like them I really tried.... I just couldnt care less about their story. It's not Minsc and Boo from BG, it's not Morte or the Nameless One, It's not Morrigan from Dragon Age. Thats why I created 4 characters on my own and just ignored almost all the NPC sidequests. I didnt enjoyed them. But you dont have to care about this if you didnt played any of these games, it is my little little note which I wanted to share.The biggest feature of this game is always the combat, which is amazing in Pillars. It is very dynamic, fast, colorful, bautiful... and also chaotic at the beginning. You can slow it down anytime, or even pause to assign commands. Basicly it works like this. You press spacebar to pause the game, assisng command with every party member. For example, the Paladin activates this spell, atatck with Warrior this enemy, Cast a Fireball with the Mage, Cast a AoE defensive buff with your priest etc.... once you done, you unpause the game and every command you did during the pause will trigger and happen at the same time. Then, you press pause and again.... you assign command ans so on. Easy enemies can be beaten easily without the pause button, but tougher bosses or encounters literally are unplayable without the pause. But thats ok, combat is designed around this in these games.The lack of D&D features, names, spells is also a letdown for me. This is not the Baldurs Gate 3 I wanted. I want my Magic Missile not some other looking ( similiar ) spell which is called Minoletta Missiles, it is very confusing at the beginning. You know what was really good in all the previous games ? Once you played any of them and then you jumped on the other one, you didnt had to study all the spells because in the world of D&D every spell did always the same. You had a Magic Missile, Mirror Image, Fireball wtc. in every Black Isle fantasy game. Here I had to read, study, find out what works and what not on my own... I didnt liked it too much, but again IGNORE all this if you never played the previous games. This is my personal note. I understand that implementing the D&D rules is a matter of a lot of money and license but.... oh well.Took me 60 hours exactly to beat the game. At 51 hours, I was at the final boss, but sadly I couldnt beat him because I was level 7-8 with my party. Had to return here at max level which is 12 btw, and it was suddenly super easy. The point is, that the game didnt told me to do all these sidequests to actually even have chance to beat the final boss. I always thought sidequests are optional, not recommended. A mistake. so dont do the same. You cannot beat the boss I think under level 10, but max is recommended.Overall the game is really really good. A lot of gametime, possible replayability with multiple and different endings. Looks very pretty, plays very smooth. I had a great time. A comeback of a classic RPG. A reminder in the modern days, what we loved so much in the late 90's. Definitely recommended.8/10			"

But you can just hire people for your party too.Crafting - You have to pay to craft or enchant...but who are you paying? nobody is around.That's all I can think of off the top of my head, but it is definitely a great game, and I am thoroughly enjoying it.

												First of all: I'm not good at reviews. But I felt compelled to write on for this game. Second: Yes, this is a decent game. Do I recommend i? I really don't know. Part of me wants to say Yes because I'm hoping for a better cRPG in the future (maybe Pillars of Eternity 2?), part of me says No because this wis simply a subpar game.This game has been called the spiritual successor to Baldurs Gate. And so I will compare it to BG extensively in this review. Baldurs Gate IMHO looms as a menacing shadow over every cRPG out there. Now, PoE may be Baldurs Gate's successor ""spiritually"", but it's definitely not quality-wise. It is impressive how a game that is almost two decades older is still better. Off the top of my head, there are only two aspects I can think of that PoE does a better job of than Baldurs Gate: 1) of course graphics, 2) UIThat's it. Everything else is just decent but certainly not overwhelming: 1) PoE's plot is introduced to the player with walls of text. While text and lengthy dialogue aren't bad per se (see Planescape: Torment), presentation is key. And the way it is presented to the player is not very captivating. In fact, for quite some time, I didn't really understand anything about what was going on. And worst of all, I didn't really care because I got bored of it real fast.Compare that to, say, the start of Baldurs Gate 2 and you immediately see the vast difference: You play through, your character ""lives"" through what's happening. It is presented in such a way that it's involving and immersive rather than spamming walls of text at you. 2) Next is content: This game is very slim. I don't know if that's a lack of recources on Obsidian's part or what. Let's just say that. While Baldurs Gate is bursting with content, in PoE, you wander through these tiny maps that barely contain any quests or points of interest. You could spend dozens of hours in the starting city of Athlatka alone in BG2. More importantly, BG's locations feel alive. It feels like the devs put a huge amount of work and detail into each and every map, into each and every quest. PoE, in comparison, looks pretty but feels empty. 3) Characters: I'm not good at names, I forget characters fast. So it means something if I still remember the crazy Minsc who constantly talks with his space hamster, the strong personality of Jaheira, the outcast Harper who lost her husband, Nalia's silly notion of being the one privileged to help the needy, the slightly annoying Aerie who lost her wings, Yoshimo who always made fun of martial arts cliches and so many other notable heroes. In PoE, the only character I feel I'm gonna be able to recall in a few months is Durance. 4) Replayability: What incentivizes you to replay this game? Not only is it lacking in content, there are no real major decisions to be made by the player that would alter the game in such a way that you would miss out on something in the first playthrough. Whether that's good or bad is another question. I wouldn't replay, say, The Witcher 3 either. But it is said that there people who replayed Baldurs Gate about a dozen times. 5) Combat mechanics: This was the biggest letdown for me, personally. I can overlook lack of content or a less entertaining plot if the game's mechanics are good. In BG, you would reload battles over and over again (at least with certain mods that made the AI smarter). At some point, you would find a way to win them. With the right pre-battle buffs, the right potions quaffed before the battle started, the right spells, you could eventually win. You wouldn't just spam everything you had, you actually had to think. And then you would hear from a friend about another way to do it. Almost every battle was exciting and had countless possibilites of how to approach it. In PoE, while there are huge amounts of stats and extensive tooltips explaining each and every one, combat more often than not felt like a mindless spam fest. You just clicked through all the characters' abilities and talents and hoped they would do enough damage to bring the next group of mobs down. At times, combat felt like a mere ARPG with the need to pause only because you have six characters rather than one. Never did I need to think about tactics, about what certain spells or abilites actually did specifically. That's my 50 cents. And again: Just because it tries to revitalize the old-school cRPG genre, it should receive an A for effort.  "

												This game is almost a masterpiece. I use the word ""almost"" 'cause Pillars of Eternity has some significant flaws concerning gameplay: frustrating glitches, ridiculously low level cap (well, for the completionist, which are any dedicated RPG player), etc. But I haven't experienced such a deep immersion into the game world for many years. That's why I rate this as ""Must Have"" for any CRPG fan who left out there. You won't regret, I promise.			"

												Good challenging combat if you put it on hard mode however if you buy the expansion youll level up higher than what they were made for.  There is an option to have it scale but I found little to no challenge in the first expansion.  Working on the second one now.  Way too much diaglog also in the main game.  If you like this game engine/rpg this is a great game.  Reminds me of playing Baulder Gate games back in the day :)			"

												If you're new to this genre of games, then it has a bit of learning curve, but once you get the gist of game mechanics, then the game is really immersive. The story is interesting and flexible, you can play go through the story however you want; as a good guy or a bad guy. Combat is a little dull at times, but extremely challenging on others, which keeps you keen and on your feet as you go through the game, you can choose to avoid confrtontations if you'd like through careful choice of responses. All these factors put together make the game have high replayability.TL;DR: Strongly Recommend!  "

												Great RPG game overallPros:1. Quite interesting tactical combat, a lot of challenging fights2. Appealing graphics3, Quite callenging (beaten game twice pre/post WM DLCs on highest difficulty)4. Plot is great compared to 95% of modern games.5. above average replay value6. quite interesting system with various weapons.7. Almost forgot to mention this - it is the first RPG i played that FINALLY got rid of inventory managment!!!Cons:1. Plot could be a bit better considering it is Obsidian. Too much about Gods etc... to my taste.2. Way you are getting experience points is a bit flawed - beginning is very hard, but after a while you will outlevel everything and game will be a way too easy. I know it can be avoided, but i still think it is somewhat a design fail3. Personally i like character building system, but i think it lacks variety.Overall 8.5/10one of my favourite games.			"

												WowThis game has almost transported me back to the days of the infinity engine crpgs like bg and bgII. I know its been said a million times already but its balances the old and new fantastically. It reminds me heavily of wasteland 2 ( another brilliant game from 2014) , with the classic pause/issue command combat from the infinity engine. The game has kept many features such as the HUD pointers/formation , even cute animations that are cleary influenced by the cult predecessors that are mentioned time and time again. Gorgeous music too that is extremely nostalgic. There are so many things to mention but I want to get back to the game! A few minor bugs that need to be ironed out too, which should be patched soon! 10/10 game.. hardcore rpgers MUST play!			"

												This game is great! Highly recommended. If you take the time to learn the system, lore, and combat/exploration mechanics you will enjoy it thoroughly. Just get it and play!  Wonderful!EDIT:  After playing many more hours I just want to reiterate how excellent this game is. Even if you have not played the older classics like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale or Planescape and you want to play a Dungeons and Dragons ""type"" game with a marvelous story, well written dialogue and lore, really fun combat, great graphics, and cool items and spells (""Calling the World's Maw"", the 4th level Druid spell is AWESOME and hilarious!) then this really is the game for you. Don't expect to rush through it like Diablo. Don't look for 1st person angles and total open-ended environments like Skyrim. DO look for a really interesting leveling system, fun and funny stories, and an addictive experience. I am having a hard time NOT playing this game...  or even thinking about it while I am at work.

												BASED ON 50+ HOURS PLAYED, NO SPOILERS: Obsidian set out to recreate the wonderful Infinity Engine games and succeeded thoroughly. Although it deviates from the classics in quite a number of ways, it is a wonderful interpretation of what made those games amazing while distinctly setting itself apart as an amazing cRPG on its own merit. Pillars of Eternity showcases how much amazing writing can do while offering you immense control over your own narrative through the highly varied dialogue options. Combat is fast (comparatively) and highly enjoyable, offering a great stategic challenge and allowing the eleven different classes to have their own playstyle. This is as close to a perfect cRPG as you will get. Full video review:

												Just finished and after 80+ hours of solid gameplay I can honestly say this is one of the best RPGs I have played in years.  The attention to detail is extravagant.  The story and overall writing is superb.  I have never felt so immersed in a game from all of the decisions you can make that truly impact the game.  Also, the amount of control over character attributes/statistics helps build dynamic combat strategies that keeps the game fresh.There just isn't enough positive things I can say about this game other than I highly recommend it.  I have been playing RPGs for 20+ years and this one easily ranks in the top 5.  If you haven't played it - do it! "

												Disclaimer: This piece was not intended as a review. Therefore it is written with a lot of personal opinions from me as a gamer perspective. This has little to no analysis as me the game designer.The short version is that I greatly enjoy Pillars of Eternity. It brings some old school game design and emotions back to the industry. There are moments where a critical eye towards modernizing aspects would've been welcome. I would personally enjoy it if games like these would maintain their old format with modern elements. That way this genre can be revitalized and enjoyed for generations to come.–-------------------------------------------------I can understand how some might find the pace slow. Thankfully I play a wide range of games going from the past paced Wrack to turn based games and everything in between. Each genre has its own pace to work with and switching between them can be tough as a gamer. It took me a while to get used to the pace of Serious Sam and Wrack, because everything is so damn slow these days to begin with. Even the ""fast"" shooters are really slow compared to games in the past. I didn't even notice this until re-playing some of them. Not so weird seeing how most ""fast paced"" games are made with console controllers in mind. Those are just slower to begin with and have invaded PC gaming as well. In that regard I can somewhat understand how some people might have trouble getting used to the slow pace of Pillars of Eternity. Simply because its on the other extreme end of the pacing scale.So far I've restarted Pillars a total of 3 times. But I always end up going back to the same party build up. You need 2-3 tanks to get by. Especially against larger groups of opponents. In that regard I find that it doesn't really matter what kind of a character you make yourself. You'll have to make one to fit one of the group roles. The battles won't drastically change all that much. Only the interactions with the world and dialogue options will alter. Even that seems to be limited. I clearly see old DnD dungeonmaster techniques in which you create the illusion of freedom and diversity. Your character might not have 18might to scale that wall. But hey just have Eder do it for you and then drop a rope so you'll still end up on top of the wall. You'll never really have a win-lose situation due to that. Only in places like Raedric's hold you actually have 3 choices on how to enter his hold and deal with the situation. Downside is that if your main char lacks the stat to climb vines you won't be locked out of that route and have to use one of the remaining entry points. You will get the option to have one of your party members to take your place. One hand that is only logical and real since you work as a team. Other hand you won't get any real win/loss situations.Different dialogue options is more fun. At times you do get some results that are different then another playthrough. Especially since it is also combined with your reputation. As well as the reputation how how you usually respond such as diplomatic, cruel, benevolent etc. Also nice that, just like D&D, there are different DC's (difficulty checks). There are chat options at 13,15,17,20 etc which unlock different responses and interactions. Catacombs under Defiance Bay is the first place where you'll actually notice this aspect most clearly. How you developed your character and gained reputations will matter. Choices you made up to that point will have their impact. Something you don't really see in many games.Combat is clunky as hell. Even if you enjoy turn based like I do it still is annoying at times. I can understand how many of us, me included, like games that capture that old school feeling. That doesn't mean games like this need to be full with outdated game design philosophy. Some elements would benefit from being modernized while maintaining a critical eye on the how. With all the spells and skills available it is only normal to use pause a lot and have a relatively slow pace. There simply is a lot of depth and choices that need to be made almost constantly. Sure the tanks do nothing but use knockdown combined with a load of passives to engage large groups of opponents and staying alive. But the rest of the group is a lot more work. Especially with cone shaped AoE spells that require some to get into proper positioning in order to work. Strategically this type of combat is fun and challenging. But at times it simply isn't intuitive and smooth...with moments that are downright unresponsive. With large fights the screen gets cluttered with all those little boxes above the character's heads and spell effects and the rings on the ground indicating what's going on. I would've loved if games like this would incorporate a camera that you can rotate just like Grim Dawn has.Which brings me to the Graphical Aesthetics. As always I love it. Everything blends well together. The first time you temporarily lose camera control for a small ""in-game cut scene"" conveyed the emotion of nostalgia and familiarity. This looks and feels like those old school cRPG's which most of us love. You see the love for D&D world building and tales of a fantastic story. The art style and how certain elements get portrayed early on in the game immediately set the right tone. It felt as if I had missed it more then ever realized. Almost had to pink away a tear in the corner of my eye. On the other hand it also has a downside in modern times. All art is pre-rendered and has to be fully loaded when entering a new area. Which means A LOT of annoyingly long loading times. Something that would occur less with 3d models that would be rendered by the graphics card when getting near the location. And using 3d models would also let people rotate the camera for a better and clearer overview of crowded battles. Question remains how going to 3d models would effect the aesthetics of the entire game. Would it effect it in such a way that those conveyed emotions would no longer be generated?Regarding modernizing games like this... Well I don't want them to become fully fleshed 3d open world games. Let them be isometric, top down or whatever. But that doesn't mean some Quality of Life changes can't be made. For example the TAB button is getting worn out drastically. I move a lot in stealth and after every move action I press the TAB to see if there is something hidden. If you have a high enough perception you'll notice things without using this method. When it comes to D&D, especially since 4th Edition, I found passive Perception and active Perception a very pointless mechanics. The same is being used in Pillars of Eternity it seems. It is something that needs to be looked at. Then find a proper solution for this mechanic.The group stealth issue still annoys me. After your characters reach lvl 3 or 4 they are becoming truly powerful. No more issues of survival, lack of damage or whatever. They feel solid like adventures should. The rogue, combined with the right passives, will cut through opponents like a knife through hot butter. That is awesome and what we'd expect. However the other aspects of a rogue don't work well at all. Placing traps seems rather pointless. Out of the many that I've placed in front of a door that opponents have to run over...only 1 actually activated. Using Stealth to sneak into a room and ambush opponents with a first strike isn't going to happen...EVER! I've been investing in stealth for all members in the group. It has happened how the entire group could stand beside a troll without it noticing us. But using the backstab of the rogue...still not happening. Something is seriously flawed here. The rogue needs to be able and use stealth on its own for the combat aspect. Outside of combat you simply select the rogue and move it on its own away from the group. Such as scouting ahead and removing traps for example.			"

At 15 hours of gameplay I strongly recommendIf you liked games like Icewind Dale and Baldur's Gate, or are a fan of classic style RPGs you will enjoy this game.The pricepoint may be discouraging to people who look at it as $45 for a 2D game but the RPG elements are truly well done, the world is immersive, the characters are interesting and the gameplay has that familiar tough but fun feel of older RPGs.Rather than write paragraphs of why I'm enjoying this game I've decided that a list would be both easier to read and summarise the features that I've found enjoyable: The 2D art is amazing and the pre-rendered backgrounds look excellent The conversation has a depth that allows your character's background or attributes to be relevant There are multiple paths to the scenarios I've encountered so far Combat on higher difficulties requires thought and careful planning The classes are interesting, and while there are still a few familiar faces amongst typical RPG classes there are a few classes may have been inspired by more recent RPGs which brings new facets to classic gameplay The stronghold is a more recent feature to RPGs that allows players to become invested in an asset which functions in game time SO MUCH LORE. There are a lot of short stories tied to named characters for those who like to readAnd finally the two most important features I'd like to note: There are Elves I can play a RangerI would have liked to have seen the option for LAN or Internet connection for cooperative multiplayer, a little more customization for the character models and portraits, and I have the concern that players that are new to this kind of game may get lost (I know I've felt a little lost once or twice already and needed to consult the Journal).

												At 10 hours in I feel I have still barely scratched the surface of this game. Though the ruleset has changed, the look and feel of Baulder's Gate have been inherited in almost every way. The writing is amazing and your peanut gallery of a party always enjoys giving their two cents. I have yet to see what challenges are brought along with keep ownership, but I know being a money drain seems to be the first. Those of you familiar with this sort of pause-based gameplay will feel right at home. The part which grabs me the most, however, is the look and feel of the world: a Forgotten Realms aesthetic with what looks to be a splash of the first Diablo's darkness.The spirit of Black Isle and the soul of Bioware seem to reside in Obsidian, and I can't wait to see what's on their horizon.

												I'll try to be short cause most people don't read long reviews anyway..My opinion of the game after having finished it and having 90+ hours of gameplay is :-- it's basically a remake of Baldur's Gate § Neverwinter Nights with today's graphics and technology.The story is different, but everything else is either identical or slightly modified.+ vs -+ it's polished, I hardly had any bugs at all, it runs smooth, except for the loading screens and save/load games which became longer and longer as I played+ The monk (which in other games I played was underpowered) was absolutely awesome without being OP. I loved playing that character.+ The story is ok, actually, it's more than ok, i'ts very detailled and interesting. I even find it well written at times.+(?) it's got a lot of feature identical to Baldur's Gate, even the ""help a man in a fight outside a bar and he joins your party afterwards"" (NW2 with the dwarf), to many, this is a positive thing I guessI can't really think of anything else, it all runs smooth with not to many hiccups.- It feels like it's not a finished product- It feels shallow and not coherent, example : big city has riots, you go back there after a short while, almost everything is as before except for one or two NPCs who say a few different things- though the background story is pretty good I think, the actual conversation scripts and peripheral story writing can be absolutely terrible at times, I was sometimes literally smacking my head- they did reproduce from the old successfull RPGs, but reproducing from a good game doesn't make a game good.... they didn't build on anything, they didn't push any barriers, they didn't bring any depth to the characters and the story or even the setting, the world and so on.It felt like a polished but unfinished game. There was no creativity, there was nothing ""new"" except for details mostly related to modern technology.Conclusion : It's like playing Baldur's gate I and II and NW 1 and 2 mixed together with today's technology and a different story.ie, nothing special.conclusion : I did enjoy playing it for a while though I got bored as well after a while, I only finished it out of principle. And I'm sure many people will enjoying playing it, in fact whoever's reading it, you'll probably have a ""nice"" time playing it.But it's certainly not an exceptional game, certainly not as good as all the hype was saying and certainly not worth the price when you compare that to games like The Witcher 3.10-20 euros, yeah, good buy, but other than that ..and that was my short version :p			"

												This caught me in an interesting time: I didn't want to play any games, my intentions were to sit down reading a well written story. And it appeared I could get the best of both worlds with Pillars! Its quality storytelling and rich language would make any book proud, and the gameplay, despite being tedious sometimes with lots of micromanaging, is nicely balanced and provides an tactical challenge. The game is way more user-friendly than BG and won't punish you too much for your decisions, making it more fun to really play your role.I was kind of afraid to get a typical fantasy setting with elves, magic and ancient artifacts… well, you get a little of the latter (and the former as well), but just by making gods and reincarnation a major part of the world Obsidian made it fresh and original, with just the correct amount of disturbing. You get to decide on difficult topics like morality of science and the role of religion.This is definitely not the right game if you want to hack-n-slash to the bad guy and make it a day (but even in this case the game may not be so disappointing). It is thoughtful, beautiful, and emotionally delivering.			"

												Pillars of Eternity is a fantastic old-school cRPG game with wonderful isometric graphics, engaging combat, and compelling story. I originally funded this game on Kickstarter (Sep 2012), and I have been eagerly waiting for the game’s release. It has been well worth the wait and the game has far exceeded my expectations.I have always been a fan of the original Baldur's Gate and Fallout games. If you enjoy these types of games, you will definitely like Pillars of Eternity.The writing and dialog was done very well in the game. You will need to be prepared to do a lot of reading, only a small (critical) portion of the game is voiced. If you end up skipping through most of the dialog, you might be lost, or required to read cliff notes.Highly recommend this game, 9/10 "

												I never write reviews, but this game deserves one.IIf you care too much about graphics, AAA game cutscenes, fast paced 0 depth combat you are not going to like this game. This game actually requires strategy, you have to know actually what youre doing in big combats, pausing the came constantly, repositioning your companions (you have to manage 6 characters at one point), casting spells acordingly to the situation, Interrupting-focusing high threatening targets.So, for the lads with no experience with this kind of RPG.1.- You just cant pop all of your skills and kill everything while you heal infinitely using potions.2.- There is no Millions of damage skills (*I reck everything  spamming a single button*).3.- Traps in dungeons are no ♥♥♥♥ing joke, they obliterate you.4.- You have to read a lot if you want to entoy the story (YES, READ)5.- No, you cant be lvl 100.6.- Some batlles are so tough you will cry.To Finish, the writing is very good, The pre rendered HD visuals looks stunning no matter what people say, this is a beatutifull game, the sound and the soundtrack is really good and feels on point on what you are doing. i dont want to spoil you anything, but this game has so much depth its scary. I havent messed yet with the enchanting system, or crafting, but its all there, everything a good rpg should have is there.This game takes the RPG'S genre to its former glory, there is nothing like it right now, if you liked Baldurs Gate, Dungeon Siege 1 and the likes YOU CANT MISS THIS ONE.IT´S THE BEST RPG RIGHT NOW, THERE´S NOTHING LIKE IT,  IT´'S JUST THAT GOOD.  10/10			"

												I don't usually write reviews for games, but I felt compelled to this time. I didn't find out about Pillars of Eternity in time to back it on KS, but I began supporting it as soon as I learned of its existence :)As a kid I played the old Infinity Engine games. I think my first was Fallout 2, then Fallout, then Planescape: Torment, then everything else. Basically, I cut my teeth in gaming on some of the best (arguably the very best) Western-style CRPGs ever made. It gave me a sincere appreciation for storytelling in games that has served me really well since, though I think any fan of RPGs remembers the dry spell in the 2000s where it looked like CRPGs might irrevocably change to something much lamer, or just not get made anymore. If I had to pick a game that ended that negative outlook, probably The Witcher, by my reckoning, and it has been a great deal better since. I guess it's a real resurgance of craft and storytelling in CRPGs :)This game is the best one out of any that I've played since Planescape: Torment, though. Bar none. It has an engrossing story, a brilliantly realized and organic (but mystical!) setting, places that feel truly alien through sincere and earnest effort on the part of the developers. Interactions with NPCs carry the dramatic flair that a VERY good dungeonmaster can bring to a P&P tabletop game, and that feeling is only further enhanced by the clever system of scripted events in the game that have multiple stat or skill checks and require some thought to navigate without peril. They don't happen often enough for you to start predicting every time you'll have one, but they do happen often enough that they are a serious gameplay element and not a gimmicky afterthought. The user interface is a brilliant combination of accessibility and feature-richness, evoking the Infinity Engine interfaces in general but without their frustratingly restrictive control schemes.I haven't played enough to assess how the game will be in retrospect, after the story has ended. But I am absolutely enthralled by my role in the story so far, and I am not looking forward to the end of it so much as having gone on this awesome gaming journey. You don't get stuff like this often. Buy it, if you're even a little interested you ARE the type of gamer it's for. This will rekindle any person's love for old CRPGs, and I bet it'll make a lot of new fans too!			"

												The 290-odd hours I've put into this game would have been enough to finish writing my novel.I probably spent most of that just messing around with character generation.I am so weak.Two thumbs up, Pillars of Eternity.  I hate you.			"

												An isometric RPG following in the steps of predecessors like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale,Pillars of Eternity might not be as good when compared to them but remains nonetheless an enjoyable experience.Pros:-nice story overall,some companion and side quests are very nice aswell-decent graphics,even though they don't hold up when zoomed close-good soundtrack-a few interesting classes amongst the usual archetipes-good character customization-nice party banter-lots of dialogues,books,things to check to flesh out the game world-the stronghold is pretty interesting-good amount of zones to explore and lots of quests-the game system-not the usual DnD fare-is pretty interesting-original setting-you can create your own party members if you don't want to use the story onesNeutral:-lots of micromanagement party-wise,you're expected to pause often in combat to give orders/activate skills-some fights can be difficultCons:-while the story is interesting overall it's very slow to unfold and lacks the sense of grandiose that was found in older games-the game system isn't fully explained,leaving one to guess certain game mechanics,this is even more troubling during character creation-some pathfinding issues-some areas are poorly designed for combat,leading to the party getting stuck in narrow corridors/doorways and being unable to fully engage the enemy-lack of proper party AI leads to the aforementioned micromanagement,which can get tiring in the long run-not all party members are equally interesting,some are a bit boring or have lacking quests-some quests can be a bit dull,or have pooor directions,especially when you're trying to remember where the original quest giver was-stealth is a bit hit or miss (no way to stealth single characters,must stealth to find traps/secrets)Overall this is a good game that sadly suffers a bit when compared to its predecessors,it lacks the engaging story and characters and the depth the DnD system and setting gave to the games of old. I got it for 25$ and am satisfied with the purchase,but considering the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate are available for even less makes it a tough call overall.Still,if you already played those and are looking for more-or just want something more modern-Pillars of Eternity does have enough going for itself to make it a worthwile purchase and an interesting experience to play through, especially considering isometric RPGs are not that common these days (even though we're enjoying a resurgence with other good titles like Shadowrun and Wasteland 2).

												I thought I would enjoy this game like I did Icewided Dale, but I don't. Some of the interface and game mechanics are unituitive leaving a high learning curve. There is so much reading I felt like I was studying for a test. If you think you might like it I would say buy it and play for an hour. If you don't like it then return it. Don't do like I did and keep playing thinking you'll learn to like it, I didn't. Now I'm stuck with an expencive game I'm not going to play.			"

												Was so exited to play this game, but... Pros:- Old school- Pretty graphics- Font size could be expanded (I like to play on TV)- A lot of nice and comfortable tips in char creation windowCons:- A lot of unusefull spells/skills (unless it's the only skill that is left unspend)- Semi realtime (pause\unpause) battles make it really hard to move chars to their desired positions and use skills (instead I prefer solid turn-based system)- Started to play on Normal with single save - first two-three maps convinced me that the opponens are easy peaces and I relaxed a bit, but next map just wiped off the party with no struggle, replay showed that all of next maps are much more severe and requires a big party (expected some ballance here...)- Maybe with some practice you will know how to avoid danger or battle with a small party (1-2 chars) but first run even on normal surely will require you to get a lot of meat in your teamAll my cons are about gameplay and it's really frustrating. Will finish the story but with not much fun.			"

												Im a BIG FAN od Icewind Dale (pretty much grew on it at age of 15), Baldurs Gate 2 etc. This game is a lot harder than those that i grew on in RPG category. And by harder i mean harder, Harder and HARDER. You will be so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by the number of deaths your characters will go through. Dont buy it if you dont like engaging a boss (or even something that looks like easy room) like 20-50 times before you put him finally down.You can do anything with your characters, many classes, different stats etc. Recommending even if im not a fan of such a hard progress. Dont think its worth the prize, I got it from my brother on B-day.			"

												Hands down just a fantastic RPG game. Whether you are exploring the countryside, chatting to your fellow adventurers about the history of the region or more interestingly about their background, to crawling through dark dungeons in search of unspeakable riches, Pillars of Eternity delivers on every level. It's gorgeously designed and conceived, it's got all of the depth in both the story and the worlds lore, the interactions are meaningful and interesting, the battles exciting, tactical and rewarding.For me personally, it's an absolute masterclass in what I would call a traditional RPG game. If you are considering buying this game I can guarantee you that if you like an immersive and exciting adventure you will not be disappointed.Good luck out there.			"

												Great game. save often though as some areas wont load after you go thru a door and go back in. For example the 1st castle you fight inside while on the roof doesnt let you back inside. But game is amazing 7/10. Hopefully they fix it. game is currently unplayable. Will try again tomorrow			"

Posted: April 1, 2015
												I've broken this review about Pillars of Eternity (PoE) into two parts, story and combat. An entire section could be devoted to the mechanics but I will simply say they are great in my opinion.Story: PoE is a book wrapped as a game and the storyline is novel quality that would scare young adult fantasy readers. If you are in it for the story-line alone play PoE on the easiest difficulty with all the help you can get. You create one character and over the course of the story have up to an additional five characters join you. You can even create your own and not bother with the in-game characters. You may want to have as many in-game characters as you can in your party if you want to see the story-line mature fully.Combat: First, I am playing the game on what is called ""hard"" difficulty and with a special setting called ""expert"" mode. PoE's expert mode turns off a lot of helpful information so you must learn what enemies are weak to and much of the information is hidden. Based upon my settings my overall assessment of the combat is brutally difficult, imagine playing chess-master on a grandmaster setting but instead you don't know what all the pieces do but computer does and often has more pieces than you until you get a full party... and even then the enemy will often outnumber you. This is refreshingly positive experience as I am expecting to steamroll the AI as I do in most games. Even with these difficult settings the battles with the AI enemies still feels fair. I feel like I am playing more a game of chess on equal footing than what most games do to make up for bad AIs such as give special bonuses and stats to the AI to make it difficult instead of developing a tactically smart AI. The AI in PoE feels like they are fighting for their life, targeting certain members of my party and using the strengths of their pieces to the best of their ability and even minimizing losses to win the complete battle at times (which is game-over for the player).  The downside of such a difficult AI is a slight draw away from the storyline, in that I've found that I won't bring the in-game characters because they aren’t min-maxed enough for their particular role which means I may be missing out on some dialogue. PoE does have an even higher difficulty but it just increases the stats of the enemies and I'm not interested in that. PoE even has an iron-man mode for the masochist which could make for a fun easy difficulty iron man story.			"

												It is the most overhyped RPG that I've ever played. This game has a very exciting start, but then becomes boring really quickly. And it has some serious problems with directing player. I went in two different directions and every time got stuck, because my party was not powerful enough. It is just frustrating in a game that is not a sandbox. Should I struggle to find this epic story of yours? Hell no.Score: 4/10pros:- graphics- voice acting- interesting beginningcons:- lack of direction - can get stuck in the very beginning multiple times- lots of spells looking alike and uninteresting in general- dull equipment, no interesting loot- not interesting NPCs- booooring!

												The bugs that people are citing as reasons to avoid the game simply are not that bad. Don't double click inventory. If you encounter one of the other bugs, sorry, but the game itself is imminently playable as is. The combat is hard but fun (once you get past the first town's temple which has inexplicably engagement breaking enemies). The art is beautiful. The character creation is extensive and meaningful. The story is rich. The world is rich. The quests are varied. The companions are varied (though they can't compete with nostalgia). The dungeons are deep. It's not perfect but it's one of the best RPGs in years. It's not trying to be an MMO like some modern RPGs. It can be obtained legally without DRM! That in and of itself is amazing. While the Dragon Age series has gotten more and more faceroll with thin plots and a built in dating sim, Pillars has focused on making intense, tactical combat and a rich game world, and they did it very well. Does the might stat make sense? No. Are there a couple bugs? Yeah. Is it fun as heck? Yes. It's an experience I would recommend to anyone, as it doesn't jerk you off while picking your pocket as is the modern trend. It delivers a real game, with real depth, and many hours of play. It's exactly what games should be.			"

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E30 Pillars of Eternity 

			Views: 239		

			Continued... Sorry the review was too big for Steam and YouTube so I had to split it up. You can find the first part of the review on my Steam Page here [http://steamcommunity.com/id/invadersean300/]...		

Pillars of Eternity: Pillars of Eternity, a Kickstarter (77,000!) CRPG developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Paradox Interactive. First a bit of a disclaimer, I have NOT completed the main story of Pillars of Eternity, I am currently in Act 2 and have put almost 30 hours into the game already. Anyways, on with the review! ---->This game takes lovers of RPGs back to some of the roots of some of the most beloved video games ever, titles like Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale and my personal favorites Fallout and Planescape: Torment are all great examples of CRPGs and some of the highest rated games of all time. I could go on, but, just know that Pillars of Eternity is a game that will take you back to those great experiences while delivering its own. Like all CRPGs the game takes an isometric point of view, you see everything from the sky, looking down, giving you the ability to appreciate grand landscapes and structures that are beautifully done in the game.Things like large buildings, bridges, forest, swamps, the ocean, all are beautifully crafted and the isometric point of view has always been perfect for show-casing these types of games, it looks beautiful and you don't need a top-of-the-line gaming computer to appreciate it. The music scores in CRPGs are usually on par with its excellent graphics and Pillars of Eternity is no different. Every soundtrack fits the mood perfectly and really compliments the atmosphere and setting, the only music that will get annoying is when combat starts, it’s the exact same every time and gets a bit annoying, but the rest of the tracks are amazing. ---->Gameplay is pretty straight forward, use the mouse and click on the ground to move your character, the mouse is your primary device, you have plenty of keyboard hot keys to use as well to assist with things like selecting characters, formations and dialogue options. The interface is nice and slick, not too barebones, not too cluttered and laid out in a very nice fashion, and easily customizable as well. Speaking of customization the character builder in this game rocks! You have a total of five races to choose from, many of which have sub races, then you have eleven classes to choose from, each one quite unique and different and most importantly, useful, you will definitely find favorites but, from my experience, every class can easily be useful alone and in a group and that is a welcomed addition to any RPG. You'll also get to choose color pallets for your characters, multiple voices, and very beautifully detailed portraits. You could and easily will drop many hours in the character creator and still find new characters to create, the best part is the game allowing this to be used throughout the game, as you get the ability to create new companions in addition to finding story ones early in the game, it’s a nice feature, allowing you to create one of every class and try out a multitude of playstyles and strategies for combat.---->Combat can be hit or miss, I personally enjoy it, but, I can see it being boring or frustrating to some. First, your characters never do anything on their own, even when getting abused with mace blows or shot at with pistols they will stand there taking it all without ever attempting to retaliate. You HAVE to tell your companions exactly what to do no matter what it is, they will not do anything without an order, and when it’s a party of six, fighting multiple bad guys, that can get a bit slow, this isn't helped by the fact that you'll be pausing combat a lot to tell a character to do something after they've done their previous action. Another annoyance with combat is that characters will often run into each other, and will not attempt to move around each other instead, just running forward till whatever is blocking them is out of the way, this makes unit placement annoying and frustrating, I cannot stress enough how important it is to create custom formations to help alleviate this head ache. I'm harsh on the combat but, overall, I enjoy it a lot, the game lets you be as brute force or strategic as you wish and really rewards you for coming up with clever combos and will definitely challenge you with tough fights that will require every bit of cunning and cleverness you can muster. Magic is a lot of fun, spells are flashy and look amazing and actually feel like they pack a punch, they're exciting to use and I would strongly suggest bringing magic along for any fight. ---->Something else you also get fairly early in the game is the Stronghold, this is a player home that you get to upgrade throughout your adventure, allowing you to add multiple shops, a bounty board, a treasury and more. It’s in a ruined state and will look quite impressive as you get closer and closer to completing all of the upgrades, you'll also be able to hire guards to help defend from interlopers, you'll receive taxes to help fund your adventures, and side missions for your companions to do. It’s an awesome castle they give you early on and access to one of the biggest dungeons in the game, there are some missed opportunities with the Stronghold, one that I will share is you can actually arrest NPCs in the world and put them in your prison...and that’s it. You never get to do anything outside of that and your only option is to release them or they will escape on their own eventually. I'm not sure what the point is and haven't discovered anything you can do with it so it just seems kind of pointless, still the Stronghold is awesome and I devoted almost all of my resources early on to restoring it and exploring the dungeon beneath. ---->So the story, hmm, well I haven't finished it so I can't give you a full debrief on it, however, my impression is that it is not as strong or gripping as it could have been. You find out early in the game that you are what is called a Watcher, someone who can peer into the souls of the living, and see the past lives of that person. Unfortunately this awakened something inside yourself and as told to you by a crazy man, you too will suffer the fate of all of your past lives all living with you at the same time, driving you insane and ultimately to your doom. You set out to find a cure and get swept up into other bigger things going on. The story sounds great, the idea of the Watcher is awesome, it just isn't utilized to its fullest; the world becomes background to your concerns, that is to say that at least from the point I’ve played, the world doesn't seem to care about your success or demise. That is a very fitting setting, but it’s a tough sell to engage the player in, since there isn't a life threatening doom approaching, what was needed was strong personal reasons to motivate the player. Again, this all seems very passive and aside from the occasional staring into space, being a Watcher doesn't seem to really be as bad as the world cracks it up to be. ---->Again this is from my point of view and I admit I have not finished the story, but there are only a few acts and by now I would expect to have a full understanding of all that is going on, if they reveal something later on perhaps my opinion will change, but, it shouldn't take till Act 2 to be invested in any story...[Video Review at: www.youtube.com/RoyialNetwork] (Review was too big for Steam and YouTube, so its been split up link to video above, sorry about that!

Posted: November 9, 2016
												So, Pillars of Eternity.I was very excited about this game after watching the kickstarter video. I was/am a huge fan of many Obsidian games, including the Fallout series (the early ones plus NV), Planescape Torment etc. I pledged a decent amount of money and followed this game's development.I'm not even sure as I write this if I'm going to end up giving it an up-thumb or a down-thumb. Pillars is a classic RPG. There are clunky mechanics, done that way unapologetically. It has tons and tons of content. So many character customization options. Interesting story and characters although I find sometimes the micromanagement can get in the way. The combat can get fairly repetitive, although it can also be interesting in its own way. For if I'd recommend it, it depends on if you're a patient person or not. I've played through mostly as a wizard and the resting mechanics can get beyond annoying since the game restricts how many spells you can cast per rest (the flip side of the coin being the spells are powerful) with the game difficulty restricting how often you can rest. There is no romance in the game, which can be a good or a bad thing depending on your tastes as a player.I guess you could liken it to something like Baldur's Gate, but it's much less based on D&D than BG was. It has its own combat and ruleset. It's done from an isometric perspective and has real time with pause type combat. I am not a fan of that type of combat, I much prefer Wasteland 2's turn based combat, and I think that's a fair comparison giving the similarity of the development teams and the release date of the games.On a personal level, I'd give the game about 7/10. It's exactly what it aimed to be, but what it is isn't always my cup of tea. Having to return to inns or go back to buy more camp supplies really messes with me as I'm someone who likes to start something and then just progress through it, not to chain runs back to town. That was one of the main things that turned me off of Fallout 4, the chain runs back to camp to lug loot and crafting supplies. That being said it's very well written, and most problems have different solutions, some of which are gated by skill checks. Also, the choices you make aren't ""requires most skill is automatically the best one"", you have to read the dialogue and options and sometimes choose the thing with the lower skill check because it's more logical, and the game is crafted in a way that you get the better outcome that way.That being said, there aren't enough of those events in the game. If you were expecting it to be like Planescape: Torment in that it'd be riddled with such interesting events, it isn't. Much of the game is walking into areas and clearing them out using their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat system. The combat system essentially requires continual pausing in order to make characters do logical things, but of course once one character has started his action, all the other characters are acting as well. That might mean you have a character get himself into trouble while you were issuing commands to the prior character. I find the combat in this game almost as much a case of putting out fires as it is meaningful choices and action. I think my final reaction to it is one of mild dissapointment in that it was a game made by a company who has given me some of the best storytelling I've experienced in games (New Vegas, Torment) and it simply hasn't lived up to my expectations so far.

												It's boring. The combat is dull and the story isn't interesting. Maybe it gets better as you progress, but it's very boring to start. At least BG gave you an interesting story from the start. The combat itself actually feels like a step back from BG. The real-time aspects do nothing to make it more interesting and the AI is so bad that you have to micromanage them... sadly, there's not a lot to manage. There's not many abilities to work with, and a lot of them are per-rest rather than per-encounter. So, you either rest frequently or auto-attack your way through battles. Your main character is so pointless in the game that there's little reason to have one. Your character in the story is essentially a faceless/pastless character in a new land. Nobody knows or cares who you were. The characters you meet join you at the drop of a hat, and bring nothing beyond their lackluster skills. It's a far cry from BG and I'm pretty disappointed.			"

												As much as I would like too I cannot recommend this game. I'm a big tabletop RPG player and even I found the combat to be tedious towards the end, micromanaging every action as your party stands around gormless gets old quickly. The story has some original ideas and is very well written, but the companions are almost all very difficult to like and the pacing is incredibly slow.Also, and I'm not quite sure how this is possible giving this game has had a half millions patches, it's still very buggy and prone to crashing. It crashed on the ending for me for example, but by that stage - I was just glad it was over.			"

												After about 20 hours of play time the game now is sooo buggy that it crashes even upon attempting to open it.  Horrible response from Obsidian, well none actually and there appeares to be no fix intended.  BUT my biggest beef is with STEAM for willing and knowingly selling a game that has proven defective in design and code and then knowing the publisher has no fix nor intends (appearently) to ever fix this game STEAM continues to sell it (they refused my refund request despite the overwhelming evidence of this games flaws.  Why then would I buy a game if it has known issues, you ask.  Very simple, the game has no issues is you bought the hard copy it is only the STEAM offered game that has issues and that is been harder to find info on.  I might recommend the game if it was fixed and STEAM may have something to do with fixing it			"

												Pros:- Excellent story and engaging setting- Interesting and story-rich companions.- Customizable characters and interesting zones.Cons:- Combat is unbelievably slow and complicated.- Long sections of dull, repetitive content that are required to get to the good bits.- Arbitrary gating of story choices and resolutions behind other, less interesting content.- The ""Nevermind-factor""Review:All of the pieces are there for PoE to be a smash hit, but for some reason it just doesnt quite come together.The main story is impressive and engrossing. However, I often find myself slowed to a crawl by tedious sidechores - Sidechores that you are almost required to do if you want to be powerfull enough to even survive the next leg of the story.I am not just speaking of sidequests, whose quality varies from pretty good to absolutely atrocious, but also of story-less and repetitive content such as bounty hunts and..URGH..The Endless Depths of Cad Nua. A dungeon crawl that is so long it could be its own standalone game, but it is mind-numbingly repetitive, as are many of the ""dungeon"" segments in PoE. They are long, tedious, punish any attempt to get through them faster with traps and obstructions, and offer no fun at all. This is further hampered by an overly complicated and very punishing combat system that makes even small skirmishes a long slog to get through.In addition, the ""perfect"" resolution to story quests often requires you to do other quests first. Sometimes to insane levels. For example: To resolve a critical battle in the ideal manner, you first need to completely finish the 2 expansion packs before you can proceed. The end result is that I cannot for the life of me motivate myself to keep playing through the game - For every good segment, I feel like I need to grind through mountains of repetitive and dull content if I want to finish the story my way. And I just dont want to do that. It requires so much effort and time to carve through the boring sections that on every attempt I end up throwing my arms into the air and saying: ""You know what, Pillars of Eternity? Nevermind. Just -nevermind-.""PoE is the ""Nevermind factor"" made real.			"

												For whatever reason my long, thoughtful review didn't go through 2 times, so here's the short version: Boring combat (you need a meat shield and you choke point juggle, that's it) Boring RPG aspect (your followers are 1D, the story choices have no consequences, overall just no real Role-Playing) Stronghold is a waste of time and feels completely tacked-on for no reason The sneaking mechanic sucks all the fun out of the game (and double speed ruins immersion, so choose your poison) Information overload and I wanted to read stuff, just the majority is just too damn boring and meaningless Weak classes (Rogue is the most useless class in the whole game) Weak items (you stop caring about items 1 hour in) Boring level ups Lots of odd mechanics (infinite, permantly accessible storage no matter where you are - wtf?, crafting that can be done everywhere, anytime from the menu by clicking a button - wat?)In summary the game just wasn't fun. Then I checked what others complained about and it was pretty much the same, even by people who played 100+ hours. Therefore, I can rest assured the game is not for me and I cannot recommend it. "

												It is hard to rate this game, as I did find the game's first 20 - 30 hours amazing - which is more game time than most standard AAA released today.  However, after playing that long you will start realizing some serious flaws in the game...* All the classes will start to feel the same* You'll start realizing the limitation of the skills system* Main quest starts strong, however, gets weaker later on* Visiting dungeons starts to feel like a hack and slash (every room/hallway filled with red to kill)   -  Hardly any unique loot to find      - This promotes their simplified enchanting/upgrading system (know all recipes, upgrades level capped)* No experience from killing enemies after logged in bestiary* The companions have banter and seem fleshed out, but seem to be missing the flair/annoyances to be remembered* Stronghold could have been better implemented.   -  Also hate that some events could start while traveling and go away before you reach your destination to enable    eventThere is more, but I guess I am being a bit nit picky.  Perhaps future installments of PoE will expand/improve, but as a stand alone game for isometric party based RPG, it is far from reaching the BG series/DAO.  Would definitely wait for the game to be 50% off, especially if you're expecting BG series/DAO.			"

												Tried twice now to get into this game - just can't do it. So damn boring - far too much ""lore"" that the game has failed to give me any reason to care about. Numerous gameplay annoyances such as being arbitrarily pulled out of stealth so enemies can talk to me, stupid overpowered enemies with instant stunlock/2 second kill your best tanks. Almost non-existant loot. Tedious micro-management of combat with all these damn abilities, yet my characters feel ineffective and differences between characters feels marginal at best. Baldur's Gate is still my favourite and i'll probably do another full run for the billionth time after this. The thing is that it's also heavily flawed yet i'm still here in 2016 waiting for something beat it. Very disappointed...When I think about it both BG games were fairly linear but you could go off and adventure, finding and raiding dungeons, bring up wheelbarrows full of loot, get tons of XP, build overpowered character combos (especially with BG:T or the new enhanced edition). The story wasn't really anything to write home about but it kept you moving forward and the fights were challenging but fair for the most part (the original not BG2). The lore was never being rammed down your throat, if you wanted to get more immersed in it then you could do so but it was always your choice to do so. The characters and banter were awesome, I've created numerous parties just to see the different combinations and see fireworks fly between some of them.			"

												It pains me that I have to write this review, but I've put so many hours into this game, hoping that in the next chapter it would get better, that the story would pick up, and the world would come alive, but it never does. The world is dead, it never comes alive. The characters have a lot to say, but they never really talk about anything meaningful. The dialog is well written, but this does not hide the lack of substance. The lore is almost all about rebirth, souls and a war involving a god. There are no cool cultures with interesting histories and weird customs here, it's a generic medieval world with swords and dragons.  If you are going to try and make a game like Baldur's Gate why would you refrain from using the rich world of D&D that Baldur's Gate had? This was a huge part of the game... And why would you not use the infinity engine? Baldur's Gate 2 is seen by many, including myself as the best rpg ever made. If you are going to try and make a game like this, you should be hoping to get close to it. I would have been happy if it was similar to the first Baldur's Gate. (Which it is not) Such a game is considered a master piece precisely because it has very little flaws, how arrogant can you be to think you are going to improve upon it's mechanics? No matter how you tweak the difficulty, the game is either boring and too easy, or it is tedious and hard. Fights often last 15 to 20 minutes which means it will take you hours to clear one map. On the harder settings you get tempted to fight without resting, since you need camping supplies for this. Often this means you are starting a fight you cannot win. So you constantly have to run back to town to get more supplies which involves multiple load screens that take ages to finish loading. I suspect they made this game in 3d and locked the camera in place, which would mean much more stuff to load compared to the 2d sprites of BG. The only thing they did right are the graphics, every area feels unique and has nicely detailed graphics just like BG.EDIT: If you are interested in this game because you want to play something like Baldur's gate, and you enjoyed BG for it's story, characters and rich world then I would not get this game, it has very little of this. If you liked BG for other reasons then maybe you will like this. It is not a terrrible game. I got it because they promised another BG, but they failed to deliver this, hence my disappointment.			"

												6/10 or 7/10 at the most. I know that many people bought the game because they thought that it would be like Baldur's Gate 2, myself included. And yes, the two look very much alike. But that's one of the problems really, because it's not fair to compare this game to the legendary BG2. When I heard about the game, I was thrilled. I bought it as soon as I could. I really tried to get into this game, but I soon lost my interest in it. The storyline wasn't bad, but the side-quests weren't so good in my opinion, so eventually I started skipping them. And the battles I didn't like one bit, so they were only a necessary evil to me that kept me back from continuing the storyline. I also didn't like the long descriptions on what the other characters look like or what they do, because they just made the conversations heavy.What I really liked were the atmospheric cutscenes, but the backer NPCs only harmed the atmosphere in my case. I also appreciate the graphics because I'm not a fan of anime-style graphics with flashy colours and exaggarated huge weapons and armors.All in all I think the story of the game was good and the graphics were okay, but pretty much everything else didn't work. Battles were tiresome, building and equipping the characters felt pointless and side-quests didn't help to create an interesting and alluring world. This game just didn't convince me.			"

												Wow... the depth, the immersion, the absolute perfection of the story telling - this game has it all. It's a wonderful experience, and it had me enthralled from the first to the last. All of the characters were interestering, and it was rough only having to choose certain party members to tag along at any given time. The combat was great, the humor better, and the storyline was well done.The only issue I really had was in the AI pathing of my party members - they were dumb as stumps. I would set em up in acertain way, then they'd do something else at time. The number of times I accidentally fried one of my own teammmates was crazy, not to mention having them try to hit an enemy standing next to them, only to see them run around an entire pack of mobs to get the hit in at a different angle was mind boggling. Still, this was a relatively minor issue. Loved loved loved the game, and as soon as I was done I was looking for an expansion...			"

												Solid game, spent 91 hours in my first playthrough and still didn't find everything. Combats can be extremely tough, Ogre's just flatten groups if you don't take them seriously. The intensity of the last combat is out of control, took me five tries to make a solid strategy to take it down. Old Nua is by far the best dungeon crawl I have had in a long time, it reminds me of Pathfinder's Emerald Spire, just a drag down, soul crushing grind to make it to the last floor, and than you have a boss thats harder than anything else expierence in the game.Three thumbs up, Im working up the courage to give this game another play through at a harder difficulty setting. This is also important. The characters you get to recruit, make sure one of them has a stupidly high mechanics score.			"

												This game is everything I hoped for and more. Ive been a big fan of RPG's in general, but lately it seems that the newer ones are dumbed down so that they will sell to a larger demographic. Games like Mass Effect while a decent game, is more of an action game with RPG elements, you never had the freedom to do what you wanted like you had in Fallout 1 and 2, and the Balders Gate series. This game delievers an old school RPG experience with enhanced graphics and great dialogue. The writing in this game is so good that its almost like reading a book. If you have any interest in RPG's, especially old style Fallout or Baldurs Gate, do yourself a favor and buy this game.  This is my first review I have ever written on a Steam game which should go to show how much I think of it.			"

Lots of well written stories and dialog.  Act 3 is probably the most entertaining from a story perspective.  Act I and II take a little while to get going, but still exciting enough to keep me interested.I did lose interest in the ""kickstarter backer"" stories and stopped reading those after the first 2 or 3.

												First review ever!Loving this game so much, thought I would share a few thoughts.First and foremost.....Fun.50 hours in.  So much choice and diversity.  Regret going basic fighter as my first choice, but can choose new skeletal characters from tavern and make them your own to fill your party.  Or you come along premade characters throughout your journey that will fill out your group.  Just made a paladin and ran into a ranger to fill out my, 2 fighter, 1 wizard, 1 cleric group to 6.  Have a chanter at my home castle to do quests for me.As a D&D fan this game really holds true and makes me feel like I made the character on paper and now am in a Dungeons Masters elaborate adventure. Best game I have played in a while.  Feel like 50 hours in I am just scratching the surface.  Probably have 150 in before I can beat the game. If you are in to more turn based RPG games, I recommend Wastelands 2.  Just beat it before I picked this up.  Loved it.  Graphics are behind the times, but gameplay and story were phenominal.			"

												Pillars is a great game in it's own right. If you loved Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment or Icewind Dale, then you will feel at home. The game is very detailed and Obsidian took great care in making every area interesting to explore. There is much dialogue and while the story not as memorable as Planescape: Torment, it still intrduces us to a new world to look to in the future. The game has replay value and Obsidian continues to patch it up. The combat is fun and you will get obliretaed if you don't plan out your strategy. Character builds are very detailed as well, so take your time with that build. Be forwarned though, the game is very buggy and crashes randomly to the Desktop.

												This is, hands down, one of the best games I´ve ever played.  Because that I grew up with Baulders gate 1 and 2 this is a game well suited for me. A lively atmosphere and rich enviroments with great music to boost it. They said that they aimed to bring back the feel of the old infinty engine games (Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale e.t.c) and they did just that. Not just the isometrical camera and live turnbased combat (pausable, of course). They looked to the smaller things, such as the good old ""You must gather your party before venturing forth"" as well.Apart from that the game is also littered with alot of community written content wich shows that they really cherish the community they have gathered. There is no real downside to this game, it offers great replay value, great challenges and hours upon hours of gameplay.Should I really search for a downside I could find two things1: The UI has a button wich reveals that you will acquire a stronghold at one point, it could have been covered up as not to spoil a great surprise.2: I easily reached the levelcap way before reaching the end of the game, mind you it took alot of sidequesting and it kept me from being way overpowered for the endgame. A slight to much sidecontent in relation to maincontent.That being said, I strongly recommend it. It brought back so many good memories of what I love about roleplaying games.			"

												This is essentially the BG3 game we all have been waiting for since BG2:ToB. The interface, the graphics concept, the narrative, the combat, quests, etc. we all loved in BG (and mostly missed in IWD) are all in PoE. Maybe the pacing wouldn't feel as dynamic as in BG, but it's all a matter of taste. Those who didn't like PoE, probably didn't like the BG series in the first place. So if you do not belong to the latter group, this game is definitely a BUY for you.			"

												I'm not much of a review writer (I think I've written maybe two before this one), but...this game's deserving of a good review, and as I finished my first playthrough earlier today it seemed the ideal time. Unfortunately, I'm not a wordy person, so I'll point out some quick bits and leave the description of the plot out apart from some very simple comparison to its grandparents:Story - 6/5. Seriously, it's so multi-faceted, between the main questline and all of the side quests, it's the type of story we haven't seen since the good old days of cRPGs (aka Pillars' grandparents!). Other, more recent RPGs are definitely steered towards the action side of things, and while the Bethesda games do have a fairly expansive story/lore (well, fond memories are especially coming to mind about Morrowind when I'm thinking of that), there's just something great about a game's story relying a lot on making the player read. Combat - 5/5. I've never been the best at party-based RPGs (though they're very probably my favorite style, go figure), but playing through this game has been a real learning experience. While it's not super dense, it's not too simplistic either, and it allows you to play it however you will. Eventually I got to the point where I could tell which battles required strategy to win decisively and which I could just essentially auto-smash. The variety of combat styles available through the different character classes is great, and the two unique classes added to the eschelon were fun and interesting to learn and play. There was only one battle which I ended up taking an alternative method to solving...needless to say, I tried to persevere and win it out through blood and steel, but all that was happening was my party's blood was being spilled at alarming rates and their steel was being dropped by their limp, lifeless corpses. Non-combat gameplay/exploration - 4.5/5. One of the first things which really impressed me about the game is how a character's stats and skills regularly affect gameplay outside of combat. Whether it be in conversations or scripted events or what have you, I regularly saw options I couldn't go with (a few of which unfortunately made my character act contrary to the sort of personality I'd developed for him throughout the game) and many which I could. My only complaint about this system, and it's a small one since in reality it just gives me more reason to go back and play again as different styles of characters, is that none of your companions' stats or skills can be used in any of these situations. I understand that your PC is, of course, front and center and does most of the talking, but I found myself wishing on occasion that I could have had my companions weigh in a bit more.  Pets - unrated/5. I didn't, in all honesty, see the point of having the pets around. They didn't detract from the experience at all, but they didn't add to it much for me either. They just sort of followed us around, all behaving as placidly as the others while all sorts of crazy situations unfolded around them. Stronghold - 4.5/5. Only complaint about the stronghold is there's no way to combine at least some of the resting bonuses you earn from building the various parts of the stronghold...would have been nice since there were so many lucrative rooms to stay in at the inns in various towns/cities. I enjoyed piecing the place together, and it added a fun little side-mechanic to distract me on occasion. Music - 5/5. When it needed to be atmospheric, it was atmospheric. When it needed to be a bit tense and...battle...ish....it was that. The music was well composed, varied and interesting. Graphics - 5/5. I love this style! Replayability - 5/5. The amount of variation possible between playthroughs is obscene depending on race/background/class/personality/decisions/penchance for violence/completist attitude/etc etc etc.There are still a few bugs/glitches/typos in the game, but I know the guys at Obsidian are working on getting it all ironed out. Final thoughts - I can't wait to get around to playing through this again, though I'm going to take some time off between playthroughs so I don't tire myself out of it (and so I can give some much needed attention to other games I've bought lately). I saw an interview with one of the creators stating that they're already working on putting together a story for a substantial expansion (YES!), akin to those expansions from all the older classics of the genre. This game, man. It's worth your time and money if you're into this sort of thing, and it's got me eagerly awaiting any future developments. A game destined to remain in the glorious halls of classics. TL;DR: 5/5!Final words I forgot the other day: You must gather your party before venturing forth.			"

												Reminds me strongly of the old baldurs gate type games, but simplified and for me, personally, easier to get into! So far I have played for about 15 hours, in story mode because I'm not particularly good, and the conversations are well written with good answers; already people have reacted to the reputation I have built up with answering a certain way. The backstory I made in character creation has made a difference in how people have talked to me. The world feels more alive and as if it's really -reacting- to how my character talks and acts.I highly recommend this game to people new to RPGs and people who have played them before too.			"

The graphics are beutiful and background paintings are gorgeous. Be advised though, it is a very big game; one that will require concenration and commitment.			"

It has a really interesting tabletop RPG feel to it - think Dungeons and Dragons - which compliments game immersion.I'm only 3 hours into this game but so far it stands out more than any other RPG I've played since KOTOR 2 (another amazing Obsidian game) and I can only see it getting better.

The only real con I have so far is bugginess and the game freezing a lot, but that's mostly due to this being launch day.)Another great game, Obsidian!			"

												I had a lot of fun with this game, it brought back the nostalgia of first playing Neverwinter Nights but with decent graphics and fun gameplay, it's in depth enough I can enjoy it but I can ignore a lot of the details if I so choose.  I'm only about a third of the way through the main campaign and keep getting side tracked, thoroughly exploring each map as I come to it and reading any lore I come across.  I like the way the codex fills out as you travel and fight different monsters to reflect your growing knowledge of the places you visit and the creatures you fight.  Haven't played the first expansion and I'm waiting on the second but if the quality remains close to the main game I'm sure they'll be a big hit as well.  Look forward to seeing more expansions/games like this in the future.			"

												Baldur's Gate.Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bahl.These, particularly the last two, forever exist in my experience as high pinnacles of storytelling and gaming. When I first played them in my early teens I had no idea what D&D was. I did not know the 2ed Rules. I cheated extensively just to continue the story and interact with my companions. The Baldur's Gate series set the bar for any and every future RPG, and for the most part, set it too high.At times my nostalgia and heart have been tickled by others... By Mass Effect, by Neverwinter Nights and its expansions, and Dragon Age II (yes... the second one). However, nothing has ever given me half a whiff of what BGII did; to the point that I bought BGII again on GoG just to be able to play it on a modern OS.Until Pillars of Eternity. The engine? Basically the same. The character details rarely mattered; the portraits and interactions always did. PoE isn't like Skyrim or Mass Effect: You won't be spending 2-3 hours designing your protagonist. Instead, you'll choose a look and then actually step into their shoes through choices and dialogues.The settings and backgrounds range from ""Yeah, this really is a dirt road through nowhere"" to ""Bawls, that is a beautiful set-piece!"" More than once I stopped or backtracked to look at a particular sculpture again, or re-loaded just to get another glimpse before a fight. There are some stunning places and things to be at and look at in this game.The characters are strong. By that, I mean they are consistent, different from each other, and overall endearing. I have not tried them all (I, apparently, didn't find all of them through my first complete playthrough!), but the ones I eventually settled on were living, breathing beings with their own pasts, desires, and beliefs. Not every one is an enigma wrapped in a riddle wrapped in a bow -- but not every single one needs to be. The major fights in this game, as I played on Normal, were on the easy side with the exception of the dragons.The story was long. Much longer than I thought -- both to my delight and occasional frustration. There are weaker parts and stronger parts, but the pressure of the main plot only felt light once or twice. The mystery is well played, and I didn't see the ending coming at all; though (reminiscent of other RPGs) the final few acts felt somewhat underwhelming. When I replay it (and it's definitely a ""when"") I'll have a much narrower idea of what I want to do, and I believe I'd even enjoy one more playthrough after that.The game's mechanics are easy to get a jist of, but too ambiguous to really min-max on your first go through. A second playthrough is warranted based on what options you missed by 1 stat or 1 skill alone.Who will like this game? Anybody and everybody who enjoyed the Baldur's Gate series. Anybody who likes RPGs with squad-based micro-management and has the patience to play a game like this through (60 hours was my minimum, though I think you could squeak by your first time with 40-50 hours).It may only be 85% of what Baldur's Gate II: SoA + ToB is to me, but to be likened to my personal pillar of gaming is high praise from me since so many others claimed BG2's heritage and didn't just underdeliver, but fell painfully short. PoE is a good game, and will be a good game whenever I play it again and again.  It's the type of game I may not play for months, or years, but when I do it will fulfill a very specific need: The need to immerse myself in a different world and with fully formed characters to go on an adventure.Heartily recommended.

Pillars of awesomeness!Yes, it's true, the game is hard and frustrating, and also very retro. But I love it, it's huge, and the story and deep combat suck you in, if you don't give up after the first hour. But you really have to like this sort of thing, reading a lot to immerse yourself in the story, you need to learn what's what in order not to get trashed by even a spider. This all takes time, and it's not for everyone. I did not play Baldur's Gate,and I'm not really nostalgic for isometric RPGs. I actually wish you could rotate the camera, because sometimes a column or door will block your view. In my opinion, they could have made a few things less nostalgic (eg why so much backtracking in this time and age, why so much useless loot, and why so many loading screens?), but these are ultimately minutiae and I can definitely look past them, because it's objectively a great game.

												(Not an in-depth review). Being new to the genre, I can say that I have enjoyed the game for the most part thus far. The story and plot development is somewhat interesting. The combat mechanics are pretty fun. I do enjoy the upgrade paths available to classes. It can lead to interesting character builds. Altogether, i'm not too sure about replayability at this point of the game (Act II). After all, It does seem like a niche game. I can't say that most players would enjoy the game, but it is worth a try if you're willing to part with the money.

												It is a pretty good game. It is what you would expect from an old school RPG like Baldurs Gate. However, the graphics could be better (try zoom in and you can see how unclear the visuals look). Some of the dialogue is voiced, but most is not. Maybe they will do more voiced dialogue with updates. I think the game is worth the money, but I feel it could have been better. The gaming experience is not ""WAUW OMG!"", but it is a  pretty good game in the genre. There is a lot of quests with lots of story and dialogue (if you dont like that, then you wont like the quests very much - although you can skip them and let the quests descriptions in the journal guide you instead, if you dont care about the stories anyway. Thus, it is not a huge problem). I would say that game is like 7,5/10 for its genre. There are some combat mechanis from Divinity of Original Sin, which you could have taken into this game. Fx. lightning on pools of water make it electrical and gives lightning damage to those going into it, or being able to freeze a pool of water into ice. The music and sounds in Pillars of Eternity is much better than in Divinity of Original Sin. Also, the characters in Pillars of Eternity are interesting, which makes you want to them a little better. Anyway, all in all it is a highly recomendable game for those who like the genre. You pretty much get what you would expect and there is a lot of hours of gameplay in it, so you get the moneys worth of content.			"

												A New School Game for Old School Gamers!Pillars of Eternity brings back the Infinity Engine style RPG that many of us played and loved. Taking inspiration from Baldur's Gate. Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment, Pillars of Eternity offers up a great experience for anyone who was a fan of those old games and are looking for a new game to play in a similar vain. It definitely lives up to its status as a ""spiritual successor."" While playing, it has the depth and story of Baldur's Gate, a soundtrack and tactical combat of Icewind Dale, and the walls of text and fluff that Torment had.Even if you have not played those styles of games, Pillars is a great game to play still. The positives of Pillars of Eternity include:1.An in depth character creation system including many different races and unique classes (and backgrounds!) that only fuel the RPG experience2. A unique system that still has a pen and paper feel to it3. A game that facilitates role playing a character and developing them.4. Both recruitable NPCs and the ability to make your own recruitable party members.5. An engaging story set in a unique and interesting worldOne of Pillars downsides is it lacks the multiplayer mode that Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale had, but hopefully an update or DLC will add it. If not, I sure hope a sequel does. Now you may not view this as a downside, so that may not be a concern to you. Also wish the Stronghold function had a little more depth to it.All in all, Pillars of Eternity is a great game that harkons back to the old days of some of the best RPGs and can now consider itself amongst their ranks.

												My recommendation does not extend to the DLC which I do not own and probably will not. The Basic game is enough bang for the buck if you get this on sale. I found it to be very similar in style to its predecessors by Bioware, Baldur's Gate etc. But the character generation is not 100% D&D as you know it. It is very nicely done and makes you feel as if you are immersing in the creation as opposed to just checking off tick boxes here and there. The story line is also immersive and interesting if the plots tend to thread a bit longer than I like and involve some fed ex type quests that leave one wishing travel were a little faster. (Even with the fast mode it takes time.) Similar in that sense to NWN. The stronghold is a better done version of the same idea as the one in NWN 2. Though it is rather matter of fact once you get it. It seems a bit like there is a common sense way to level it up and then the foolishness of choosing a different order.  But in the end the update lengths aren't too tediously long and you should have it complete well before Act III. Especially if you do the tasks as well as the side quests. I have not finished the game yet, but I felt it has earned a thumbs up review where many games at this many hours in might start to be disappointing or discouraging completion. This one does not. I don't feel I misspent my $ on this at all.I should note that because of the depth of the character generation system and the reputation system in game you might find the replayability higher than normal rpgs. Overall 9 out of 10 in ALL areas. Especially enjoyed hearing Matt Mercer's voice as Aloth and others.			"

												If you enjoyed the infinity engine games you will love this. I can give little more praise then that. There are a few flaws, but I am really happy so far. It is a very long game though. I recomend it for summer play. Also, the lower system requirements are nice because I can run it nearly perfectly on my laptop.			"

												EXCELLENT Game by my standards. It runs very much like old school Baldur's Gate / Icewind Dale, but with a different system. The way your character is built and develops are great! There's a large amount of varaiety and customization for both you and all your companions (which you can use pre-created personalities or make new characters like your own!).I usually loathe the side-characters but I found myself actually liking the ones in this!I would HIGHLY recommend this game to any RPG fans.

												A true spiritual successor to classic Infinity Engine crpgs. The game has good story, good reputation system, interesting characters and nice feeling overall. It can also be challenging at times, probably more so on higher difficulty levels. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates really good crpgs.On the other hand, I think 8 companions are too few (although you can add to the party custom made characters) and the game also has the most cheap optional boss in the game. No kidding.			"

												Pillars of Eternity is well rounded, solid RPG reminiscent of Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights.  It has a really interesting tabletop RPG feel to it - think Dungeons and Dragons - which compliments game immersion.I'm only 3 hours into this game but so far it stands out more than any other RPG I've played since KOTOR 2 (another amazing Obsidian game) and I can only see it getting better.  Honestly, if you're a fan of PC RPGs, especially Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights or KOTOR give this game a go.			"

												An O.K. game. My complaints:1. Spells are very damage oriented. You don't have very many interesting utility spells or out of combat spells like in Baldur's Gate or even Neverwinter Nights.2. It feels like Keep management is half-finished. You build a bunch of stuff and post guards to protect it, but all of that investment doesn't really pay off. Feels like a strange mini-game.3. Not sure about Might influencing spell damage. Lets you play a literal muscle wizard wielding a two handed sword and wearing full plate. For some people this will be a plus - for me, it's not.4. I encountered no less than 3 game-breaking, play through ending, bugs upon launch. Thank goodness for multiple save files.5. This is nit-picking, but I hate the way that all the characters run in sync. For some reason it distracts me.On with the good.1. Some characters are fairly well written, particularly Grieving Mother and Durance.2. The story is, although somewhat predictable, fairly good.3. Scratches the cRPG itch.4. Nice soundtrack. 5. Nice art style that nods back to the golden era of cRPGs.All in all, a good, but not great, game. Noticed that there are 4 more spell levels that aren't even touched in the game, which implies there will be expansions. Might be better after DLC / expansions. Would not recommend at the price point of $45 USD - get it on sale or through a third-party site.			"

Combat was fun and loved the resting system - it gave more of a challenge and more lovely micromanagement. I loved how your choices actually felt like they affected the world around you.I wish the game had more memorable characters tho!

												Baldur's Gate.Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bahl.These, particularly the last two, forever exist in my experience as high pinnacles of storytelling and gaming. When I first played them in my early teens I had no idea what D&D was. I did not know the 2ed Rules. I cheated extensively just to continue the story and interact with my companions. The Baldur's Gate series set the bar for any and every future RPG, and for the most part, set it too high.At times my nostalgia and heart have been tickled by others... By Mass Effect, by Neverwinter Nights and its expansions, and Dragon Age II (yes... the second one). However, nothing has ever given me half a whiff of what BGII did; to the point that I bought BGII again on GoG just to be able to play it on a modern OS.Until Pillars of Eternity. The engine? Basically the same. The character details rarely mattered; the portraits and interactions always did. PoE isn't like Skyrim or Mass Effect: You won't be spending 2-3 hours designing your protagonist. Instead, you'll choose a look and then actually step into their shoes through choices and dialogues.The settings and backgrounds range from ""Yeah, this really is a dirt road through nowhere"" to ""Bawls, that is a beautiful set-piece!"" More than once I stopped or backtracked to look at a particular sculpture again, or re-loaded just to get another glimpse before a fight. There are some stunning places and things to be at and look at in this game.The characters are strong. By that, I mean they are consistent, different from each other, and overall endearing. I have not tried them all (I, apparently, didn't find all of them through my first complete playthrough!), but the ones I eventually settled on were living, breathing beings with their own pasts, desires, and beliefs. Not every one is an enigma wrapped in a riddle wrapped in a bow -- but not every single one needs to be. The major fights in this game, as I played on Normal, were on the easy side with the exception of the dragons.The story was long. Much longer than I thought -- both to my delight and occasional frustration. There are weaker parts and stronger parts, but the pressure of the main plot only felt light once or twice. The mystery is well played, and I didn't see the ending coming at all; though (reminiscent of other RPGs) the final few acts felt somewhat underwhelming. When I replay it (and it's definitely a ""when"") I'll have a much narrower idea of what I want to do, and I believe I'd even enjoy one more playthrough after that.The game's mechanics are easy to get a jist of, but too ambiguous to really min-max on your first go through. A second playthrough is warranted based on what options you missed by 1 stat or 1 skill alone.Who will like this game? Anybody and everybody who enjoyed the Baldur's Gate series. Anybody who likes RPGs with squad-based micro-management and has the patience to play a game like this through (60 hours was my minimum, though I think you could squeak by your first time with 40-50 hours).It may only be 85% of what Baldur's Gate II: SoA + ToB is to me, but to be likened to my personal pillar of gaming is high praise from me since so many others claimed BG2's heritage and didn't just underdeliver, but fell painfully short. PoE is a good game, and will be a good game whenever I play it again and again.  It's the type of game I may not play for months, or years, but when I do it will fulfill a very specific need: The need to immerse myself in a different world and with fully formed characters to go on an adventure.Heartily recommended.

												As an avid fan of the old Infinity Engine games, and after all the rave reviews, I was very excited to be able to finally play this game, and for the first couple of hours I was impressed at the scope, the overall quality, and the succesfull way in which an old gaming formule was brought into the 21st century. A couple more hours in, I am still impressed by the scope of Pillars of Eternity...but somehow I can't help but feel slightly let down.That's not to say that there isn't an awful lot they DID do right. The combat, e.g., has been given a successful overhaul. It's still  fun and deep, but plays out a lot faster and seems far less dependent on fairly random crowd control effects from the old games. I also like the little touches like the per-battle (rather than per-day) abilities, the fast movement mode, and innovative classes like the Chanter.Also, in general the story and dialogue are interesting, although I do agree with some reviews that the entire affair does tend to get a bit long-winded and a bit too serious at times. That being said..I feel the whole thing is a bit uninspired. The quests, the level design,  and even the loot (basically you get very little good stuff, you have to enchant it) certainly get the job done, but it never strays far from the established formula and all feels a bit...bland. Compared to the freshness of e.g. Divinity: Original Sin, which did manage to bring something truly new to the table in spite of being decidedly old school as well, PoE is a letdown. It also falls quite a bit short of the game it's so obviously paying hommage to, Baldur's Gate 2..that game constantly managed to surprise you with great level designs and quests..here I've waded through 7 levels of Endless Path dungeon without anything that stood out. Maybe this comes across as overly harsh, since it is a good game and I am enjoying it, but it does feel like quantity over quality..they basically throw everything but the kitchen sink at you and hope it will stick. Most of it does, and there are some really good idea on display here, but a lot also feels like padding (far too many samey accounters, a flimsy stronghold...ironically, exactly the things that Dragon Age origins also did wrong) "

												First review ever!Loving this game so much, thought I would share a few thoughts.First and foremost.....Fun.50 hours in.  So much choice and diversity.  Regret going basic fighter as my first choice, but can choose new skeletal characters from tavern and make them your own to fill your party.  Or you come along premade characters throughout your journey that will fill out your group.  Just made a paladin and ran into a ranger to fill out my, 2 fighter, 1 wizard, 1 cleric group to 6.  Have a chanter at my home castle to do quests for me.As a D&D fan this game really holds true and makes me feel like I made the character on paper and now am in a Dungeons Masters elaborate adventure. Best game I have played in a while.  Feel like 50 hours in I am just scratching the surface.  Probably have 150 in before I can beat the game. If you are in to more turn based RPG games, I recommend Wastelands 2.  Just beat it before I picked this up.  Loved it.  Graphics are behind the times, but gameplay and story were phenominal.			"

												Pillars is a great game in it's own right. If you loved Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment or Icewind Dale, then you will feel at home. The game is very detailed and Obsidian took great care in making every area interesting to explore. There is much dialogue and while the story not as memorable as Planescape: Torment, it still intrduces us to a new world to look to in the future. The game has replay value and Obsidian continues to patch it up. The combat is fun and you will get obliretaed if you don't plan out your strategy. Character builds are very detailed as well, so take your time with that build. Be forwarned though, the game is very buggy and crashes randomly to the Desktop. F5 frequently so that you don't loose progress. I am almost 70 hrs into the game and I am still on Act 2 since I take my time with the game. I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves this genre. It's definitely helped me with my vocabulary.			"

												This is, hands down, one of the best games I´ve ever played.  Because that I grew up with Baulders gate 1 and 2 this is a game well suited for me. A lively atmosphere and rich enviroments with great music to boost it. They said that they aimed to bring back the feel of the old infinty engine games (Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale e.t.c) and they did just that. Not just the isometrical camera and live turnbased combat (pausable, of course). They looked to the smaller things, such as the good old ""You must gather your party before venturing forth"" as well.Apart from that the game is also littered with alot of community written content wich shows that they really cherish the community they have gathered. There is no real downside to this game, it offers great replay value, great challenges and hours upon hours of gameplay.Should I really search for a downside I could find two things1: The UI has a button wich reveals that you will acquire a stronghold at one point, it could have been covered up as not to spoil a great surprise.2: I easily reached the levelcap way before reaching the end of the game, mind you it took alot of sidequesting and it kept me from being way overpowered for the endgame. A slight to much sidecontent in relation to maincontent.That being said, I strongly recommend it. It brought back so many good memories of what I love about roleplaying games.			"

Maybe the pacing wouldn't feel as dynamic as in BG, but it's all a matter of taste. Those who didn't like PoE, probably didn't like the BG series in the first place.

												This game is made for people who are fans of old Bioware and Infinity Engine games. If you are one of those people, then I'm guessing you already own this game and know how good it is. If you aren't one of those people, then this is the perfect place to try a classic type of RPG which has sadly gone out of style recently.			"

												IF you like old school hardcore overhead rpgs with great story and party management/strategythis is a good game that will bring back those memories or allow one to relive those times.Expect to spend a lot of time on this game, even for just the smallest of things, map loading is a problem and takes a bit long to load though each one is loaded with many objectives to help alievate this problem. Just like many old games prepare to reload old saves or save regulary asthings can and will go bad quickly which is part of the fun.Definitely worth the large amount of time and money one will put into this.

												It's not as good as Baldur's Gate 2 was, but it's still an excellent Infinity-Engine-like game, likely to take 200 to 300 hours away from your lifetime if you include expansions. There are many pro and cons for this game, many things that deserve improvements, many aspects which were way better in BG2. But hey, it's still way better than Baldur 1, way less dull than Icewind dale, and it supersedes any game of the genre since BG2.The genre was abandonned for almost 15 years: this game makes it alive again, with a very modern and convincing engine, even though it still needs improvements (combat views are hard to read). Music is fantastic, graphics are outstanding, the story is great: it's just good to play, and there is no challenger.			"

												A very very solid RPG game very much in the style of Baldurs Gate.Basically if you liked Baldurs Gate buy it, if you didn't then don't!It really is that simple.One thing I will say though is definitely read up on stats etc... beforehand they are rather different that traditional games and quite confusing until you get your head around it.The other thing is your none used companions still gain XP even when  not in your party so you can build up a collection and chop and change a bit for different quests etc...

												As an avid fan of the Baldur's Gate series and most sorts of RPG's in general, Pillars of Destiny has quickly risen to be one of my all time favourites in just a small amount of time. The game is incredibly detailed story-wise to in game lore, the combat system is true to the old school Baldur's Gate-style ""pause-plan-act"", character depth and customization is without end, and the world scenery is damn near fantasy perfect.I love this game... And I plan to spend many, many hours more to come in the enchanted world of ""Eora"". This is a must-have of 2015 for all true RPG-fans.			"

												Delivers exactly what it promised, a modern take on the classic Infinity Engine RPGs.  Looks great, plays great, with a great worldbuilding story that hopefully sets the stage for more games to come.  Just eats up the hours like the old Baldur's Gate games did, and goes out of its way to make sure you can play it any way you want to.  Plenty of variety in the options available to you in terms of characters, histories, abilities/talents, weapons, spells etc - there is lots of replay value in this game.			"

												I am totally swept of my feet. I have been waiting for such a game since P:T in 1999. Many games went out during that 16 years, but none were so perfect as Pillars are. It has everything a perfect RPG might need. Deep, interesting world, great visuals, awesome music, truly living npcs with their own backgrounds. I am really amazed by the hit system. No more binary hit/miss with flat 5% crit chance. The mechanics built for attack rolls and miss/graze/hit/crit is really awesome. And the best thing is, it works the same on every aspect. Exactly the same formulas work for swinging a sword and casting a spell. I am playing a paladin and I am really happy that for the first time paladins aren't just uber-good warriors in shining armors. You can select from multiple ways of life, you can be a cruel/aggresive paladin, honest/diplomatic, rational/stoic and more. There is no trivial good-evil axis. There are many dispositions, many possibilities of action.It is like taking all that is best in Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment and improving it 300% so that it matches the expectations of today's gamers.I am harsh when it comes to rating games, but Pillars of Eternity is peremptorily 10/10.

												This is my first time to dig deep into this type of RPGs. And i really like it. After around 20-25hours of gameplay I decided to start allover again with different class because I didn't think my main character fits in the story by his origin or class. And yes, you should do the same if you feel this way since the game is decently long. I'd rather play thru whole game lovin it than just rush thru it and then start a new char to play properly.+Deep character creation without limitations like ""warriors use 2h swords and rogues only daggers"" **+Story so far+Combat-** But this might lead you to the point where you start allover like me realizing your char is weird with weird stats so study each stat if not familiar yet-Graphical style is beautiful but there could be more interactive things/modern touch like Divinity Original Sin had.I'm not a reaviewer so thats all I say.

												This game is a good game, a very good game ! It captured the essence of what made infinity engine games so enjoyable to play and I see myself as a youngling in front of his computer once again.That being said, this game is, actually, overrated. In fact nearly everything is better executed in BG2. The AI  (ennemies or friends) was better, the UI was better, the story too (event though I'm not nearly finished with it, I played for some times, 10-12 hours, and it is slow to take off...), spell variety is lacking....And if you think it's nostalgia, I played my last BG game one year ago. In Pillars, when you are behind a tree or a house you see nothing (no option of semi-transparency), you cannot force the orientation of a non-walking character, you don't see what you gain from quest (""Well, thank you. Here seome gold as rewards !"" - wanna know how many ? Well open the inventory before talking to the PNJ, loot at your amount of gold, talk to the PNJ, substract...). The pathfinding is shamefull, especially in combat ; the other NPC lacks depth (""Hmmm I'm bored.... I guess I will come with you. I just like defying death for no reason"") ; secondary quests are somewhat superficial...And some things in need of a serious upgrade were not done (formation is well and good but if they do not move like it it's useless).I repeat : it's a very good game for RPG lovers such as myself. But the realization is not on par with a 15 years old game.... So even if it's a good game it does not gain his place as one of the best RPG of all times : too close to Infinity Engine games to not be compared, with too much downscale from this games (even though there's some enhancement like character animation).

												Before i say anything, i just want to point out that this game kicks butt of ALL bigger title RPG's that have been made recently. I cant believe that Obsidian was almost on the verge of shutting its doors, and then they came up with something like Pillars of eternity. In my opinion, the brightest star of RPG industry currently and the best possible tribute anyone could have done for Baldurs gate's, Icewind Dale's etc. PC D&D rpg games.If baldurs gate's 1/2, icewind dale's 1/2 were you thing back in the days, i can tell you Pillars of eternity just brought the genre back! Beautiful hand made graphics, orchestral music, top notch plot etc. brings me back to the days when games had just the right amount of difficulty and the player wasn't lead from the hand in every turn.And dont worry, the game isnt stuck to the early years of rpg's. The UI is very well made to the modern standards, as is many other things such as possibility of ""hiring"" a companion wich is basically creating a filler character in your group by yourself. The hiring system is a genius idea honestly, as you want to have a full group as soon as possible early on in the game. Later on you can also of course find groupable NPC's that have a personality, opinions and own agenda wich you can choose to proceed if you will. So now you get to make a group with every other npc character in game, as you can simply fill the empty spots with the hiring system. Smart.As you play the game a bit further, you get your own stronghold where you can build stuff, switch your companions, get buffs after sleeping there etc. Its a great idea, because you start to get overflowing with money at some point eventually. You need to hire guards wich take weekly payment etc. Also you can send your overflow hirelings to do your bidding in case you get a writ. Usually a smart move too.One thing i really loved, was how the inventory was made. Can't tell you how many times i almost lost my nerve (except in bg2 with bag of holding :) when i had inventory full of stuff and no idea where to put all that junk.And now... the part that i really REALLY love in this game:You can carry as much stuff as you ever will want. You have an option to drop stuff to stash whenever you want, and your inventory will never be stuffed of hundreds of ""junk"" -items, wich btw are worth collecting and selling to vendors as you get back to town.Also i've found out that all the items you find (mushrooms, jewels etc.) are in fact useful and worth keeping instead of selling. All books, papers etc. include tips if you read them carefully and use your imagination. If you find jewels and herbs etc. you can use them for enchanting/crafting. I even found vendors selling crowbars, climbing hooks with rope, torches etc. All these items that i found useful eventually. Every now and then you gotta pry some bars aside, climb a wall, or possibly torch something up possibly.AND yes! You can craft anywhere! You can select the item you want to ""enchant"" and just do it on the spot without finding a forge and flapping thru useless junk in your inventory for hours. This makes the game much more straightforward (in a good sense) and you dont get stuck at inventory for ages.Also no grinding is involved for crafting. Theres no skill's or such required from what i've seen, no farming etc. You simply check what enchants, foods, potions you want/can make and just hit craft. Sometimes you can learn a recipe or such, but overall ive found crafting ever so deliciously simple. Obsidian clearly has realized that spending time in inventory instead of playing has been a fun killer for ages. Theres a lesson to be learned from this for all the big budget RPG -maker's.What i've played this game so far, only problem i find that im scared as heck to play it because time goes like ZAP!I've allready washed my laundry twice and forgotten it to the washing machine. 3rd time is about to happen, because i'm just too stuck on this game... ;D			"

												Am really enjoying this game so fare and looking forward to continue playing it. I Have only encountered one bug so fare which was bad enough to make me cuss which was a character became stuck in place unable to move during a boss fight which meant I had to restart from a previous save (cussed because had won a difficult fight but then had to do-over).Other slightly odd things are creatures such as slime's or shades or the like being able to be tripped over?? or animal companions/ summons being able to start dialogue (can set up party then move up animal to start a dialogue which leads to combat meaning you are not caught out of formation), supper sneak (get a good look at whats ahead with animals who seem to be able to get closer to mobs than party members without being detected), animals can climb like people (if you go up a ladder or climb a vine pets should have to wait/ especially an animal which couldn't be carried by the party .i.e. bear). But these are just miner little quirks I thought and I don't mind so much, except the tripping things which shouldn't be tripable. As I mentioned at the start I am loving this game and looking forward to continue to play, and I am sure as time progresses and the game is patched and updated it will evolve. I do very much like how combat is calculated and the HP and resting system which makes for a more tactical play style. I also like that I am not picking up +10 item of kill everything every other battle, and that monsters more often than not are dropping the items which they are using .i.e. they are not using a basic weapon in combat but then drop some amazing magical item (which just wouldn't make any sense).Thanks for the great game and the hours of enjoyment I have had and have left to enjoy, looking forward to any additional content/ updates.

												This is my first review ever, i will start by saying that this a great game, well worth the full retail price, Obsidian has done great work considering the budget that they had to develop this game on. The game may have a few bugs but i did not run into any on my time playing it and if there are any they would not detract from the fun romp this game is.Pros-Great Story-Great Companions-Choices that actually matter-You actions shape other characters opinons of you- People will reflect to you differently depending on your disposition- one character may try to kill you while that same character could listen to reason depending on your disposition.-Challenging Gameplay- ability to structure game for either old school gaming or for those who enjoy the story based aspects more.-Replayability- Different dialogue choices for different classes and races provides a reason to replay-Great art style- the storyboards look very good, the hand drawn maps look well crafted and have a certian appeal to them-15 level dungeonCons-Story takes a while to pick up you do not know a lot about what is going until the middle of the 2nd act -AI- the game needs the ability to better micromange your characters- the fact that you can not assign standard behaviours to your characters (e.g. heal yourself if under certian edurance/ health) forces to pause and play after each move, this can get frustrating particularly in the large fights with lots of mircomanagement where one wrong move can kill your party (Characters not moving if you have not selected them- they should at least have a default attack)-Stronghold Management- feels a bit lacking while the bounty quests are good, the stronghold just seems to be a a way to spend the large amount of money you will not need to spend, finished the game with no cash than i needed- A few pathfinding issues "

												I haven't yet finished this game, being the type of person who likes to complete every possible side quest and explore every area in RPG's, but I feel like I have seen enough of the game to write this review. Pillars of Eternity is a game moulded very much in the fashion of some of my favourite games of all time; Baldur's Gate (I & II) and Icewind Dale, and it definately justifies it's position sitting side by side with these greats.Being a top down RPG it doesn't have the flashiest or most breathtaking visuals, nor the fast paced combat of many of today's modern games, but it doesn't suffer for it in the slightest. A fascinating, dark and gritty high fantasty world, bursting with interesting and entertaining characters in which you search for answers to a mysterious event from the start of the game set the stage for the telling of a very well devised story. Like most games of this genre, it features a reasonably well detailed character creation system which allows you to feel that important attachment and immersion during the story, and the voice acting/script writing work is very well done. Expect to be amused, baffled and enthralled in equal measure by the numerous NPC's with which you can party up and travel with (all with their own backstories, most of which I found pretty neat).Combat-wise the game is solid, being pretty much standard fare for this type of game, but it felt nice and smooth and there is a good variety and diversity of skills amongst the classes. Loot is also varied and interesting enough to keep you constantly on the hunt for that next upgrade or nice drop. One thing I found very pleasing about the game was the abiluty to acquire and upgrade your own ""Keep"", which was obtained through a very interesting quest and worked solidly with the main story line of the game, intermingling seamlessly as I quested back and froth between them.Overall this is a game which borrows, and to a small extent, builds on the solid foundations of prior games in this genre and couples it with a beautiful and detailed world and engaging story. There is nothing particularly groundbreaking added in this game (or at least, what I have experienced of it this far), but there a few new features here and there which fit in very well with the overall experience, without parting too much from the old school feel the game conveys. Highly reccomended, especially if you already a fan of similar games.			"

												This game is awesome! It feels like an old school RPG and the character customization is nice. I feel like this is more toward the old DnD rule set as a mage you can only cast a certain amount of spells per rest. The story is immersive and interesting, looking forward to seeing what else happens! The combat is face-paced but the good thing is you can pause it by hitting the space bar and slow it down by pressing S which slows that combat by half I believe. The only issue I have with combat is the camera. At times you are behind objects and cannot see your characters very well. It is just a minor annyoance. I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys a good rpg that has a feel of older games, like Baulders Gate etc...			"

												A fantastic (in the true sense of the word) adventure with a capturing story, great delivery and atmopshere, alright character-development and DnD-esque combat and conversation. This is for anyone in love with the DnD-esque genre. I would say that if you expect something like Torchlight/Diablo just because its isometric, you're in the wrong genre. Combat is slow, tactical and at times a challenge or a chore. The main bright spots of this game are the story and the lore and the atmosphere. It really does feel like an adventure or a quest.Here's the deal though: it is not worth 40 euros. Buy it in a heartbeat if its 50% off or more, but any price large than 20 euros is honestly pushing it. Its a really great game, but the genre generally belongs to the past for a good reason, and lore can only carry a game so far.8/10 , great game, awful price.			"

												I'm not much of a review writer (I think I've written maybe two before this one), but...this game's deserving of a good review, and as I finished my first playthrough earlier today it seemed the ideal time. Unfortunately, I'm not a wordy person, so I'll point out some quick bits and leave the description of the plot out apart from some very simple comparison to its grandparents:Story - 6/5. Seriously, it's so multi-faceted, between the main questline and all of the side quests, it's the type of story we haven't seen since the good old days of cRPGs (aka Pillars' grandparents!). Other, more recent RPGs are definitely steered towards the action side of things, and while the Bethesda games do have a fairly expansive story/lore (well, fond memories are especially coming to mind about Morrowind when I'm thinking of that), there's just something great about a game's story relying a lot on making the player read. Combat - 5/5. I've never been the best at party-based RPGs (though they're very probably my favorite style, go figure), but playing through this game has been a real learning experience. While it's not super dense, it's not too simplistic either, and it allows you to play it however you will. Eventually I got to the point where I could tell which battles required strategy to win decisively and which I could just essentially auto-smash. The variety of combat styles available through the different character classes is great, and the two unique classes added to the eschelon were fun and interesting to learn and play. There was only one battle which I ended up taking an alternative method to solving...needless to say, I tried to persevere and win it out through blood and steel, but all that was happening was my party's blood was being spilled at alarming rates and their steel was being dropped by their limp, lifeless corpses. Non-combat gameplay/exploration - 4.5/5. One of the first things which really impressed me about the game is how a character's stats and skills regularly affect gameplay outside of combat. Whether it be in conversations or scripted events or what have you, I regularly saw options I couldn't go with (a few of which unfortunately made my character act contrary to the sort of personality I'd developed for him throughout the game) and many which I could. My only complaint about this system, and it's a small one since in reality it just gives me more reason to go back and play again as different styles of characters, is that none of your companions' stats or skills can be used in any of these situations. I understand that your PC is, of course, front and center and does most of the talking, but I found myself wishing on occasion that I could have had my companions weigh in a bit more.  Pets - unrated/5. I didn't, in all honesty, see the point of having the pets around. They didn't detract from the experience at all, but they didn't add to it much for me either. They just sort of followed us around, all behaving as placidly as the others while all sorts of crazy situations unfolded around them. Stronghold - 4.5/5. Only complaint about the stronghold is there's no way to combine at least some of the resting bonuses you earn from building the various parts of the stronghold...would have been nice since there were so many lucrative rooms to stay in at the inns in various towns/cities. I enjoyed piecing the place together, and it added a fun little side-mechanic to distract me on occasion. Music - 5/5. When it needed to be atmospheric, it was atmospheric. When it needed to be a bit tense and...battle...ish....it was that. The music was well composed, varied and interesting. Graphics - 5/5. I love this style! Replayability - 5/5. The amount of variation possible between playthroughs is obscene depending on race/background/class/personality/decisions/penchance for violence/completist attitude/etc etc etc.There are still a few bugs/glitches/typos in the game, but I know the guys at Obsidian are working on getting it all ironed out. Final thoughts - I can't wait to get around to playing through this again, though I'm going to take some time off between playthroughs so I don't tire myself out of it (and so I can give some much needed attention to other games I've bought lately). I saw an interview with one of the creators stating that they're already working on putting together a story for a substantial expansion (YES!), akin to those expansions from all the older classics of the genre. This game, man. It's worth your time and money if you're into this sort of thing, and it's got me eagerly awaiting any future developments. A game destined to remain in the glorious halls of classics. TL;DR: 5/5!Final words I forgot the other day: You must gather your party before venturing forth.			"

												First of all I want to say I am really happy that these kinds of games are still being developed.Pillars of Eternity is a classic isometric crpg to the likes of baldur's gate and planescape torment. It is the spiritual, modern succesor of these games. And it delivers! Pros : - Vast world with lots of things to discover       - Great lore and original story       - PST style of writing        - Gorgeous graphics, runs and looks wonderful in 4K       - Superb Music and sound design       - ~50-60 hrs long       - Very cool system of character classes and buildsCons : - Combat system tho new, does not impress and is rather cumbersome       - A bit clunky at times in a sense that it overcomplicates the mechanics of the game just for the   sake of it       - The difficulty is HARD, even on easy (which for some may be a good thing)       - Steep learning curveOverall score : a solid 9/10 Starting a new playthrough soon!

												Finished the main quest and side quests with 89 hours in (Give or take 5-10 hours where I left it running for lunch).  Had a hard time putting it down, reminded me a lot of the old Never Winter Nights games and Baldur's Gate.  It feels very much like a D&D game, despite not being officially a D&D game (Very similar spells, classes, etc).  Love Obsidian's attention to detail when it comes to plot, NPCs, imagery (Describing characters and places), quests, and dialogue.  So many quest and dialogue options!  I'm itching to start a new character and play through it differently, but I'm going to check out the DLC first.  Highly recommend this if you enjoyed Never Winter Nights, Baldur's Gate, or any other D&D based games with party based combat and quest/dialogue options.			"

												As an avid fan of Baldur's Gat I & II as well as Planescape Torment, it was an easy decision to back Pillars of Eternity on Kickstarter. When the final product came out with glowing reviews, my anticipation was high. Luckily I can say POE lives up to the promises of the Kickstarter; albeit with its own caveats.What's amazing about POE is that it's easily the most accessible for newcomers and veterans alike. You can simply toggle on or off tutorial menus and the like whenever you want. There are new additions to the gameplay and interface that made me admire the attention to detail. Don't be scared off if you've never played this type of game.On the whole Pillars of Eternity feels like it needs just a bit more creative time in the oven. The core story is a bit lackluster. I never cared for the world or truly understood what the threat was. The writing quality and quantity is still very high, but the stakes never seem worth it. It's like I was back home but all the people and furnishing were different. And when compared to other games in their library, this appears even paler in comparison. The characters also aren't as interesting or memorable for the exception of a couple. There's still a TON of story in this game. You can always find a new tome or book on a shelf ready to be read. Yet I always sold these books at markets instead of reading them. I just kinda wanted the main adventure to be over with.Side quests are plentiful although a tad redundant. Most missions are kill or retrieve. The consequences of your actions doesn't feel as dramatic as Baldur's Gate II. Plus your options in the dialog tree, while there, don't feel like they're as deep.Dungeoning is still fun. The action is as intense as before. Spell casting doesn't seem to be as fun. It didn't quite feel like I was on a huge adventure for some reason. Like the confines of the maps were smaller than before. This game is definitely challenging especially if you're not ready for it. It's good to see that the pause mechanic and planning out your attacks is still in good form. I love playing as the ranger class but I was sad to see that there are no arrow/projectile types that you can manage and buy. If you have a bow, crossbow, or sling you have an infinite amount of ammo as your disposal. I guess they came to the conclusion that this got in the way of the fun factor.What I loved about the original Baldur's Gate games was the sense of an inhabited world. Random events, character interactions, and grand adventures seemed to spring out of nowhere at any time. All distinct and unique from each other. Pillars of Eternity feels like it's cut short in most categories; although, it's still quite up there in terms of quality.For the year this came out in, it's easily one of the best games of the year. In terms of the Baldur's Gate and Planescape Torment games, it's in the back of the pack but a welcome addition. A sequel is warranted.			"

I cared enough about the world going into this game that I spent hours upon hours making and remaking characters, never getting past the first act, because of all of the things that I could have done in certain situations as a different character. I finally settled on a druid, strong and smart, that would be able to keep me vested. I shudder at the thought of the hours I am about to sink into this title when 36 hours in I've decided on a character and begun combing the landscape without even coming close to the second act or expansions.

												Overall, a pretty entertaining game.The combat is alright, I can never decide if I actually like this sort of game, but it seem to work pretty well for the most part. If it isn't your thing, just turn down the difficulty of the game. I personally prefer easy difficulties for this sort of thing as I find the combat more entertaining when you don't have to worry about it so much.For those unaware, the system is that of a top down, pausable RPG where your characters have various abilities you can use which are either per-encounter, per-rest, or use some kind of in combat resource (i.e. monks use ""wounds"" to power their stuff). I'm not personally a fan of per-rest stuff, as I find it tends to be that I just avoid using certain abilities unless I really need them, which is kind of lame because it makes the combat have a lot less variety. There's also a mechanic called fatigue which makes your characters weaker if you don't rest for a long time, and I'd have preferred to see that more fleshed out in place of a hard limit of ""this ability can be used twice per rest"". The story and interactions is where the game stands out though, and for me is the real reason to play it. There's quite a wide variety of things to do and people to talk to, with many response options to choose from (I'd recommend turning off the option to see why you can choose certain options though, as I find it makes the interactions more interesting - often if I see I've unlocked an option by having X stat, it will make me want to choose that option. If I can't see that, then I just choose more naturally what I want to do). Overall pretty fun though, in particular if its on sale I'd recommend picking it up - it's worth one playthrough at least if you can get it for a good price.			"

												PoE is one of the best RPGs I have ever played (and I've been playing them for decades).  It is the first game that actually succeeds at recreating the strategic fun of the Infinity Engine games (Baldur's Game, Icewind Dale, etc.) while updating the style and gameplay for the modern day.  This is an insanely deep game, which is obvious from the get-go tons of player choice everywhere.  Not only that, but Obsidian created a totally unique character development system for players to experiment with that affects both combat and story.  This isn't your typical Str, Dex, Con-based game, but more of a hybrid including elements you might see in a Fallout-style game (stats and chosen origin will give you dialogue options).I don't think anything can touch the storyline of the Baldur's Gate games in my mind, but I've been enjoying PoE's very much, with all of its twists and turns and options to discover through exploration.If you like RPGs, especially deep, tactical RPGs, I recommend PoE.  If you've been looking for Baldur's Gate III, you need PoE now.			"

												When someone says ""We can do another Baldur's Gate, but modern"" after 10 years of RPG drought, i tend to be sceptical about it. When someone asks money ahead of the product being made, i generally don't trust them. When a developer has a history or releasing conceptually great games reduced to barely playable mess by bugs and content cuts, i'm bound to doubt their ability.So I didn't back Pillars of Eternity on Kickstarter, and my completionist side will regret this forever (Kickstarter Backer achevement, why is that a thing?), because, surprisingly, the game is exactly what was promised - a Baldur's Gate game, but better. In every respect.			"

												If like me, you grew up playing more ARPGs, like Diablo and Titan Quest, than CRPGs, like Icewind Dale, Pillars is going to take a lot of time getting used to. Especially the combat system requires a lot of thought and planning, even on the normal difficulty setting. But once you're into the game and the story, Pillars is definitely a game that's going to keep you busy. It's too bad that you have to spend so much time looking at loading screens, because otherwise the game would easily keep you going when you should go to sleep (okay, you could call that a good thing if you like to be awake when you have to work). If you're just looking for a action packed RPG, Pillars might not be the thing for you, but if you like a deep story, reading massive amounts of text (it's insane really) and decent tactical D&D-style combat, then Pillars is the game for you.

												A New School Game for Old School Gamers!Pillars of Eternity brings back the Infinity Engine style RPG that many of us played and loved. Taking inspiration from Baldur's Gate. Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment, Pillars of Eternity offers up a great experience for anyone who was a fan of those old games and are looking for a new game to play in a similar vain. It definitely lives up to its status as a ""spiritual successor."" While playing, it has the depth and story of Baldur's Gate, a soundtrack and tactical combat of Icewind Dale, and the walls of text and fluff that Torment had.Even if you have not played those styles of games, Pillars is a great game to play still. The positives of Pillars of Eternity include:1.An in depth character creation system including many different races and unique classes (and backgrounds!) that only fuel the RPG experience2. A unique system that still has a pen and paper feel to it3. A game that facilitates role playing a character and developing them.4. Both recruitable NPCs and the ability to make your own recruitable party members.5. An engaging story set in a unique and interesting worldOne of Pillars downsides is it lacks the multiplayer mode that Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale had, but hopefully an update or DLC will add it. If not, I sure hope a sequel does. Now you may not view this as a downside, so that may not be a concern to you. Also wish the Stronghold function had a little more depth to it.All in all, Pillars of Eternity is a great game that harkons back to the old days of some of the best RPGs and can now consider itself amongst their ranks. Get it. Play it. Enjoy it.			"

												Best game of its type since Baldur's Gate 2.  Which.... well I guess that's not saying much since there haven't been many but...Great writing on par with Planescape Torment (though lacking the same depth, somewhat), good interface, interesting, intuitive yet simple combat system.Little threadbare in some places.  Item diversity could have used some work, as could the crafting system.  And there were some great opportunities for player-specific interaction when backgrounds/homelands/races etc intertwined that were left unexplored.  Also no romance options, which was a bummer, since those were some of the best story sections of games like Baldur's Gate 2.  You could tell they wanted to do everything but ran out of time or money at some point.  Looking forward to expansions/sequels/new games of the same type now that Obsidian has decent proof that games like this can make a profit.Just... if you liked BG2, buy this game.  Buy it to relive the nostalgia of playing a story-heavy well written game of this type.  Buy it to encourage game devs to keep making these.			"

												Early ReviewYes I spent the $45 on it and so far I'm very happy.  This is Baldur's Gate for 2015.Pros:-- Character Creation:  Excellent setup - great back stories, plenty of customization.  Talents, skills, and point distribution.--  Difficulty Settings:  several different options here - which should give it high replay value as well.--  Storyline:  so far so good.  Got me involved right from the beginning.  The main story-arch is developing nicely and gradually.  Good voice acting and dialog seems to flow - feels genuine--  Combat - similar to BG of course--  Crafting -- oh yeah!  That's a nice touch, nothing too dramatic yet - but you don't just have to sell junk - you can craft some useful combat buffs.-- Stash - very helpful--  Recruit mercs - early on even you can recruit some party members for reasonable amounts of copper.  Very helpful in those sticky places--  Stronghold - just just started this part.  But seems like a nice developing touch of building your stronghold - looks like you can develop some residual incomeCONS--  Graphics are so-so but this isn't a big con for me.  In a top-down 3rd person, I can live with it.  Some like it, some don't.--  Combat sometimes is overwhelming.  Getting into some places early on where I'm completely overwhelmed.  Could be frustrating to some.--  Fog of war feels a bit tight, but not incredibly so.That's all I can think of now - will update more later.Overall I have no hesitation in saying it's worth the money.  As a BG / Icewind / RPG fan, I'll get every penny's worth out of this one.This game will make great grounds for future divorces. "

												Just to clarify before I dive into the review, Pillars of Eternity is a MASTERPIECE! *cough* OK, it is hard to not compare it to Balder's gate (and in turn The White March to Icewind Dale) Balder's gate 2 is my all time favourite video game. Now I am being pedantic here but it is not Balder's gate 2, quite. It is closer to part 1. (which really makes me want a Pillars 2!) I don't like the level cap being so low and I would have prefered a few more spells. Please though, this is only while comparing to BG2. If you've never played any of the games this is almost a homage to then you will be blown away by the variety in combat. As a story, it's stunning. Keeps you gripped and has many twists and turns along this long road. It actually gets quite intense. The homestead parts I found a perfect retreat from the world around. You see it build, it grow,many quests stem from there, it becomes home. Gameplay wise, if you know isometric games then it's a piece of cake to pick up, but very tricky to master. In my eyes, and I have read people say the combat is boring (???) .... The combat is deep and complex with many possible outcomes. The companions are superbly written and come with very interesting quests and personalities. One gripe I had, no evil team. I always liked a run with the good, and the bad, but it wasn't to be. Graphics are ace, it's smooth, beautiful and gripping. A true masterpiece of modern gaming. I want to give it 5 but just because of a couple of minor let-downs I give Pillars 4.8 out of 5. Any RPG fan should own this!			"

												To all the fans of Baulder's Gate: you need this game in your life.Incredibly deep and wonderfully immersive, Pillars of Eternity is absolutely stuffed to the brim with so much lore that you'll wonder which has more - this, or Skyrim. With tons of races, classes, and choices of playstyle, you're guaranteed to find the perfect fit.As someone who has no patience for turn-based combat, I'm rather fond of the fact that I can just let my party go at it with enemies on auto-pilot. Very often I'll find they've decimated the opposition so quickly that some summoning spells have just been cast and now I have to wait that extra second or two for the summoned allies to disappear before I can loot all those corpses. Other times, I'll find my party absolutely destroyed because I've run headfirst into a difficult fight that really shouldn't be attempted without using the turn-based combat system properly, or else over-leveling by a lot.One of the most intensely satisfying things about Pillars of Eternity is the vast number of choices in dialogue and how different choices affect your story in different ways. This is not the game to go about ""exhausting all the dialogue options"" - often, if you try to, you'll find that you've♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥someone important off, or doomed a character's fate, or swayed a faction's views in the opposite direction from your intention.So! Do yourself the favor: Buy this game. Play it. Immerse yourself. And don't look back.			"

												If like me, you grew up playing more ARPGs, like Diablo and Titan Quest, than CRPGs, like Icewind Dale, Pillars is going to take a lot of time getting used to. Especially the combat system requires a lot of thought and planning, even on the normal difficulty setting. But once you're into the game and the story, Pillars is definitely a game that's going to keep you busy. It's too bad that you have to spend so much time looking at loading screens, because otherwise the game would easily keep you going when you should go to sleep (okay, you could call that a good thing if you like to be awake when you have to work). If you're just looking for a action packed RPG, Pillars might not be the thing for you, but if you like a deep story, reading massive amounts of text (it's insane really) and decent tactical D&D-style combat, then Pillars is the game for you.

												So, you want to lose track of time and adventure until your eyes bleed?  You wish that Baldur's Gate could have lasted forever?  This is the game for you!The story line is engaging, plenty of freedom to make your own way.  An excellent RPG overall.Pros:- Options, lots of them.- Plenty of quests and side quests.- Inventory slot for adorable animal companion.- Spend less money on food by forgetting to eat in real life.Cons:- What day is it?- Some clunky or missing features.  (Combat can get hairy in large groups, no button to re-center on your party)			"

												Best game of its type since Baldur's Gate 2.  Which.... well I guess that's not saying much since there haven't been many but...Great writing on par with Planescape Torment (though lacking the same depth, somewhat), good interface, interesting, intuitive yet simple combat system.Little threadbare in some places.  Item diversity could have used some work, as could the crafting system.  And there were some great opportunities for player-specific interaction when backgrounds/homelands/races etc intertwined that were left unexplored.  Also no romance options, which was a bummer, since those were some of the best story sections of games like Baldur's Gate 2.  You could tell they wanted to do everything but ran out of time or money at some point.  Looking forward to expansions/sequels/new games of the same type now that Obsidian has decent proof that games like this can make a profit.Just... if you liked BG2, buy this game.  Buy it to relive the nostalgia of playing a story-heavy well written game of this type.  Buy it to encourage game devs to keep making these.			"

												Pillars of Eternity is an incredibly good game in the spirit of Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment, though fans of Spiderweb Studio game's such as Geneforge and Avernum will also feel at home.The combat system seems to inspired by the tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons 4th edition, with your abilities being split into encounter and daily powers that reset either after the end of every fight or after each rest. While I am not a fan of D&D 4th, I have always said that their combat system would work better in a computor game, and I feel that Pillars of Eternity proves me right here. I did not play Pillars for its combat system, but I enjoyed the tactical battles none the less.Without mentioning any spoilers, the storyline for Pillars of Eternity is fantastic. There are a myriads of options and solutions to most if not all problems in the game, with significance to your characters reputation which I felt led to natural consequences throughout the game. While there were some small handful of places where I felt like I could have done with slightly more branching paths in the storyline, I were pleasently surprised when the game often gave me choices that I did not expect.The companions are a colourful collection of eight, and while I love them and my characters' interaction with them, they may well be my biggest critique in the game. While their quests are interesting, and while I grew attached to their bantering in the background in the course of our adventure together, I felt as if they are largely ignored by the world. They will sometimes comment upon an ungoing dialogue, yet the NPCs will often neither remark upon or indeed notice your companions contribution. This makes them feel sadly invisible and unimportant. I still love them, I simply wish that they had more of an impact on the overall game.The music of the game is discrete and enjoyable. I am generally the kind of gamer who will turn the music off while playing to listen to my own, yet I left the music on throughout the game as I felt that it heightend the experience without being all up in my face.To round things up, I would recommend Pillars of Eternity to any cRPG fan out there, and also to anyone who wishes to get into cRPGs as the learning curve is not too steep, certainly not as steep as Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. The game caters to many different kind of playstyles, so anyone who likes seeing their own character grow forth as a person in and of itself is bound to enjoy this wonderful game.			"

												I finished the game with about 99% of all quest/explorations done.It is a decent spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate 2 and an absolute piece of art in it's scenery and graphics. You can notice the art team did an amazing job down to the details.The problem is that the game is still quite buggy, I came across a lot of them, including major ones that wouldn't allow me to continue and would make me load an older save file. So keep this in mind and save often and in different files.The battle is often poorly balanced because of it's system. It feels as if they tried to make this revolutionary system of endurance with armors, damage reduction, graze/crits being more realistic. But it fell short in the execution and you will notice battles can be quite draggy, often going for much longer than it should despite having the most powerful weapon and a high level character. I feel they could have achieved more by sticking with a stable equipment system (+1,+2, etc) and spending more time polishing the game, removing bugs and adding more depth to quests and NPCs.The Stronghold  was extremely positive, adding a lot to the game without disrupting your adventures around. But the Endless Paths could definitely have used more time. Some levels were quite plain and could easily be just part of other levels. And safe a few levels, most of them didn't have any characteristic or good NPCs or puzzles such as Watcher's Keep did in BG2.Having said that, I really enjoyed the game. It doesn't have the magic that Baldur's Gate series had had (every area had so much depth and quests and interesting NPCs that is hard to compare), nor Pillars of Eternity has a very surprising storyline. But I quite enjoyed it and I think everyone will feel accomplished by the end of the game.			"

												As an avid fan of Baldur's Gat I & II as well as Planescape Torment, it was an easy decision to back Pillars of Eternity on Kickstarter. When the final product came out with glowing reviews, my anticipation was high. Luckily I can say POE lives up to the promises of the Kickstarter; albeit with its own caveats.What's amazing about POE is that it's easily the most accessible for newcomers and veterans alike. You can simply toggle on or off tutorial menus and the like whenever you want. There are new additions to the gameplay and interface that made me admire the attention to detail. Don't be scared off if you've never played this type of game.On the whole Pillars of Eternity feels like it needs just a bit more creative time in the oven. The core story is a bit lackluster. I never cared for the world or truly understood what the threat was. The writing quality and quantity is still very high, but the stakes never seem worth it. It's like I was back home but all the people and furnishing were different. And when compared to other games in their library, this appears even paler in comparison. The characters also aren't as interesting or memorable for the exception of a couple. There's still a TON of story in this game. You can always find a new tome or book on a shelf ready to be read. Yet I always sold these books at markets instead of reading them. I just kinda wanted the main adventure to be over with.Side quests are plentiful although a tad redundant. Most missions are kill or retrieve. The consequences of your actions doesn't feel as dramatic as Baldur's Gate II. Plus your options in the dialog tree, while there, don't feel like they're as deep.Dungeoning is still fun. The action is as intense as before. Spell casting doesn't seem to be as fun. It didn't quite feel like I was on a huge adventure for some reason. Like the confines of the maps were smaller than before. This game is definitely challenging especially if you're not ready for it. It's good to see that the pause mechanic and planning out your attacks is still in good form. I love playing as the ranger class but I was sad to see that there are no arrow/projectile types that you can manage and buy. If you have a bow, crossbow, or sling you have an infinite amount of ammo as your disposal. I guess they came to the conclusion that this got in the way of the fun factor.What I loved about the original Baldur's Gate games was the sense of an inhabited world. Random events, character interactions, and grand adventures seemed to spring out of nowhere at any time. All distinct and unique from each other. Pillars of Eternity feels like it's cut short in most categories; although, it's still quite up there in terms of quality.For the year this came out in, it's easily one of the best games of the year. In terms of the Baldur's Gate and Planescape Torment games, it's in the back of the pack but a welcome addition. A sequel is warranted.			"

												Overall, a pretty entertaining game.The combat is alright, I can never decide if I actually like this sort of game, but it seem to work pretty well for the most part. If it isn't your thing, just turn down the difficulty of the game. I personally prefer easy difficulties for this sort of thing as I find the combat more entertaining when you don't have to worry about it so much.For those unaware, the system is that of a top down, pausable RPG where your characters have various abilities you can use which are either per-encounter, per-rest, or use some kind of in combat resource (i.e. monks use ""wounds"" to power their stuff). I'm not personally a fan of per-rest stuff, as I find it tends to be that I just avoid using certain abilities unless I really need them, which is kind of lame because it makes the combat have a lot less variety. There's also a mechanic called fatigue which makes your characters weaker if you don't rest for a long time, and I'd have preferred to see that more fleshed out in place of a hard limit of ""this ability can be used twice per rest"". The story and interactions is where the game stands out though, and for me is the real reason to play it. There's quite a wide variety of things to do and people to talk to, with many response options to choose from (I'd recommend turning off the option to see why you can choose certain options though, as I find it makes the interactions more interesting - often if I see I've unlocked an option by having X stat, it will make me want to choose that option. If I can't see that, then I just choose more naturally what I want to do). Overall pretty fun though, in particular if its on sale I'd recommend picking it up - it's worth one playthrough at least if you can get it for a good price.			"

												I had a lot of fun with this game, it brought back the nostalgia of first playing Neverwinter Nights but with decent graphics and fun gameplay, it's in depth enough I can enjoy it but I can ignore a lot of the details if I so choose.  I'm only about a third of the way through the main campaign and keep getting side tracked, thoroughly exploring each map as I come to it and reading any lore I come across.  I like the way the codex fills out as you travel and fight different monsters to reflect your growing knowledge of the places you visit and the creatures you fight.  Haven't played the first expansion and I'm waiting on the second but if the quality remains close to the main game I'm sure they'll be a big hit as well.  Look forward to seeing more expansions/games like this in the future.			"

												A fantastic (in the true sense of the word) adventure with a capturing story, great delivery and atmopshere, alright character-development and DnD-esque combat and conversation. This is for anyone in love with the DnD-esque genre. I would say that if you expect something like Torchlight/Diablo just because its isometric, you're in the wrong genre. Combat is slow, tactical and at times a challenge or a chore. The main bright spots of this game are the story and the lore and the atmosphere. It really does feel like an adventure or a quest.Here's the deal though: it is not worth 40 euros. Buy it in a heartbeat if its 50% off or more, but any price large than 20 euros is honestly pushing it. Its a really great game, but the genre generally belongs to the past for a good reason, and lore can only carry a game so far.8/10 , great game, awful price.			"

I finally settled on a druid, strong and smart, that would be able to keep me vested.

												A New School Game for Old School Gamers!Pillars of Eternity brings back the Infinity Engine style RPG that many of us played and loved. Taking inspiration from Baldur's Gate. Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment, Pillars of Eternity offers up a great experience for anyone who was a fan of those old games and are looking for a new game to play in a similar vain. It definitely lives up to its status as a ""spiritual successor."" While playing, it has the depth and story of Baldur's Gate, a soundtrack and tactical combat of Icewind Dale, and the walls of text and fluff that Torment had.Even if you have not played those styles of games, Pillars is a great game to play still. The positives of Pillars of Eternity include:1.An in depth character creation system including many different races and unique classes (and backgrounds!) that only fuel the RPG experience2. A unique system that still has a pen and paper feel to it3. A game that facilitates role playing a character and developing them.4. Both recruitable NPCs and the ability to make your own recruitable party members.5. An engaging story set in a unique and interesting worldOne of Pillars downsides is it lacks the multiplayer mode that Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale had, but hopefully an update or DLC will add it. If not, I sure hope a sequel does. Now you may not view this as a downside, so that may not be a concern to you. Also wish the Stronghold function had a little more depth to it.All in all, Pillars of Eternity is a great game that harkons back to the old days of some of the best RPGs and can now consider itself amongst their ranks. Get it. Play it. Enjoy it.			"

Among the classics like Ultima, Infocom(s), Baldurs Gate, Kotor, Mass Effect -  telling a story that really involves the player. If you liked the titles above (esp. Baldurs Gate but also Icewind Dale, Planescape T) you shouldn´t even think a second time before investing in Pillars of Eternity! Now Im only hoping that Pillars will grow with DLC´s and sequals that will be as GREAT as this one! Ive played video games for like 30 years and this one even manage to surprise me in a lot of ways.

												Reminds me strongly of the old baldurs gate type games, but simplified and for me, personally, easier to get into! So far I have played for about 15 hours, in story mode because I'm not particularly good, and the conversations are well written with good answers; already people have reacted to the reputation I have built up with answering a certain way. The backstory I made in character creation has made a difference in how people have talked to me. The world feels more alive and as if it's really -reacting- to how my character talks and acts.I highly recommend this game to people new to RPGs and people who have played them before too.			"

I'm also a huge fan of games that let you completely design your character (backstory and all!) This is the kind of game I would have completely lost my mind over as a kid.			"

												This game is awesome! It feels like an old school RPG and the character customization is nice. I feel like this is more toward the old DnD rule set as a mage you can only cast a certain amount of spells per rest. The story is immersive and interesting, looking forward to seeing what else happens! The combat is face-paced but the good thing is you can pause it by hitting the space bar and slow it down by pressing S which slows that combat by half I believe. The only issue I have with combat is the camera. At times you are behind objects and cannot see your characters very well. It is just a minor annyoance. I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys a good rpg that has a feel of older games, like Baulders Gate etc...			"

												I'm not much of a review writer (I think I've written maybe two before this one), but...this game's deserving of a good review, and as I finished my first playthrough earlier today it seemed the ideal time. Unfortunately, I'm not a wordy person, so I'll point out some quick bits and leave the description of the plot out apart from some very simple comparison to its grandparents:Story - 6/5. Seriously, it's so multi-faceted, between the main questline and all of the side quests, it's the type of story we haven't seen since the good old days of cRPGs (aka Pillars' grandparents!). Other, more recent RPGs are definitely steered towards the action side of things, and while the Bethesda games do have a fairly expansive story/lore (well, fond memories are especially coming to mind about Morrowind when I'm thinking of that), there's just something great about a game's story relying a lot on making the player read. Combat - 5/5. I've never been the best at party-based RPGs (though they're very probably my favorite style, go figure), but playing through this game has been a real learning experience. While it's not super dense, it's not too simplistic either, and it allows you to play it however you will. Eventually I got to the point where I could tell which battles required strategy to win decisively and which I could just essentially auto-smash. The variety of combat styles available through the different character classes is great, and the two unique classes added to the eschelon were fun and interesting to learn and play. There was only one battle which I ended up taking an alternative method to solving...needless to say, I tried to persevere and win it out through blood and steel, but all that was happening was my party's blood was being spilled at alarming rates and their steel was being dropped by their limp, lifeless corpses. Non-combat gameplay/exploration - 4.5/5. One of the first things which really impressed me about the game is how a character's stats and skills regularly affect gameplay outside of combat. Whether it be in conversations or scripted events or what have you, I regularly saw options I couldn't go with (a few of which unfortunately made my character act contrary to the sort of personality I'd developed for him throughout the game) and many which I could. My only complaint about this system, and it's a small one since in reality it just gives me more reason to go back and play again as different styles of characters, is that none of your companions' stats or skills can be used in any of these situations. I understand that your PC is, of course, front and center and does most of the talking, but I found myself wishing on occasion that I could have had my companions weigh in a bit more.  Pets - unrated/5. I didn't, in all honesty, see the point of having the pets around. They didn't detract from the experience at all, but they didn't add to it much for me either. They just sort of followed us around, all behaving as placidly as the others while all sorts of crazy situations unfolded around them. Stronghold - 4.5/5. Only complaint about the stronghold is there's no way to combine at least some of the resting bonuses you earn from building the various parts of the stronghold...would have been nice since there were so many lucrative rooms to stay in at the inns in various towns/cities. I enjoyed piecing the place together, and it added a fun little side-mechanic to distract me on occasion. Music - 5/5. When it needed to be atmospheric, it was atmospheric. When it needed to be a bit tense and...battle...ish....it was that. The music was well composed, varied and interesting. Graphics - 5/5. I love this style! Replayability - 5/5. The amount of variation possible between playthroughs is obscene depending on race/background/class/personality/decisions/penchance for violence/completist attitude/etc etc etc.There are still a few bugs/glitches/typos in the game, but I know the guys at Obsidian are working on getting it all ironed out. Final thoughts - I can't wait to get around to playing through this again, though I'm going to take some time off between playthroughs so I don't tire myself out of it (and so I can give some much needed attention to other games I've bought lately). I saw an interview with one of the creators stating that they're already working on putting together a story for a substantial expansion (YES!), akin to those expansions from all the older classics of the genre. This game, man. It's worth your time and money if you're into this sort of thing, and it's got me eagerly awaiting any future developments. A game destined to remain in the glorious halls of classics. TL;DR: 5/5!Final words I forgot the other day: You must gather your party before venturing forth.			"

												Fun game. I really enjoyed the lore and there is a lot of it, between the main story line quest and the various books you can find strewn in the world.  I would definitely recommend this one for anyone that is a fan of isometric RPGs.My only 2 complaints of this game are:-The loading screens.  Sometimes you have to go through a bunch of them in quick succession just because you want to go travel to town *load* enter the tavern *load* rest and buy supplies, leave the tavern *load* travel to where you were before *load*-Certain class balancing.  It is a lot more apparent on Path of the Damned difficulty, but it becomes noticable which classes are better than others or which just have better utility.  There is no ""useless"" class but there are ones that will make your life more or less difficult.			"

												It's like a love letter, sitting there in front of your tiny screen and waiting for Baldur's Gate to finish installing on your Windows 98. The sheer awe that would await, did not prepare you for the journey that would take place. The experience was a profound one, one that would shape the way you viewed your future roleplaying gaming sessions. BAM! ZOOM 17 YEARS LATER AND WE GOT PILLARS OF ETERNITY UP IN THIS HAY.On a stupid sidenote: Chris Avellone's characters, Greiving Mother and Durance, are the best companions in any game ever, as expected out of his god damned sexy handsome genius. I already hyped these characters when they were announced as being written by him and sure enough, they are some of the most well received. Too bad the fanfic backers ruin the immersion. One of the first [Yellow] namned NPC's in a house can be googled into a closed off ""My OC"" anime forum. I did think it was too stereotypical to be true, but the whole godmode and calming down was too much fanfic-levels of writing and googling it was too much. Now if only you could kill more of them, too bad only 5% of them are any good reads.			"

												When someone says ""We can do another Baldur's Gate, but modern"" after 10 years of RPG drought, i tend to be sceptical about it. When someone asks money ahead of the product being made, i generally don't trust them. When a developer has a history or releasing conceptually great games reduced to barely playable mess by bugs and content cuts, i'm bound to doubt their ability.So I didn't back Pillars of Eternity on Kickstarter, and my completionist side will regret this forever (Kickstarter Backer achevement, why is that a thing?), because, surprisingly, the game is exactly what was promised - a Baldur's Gate game, but better. In every respect.			"

												Pillars is a great game in it's own right. If you loved Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment or Icewind Dale, then you will feel at home. The game is very detailed and Obsidian took great care in making every area interesting to explore. There is much dialogue and while the story not as memorable as Planescape: Torment, it still intrduces us to a new world to look to in the future. The game has replay value and Obsidian continues to patch it up. The combat is fun and you will get obliretaed if you don't plan out your strategy. Character builds are very detailed as well, so take your time with that build. Be forwarned though, the game is very buggy and crashes randomly to the Desktop. F5 frequently so that you don't loose progress. I am almost 70 hrs into the game and I am still on Act 2 since I take my time with the game. I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves this genre. It's definitely helped me with my vocabulary.			"

												This is, hands down, one of the best games I´ve ever played.  Because that I grew up with Baulders gate 1 and 2 this is a game well suited for me. A lively atmosphere and rich enviroments with great music to boost it. They said that they aimed to bring back the feel of the old infinty engine games (Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale e.t.c) and they did just that. Not just the isometrical camera and live turnbased combat (pausable, of course). They looked to the smaller things, such as the good old ""You must gather your party before venturing forth"" as well.Apart from that the game is also littered with alot of community written content wich shows that they really cherish the community they have gathered. There is no real downside to this game, it offers great replay value, great challenges and hours upon hours of gameplay.Should I really search for a downside I could find two things1: The UI has a button wich reveals that you will acquire a stronghold at one point, it could have been covered up as not to spoil a great surprise.2: I easily reached the levelcap way before reaching the end of the game, mind you it took alot of sidequesting and it kept me from being way overpowered for the endgame. A slight to much sidecontent in relation to maincontent.That being said, I strongly recommend it. It brought back so many good memories of what I love about roleplaying games.			"

												This is essentially the BG3 game we all have been waiting for since BG2:ToB. The interface, the graphics concept, the narrative, the combat, quests, etc. we all loved in BG (and mostly missed in IWD) are all in PoE. Maybe the pacing wouldn't feel as dynamic as in BG, but it's all a matter of taste. Those who didn't like PoE, probably didn't like the BG series in the first place. So if you do not belong to the latter group, this game is definitely a BUY for you.			"

												I thought this was a rare, great game. Challenging, engaging, some great voice acting, writing, characters, lore, etc.After playing through numerous times, I came to appreciate the innumerable little improvements this game had over the cRPGs it paid homage to, but also deviated from. Yes, there were still some bugs, but the developers seem intent on fixing them even after all this time.I think part of the problem a lot of people had w/ this game is that, based on what they thought it would be (how it would play), they got frustrated when their preconceptions about character classes, abilities, attributes (stats), etc. weren't met. I'm not saying I blame them (e.g., why would you think to max out Intelligence on a Barbarian in a D&D-inspired game? Yet, that's a great idea given the mechanics of PoE!), just that it helps to come into the game w/ an open mind. I certainly struggled for a while to understand combat mechanics in my 1st game, but came to love it.I can't wait for the sequel.			"

												All the great writing you expect from an Obsidian title, without the bugs. It sports a brilliant story and recaptures the gaming mechanics that made Baldurs Gate and Icewind Dale so popular back in the day. I aboslutely love that experienced is gained from exploration and completing quest, rather than individual tasks or battles becuase it allows you to negotiate obsticles however you please without feeling like your missing out on XP. However, the game can be a bit boring at times, with the writing edging on tedium, and its especially annoying when dialogue is spoken while the written action is interspersed between sentences. Still, its a solid purchase and a wonderful, original entry from the developer.			"

												A very well done, Infinity Engine (i.e. Baldur's Gate and company) style game.  They really nailed the look and feel of the interface and graphics.  The game is pretty superb in all other areas but doesn't quite reach the level of Baldur's Gate 1 or 2 in my opinion.They created their own world and lore, and while well done it, just didn't capture my imagination as much as the regular AD&D setting.  They also created their own rules system, and I think this is where it lacks the most.  I love a lot of things they did, but they really missed the mark with stealth and loot.  Stealth is just hard to pull off and was originally a group only ability.  This was changed in the expansions though.  The loot to me just wasn't very exciting.  Even late into the game I was still using some of the same equipment I found pretty early on.  Many, supposedly high end items I never even equiped as what I had was better, or was at least better for me.  I think the problems stems from the fact that equipment has certain enchanting rules and it just makes many items feel bland.  This was improved upon in the expansions but not a whole lot.The difficulty of the base game seemed fairly easy to me.  I played on hard / expert and only had problems with some of the end game level battles.  Can't say the same for the expansions but that is for another review.Anyway, those are some of the negatives.  Most of the rest is very good / great level so it is still a great game for those craving RPG's of the past.			"

												If you love classic CRPGS like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale or Planetscape: Torment then you owe yourself to pick up this game. I've played almost 50 hours now and it's utterly brilliant. In a time where CRPGs have been reduced to AAA titles with QTEs, linear progression and being spoon feed every morsel of information Pillars comes as a blessing of both nostalgia and fresh air. The character creation is brilliant, the classes deep and interesting and the combat is strategic and tough, yet very rewarding. But it it's the lore and the graphics that really makes this game so brilliant. Your adventures in Dyrwood will immerse you into a world with a rich history, interesting races, frightful monsters, a pantheon of gods, and tons of interesting NPCs. The hand drawn graphics really brings this wonderful world to life in a way 3D graphics just can't. For the younger players or those who never played the classics CRPGs of the late 90s, get ready for a bit of shock. Be ready to spend hours reading text, from old tomes, diaries to treaties on local history, books on culture, religion and factions. You'll also spend lot of the game time reading descriptions of characters and events. The game won't spoon feed you lore, it asks you to find out by yourself. It asks you to explore and understand, like all great RPGs should. This is a game that asks you to invest and apply yourself, but if you do it will reward you handsomely for it. The world feels more real and immersive because of it.In short, this is wonderful game and all RPG fans need to pick it up, because we need more games like it.			"

												This game is great for all the reasons everyone says it is. I especially liked the unique races and classes, as well as Obsidian's original fantasy world and storyline. This fully-realized history really makes the game stand out as more than an update or clone of previous CRPGs set in some TSR world that's been around for ages. I also liked the Stronghold maintenance sidegame. Ever since I started playing AD&D back in the 90s I have wanted to see one of my characters acquire property and attract followers. Well done.			"

												When i played this game. I had the same feeling as Skyrim. Playing for countless hours nonstop while having alot of fun while doing so. This is a generic 'turn-based' game, nor is it a game where you can just run in and expect to kill everything. The game is sort of unique with its combat. It can be played as if it is a turn-based game, it can also be played as if its not. The main thing that seperates this game from others is difficulty. You might (and probably will) get stuck on a certain enemy at some point in the game. That just means you need to change your tactics or go level up or change your party. Once you do beat that...one enemy... that one group... it feels good. Much like the retro games like Contra, although not NEAR as hard. (then again depending on your difficulty...)This game is amazing, its a topnotch game. 11/10.			"

												This game is an excellent bar to set for other game companies. The story is one of the best I've had the pleasure of experienceing. My favorite picks would be BG2, BG2TOB, NWN, BG1.Combat is flawless and follows to a small degree(loosely) the DND ruleset which is known in IE games for being a staple mechanic.The sheer amount of content with the Endless Dungeons and bounties adds much flair and things to do. Let's not forget that you get your own keep and can upgrade it AND pay people to guard it! There are multiple secret areas and numerous items good and bad to find. This game from start to finish took about 32+ hours to complete with about 60% of the game explored and completed.There are multiple facets that I havn't even discovered and I plan on replaying through the game again solo.Giving this game anything below a 9 would be ludicrous.My only complaint is that this game advertised that it is able to be solo'ed. So far the balancing of the classes other than a barbarian is kind of messed up. This game would be a perfect 10/10 for me if I could actually solo it. I've obtained a platinum in the Dark Souls series and Bloodborne but, even those games are not as hard as Pillars of Eternity solo on NORMAL. Please make a selectable option for solo that scales down the enemies a bit for a solo run or, take out the level cap for solo-runners.Story: 9.5Combat: 9.6Content: 10/10Play Time: 32 hrs 9.1/10Replayability: VERY HIGH 10/10 Solo: Currently undoable for anything but barbarians.Overall: 9.5/10 "

												At first, during the kickstarter campain, PoE was a ray of hope for all ""old"" isometric rpg enthusiasts.Then, after release, it has been hyped by so many gaming websites and magazines.A lot of those players waiting for a new baldur's gate (2) were quite disappointed- or lets call it ""disillusioned"" as nothing beats bg2 (hi!).But, after all, PoE is still a great game with many new cool aspects, game mechanics and a solid story. So yes, i recommend this game for old rpg fans and new players.edit: After 200+h of Gameplay and two AddOns i still recommend this game. As mentioned I needed quite some time to get used to the style and mechanics of the game but now I love it. <3			"

												After 48 hours of gameplay, after hundreds of times of recreating new characters, after trying different difficulties and modes, I still have not completed Act II, and I think I'm going to restart again.So these are the most important and interesting features of an RPG to me: playability and fascinatingly dark story.I admit I've never had the chance to play Baldur's Gate but I used to be fanatical IWD player, Pillars of Eternity did even better at every aspect of old school RPG. The graphic performace is  amazing under the well-shaped engine of 2D/3D, and they did pay a lot of work in the conversations and storytelling and of course the background unfolding.Buy it my friends, 100% you won't regret it, 100%.

There are loads of muchrooms to put into a bottle and turn into a potion to enhance your journey, which makes you wonder why we dont back to a time when this was common place for all wizards. one this, if you run this on a lap top that is 6 years old, it may not run very fast. this will cause you to vomit and be sad, but it is possible to make the low frame rate seem like some kind of magic in the world that has caused your adventurers to seem like they are walking through treakle. 10/10 would game again			"

												This is effectively the successor we've been waiting for BG2. Does it hit as hard as BG2? No, it's hard to do that. BG2 existed in a kind of beloved universe by nerds, cultivated with a rich goofy history from Dungeons and Dragons.This attempts to do it's own thing, though common fantasy tropes are brought in. None the less it's interesting and takes a strong themeatic focus upon the concept of the soul, which here is a particular thing with particular qualities, capable of being approached in an almost scientific manner.The gameplay is essentially turn based though real time, you will pause often. AI can be preset for companions to make it flow easier and I've found it to work fine. The classes are many and interesting while the stat system is a little more forgiving, as usefulness is spread out wide amid the stats. It's hard to build yourself into a character hole.The dialogue and reading is plenty. Play this game ever night, a little bit, before you go to bed. It's like cozying up with a book. It isn't supposed to give you an adrenal rush, but be an enjoyable journey.I would suggest playing it on the harder difficulties, I did at first and rarely had any issues save for near the end.

												All the great writing you expect from an Obsidian title, without the bugs. It sports a brilliant story and recaptures the gaming mechanics that made Baldurs Gate and Icewind Dale so popular back in the day. I aboslutely love that experienced is gained from exploration and completing quest, rather than individual tasks or battles becuase it allows you to negotiate obsticles however you please without feeling like your missing out on XP. However, the game can be a bit boring at times, with the writing edging on tedium, and its especially annoying when dialogue is spoken while the written action is interspersed between sentences. Still, its a solid purchase and a wonderful, original entry from the developer.			"

												A game stripped off of the glamour of modernity does not always hit home. Next generation graphics and mechanics have always taken the industry to the next level. Every once in a while though there comes a rare jewel that makes us take pause -- makes us stop and revisit what was and see it in new light. Pillars of Eternity has done that for me so far. It has been a while since I've played a CRPG, and at first I felt it jarring to be taking the slower pace in gaming once more. But let's all admit that there is an undeniable pull for the old and time-tested models of the past against the flashy, glossy and cinematic titles of this day. It isn't anything ground-breaking mind you.  Pillar of Eternity is true-to-form to the way I remember Icewind Dale or Baldur's Gate were when I first played them years ago. There are, however, some modern fixes that make the journey more streamlined without breaking the nostalgic feeling of playing this sort of game. Settings and options make the game friendly to old fans and would-be followers alike. Sure the art is dated and often times may feel so limited -- but hey -- that's both the challenge and reward of opening such a treasure. I can't say much for the narrative save for the fact that there is a warm feeling experienced from reading through a lot of narrative texts and deciding on the next course of action of your personally crafted heroes and story-rich NPCs. And speaking of heroes - the game offers a lot of exploration in hero-crafting, offering alternative class types such as the Chanter and Cipher that is quite akin to the trinity-breaking hybrids of modern role-playing anti-molds.  The best advice I have if you're picking this up (about two years after it has been out and patched to death) is just play it without any of the distractions brought by the wikis and forums of the world. I think that that is the best dose of nostalgia titles like these bring to the table -- a time when you were just left with a game and nothing else mattered.			"

												I bought PoE because I was interested in the story and, to be honest, because I was curious how similar the game was to the Baldur's Gate etc.I was entertained. True, I didn't care much for the story (the whole soul thing didn't strike my fancy, and the world and races simply didn't knock my socks off), but I was entertained, alright. On the one hand there was, of course nostalgia, on the other the game simply oozes the designers' lifeblood. You can feel it in all the little details and every line of text, from the dialogue to the virtual novel style elements. This is not a ""medal for effort"", though. Only a game that shows that the developers cared - really cared - can hope to be  good, or even great game and lately too many games are released that show quite the opposite. All in all PoE is worth playing; be it out of nostalgia, the love of role playing games or the respect for devs who actually care! However this is game is not the holy grail some people claim: it's nostalgia, first an foremost! If you loved Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape Torment you probably will feel right a t home in PoE. If you have never played one of those, chances are that you might find PoE not THAT fun and entertaining, especially if you are mostly used to RPGs that have been realeased in the last 5 years. On the other hand, you might like it anyways...			"

												If you love Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, or CRPGs in general, get this game.Be warned: It's difficult, and the gameplay, while it looks the same, is startlingly different under the hood. No more grinding for XP! There's no enemy scaling, so if you're getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you then you probably need to level up and return to the area later.The storyline is great, and the NPCs are pretty well rounded. Wizards are pretty much nerfed, but there are a lot of other fun classes. Plus of course, it runs on Linux! "

												I used to play a lot of Baldur's Gate back in the day, it was one of my favourite games.Pillars of Eternity is an accurate recreation of the old RPGs like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale.Storyline, rule set, voice acting, soundtrack, magical items, monsters, combat system: you name it this game does everything right.  It's even easy to walk away from the game and come back weeks later and pick up the adventure again without losing track of what quest you were doing.It's really hard to find anything to complain about with Pillars of Eternity.....except for the blasted loading screens.  Every time you enter or leave a building or level or map.  But ironically Baldur's Gate was like that too.  The game is still worth every penny at regular price,  11/10.			"

												TLDR; it's like Baldur's Gate but with way better combat and character building.A worthy successor to the D&D cRPG classics. It's a true western cRPG with an interesting story that builds as you play and well-written characters to interact with. It's dialogue is well-written and provides many different opportunities for a variety of character builds and behaviors through scripted interactions.The major improvements to combat are the hallmark of the game's excellence. The biggest improvement of Pillars of Eternity over its spiritual predecessors was adding a great deal of variety and balance to the classes and the attribute system. No attribute is inherently dump-stat material (like Intelligence in Baldur's Gate).Combat is also more fluid and exciting, with better UI and feedback. The melee engagement system (a formalized game mechanic of the Attack of Opportunity system) gives combat better flow and allows you to maintain real battle lines and manage more purposeful positioning in a fight.Definitely one of the best RPGs of the decade so far, and a worthy successor to its past.

												A fairly solid game that harks back to the old RPGs of yore. Perhaps a bit too much. It doesn't seem to improve upon things as much as it could have. It often keeps things that perhaps would have been better to be improved or ditched entirely. The real time with pause combat is a mess and I think it'd have benefitted from being full turn based. Otherwise; good.			"

												Where to start with Pillars of Eternity. OverviewLike most of us here on steam, we have that infamous library of shame, and for the longest time, this hidden gem was one of them. I can't even remember how I came to acquire this game in all honesty, but however I did, I am beyond grateful for the purchase/acquisition.If you like RPG games with a rich story, true player choices that affect the game in subtle, but dramatic ways, than Pillars of Eternity is for you. It is a party based game where you can either use the companions the game provides, or spend some in game gold and hire your own adventurers, which are customized from the ground up if you purchase them after level 1. So the amount of player options is truly amazing for this style of game, and the story... I could write a ten page review as to why this is one of the best stories in a game like this. But I will let you experience it for yourself. No spoilers.. Yay!It takes a bit of a different approach to the party based mechanics, where you are allowed to pause the game to issue commands to each person. Though this might break immersion a tinsy bit, since some of the combat is very faced pace and you might not have enough time to dictate your actions, you can find your healer or archer dead before you can even blink.  Or worse yet, have your strongest person be temporarily mind controlled against you! I can't attest to how many times that ability made me grumble and want to smash my keyboard.  There is also the wonderful thing of trial and error, there are some combat set ups that simply can't be done with some party builds, or at least ,not without being a massive pain in your♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game does not hurt you for this, and gives you ample opportunity to find just the right set up to get whatever your mission is done.With that said, below is my summary for the game. Keep in mind this is my opinion, and you should take it with a grain of salt. After all, this type of game is not for everyone. Good Rich, detail oriented story Challenging combat system The world looks absolutely beautiful, and feels like it is living on some level. Companion banter can be quite hilarious. Challenging bosses even when at max level/have amazing gear. Not to many puzzles, but the ones that are present are challenging and require digging in game (provided you don't cheat with google!) High learning curve. The game gives you the basics, and it is your job to shift through the abilities, stats, and what not to build your own character. ((personally a good thing for me, some might disagree.))Not So Good No respawning enemies, once you clear out a map it remains clear (makes getting more loot items impossible) No weapon crafting, would be nice to be able to make custom weapons, especially for end game.Final ThoughtsIn short, if you love RPG games that have in depth story, sophisticated combat, and interesting side quests, this is a game for you! I will leave it at that however, and let you decide for yourself if this is a worthy game for your money.			"

												I usually don't like single-player games that make me micro-manage multiple characters; it tends to make me focus on inventory and number-crunching more-so than the story and the adventure.  With that said, I bought Pillars of Eternity because I was looking for an adventure akin to table-top RPGs and also out of support for the cRPG genre.Unlike its predecessors, Pillars of Eternity shaves off a lot of the busywork of babbysitting companions. Stuff like streamlined inventory management, leveling and other features such as the combat AI, the game was a lot easier to get into.Speaking of ""easy"", I think my main gripe with the game was in its difficulty.  While not a complete stranger to strategy games and RPGs, I found myself struggling in ""easy"" mode yet, at the same time, was not getting a satisfactory victory in ""story time"" mode (as things died WAY too easily for my tastes).  After completing the game after only 9 hours, I suspect that my issues were due to me not exploring enough and/or not participating in enough side-quests; leaving my group under-leveled for the content.  Still, I find it odd that, even in ""easy"" mode, some group of monsters were able to completely crowd-control and annihilate my entire party; regardless of how often I'd reload the game and tried different tactics.  So, for anyone who's looking into getting this game, I'd watch out for that.I'm definitely going back in with a new character, exploring more content (including the game's DLCs) and hopefully try to play through it in ""normal"" difficulty.- The various vistas are great to look at; lots of details without confusing the eyes and without taxing the computer.- The (usually rare) voice-overs performances are serviceable and soothing.- The music is enchanting (I especially enjoy the light-hearted tone from the combat track ~ which is rare these days).- The story, while confusing and slow, is still pretty good.I was pleasantly surprised.  An RPG that encouraged me to role-play; it's been a long time since.			"

												50+ hrs played I waited till I hit the 50+ hrs point to write this review so that I had a complete feel for the game before I made any desessions about the game. All in all I give the game a 85/100. And the -15 is mostly just personal perference not things that are wrong with the game itself. Pillars is a great game with 100's of hrs of game play and a large amount of replayability. Of course you have to like playing with a team of six characters of different classes. I prefer games like Skyrim where you mostly play just a single player. Pillars has a great story line with a mostly open world and you get to chose what order to solve the quests you have. There is a large amount of treasure and items to be bought with nothing bring over powering. The game can be difficult at times. And I do wish they had put a level system in the journal so you know if the quest was to high above your level to complete. The 2 dlc's are a must. And should be bought at round lvl 7 and played before you finish the main game. You can go back to the main game after the dlc's and there is some great loot that can be used like better armour and weapons to give you a better edge also. another fun option in the game is you can have a Keep which you can upgrade and make your home. This is a great game. Read all the reviews you can and get it on sale even better. Also look at all the hrs a lot of people have spent playing this game. That was the biggest factor that told me that this was a good game.			"

If I get thru the enemies guarding the areas, just show me the hidden answers to escape or whatever.  The combat is the best in any game of this type, the UI is intuitive.			"

												This game was good, but I couldn't help feeling like it wasn't as good as it could have been.  It feels like editorial mandates got in the way of the story that some writers were trying to tell and gummed up the works.  Quests can feel disconnected and companions occasionally feel neutered by editing, especially those written by Chris Avellone.Don't get me wrong, the story is fantastic and the companions break the Bioware mold that many RPG's find themselves stuck in.  The world is fantastically realized, being both dark and gritty while also maintaining a sense of wonder not always found in contemporary fantasy.  The lore is also well written and interesting, avoiding some of the pitfalls of other games of the genre by making the lore seem too distant from what is actually presented and giving a real sense of belonging within the game world.The graphics are another high point, for the most part.  All the backgrounds are well detailed with particle effects that just pop, but the models aren't really consistent.  For an indie game of this magnitude, they do look very good, but if you are expecting highly detailed, AAA models, look elsewhere. Occasionally enemies will have their models go over scenery that they really shouldn't, it is most notable when they die.  Despite those flaws, the overall artistic design is stunning.Music is okay, nothing really spectacular, but it more than does the job.  For the most part, it is rather sparse and when it does come in it is typically light and unintrusive.  While this can feel immersive, it means that I wouldn't really say any of it stands out.Overall, it is a really good game, that seems like it could have been better with more time and money.  That said, it is probably the best singleplayer RPG in years and without a doubt the best throwback to the old infinity engine games on the market (although with Numenera looming on the horizon, that may be a better option long term).  8.5/10			"

												A game stripped off of the glamour of modernity does not always hit home. Next generation graphics and mechanics have always taken the industry to the next level. Every once in a while though there comes a rare jewel that makes us take pause -- makes us stop and revisit what was and see it in new light. Pillars of Eternity has done that for me so far. It has been a while since I've played a CRPG, and at first I felt it jarring to be taking the slower pace in gaming once more. But let's all admit that there is an undeniable pull for the old and time-tested models of the past against the flashy, glossy and cinematic titles of this day. It isn't anything ground-breaking mind you.  Pillar of Eternity is true-to-form to the way I remember Icewind Dale or Baldur's Gate were when I first played them years ago. There are, however, some modern fixes that make the journey more streamlined without breaking the nostalgic feeling of playing this sort of game. Settings and options make the game friendly to old fans and would-be followers alike. Sure the art is dated and often times may feel so limited -- but hey -- that's both the challenge and reward of opening such a treasure. I can't say much for the narrative save for the fact that there is a warm feeling experienced from reading through a lot of narrative texts and deciding on the next course of action of your personally crafted heroes and story-rich NPCs. And speaking of heroes - the game offers a lot of exploration in hero-crafting, offering alternative class types such as the Chanter and Cipher that is quite akin to the trinity-breaking hybrids of modern role-playing anti-molds.  The best advice I have if you're picking this up (about two years after it has been out and patched to death) is just play it without any of the distractions brought by the wikis and forums of the world. I think that that is the best dose of nostalgia titles like these bring to the table -- a time when you were just left with a game and nothing else mattered.			"

												Amazing game, playing it through the second time now that I picked up the DLC. The story is amazing and the combat is just difficult enough to be challenging and rewarding. A must have for any Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale fans!			"

												I bought PoE because I was interested in the story and, to be honest, because I was curious how similar the game was to the Baldur's Gate etc.I was entertained. True, I didn't care much for the story (the whole soul thing didn't strike my fancy, and the world and races simply didn't knock my socks off), but I was entertained, alright. On the one hand there was, of course nostalgia, on the other the game simply oozes the designers' lifeblood. You can feel it in all the little details and every line of text, from the dialogue to the virtual novel style elements. This is not a ""medal for effort"", though. Only a game that shows that the developers cared - really cared - can hope to be  good, or even great game and lately too many games are released that show quite the opposite. All in all PoE is worth playing; be it out of nostalgia, the love of role playing games or the respect for devs who actually care! However this is game is not the holy grail some people claim: it's nostalgia, first an foremost! If you loved Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape Torment you probably will feel right a t home in PoE. If you have never played one of those, chances are that you might find PoE not THAT fun and entertaining, especially if you are mostly used to RPGs that have been realeased in the last 5 years. On the other hand, you might like it anyways...			"

												An incredibly well-written game that is a throwback to classic computer RPGs.  As someone who missed out on Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale (curse you responsible choices!!), but played the Gold/Silver box D&D RPG games to death finding this game was a stroke of luck.  There is a lot to like, but what stands out is just the strong dialogue and sense of place this game creates.  This is one of the few games that I've played recently that I don't care very much about min/maxing my character, but instead I find myself reading the in-game books and looking forward to tracking down various side-quests.  I find myself reloading to see how a different set of choices would impact a particular side quest.  It is an engaging and atmospheric game...well suited for a leisurely play through.			"

There are plenty of ways to progress through the story, the majority of the NPCs that can join your party have wide ranging story arcs, the background and the world have been very well thought out and provide a rich setting to get into.

Makes me feel like PC not really getting stronger. Replayability works after coma, memory loss or some time.My satisfaction levels are at medium-high level.I wil return to play some more.Quality is suffictient.Best in small doses.

												As a Kickstarter backer, I have to say, I got my money's worth.  Pillars of Eternity really captured the feel of the old Infinity Engine games (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, etc), but modernized and improved.  The story isn't as strong as the Baldur's Gate games, but the world is unique and well realized (and the central question of the game was a welcome surprise).  It starts off a bit slow, and the NPCs you gather don't seem that interesting at first, but by the end they really grew on me. To the point that I felt guilty for not finishing one's quest.    The game manages to feel short, even after 60 hours of play - there are still several things I didn't do (and I would have appreciated a little more warning when I got to the point of no return for the end-game), and there are a number of extra missions that can be explored, several of which I failed to complete (and may go back and do, even if I don't re-beat the game). But overall, I was very happy with the game; they achieved their goal of reviving the style and adapting it to modern gamers.  There are still some niggling things they need to do (the filter on store items actually remove items rather than graying them out, better multi-step planning and visibility in battles), but those are minor flaws on an otherwise sparkling gem.

												Starts off really well when it give you that warm and fuzzy Infinity engine nostaligia feeling. Unfortunately the longer you play the buggier the quest scripting becomes. After about hour 30 you just want the blimmin' thing to be over though. The combat mechanics are also very suspect and it just doesn't quite work. I'd say that it is just barely a recommendation if you aren't quite sure what to expect and a solid recommendation if the old Infinity Engine games really float your boat.			"

												What I really love about it is that I can play for long sessions or for a quick session, completing 1 mission and saving my progress - and either way I'm satisfied. Each mission feels like a chapter of series, making this possible and feel okay to do. Being an adult with a business and family, this is a HUGE plus for me to find a game that is deep and complex, but also respects my time. I wish all games did this.

												Great cRPG. Story was intriguing, though the main & side quests weren't always as thematically connected as I would have liked. In particular, there's a sort of ""twist"" at the end (regarding the gods) that's almost never discussed or hinted at - and it really should have been. Still, minor gripe. The characters, while perhaps not quite reaching the level of some of BG2's or DA:O's companions (and the villain coming nowhere close to Jon Irenicus), had interesting personalities and dilemmas. Eder & Durance were my two favorites, though I'm sure mileage may vary.I was entirely satisfied with the combat system. You'll be pausing a lot (more on harder difficulties) to cast spells, drink potions, and change positions or targets. Aside from Chanter, every class felt powerful and useful, and I often had a hard time choosing between which companion I wanted to bring. What's especially nice is that every stat is useful for every class, so if you want to make a battlemage who's in the thick of melee, that's entirely possible and even encouraged by some of the wizard spells.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention some great innovations in combat as well. First off, D&D's ""attacks of opportunity"" are implemented via an engage system. Enter in melee range and you're engaged. Exit and you'll be hit by free attacks. This helps tanks tank, while also making enemies who can teleport into your midst even more dangerous. Second, the infinite-rest problem in other cRPGs is ameloriated by requiring you to spend limited camping spells in order to sleep. Some reviewers have complained about it, but I very much appreciated it. I had to be smart about using my skills & spells. At the same time, I never felt hugely limited. Many skills, for example, are actually usable a # of times per ENCOUNTER (rather than per rest).One area in which I felt let-down was the magic items. There's not much of a sense of progression. For example, I defeated this bad mafa dragon near the end of the game, but his items were mediocre. And the best 2H weapon in the game (a pike) is bought IN A STORE. Even beyond that, the items and their modifiers rarely felt unique. Nothing like getting Lilarcor or Carsomyr in BG2.All said though, it's great. I beat it without White March, and, frankly, am glad I didn't. I was ready to move on.DIFFICULTY RECOMMENDATION: I beat the game on Hard and some fights were quite difficult, especially a few near the beginning (I beat Raedric at level 4, with a party of 3, lawl). But I breezed through many more (especially near the end when I'd hit the level cap and optimized my gear). As such, I wish I had stepped it up to Path of the Damned. Thus, if you're a thorough completionist who enjoys difficulty (e.g. Dark Souls), I'd start with Path of the Damned. It'll be tough, but you're given the tools to overcome that toughness.			"

												50+ hrs played I waited till I hit the 50+ hrs point to write this review so that I had a complete feel for the game before I made any desessions about the game. All in all I give the game a 85/100. And the -15 is mostly just personal perference not things that are wrong with the game itself. Pillars is a great game with 100's of hrs of game play and a large amount of replayability. Of course you have to like playing with a team of six characters of different classes. I prefer games like Skyrim where you mostly play just a single player. Pillars has a great story line with a mostly open world and you get to chose what order to solve the quests you have. There is a large amount of treasure and items to be bought with nothing bring over powering. The game can be difficult at times. And I do wish they had put a level system in the journal so you know if the quest was to high above your level to complete. The 2 dlc's are a must. And should be bought at round lvl 7 and played before you finish the main game. You can go back to the main game after the dlc's and there is some great loot that can be used like better armour and weapons to give you a better edge also. another fun option in the game is you can have a Keep which you can upgrade and make your home. This is a great game. Read all the reviews you can and get it on sale even better. Also look at all the hrs a lot of people have spent playing this game. That was the biggest factor that told me that this was a good game.			"

The only thing they managed not to bring over is the bad pathfinding from those games. It's infinity style RPG in a fitting 2015 graphics fidelity, I assure you you'll be amazed. I was kinda late to the party but it allowed me to play the game at this moment with all the patches which improve the game by a lot. If you love BG/IWD/PST I assure you, you'll enjoy this game as well.

If I get thru the enemies guarding the areas, just show me the hidden answers to escape or whatever.  The combat is the best in any game of this type, the UI is intuitive.			"

Neither Steam nor Obsidian is offering any help in locating and denied a ""prorated"" refund of $45 of the $90 so I might be faced with a credit card dispute of the $90 unless I can get some support around here.  Buy basic version only!			"

												The game is alright. Hardcore sucks because the game mostly won't let you retreat from battle and puts difficult fights directly into easy storylines for comedic value I guess. You are probably suppose to memorize the game in normal because playing hardcore, which sounds about like chopping wood to me. The game play and story are alright. The voice acting is on point. The story is kind of childishly gritty - they try to make it seem rough by having drug abuse themes and birth defects as plot drivers might work for you. It doesn't for me.I had to butcher a party member in my hardcore game because they glitched into a wall and couldn't move. I could have saved and restarted, hoping for the best, but I didn't try that. All in all, I think this game is a great buy for when it goes on sale.			"

												If you're looking for a game that pulls you into a rich and intricate fantasy world, this is worth a play-through. It's got a lot of replay value, and it's pretty well written. I found it challenging in some areas, though that may just have been because I like to explore before leveling... The lore was in depth and interesting, the characters were well fleshed out, and I loved that my words and actions had an effect on how I was perceived by my companions. The story is solid.The only annoyance was the loading screen time, which was just a touch longer than I'd have liked, but even this wasn't a deterent. I recommend this game to anyone who loves fantasy stories and RPGs. The only way I could see this game being even more fun is if it somehow became multiplayer and my friends could join my party, but I can't even begin to imagine how difficult that would be for the dev team. This game is worth a shot, as I said before. Try to get it on sale, though.			"

												Great cRPG. Story was intriguing, though the main & side quests weren't always as thematically connected as I would have liked. In particular, there's a sort of ""twist"" at the end (regarding the gods) that's almost never discussed or hinted at - and it really should have been. Still, minor gripe. The characters, while perhaps not quite reaching the level of some of BG2's or DA:O's companions (and the villain coming nowhere close to Jon Irenicus), had interesting personalities and dilemmas. Eder & Durance were my two favorites, though I'm sure mileage may vary.I was entirely satisfied with the combat system. You'll be pausing a lot (more on harder difficulties) to cast spells, drink potions, and change positions or targets. Aside from Chanter, every class felt powerful and useful, and I often had a hard time choosing between which companion I wanted to bring. What's especially nice is that every stat is useful for every class, so if you want to make a battlemage who's in the thick of melee, that's entirely possible and even encouraged by some of the wizard spells.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention some great innovations in combat as well. First off, D&D's ""attacks of opportunity"" are implemented via an engage system. Enter in melee range and you're engaged. Exit and you'll be hit by free attacks. This helps tanks tank, while also making enemies who can teleport into your midst even more dangerous. Second, the infinite-rest problem in other cRPGs is ameloriated by requiring you to spend limited camping spells in order to sleep. Some reviewers have complained about it, but I very much appreciated it. I had to be smart about using my skills & spells. At the same time, I never felt hugely limited. Many skills, for example, are actually usable a # of times per ENCOUNTER (rather than per rest).One area in which I felt let-down was the magic items. There's not much of a sense of progression. For example, I defeated this bad mafa dragon near the end of the game, but his items were mediocre. And the best 2H weapon in the game (a pike) is bought IN A STORE. Even beyond that, the items and their modifiers rarely felt unique. Nothing like getting Lilarcor or Carsomyr in BG2.All said though, it's great. I beat it without White March, and, frankly, am glad I didn't. I was ready to move on.DIFFICULTY RECOMMENDATION: I beat the game on Hard and some fights were quite difficult, especially a few near the beginning (I beat Raedric at level 4, with a party of 3, lawl). But I breezed through many more (especially near the end when I'd hit the level cap and optimized my gear). As such, I wish I had stepped it up to Path of the Damned. Thus, if you're a thorough completionist who enjoys difficulty (e.g. Dark Souls), I'd start with Path of the Damned. It'll be tough, but you're given the tools to overcome that toughness.			"

												What a game! Or maybe ""what a world"" would be more accurate. Pillars of Eternity certainly pulled me in from the start. Oldschool Infinity Engine -style isometric CRPGs are the type of game that has long been missing from modern gaming. Now they're back, and in what a spectacular fashion!Get ready to lose yourself in the fantasy setting of Eora; a world full of juicy lore, masterfully written characters, and intriquing stories and plot. The writing is the highlight for me, because there's a lot of it, there's reactivity, there's philosophical stuff as well as political forces. The balance between reading and being involved in combat situations is a very nice fifty-fifty I'd estimate. My thorough playthrough of the game + both expansion took 130 hours.Speaking of combat, oh what a treat this old style tactical party management in real-time with pause. It sure has a lot of variables and micromanagement like positioning characters, pausing at every second to issue new commands or use different abilities - which might deter many players more used to action RPGs or simply not interested in micromanagement in their RPG combat systems, but I certainly love it all. Good news to players who struggle with or dislike this sort of combat, there are multiple difficulty settings, especially the Story Mode, which lets you learn the combat mechanics without being constantly overwhelmed.The art and environments are unlike any other, this is the hand crafted 3D into 2D style from the older CRPGs, but elevated into delicious levels of eyecandy. Top that with amazing spell and sound effects, good looking animations and the absolutely wonderful music and voice acting, and the experience is simply astounding.I love the adventuring from area to area on the world map, which depends on what direction you decided to exit to, brings freedom and excitement to going into new areas. I love the unique items, quests and NPCs that one encounters, so much cool stuff to discover. I love the party NPC characters that you can have adventuring alongside you, very memorable personalities, they feel very alive and I certainly started to care about many of them very quickly.There are so many details I could go into, so many things about this game I could gush about. But let me say it all in the simplest way I can: I've long held that my favorite game of all time is Baldur's Gate 1, this game is a worthy spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate 1, and I will go as far as to say, that Pillars of Eternity is now my new favorite game of all time.Highly recommended for RPG fans, especially fans of oldschool CRPGs.

												I was never a huge isometric RPG guy and missed a lot of the classics, like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. That being said, I've always been a fan of D&D and fantasy settings, as well as strong narratives. PIllars of Eternity delivers on this and more. The mechanics are fine-tuned, the plot is good, the writing is fantastic, the content is enough to give you information but not so much reading you go cross-eyed (unless you choose to talk to everyone or read every book).Above all, the game just has a great flow to it. It can be difficult but never '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t'. Some spells/abilities are better than others, but they are all fun to use (and you will use everything over the course of the game). The combat is pausible so you can play at your own speed, and the game looks great too.A fantastic purchase!			"

												I'm just going back for my second play through and I'm realizing (again) what an amazing game this is. I'd say this is easily the best CRPG ever, for me at least. Divinity Original Sin is close, but Pillars wins it for me. The combat is fantastic with plenty of options for how to build your party and play them. All classes feel equally (or nearly equally) viable - there are many ways to play each class, and the combat is challenging. The story and lore are the best - I'm not the type to get wrapped up in the books you pick up in games like Skyrim, but here I eat it all up. There is a TON of content here, especially with the two expansions (but 60-80 hours without, easy). The exploration feels so good too, I'm totally wrapped up in this game. I wish there were more RPG's like this, most can't keep my attention for very long. This one I'll play through multiple times.			"

												I'm editing this review so i'f you've viewed it before, you may wish to change your opinion. I'm still recommending the game though. My original review was shadowed by my inabilty to understand how combat works. After beating the game i still dont understand it. But after paying cash to reset my character and try 3 builds, the last one working the best I was ultimately less angered.Alright. This game has a good story. It really does, especially if you like thinking about what gods are. It is however very short on anything else story wise. Not that there arn't side stories here mind you. There are but ultimately it all kinda boils into the main storyline because like religion in real life it permiates everything else. Everything in the game is basically about the gods. Well anything really interesting anyway. Or its about the Egwithans and their crazy ancient stuff.Visually the game is impressive and very nice to look at. Character design is rather strait forward and easy to understand, at first. As time goes on I begin to wonder why there are so many options when it comes to building your character. So many options just seem.. not worth it and dont really seem to play a part in the story at all. I really cant put my tounge on why I do and dont like character building; maybe if they were to retool the various bonuses and things it would be better? The backgrounds are interesting but are really nothing more than additional choices in dialog here and there and with some updates they play more of a role in some quest choices and dialogs. Still though.. something in the way you build your character and just doesn't add up for me and all in all it comes off as unenjoyable.Character appearance feels like a side note for the game devs. I think the species look interesting, but there just isn't that many options on how your character will look. It almost doesn't even matter with the camera angel you play at. Still though it'd be nice to be able to have more options.The portaits are.. not good. They arn't I DONT LIKE THEM. There are mods that add more, i recommend using them. As they are basically the only way to make your character look different.I was dissapointed by the lack of story dealing with effecting the local governments. Sure you have a end game effect, but there isn't really much story dealing with helping or harming the local governments. I mean it seems at first that you might be, but you only real effect the second tribal government. Defiance bay has very little politcal intrique. Even working for the local mod is kinda boring. It also doesn't make a ton of sense when your party of six ""sneaks"" into someones home for one quest in particular only to immediately be discovered and have to kill everyone on that floor. How the people below you dont here their cries for help.. I dont know.The ending.. is actually good. I liked it a lot. I felt as if my questions were answered and I had many options to explore the paths and dialog options that led up to it. I enjoyed my bitter sweet ending through and through.Combat.. I have absolutly no idea what is happeneing in combat. Seriously.. I dont understand it. I just set the AI, click to start on a enemy or location to position my characters and occasionally I manually control my healer and my damage spell caster. Other than that.. I only really clicked on them to force party members to use potions or items or in very specific fights I would direct my main character to attack a specific person or use a specific ability. Seriously though, letting the AI run your party is almost always the best bet.The characters. I liked them quite a bit. Eder was one of my favorites with Durance being my absolute favorite above all else. Aloth is interesting but his quest line seems.. kinda boring? Even with the "" twist "" at the end. Speaking of companion story lines.. Eders was.. dissapointing And so was Durances. I really expected SOMETHING to happen with a hammer that may or may not have something to do with the gods. I also really expected Durance to do something about the truths he finds sometime before the game ended. Though I suppose what we all do with truth can be a very interesting thing.Over all I dont regret buying this game, because I had fun with it. It does feel short though, once you hit your stride and combat becomes less intense with a full party, one that has balance, you dont really need to pay a ton of attention, at first though depending on your build it can be rather unfair. Esecially if you dont just run strait to the first town and get some allies.The voice acting for this game is very good. I mean REALLY good. I can only say I WISH THERE WAS MORE OF IT. Because and lets be honest here.. who really read the entirety of every dialog box or even half of them? I know I didn't and I'll be damned if anyone else did either. There is a ton of reading here and while that isn't a horrible thing, it is a bit overwhelming. Making me often wish there was more voice work going on. I mean the voice actors are so damn good, i just wanna hear them talk more anyway.Visual interaction with the game. By this i dont mean its looks i mean when you do something in a cutscene where you have a choice to make something happen, more times than not its just a quick visual effect or someone dies or something like that. That aspect of the game feels less good and more meh.Effecting the world. Not all games have to effect the world the players runs their pc in. However.. who plays games like this and doesn't want to effect the world? You can and Do obviously by the end game... but I just feel like more could be added and made to better flesh out that part of the game.If you wanna see a review of mine that is totally nothing but rambling because i didn't enjoy a game and wanted my money back you can check out Age of Decadance review. I rant and rave and whine like the best of them.Pillars of Eternity is a good game and worth buying. Even if.. i could never beat that one dragon in that one.. VERY DEEP location.sry for typosEdit: Oh yeah the stronghold feels totally tacted on. Its cool sometimes and then boring later except for them lower levels, but it feels like a last minute addition or something along those lines. I really wish there was more to it. I've also not played the expansions. Something to keep in mind.			"

Pillars Of Eternity is a glorious also-ran. It is a flawed but ultimately worthy imitator of the great Baldur's Gate series, and a promising sign of things to come.If you are the kind of person who has purchased any of the recent Black Isle remasters from Beamdog, then let me tell you in no uncertain terms that you should go buy PIllars of Eternity right now. It is the nearest thing to Baldur's Gate II since Baldur's Gate II, and if that doesn't already make you champ at the bit, then let me tell you that its a darn good facsimile. If you aren't the kind of person who has done something like that, then the first thing you'll want to know is that Pillars of Eternity is an isometric party management RPG in the style of the old nineties and noughties games, complete with their beautiful writing, massive single player adventure, and difficulty. While you start off going through the familiar motions of building a character, Pillars of Eternity introduces a few new wrinkles that make it interesting. For starters, while all the familiar archetypes are represented, some truly weird and original character classes exist here, including the chanter who sings harmful and helpful chants, and the cipher, who wields eldritch power to corrupt and destroy the souls of your foes. All the classes feel suitably different, and at time of writing the balance seems to be fairly good across the board. Another thing that Pillars of Eternity does that will probably surprise newcomers to the genre is that every single stat has a direct and significant combat impact. There are no dump stats here and while this means min-maxers will probably be arguing amongst each other for months to come, it is now pretty tricky to gimp your character.You can also supplement your party of six adventurers by hiring characters you create from scratch at any inn. But this would be a mistake. The game includes 8 NPC companions, and you should do everything in your power to have all of them in your party at some point in the game as their writing and acting is so well done you would be robbing yourself of the experience by building a custom party of adventurers. This quality of writing extends to virtually everything else you'll encounter during the course of the game to boot, and it is consistently excellent from start to finish (with two minor and largely irrelevant exceptions which I mention below). Without spoiling anything, the world of Eora will seem immediately familiar to anyone who has spent any time travelling around Faerun in the Forgotten Realms, but it doesn't just feel different enough to be fresh - it's positively revelatory.Oh, and did I mention its gorgeous? The area maps are eye poppingly beautiful, and the characters actually animate splendidly, plus there are loads of cool spell and ability effects. In fact, sometimes they can even be a bit overwhelming. There were moments, especially early on when I was finding my bearings, where I couldn't tell what was going on in fights.The game also features a brand new, proprietary combat system that you'll need to spend a little time getting your head around. And I really do mean that, because this game is hard. Even on Easy or Normal difficulty (which you should probably stick to if you're the kind of person who only plays games once) you will sometimes find yourself badly overwhelmed at strange points as though the game was poorly paced. The learning curve is hardly gentle either, and even if you know your way around this sort of game, there are variations both intentional and unintentional that you wont anticipate in your first few hours with the game. It's a recipe for frustration, and while genre veterans are likely familiar with that feeling, if you're not used to that kind of abuse, expect Pillars of Eternity to test your patience from time to time. Still, the challenge rarely feels unfair (though make no mistake - there are some moments where it feels EXTREMELY unfair in some of the optional endgame content), and it is immensely satisfying to finally triumph over a difficult encounter.Partly this is because a job well done is its own reward, but partly this is because of the loot! And Pillars Eternity has a heck of a lot of it, and it comes in a pretty smooth progression that reminds me of the best moments of Baldur's Gate II, when you were excited to pick up the burning sword that the most recent boss left behind when he finally keeled over. And best of all, the game smartly does away with the old dumb system of playing inventory tetris, Pillars of Eternity allows you to have an unlimited number of items in your inventory in the form of a stash chest that is accessible at any time with a single mouse click whenever you bring up your inventory screen. For anyone who is used to juggling arrows and quest items, it feels downright civilized.The game is not perfect, however. Even after a patch designed to address it, the game features a strangely low level cap that you will absolutely hit. ""But wait,"" I hear you say, ""Baldur's Gate had a level cap!"" This is true, but it was one that you could only hit by importing your heroes and taking them through the game, and subsequent games abandoned them entirely. By contrast, you may make the unpleasant discovery that you are max level just around the time you really feel like you're starting to cruise. It's jarring and unpleasant, and it's best you're aware of it now.Further, a lot of the kickstarter stretch goal content is terrible. For example, early on in the game you encounter a stronghold which you capture and make your own. While it houses the biggest and best dungeon crawl in the game, it also features a stronghold building metagame that is deceptively terrible. The game is also awash in backer NPCs and memorials - NPCs and gravestones designed by kickstarter backers identifiable by their yellow name bars and tombstone icons. These are uniformly terrible, and you may make the mistake of wasting time reading through them when you first boot up the game. The serious player should regard them as unfortunate concessions to people who wanted to overpay for the game and ignore them completely. It is a real shame to think that these efforts could have been spent on shoring up the game itself.The only other objection I have with Pillars of Eternity is that it is just a little more segmented than it should be. In each Act you are gated on the world map in some ways that feel pretty silly, and while it still feels pretty modern, it lacks the freeform feel that the very best games in the genre had. Still, this is a minor complaint, and there is lots of great sidequesting and adventuring to be done.Overall, Pillars of Eternity feels like it has all the things that a throwback to one of the old greats should have, plus a few smart new inventions. It's actually a little short and content light by genre standards, as the game clocks in at around 40 or 50 hours for an leisurely, exhaustive completionist playthrough, and perhaps a little more than 30 for a more main-story-only run. But if we're being honest with ourselves, that's still a whole lot of bang for your buck, and oh boy, what a ride Pillars of Eternity is if you're up for its challenges.			"

												Pillars of Eternity was the first project I ever backed to. I expected a game with the detailed world and deep dialogues, game with interesting decisions and great story. And you know . . . I wasn't dissapointed.I can recommend this game for you if you don't look for 'incredible graphic and great physics', just for excellent gameplay.			"

												A journey of over 90 hours, could quite possibly be the best RPG I have played in years.  Draws heavily upon the IE games design but takes it with a modern touch, neither the gameplay nor the visuals feel archaic at any point along with offering  a decent challenge as a game.Definitely a high recommendation to anyone who have ever enjoyed a cRPG at some level.

												First of all, my general opinion of Pillars of Eternity: This game is a work of art. Seriously, it seems like every little thing in this game has been carefully thought-out and is there for a reason. But yeah, there are some bad things too. Not many of them though.First of all, the positives: The game is beautiful. The art style is pretty, the UI is functional, yet nice to look at. I especially like the illustrations which are visible in the cut scenes and the painted character portaits. The classes are not exactly boring standard fantasy stuff, instead they are some small, interesting aspects about every one of them. For example, the mage can only equip a small number of spells at any time, and he's also not able to spam them but has to think carefully if the fight is important enough to warrant the usage of spells. Although PoE is a old-school kind of game, there are many things which make a player's life easier. For example the fast mode and slow mode. No more waiting several minutes until your party is on the other end of the map, just turn on the fast mode! Another nice design choice: There is a really large crate the party is carrying at all time, which can be used to store all of the loot one wants to sell in the next city. Like said before, PoE is in the vein of those old-school-RPGs many of us loved as children. Siege of Avalon, Lamentation Sword or Diablo 1 - PoE has aspects of all of them, but with vastly improved graphics, handling and freedom of decision when it comes to quests. The battle system is turn-based, but it feels much more fluent and fast than, for example, the slow-paced battle system of Divinity: Original Sin. I also really liked the fact that the player gets a stronghold later on in the game, gives another little touch of strategy to the game. There are many small little things that, while not important, add quite some immersion to the game. The descriptions on items or enviromental objects, hidden caches that observant players can find, the small stories behind the characters in the world. PETS. The player can pick up certain pets from the ground and equip them. How cool is that?!Of course, there also are some negative aspects. The first thing that comes to my mind is the animations, especially those of the playable characters. They seem to start at the same time, so when you order your party to move it looks like a bunch of clones is running around. There are no differences in running animation depending on race or gender, which is kind of sad. Although it is expected from a game like this, the difficulty spikes can be a little too extreme. Sometimes the player is left to feel pretty frustrated because there are no quests to level up left, yet the boss fight is so hard that it's only doable by cheesing around (if at all). Additionally, the tutorial windows seem to forget a few important aspects. Maybe I'm just stupid, but - for example I did not know that one can hire customized mercs at the inn. I was running around with 2 characters, wondering why the fights are so hard. Sometimes the characters bug out in the battles and get stuck somewhere, although they could just move a few steps to reach the enemy. The game also has a few visual bugs, at times buttons are invisible and you've got to click where you think the button is.Overall, the positive aspects of PoE outnumber the negative ones and I'd recommend this game to every fan of old-school fantasy RPGs.

												Pillars of Eternity, what can I even say that has not been said about this masterwork.  Being a fan of Infinity engine games of old, ie Baldurs gate 1 & 2, Planescape Torment, Arcanum.  Among other non infinity games such as Neverwinter knights, Dungeon Siege ect.  This game is the glorious return of the infinity style isometric rpgs.True Strategic Combat,  every engagement in this game is dangerous, you can easily wipe your party against even the simplest of enemies, especially on Path of the Damned difficulty.  This game nails the pausable real time combat system from the days of old in a way Dragon Age Origins only dreamed it could.  This is the true sequel that the infinity engine games deserved back then when Bioware decided to go for the more casual approach.  A deep compelling story and companions.  Hundreds of pages worth of dialogue (some is even voiced)  deep conversation trees, meaningful responses, so far beyond a simple good and evil system a la Mass Effect or dragon age.  Each companion has real in game world beliefs, aspirations, interests ect.  I find myself dripping at the mouth for more, where in some other games I've found myself wanting to skip dialogue.  The world building is astounding and it sucks you in almost instantly.  Mature dark fantasy at its very best.  No shoe horned in sex scenes or cheesy lines can be found here.  The world is so well developed and so believable that I just cant pull myself away.I can't say enough good about this game really.  It is the true Baldurs Gate 3 that everyone has wanted for years, all shiny with a coat of new paint and modern game play improvements without leaching out the life that makes these games so loved.  When I compare this to an attempt like Dragon Age it's almost laughable.  Dragon age is the definition of streamlining, casualization and consolitus,  and even though Origins was a good game it really did destroy the line of games and turned them into something more accessible.  Pillar's does this in the right way instead.  It makes the game more accessible but not at the expense of difficulty or charm.  It's sure to spawn a fantastic new series, and will spearhead the renaissance of CRPGs.  Obsidian, along with other companies like Larian, with their fantastic Divinity Original Sin, and inXile with their Wasteland 2 and upcoming Torment: Tides of Numeria are proving that a game doesn’t have to be all about multiplayer and graphics, and that not every gamer wants their games easier with every new iteration.I played Dragon Age Inquisition,  the tactical camera made me want to vomit, its completely unusable, and the game has essentially devolved into a strategy-less third person hack n slash game.  Bioware, oh why have you fallen so far, Just take a few pointers from Obsidian here, they made the game you have been incapable of making for the last 20 years, and they did it right the first time.  If you are in any way a fan of RPGs or Strategy games, you woudl be doing yourself a huge favour by pickign thsi game up.  It's net even the price of a full game, and it has more content and depth than most 70 dollar games even dream of having.If you are a fan of Dragon Age or Mass Effect, I strongly urge you to pick this game up, and see how much deeper an RPG can be when the chains of mass market and console release are removed.  I guarentee you will not be dissapointed.It would be foolish to overlook Pillars of Eternity.			"

I could never get into Baldurs Gate(s), Arcanum, Planescape etc. but while this is very much like those for whatever reason I am able to get into this one (and even has me thinking I might give the others another solid go).  Anyway I did have to bump the difficulty up from normal to hard and then through iemod to path of the damned.  I don't think I am a min maxer but I guess going about the game in a completionist manner and making most of items etc. meant that it wasn't near as difficult as I feared (besides shades they were hard on any level}).

												Pillars of Eternity was designed from the ground up not only as a love letter to isomeric cRPGs of the past, but also as a continuation of that legacy. From the green character selection circles to the infamous 'You must gather your party' notification, anyone who enjoyed the Infinity Engine games will feel right at home, and still everything isn't just the same as it was. This isn't a remake or rehash: the classic intelligence and dexterity attributes have been tweaked to have more relevance outside of combat, the lion's share of level growth no longer comes from killing monsters but from conversation, reputation is made up several different expected character traits now instead of the single, universal number it was before. But still I felt compelled to collect and read every book I came across, speak to every person I came across (Even the jarring, overly Godlike backer-made NPCs), just like I did when first playing Baldur's Gate.  The world is new, but the feeling is the same, and what's changed has done so in an effort to better support that familiar experience. These improvements, however, can sometimes act as a double-edged sword. While each character that joined the party did so as a fully fleshed out person with their own motivations, those same motivations ask the unanswered question of why they were continuing to follow me on this death defying quest. Knowing many of them had their own important concerns elsewhere made it hard to imagine that they were all as interested in the approaching conclusion as I was. The game's storyline is similarly fully formed which leaves the end with a sense of finality. There's no cliffhanger here to breed anticipation for a continuation of the world. I'm left wanting more and not having any idea of how it will come about. That thought, that all the essential questions about the world have been answered, is troubling, but only if you assume there aren't any new ways to surprise us.			"

												More than 70,000 backers have placed their trust and their Christmas bonus in the Obsidian Kickstarter campaign for its initial ""Project Eternity""... And what a result ! Traditionnal RPG in all its splendor, with a deep and original universe, a great personnalisation of characters, class and talents which allow you to play or fight the way you want. The sound track is also really involving to me. Only played ten hours so far and I already can't make differences between the main and side quests for how interesting and depp all of them are.  What a pleasure it is to explore the huge variety of maps and to get lost in Eora's universe! Running on a system of active break, allowing a single press of the space bar to pend the action to study the ground and make your adventurers strategically ; there is also a possibility to programm the AI of your team to adopt a specific tactic which can be appreciable for the exploration random combats. Fortunately, this ode to nostalgia is offset by a very well thought out combat system, balanced between a resistance bar swhich can be increased by consumables, equipment or statistics separed from the proper life bar. Only small flaws for me would be the HUUUUUGE reading parts to describes actions and dialogs, that are certainly mastered and really well writen but sometimes also stopping the dynamism of a scene and quite tiring for the eyes after a few hours. Also ther are some pathfinding problems. Yep, that's it... Now running back on it!  "

												My original review of this game was negative. There were a great many things missing and just didnt warrant the price.Now I reluctantly give a thumbs up (6 or 7 out of 10) as i have returned to finish the game. Some great strides (bug fixing, party AI) make this a great buy on sale, but i think a more full experience requires the expansion (which are woven into the main story). Negative points for me:-Odd Design choices still (stuff like not being able to rename the animal companion or vanity pets or for 1 character to carry more than like 20 item icon (bag has X slots, small parties very loot unviable). Doesnt weigh heavily, but hard to swallow the tooltip importance of animal companion that is simply 'bear companion').-Loading screens. Just simply a lot of loading screens. Even with specs that crush the recommended on a SSD, they are just frequent. Load into the keep yard and go to the manor, load into the manor. Talk to someone with a problem, loading as it 'gets your companions' (faster fade to black transition than area). Load to leave manor, load to enter the inn. Load to go to 2nd floor of inn. Sleep transition, load to leave 2nd floor. Load to leave inn back to keep yard. Load to leave keep. I would estimate each screen around 3 seconds, so definitely not bad, but there are a lot of them. (i would estimate 30 seconds of loading screens for a quick visit to the keep for housekeeping. You can sleep from menus and avoid some of the screens, but the high horse of Role playing excellence and immersion gets much lower imo, but options are prefered).-Pay to win. There are two 15$ expansions that are woven into the main story line. Cool, but I am running into quests where ""you cannot achieve the noble/nicest ending here unless you bought the expansions"" and i think that is crap. Point in case is the Yenwood conflict. I absolutely adore Capt. Emery and you can certainly gain a respect and mutual understanding with her, but you will fight to the death unless you bought the expansions (if you bought the expansions, you can make good on the benevolent dialogue that she agreed with and not have to fight to the death). Something rubs me wrong about being forced to kill an NPC that I like and that likes my PC, but because I didnt buy the expansions yet, we have to fight to the death. I have no idea how many other outcomes are like this.			"

While there are a number of quality of life changes in the game system, it still has one foot planted firmly in the past.

												Play this game if you ever enjoyed Infinity Engine games of decades past.Are tired of the consolefication of RPG's? The easy mode that is most games these days, or the games that are straight console ports that give no design regard on to control a game? then play this game at leat once.The Good: This game is a well done copy of the interface that made games like Planescape, Baldur's Gate (I, II, SoA), Fallout great games of their time.  Graphically it is not going to blow you away, but the game still looks nice and I hope that it leads to more story driven game set in the same engine.The world is fleshed out and the writing is well done. The character options are diverse, even if at this time I do not know how much it will effect the story as I only have one play through.The combat is adequate. Easy difficulty provides a cake walk, Normal makes you think about a fight (but not have to min/max). Hard and PoD mode require to meta game. Lack of character AI means that on harder modes you need to make liberal use of formations and command issuance, but it did not feel like a burden on my first play through.The system they created does seem to create dead end characters that could happen in the D&D systems, but some combinations are more effective than others. The lake of restriction on armor and weapons makes this game much more variable.  Want a Wizard wearing plate armor? Can do. Want your fighter to use wands? Go ahead.Options in game to customize your game play are nice.  Do not want to have to go back to town and sell every 15 min? Enable access to your stash and adventure till you run out of camping supplies. Want to know if there are other options if you have high enough stats? Turn on that option.The system of the game is very well done and lays the ground work for future game set in the same system, all that would be needed is new art and writing.Now the bad:  The game is not BG2 level and it not fair to compare Pillars of Eternity with one of the greatest games of all time, but lets be honest we all hoped that this game would be BG3.The party NPCs are little bland and you do not form connections with them like BG2 managed.  The NPC;s do not seem to align themselves, none I would call evil and they all seemed (with one exception) ""good"" I hope my evil play through will change this perspective but I have not been able to yet.There is still game play bugs, thought not as numerous as I would have feared and hopefully patched out within a few months. Save often and not just with the quick save. "

Pillars Of Eternity is a glorious also-ran. It is a flawed but ultimately worthy imitator of the great Baldur's Gate series, and a promising sign of things to come.If you are the kind of person who has purchased any of the recent Black Isle remasters from Beamdog, then let me tell you in no uncertain terms that you should go buy PIllars of Eternity right now. It is the nearest thing to Baldur's Gate II since Baldur's Gate II, and if that doesn't already make you champ at the bit, then let me tell you that its a darn good facsimile. If you aren't the kind of person who has done something like that, then the first thing you'll want to know is that Pillars of Eternity is an isometric party management RPG in the style of the old nineties and noughties games, complete with their beautiful writing, massive single player adventure, and difficulty. While you start off going through the familiar motions of building a character, Pillars of Eternity introduces a few new wrinkles that make it interesting. For starters, while all the familiar archetypes are represented, some truly weird and original character classes exist here, including the chanter who sings harmful and helpful chants, and the cipher, who wields eldritch power to corrupt and destroy the souls of your foes. All the classes feel suitably different, and at time of writing the balance seems to be fairly good across the board. Another thing that Pillars of Eternity does that will probably surprise newcomers to the genre is that every single stat has a direct and significant combat impact. There are no dump stats here and while this means min-maxers will probably be arguing amongst each other for months to come, it is now pretty tricky to gimp your character.You can also supplement your party of six adventurers by hiring characters you create from scratch at any inn. But this would be a mistake. The game includes 8 NPC companions, and you should do everything in your power to have all of them in your party at some point in the game as their writing and acting is so well done you would be robbing yourself of the experience by building a custom party of adventurers. This quality of writing extends to virtually everything else you'll encounter during the course of the game to boot, and it is consistently excellent from start to finish (with two minor and largely irrelevant exceptions which I mention below). Without spoiling anything, the world of Eora will seem immediately familiar to anyone who has spent any time travelling around Faerun in the Forgotten Realms, but it doesn't just feel different enough to be fresh - it's positively revelatory.Oh, and did I mention its gorgeous? The area maps are eye poppingly beautiful, and the characters actually animate splendidly, plus there are loads of cool spell and ability effects. In fact, sometimes they can even be a bit overwhelming. There were moments, especially early on when I was finding my bearings, where I couldn't tell what was going on in fights.The game also features a brand new, proprietary combat system that you'll need to spend a little time getting your head around. And I really do mean that, because this game is hard. Even on Easy or Normal difficulty (which you should probably stick to if you're the kind of person who only plays games once) you will sometimes find yourself badly overwhelmed at strange points as though the game was poorly paced. The learning curve is hardly gentle either, and even if you know your way around this sort of game, there are variations both intentional and unintentional that you wont anticipate in your first few hours with the game. It's a recipe for frustration, and while genre veterans are likely familiar with that feeling, if you're not used to that kind of abuse, expect Pillars of Eternity to test your patience from time to time. Still, the challenge rarely feels unfair (though make no mistake - there are some moments where it feels EXTREMELY unfair in some of the optional endgame content), and it is immensely satisfying to finally triumph over a difficult encounter.Partly this is because a job well done is its own reward, but partly this is because of the loot! And Pillars Eternity has a heck of a lot of it, and it comes in a pretty smooth progression that reminds me of the best moments of Baldur's Gate II, when you were excited to pick up the burning sword that the most recent boss left behind when he finally keeled over. And best of all, the game smartly does away with the old dumb system of playing inventory tetris, Pillars of Eternity allows you to have an unlimited number of items in your inventory in the form of a stash chest that is accessible at any time with a single mouse click whenever you bring up your inventory screen. For anyone who is used to juggling arrows and quest items, it feels downright civilized.The game is not perfect, however. Even after a patch designed to address it, the game features a strangely low level cap that you will absolutely hit. ""But wait,"" I hear you say, ""Baldur's Gate had a level cap!"" This is true, but it was one that you could only hit by importing your heroes and taking them through the game, and subsequent games abandoned them entirely. By contrast, you may make the unpleasant discovery that you are max level just around the time you really feel like you're starting to cruise. It's jarring and unpleasant, and it's best you're aware of it now.Further, a lot of the kickstarter stretch goal content is terrible. For example, early on in the game you encounter a stronghold which you capture and make your own. While it houses the biggest and best dungeon crawl in the game, it also features a stronghold building metagame that is deceptively terrible. The game is also awash in backer NPCs and memorials - NPCs and gravestones designed by kickstarter backers identifiable by their yellow name bars and tombstone icons. These are uniformly terrible, and you may make the mistake of wasting time reading through them when you first boot up the game. The serious player should regard them as unfortunate concessions to people who wanted to overpay for the game and ignore them completely. It is a real shame to think that these efforts could have been spent on shoring up the game itself.The only other objection I have with Pillars of Eternity is that it is just a little more segmented than it should be. In each Act you are gated on the world map in some ways that feel pretty silly, and while it still feels pretty modern, it lacks the freeform feel that the very best games in the genre had. Still, this is a minor complaint, and there is lots of great sidequesting and adventuring to be done.Overall, Pillars of Eternity feels like it has all the things that a throwback to one of the old greats should have, plus a few smart new inventions. It's actually a little short and content light by genre standards, as the game clocks in at around 40 or 50 hours for an leisurely, exhaustive completionist playthrough, and perhaps a little more than 30 for a more main-story-only run. But if we're being honest with ourselves, that's still a whole lot of bang for your buck, and oh boy, what a ride Pillars of Eternity is if you're up for its challenges.			"

												First of all, my general opinion of Pillars of Eternity: This game is a work of art. Seriously, it seems like every little thing in this game has been carefully thought-out and is there for a reason. But yeah, there are some bad things too. Not many of them though.First of all, the positives: The game is beautiful. The art style is pretty, the UI is functional, yet nice to look at. I especially like the illustrations which are visible in the cut scenes and the painted character portaits. The classes are not exactly boring standard fantasy stuff, instead they are some small, interesting aspects about every one of them. For example, the mage can only equip a small number of spells at any time, and he's also not able to spam them but has to think carefully if the fight is important enough to warrant the usage of spells. Although PoE is a old-school kind of game, there are many things which make a player's life easier. For example the fast mode and slow mode. No more waiting several minutes until your party is on the other end of the map, just turn on the fast mode! Another nice design choice: There is a really large crate the party is carrying at all time, which can be used to store all of the loot one wants to sell in the next city. Like said before, PoE is in the vein of those old-school-RPGs many of us loved as children. Siege of Avalon, Lamentation Sword or Diablo 1 - PoE has aspects of all of them, but with vastly improved graphics, handling and freedom of decision when it comes to quests. The battle system is turn-based, but it feels much more fluent and fast than, for example, the slow-paced battle system of Divinity: Original Sin. I also really liked the fact that the player gets a stronghold later on in the game, gives another little touch of strategy to the game. There are many small little things that, while not important, add quite some immersion to the game. The descriptions on items or enviromental objects, hidden caches that observant players can find, the small stories behind the characters in the world. PETS. The player can pick up certain pets from the ground and equip them. How cool is that?!Of course, there also are some negative aspects. The first thing that comes to my mind is the animations, especially those of the playable characters. They seem to start at the same time, so when you order your party to move it looks like a bunch of clones is running around. There are no differences in running animation depending on race or gender, which is kind of sad. Although it is expected from a game like this, the difficulty spikes can be a little too extreme. Sometimes the player is left to feel pretty frustrated because there are no quests to level up left, yet the boss fight is so hard that it's only doable by cheesing around (if at all). Additionally, the tutorial windows seem to forget a few important aspects. Maybe I'm just stupid, but - for example I did not know that one can hire customized mercs at the inn. I was running around with 2 characters, wondering why the fights are so hard. Sometimes the characters bug out in the battles and get stuck somewhere, although they could just move a few steps to reach the enemy. The game also has a few visual bugs, at times buttons are invisible and you've got to click where you think the button is.Overall, the positive aspects of PoE outnumber the negative ones and I'd recommend this game to every fan of old-school fantasy RPGs.

												    So...it's time to give it thumb up, isn't it?    Something to note for those who aren't sure about buying this due to having ""potato pc"" - I played it on notebook with Intel HD 3000... It wasn't flawless fps-wise (common drops below 25) but working and since its not action-rpg it wasn't that painful.    Bear in mind my recommendation is based on game without expansion(s).     What to start with... ok, I would say this game fulfilled my expectation to some extend, not fully, but enough to not make me regret buying it. But still, there are some thing that could be done slightly better, so lets start with things I disliked:uneven difficulty level (regarding fights) - most of them are rather easy on normal difficulty and then you are facing one when whole party gets wiped out instantly... and I'm not talking about the final oneplot seems a bit hasty at the endgeneral map (when travelling between zones) doesn't provide information about nearby locations, you need to check every corner of the zone you are in to make sure you didn't skip something by accidentsome places seems ""opened"" a bit too early, not letting you take and finish quests you would later could have done with specific abilities/knowledgestronghold... it could have been so much better with more thing to do and some done better with prison being a waste and when you have prisoner, ransom offered for them is almost non-existing... and they can flee anywaycombat log sometimes doesn't provide necessary information, making you wonder how character got killeddescription of what's happening around character or how your interlocutor behave is sometimes a bit too long and sadly only few do described things regarding voice acting (like changing the way they talk for example)only 12 character levels in base game feels odd, but its probably me being used to D&D 2 and 3 amount of levelsfew times I felt there could be more possibilities regarding quests and dialogues, sometimes choosing diffrent option has the same resultreputation system isn't clear, ""huge increase in reputation"" (without any reputation before) makes you barerly ""neutral"" for city/village/group""stand-by"" companions are leveling up, but it's not shown in choosing screen for some reasonAI is a mess and with only few options avaliable    Now what I liked:character creation - it took me good 30-40 minutes to make up my mind what I want my character to be and it has its consequences the way character statistics work - its diffrent from standard Dungeon & Dragons approach and feels unique, but is clear how it worksmany approaches for quests with few possible outcomes and way they are handled (wish there were more ""witcher-like"" type of quests, where decision made have consequences later in the game)character reputation systemthanks to this above - lack of aligment system, you are not ""evil"" or ""good"", people will look at what have you done to judgefreedom of exploration (to some extend)main plot in general is quite interesting, especially the way its narrated; maybe not Planescape level but still way above the averageside quests feels importantwant companion with specific class? Create him/her just like your main character in innspecific way some encounters are held - with diffrent screen, appropriate artwork and few possibilities of what you want to dodiffrent places when you can met new companionsabout them - great voice acting (I liked especially Duran) and thanks God that translation didn't change voicesendurance and health instead of only health as resource like in most rpg's    In general - I wouldn't call this game ""Baldur's Gate 3"" because it isn't. It's something slightly diffrent - great story, unique way of handling character creation, ""mysterious"" past of main character...    I'm recommending this game for every fan of classic RPGs - from Icewind Dale, through Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights to Planescape:Torment. It's good 40-50 hours of gameplay on the first run with good replayability.			"

												I recommend this warily... I will honestly say the game was entertaining for a single playthrough. The story started off strong and engaging but grew weaker and felt more forced in the subsequent acts. The ending was terribly crafted; it made absolutely no sense and only served to highlight a slew of plotholes. The companions were unique and interesting but neither remarkable or memorable. Compared to other, much older games in the same genre, Pillars of Eternity's story and characters were extremely bland.As for gameplay, it was pretty standard, which is to say it did nothing really new and that isn't exactly a bad thing. There were some things I didn't like, none of which ""broke the game"" or were difficult to overcome, but were noticeably annoying. Such as...-They tried too hard to be different from D&D and make their own mark by creating a whole new system but you find yourself asking, ""Was this really necessary?"" Attributes are designed to be compensated for by gear and food but the only time you find yourself desperate for an attribute bonus is for conversation rolls (which was the only time I ever bothered to use food). Other than Mechanics and Lore, the abilities play their biggest role in conversations and interactive cutscenes.-The food system was completely pointless. Perhaps it plays a very defining role in harder versions of the game, but for a normal playthrough it was just an extra thing on the side you never thought about or needed.-The player defenses worked really well if the enemy wasn't better than you in the first place and really poorly if they were. Sometimes, they didn't matter at all. Will, for example, supposedly prevents you from being charmed. But I had guys will incredibly high will scores that got charmed every. single. time. And for enemy defenses, in the end, they hardly mattered. There were only a handful of fights that couldn't be solved by an abundance of traps, summoned creatures, and/or zerging.-The AI and engagement rules, which worked rather haphazardly. EXAMPLE: you direct your priest to go heal an ally. He runs toward the ally in need of healing and a mob barely backs into him. He immediately stops moving to heal the ally and begins attacking the enemy. Forget what I told him to do... mob must die... clearly he is contributing to the success of the group. Oh, now everyone is dead because the AI does what it wants. Clearly you must double and triple pause to reissue the same commands over and over because that's how a tactical game should operate.-Combat pathing was ridiculous. Once combat starts, characters can't seem to find their way around a damn rock in the middle of the street. ""GUYS, HELP! I'm stuck on this pebble! I can't hit the mob! I'm sorry you're all dying!""-The load times were inexplicably atrocious on a good computer.I know this sounds incredibly negative. I blame the ending entirely, as it just made all of my minor qualms explode into major ones. Had the game ended even remotely intelligently, I would have happily recommend it. As it stands, it was a fun experience up until the end, which ultimately ruined it.			"

												My original review of this game was negative. There were a great many things missing and just didnt warrant the price.Now I reluctantly give a thumbs up (6 or 7 out of 10) as i have returned to finish the game. Some great strides (bug fixing, party AI) make this a great buy on sale, but i think a more full experience requires the expansion (which are woven into the main story). Negative points for me:-Odd Design choices still (stuff like not being able to rename the animal companion or vanity pets or for 1 character to carry more than like 20 item icon (bag has X slots, small parties very loot unviable). Doesnt weigh heavily, but hard to swallow the tooltip importance of animal companion that is simply 'bear companion').-Loading screens. Just simply a lot of loading screens. Even with specs that crush the recommended on a SSD, they are just frequent. Load into the keep yard and go to the manor, load into the manor. Talk to someone with a problem, loading as it 'gets your companions' (faster fade to black transition than area). Load to leave manor, load to enter the inn. Load to go to 2nd floor of inn. Sleep transition, load to leave 2nd floor. Load to leave inn back to keep yard. Load to leave keep. I would estimate each screen around 3 seconds, so definitely not bad, but there are a lot of them. (i would estimate 30 seconds of loading screens for a quick visit to the keep for housekeeping. You can sleep from menus and avoid some of the screens, but the high horse of Role playing excellence and immersion gets much lower imo, but options are prefered).-Pay to win. There are two 15$ expansions that are woven into the main story line. Cool, but I am running into quests where ""you cannot achieve the noble/nicest ending here unless you bought the expansions"" and i think that is crap. Point in case is the Yenwood conflict. I absolutely adore Capt. Emery and you can certainly gain a respect and mutual understanding with her, but you will fight to the death unless you bought the expansions (if you bought the expansions, you can make good on the benevolent dialogue that she agreed with and not have to fight to the death). Something rubs me wrong about being forced to kill an NPC that I like and that likes my PC, but because I didnt buy the expansions yet, we have to fight to the death. I have no idea how many other outcomes are like this.			"

												It took nearly 15 years to finally get a proper follow-up to Baldur's Gate 2, but here it is. Having said that, times have-a-changed since the glory days of the infinity engine. While there are a number of quality of life changes in the game system, it still has one foot planted firmly in the past. This will probably rub some people the wrong way, (Vancian spell casting seems to invite a lot of ire for example) but POE's reverence for all things old will delight just as many people.			"

												Amazing!  A++  One of the best games I've ever played!I've been a huge fan of AD&D infinity engine type games like Baldur's gate and Icewind Dale since the first came out in the 1990s. I've played through every one that I could get my hands on and for about a decade now, I have been waiting on someone to release a game that continued the legecy, then I found Pillars of Eternity.The system is not a copy of the infinity engine.  It is quite different, but only in ways that either seem to make the game more convenient for the player. I could sit here all day and tell you how great this game is, but if you liked Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale, just play this game.  It's as close as you're going to get to Baldur's Gate 3.  The only negative mark I would give this game is for charachter creation. It's pretty good, but you don't get as many options as in some other AD&D type games. No multiple sub-classes for rogues, druids, or mages. However, your charachters are very customizable as you level, and the game makes up for this in many other ways.  "

It demands much more patience and imagination, and is so much richer for it.I absolutely love this game.			"

 Ending the main quest and some of the side ones took me 34 hours and I still feel like I've missed a huge part of the game. The lenght exceeds the price, making it a ""must check"" title. Keep in mind that difficulty is high in comparision with nowadays games. Often felt like it is unbalanced (bosses fights are much harder then the path to them).  Ending variations, multiple choices that actually make a difference, makes a good replayability. For Baldur Gates and other similar games fans - obligatory game.   Storyline is rock solid. Ideas are good - if I would read a book with that kind of plot I would be satisfied.  "

												Pillars of Eternity is a classically styled RPG akin to Planescape Torment and Baldur's Gate. It is a 2.5D isometric game that successfully capitalizes on what made those classic games good.In this case, what I really liked about Pillars of Eternity was its story. While I'm typically not one for fantasy settings, Obsidian did a good job at writing a story that kept me interested -- focusing on a central theme and running with it. Yes, it's still got those tropey races and classes. Godlikes are Tieflings in everything but name. Hobbits, elves, those kinds of generic things rear their heads. However, the game doesn't spend too much time focusing on those races, as much as it does on the idea of ""souls"".The combat mechanics are, honestly, none too amazing. But I came to Pillars of Eternity for the same reason I come to most Obsidian games -- satisfactory writing. And I got what I wanted. If you like a solid fantasy game with a well fleshed out universe, and good writing with great choice/consequence systems and replayability, give Pillars of Eternity a shot. I didn't regret paying full price for this game at all.			"

												    So...it's time to give it thumb up, isn't it?    Something to note for those who aren't sure about buying this due to having ""potato pc"" - I played it on notebook with Intel HD 3000... It wasn't flawless fps-wise (common drops below 25) but working and since its not action-rpg it wasn't that painful.    Bear in mind my recommendation is based on game without expansion(s).     What to start with... ok, I would say this game fulfilled my expectation to some extend, not fully, but enough to not make me regret buying it. But still, there are some thing that could be done slightly better, so lets start with things I disliked:uneven difficulty level (regarding fights) - most of them are rather easy on normal difficulty and then you are facing one when whole party gets wiped out instantly... and I'm not talking about the final oneplot seems a bit hasty at the endgeneral map (when travelling between zones) doesn't provide information about nearby locations, you need to check every corner of the zone you are in to make sure you didn't skip something by accidentsome places seems ""opened"" a bit too early, not letting you take and finish quests you would later could have done with specific abilities/knowledgestronghold... it could have been so much better with more thing to do and some done better with prison being a waste and when you have prisoner, ransom offered for them is almost non-existing... and they can flee anywaycombat log sometimes doesn't provide necessary information, making you wonder how character got killeddescription of what's happening around character or how your interlocutor behave is sometimes a bit too long and sadly only few do described things regarding voice acting (like changing the way they talk for example)only 12 character levels in base game feels odd, but its probably me being used to D&D 2 and 3 amount of levelsfew times I felt there could be more possibilities regarding quests and dialogues, sometimes choosing diffrent option has the same resultreputation system isn't clear, ""huge increase in reputation"" (without any reputation before) makes you barerly ""neutral"" for city/village/group""stand-by"" companions are leveling up, but it's not shown in choosing screen for some reasonAI is a mess and with only few options avaliable    Now what I liked:character creation - it took me good 30-40 minutes to make up my mind what I want my character to be and it has its consequences the way character statistics work - its diffrent from standard Dungeon & Dragons approach and feels unique, but is clear how it worksmany approaches for quests with few possible outcomes and way they are handled (wish there were more ""witcher-like"" type of quests, where decision made have consequences later in the game)character reputation systemthanks to this above - lack of aligment system, you are not ""evil"" or ""good"", people will look at what have you done to judgefreedom of exploration (to some extend)main plot in general is quite interesting, especially the way its narrated; maybe not Planescape level but still way above the averageside quests feels importantwant companion with specific class? Create him/her just like your main character in innspecific way some encounters are held - with diffrent screen, appropriate artwork and few possibilities of what you want to dodiffrent places when you can met new companionsabout them - great voice acting (I liked especially Duran) and thanks God that translation didn't change voicesendurance and health instead of only health as resource like in most rpg's    In general - I wouldn't call this game ""Baldur's Gate 3"" because it isn't. It's something slightly diffrent - great story, unique way of handling character creation, ""mysterious"" past of main character...    I'm recommending this game for every fan of classic RPGs - from Icewind Dale, through Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights to Planescape:Torment. It's good 40-50 hours of gameplay on the first run with good replayability.			"

												I recommend this warily... I will honestly say the game was entertaining for a single playthrough. The story started off strong and engaging but grew weaker and felt more forced in the subsequent acts. The ending was terribly crafted; it made absolutely no sense and only served to highlight a slew of plotholes. The companions were unique and interesting but neither remarkable or memorable. Compared to other, much older games in the same genre, Pillars of Eternity's story and characters were extremely bland.As for gameplay, it was pretty standard, which is to say it did nothing really new and that isn't exactly a bad thing. There were some things I didn't like, none of which ""broke the game"" or were difficult to overcome, but were noticeably annoying. Such as...-They tried too hard to be different from D&D and make their own mark by creating a whole new system but you find yourself asking, ""Was this really necessary?"" Attributes are designed to be compensated for by gear and food but the only time you find yourself desperate for an attribute bonus is for conversation rolls (which was the only time I ever bothered to use food). Other than Mechanics and Lore, the abilities play their biggest role in conversations and interactive cutscenes.-The food system was completely pointless. Perhaps it plays a very defining role in harder versions of the game, but for a normal playthrough it was just an extra thing on the side you never thought about or needed.-The player defenses worked really well if the enemy wasn't better than you in the first place and really poorly if they were. Sometimes, they didn't matter at all. Will, for example, supposedly prevents you from being charmed. But I had guys will incredibly high will scores that got charmed every. single. time. And for enemy defenses, in the end, they hardly mattered. There were only a handful of fights that couldn't be solved by an abundance of traps, summoned creatures, and/or zerging.-The AI and engagement rules, which worked rather haphazardly. EXAMPLE: you direct your priest to go heal an ally. He runs toward the ally in need of healing and a mob barely backs into him. He immediately stops moving to heal the ally and begins attacking the enemy. Forget what I told him to do... mob must die... clearly he is contributing to the success of the group. Oh, now everyone is dead because the AI does what it wants. Clearly you must double and triple pause to reissue the same commands over and over because that's how a tactical game should operate.-Combat pathing was ridiculous. Once combat starts, characters can't seem to find their way around a damn rock in the middle of the street. ""GUYS, HELP! I'm stuck on this pebble! I can't hit the mob! I'm sorry you're all dying!""-The load times were inexplicably atrocious on a good computer.I know this sounds incredibly negative. I blame the ending entirely, as it just made all of my minor qualms explode into major ones. Had the game ended even remotely intelligently, I would have happily recommend it. As it stands, it was a fun experience up until the end, which ultimately ruined it.			"

												I must recomend this title. Being an avid fan of Baldur's Gate, IWD and Planescape Torment i bought this one a year ago and i never got to play it until now.Lazy me, the setting is new, i didn't find the time or patience to dive into it. With the recent 3.0 patch i decided to give it a go. The game starts slow, very slow. It gives you the time to learn about this new setting and savour the world it takes place in.It really is a modern Baldur's Gate 2 with a bit more exploration (the thing i like the most about BG1), The characters seem a bit hollow at first, after all they don't banter much between them. Until you get to advance on their stories, that is. I came to write this review after one of my companions shared a little secret (not spoiling it) with my character.The combat requires a bit of getting used to, i think it's a great improvement over the past IE games. Very tactical, be sure to use pause a lot and try to get the hang of all the different companions AI settings (which are not perfect btw).I'm only 20 hours into the game and it really has surprised me in a very positive way so far. Very good, congratulations, devs!			"

												As a HUGE fan of the early Infinity Engine games I was seriously looking forward to Pillars of Eternity. An old school isometric cRPG? Heck yes I'm in!  Evern if it's a fraction as good as Baldur's Gate or Shadows of Amn it will still be amazing. Like Icewind Dale back in the day.I was a bit worried that Obsidian (formerly Black Isle) would botch this like so many other games in their back catalogue but after about 20-something hours it seems my fears were unfounded. The writing is pretty good and at times really hit home with the imagery they presented in text. The background lore is fairly interesting and the writes did a good job of creating a world with a rich past and interesting conflicts and inhabitants. My only real qualm with the dialogue, writing, and conversations was the voice acting. Sure, hearing recognizable voices was fun but the talking ruins it for me. I want to read not listen. I can read faster than you can talk and give you accents of my own imagining! Gah!The combat is very similar to Infinity games, closer to Icewind Dale II than Baldur's Gate though. Per encounter / Per rest abilities spice things up while you're playing a figher, ranger, or barbarian compaired to BG. The caster classes and spells are all interesting and visually pleasing. I found the difficulty level fairly tame, even on Hard and Path of the Damned (Pillars hardest), but that comes with many years of playing tactical RPG's I think. If you're new to this type of genre you might want to steer clear of anything above Normal.Graphiclly it looks much like other Unity Engine games. Shadowrun Returns, Divinity:OS, and Wasteland 2 all share the engine with Pillars and it's easy on the eyes and I believe Pillars did a better job on scenery than the others. The towns, cities, and wilderness areas are all beautiful. This is a great game for any cRPG / Infinity Engine enthusiests and highly reccomended. If you enjoy a good RPG in general you might want to check this one out.			"

												As somone who has never played any of the Baulder's Gate games (or other similar games), I had no idea what to expect from this game. I decided to take the risk and go ahead with purchasing it anyway. That ended up being a great decision.The story is fantastic and the characters are great. There are a few potentially game-breaking bugs, but none of them drew from the enjoyment of my first playthrough ( and I am sure there will be more in the future).			"

												I never played any of the original infinity engine games, and this makes me think I seriously missed out.While so many games these days lean towards making you feel like you are in an action movie, this is more akin to an interactive novel. It demands much more patience and imagination, and is so much richer for it.I absolutely love this game.			"

												Modern RPG's have lose something through all the top notch shaders, CG, and innumerable DLC's. They lost their soul. This game feels like any one of the original infinity engine games I would have been playing in the ninties, but with a modernized interface that provides the level of accessibility you'd expect to find this day in age.What sets this game apart is simple: the writing.

You'll want to pick an option, but when you really examine the reasoning for both sides of an argument, you'll have an honest moment of moral dilemma. That is something I haven't felt in decades. Most games will slap labels of paragon and defiler on any action you take, complete with pictures and color coding as if you were too stupid to really figure it out. There's a point in which the agency of a system is made so crystal clear that it practically insults the player for not having the wit to determine their own moral code.Playing Pillars is a rich and rewarding experiance that provided deep player agency, and conveyed a rich plot. Near the end you'll have that revelation, notice the line being drawn between characters and other components of the story, and you won't get that from another EA mass produced garbage RPG.			"

												I didn't play Bauldur's Gate (yet). So, reviewing without any bias, I can say it is a great game for RPG fans. I played D&D (pencil and paper) since I was 12, so for me is almost a dream come true (because the game does not follow D&D rules, of course). Nonetheless, incredible game, with great story and mechanics. If you ever wanted to try what true RPG is, well, this game is perfect for it. Buy it, and don't give up until playing at least 6h. You will be addicted then (and yes, it is supposed to be difficult, but you can choose 'easy' from the level options =D).Also, I can't wait for Sword Coast Legends! Bet it will be just as great, and with the D&D rules I'm used to!			"

												Great classic RPG with interesting battle system, story, world and wonderful graphics. I was really captivated by the setting, enjoyed the dialogue system that gave different options based on my stats and reputations.Game’s own leveling system is quite distinctive from Dungeons & Dragons you may got used to, but I think it’s really good – I felt there was no bad class and each level up was a delight for me, when I was able to choose from many interesting perks/abilities to customize my Orlan Monk.The game is quite long - I clocked almost 70 hours and I haven't even completed the second DLC, so I estimate the main game to last for ~60 hours. I think it could be shorter - it was getting a little bit stale at the end - but that's a minor complaint. It was mostly due to fights becoming too easy/predictable. I played on HARD and at first the game was really challenging for me. I had to carefully position my team mates and use active pause a lot. But after some point it got easy - I think DLCs might have upset the balance a bit - even though I always chose ""scale enemies to your current level"" option, when such option was presented.If you like classic cRPGs – it’s for you. Heck, even if you haven’t played cRPG before – it’s one of the best games to start. "

												I must recomend this title. Being an avid fan of Baldur's Gate, IWD and Planescape Torment i bought this one a year ago and i never got to play it until now.Lazy me, the setting is new, i didn't find the time or patience to dive into it. With the recent 3.0 patch i decided to give it a go. The game starts slow, very slow. It gives you the time to learn about this new setting and savour the world it takes place in.It really is a modern Baldur's Gate 2 with a bit more exploration (the thing i like the most about BG1), The characters seem a bit hollow at first, after all they don't banter much between them. Until you get to advance on their stories, that is. I came to write this review after one of my companions shared a little secret (not spoiling it) with my character.The combat requires a bit of getting used to, i think it's a great improvement over the past IE games. Very tactical, be sure to use pause a lot and try to get the hang of all the different companions AI settings (which are not perfect btw).I'm only 20 hours into the game and it really has surprised me in a very positive way so far. Very good, congratulations, devs!			"

Posted: February 23, 2016
												I have never played any of the classic RPG’s such as Baldur’s Gate or Icewind Dale (but I know now that this was a huge mistake). So if you’re looking for a Review from someone that isn’t biased by nostalgia, you’ve come to the right place.I’ve been a gamer for 20 years now, and I can say without hesitation that “Pillars of Eternity” is one of the best crafted games I have ever come across. You really feel the love and passion that went into it. You find it in the story, in the characters, in the beautiful maps and dungeons full of lovingly crafted detail, in the wonderful music and in the voice acting. There is nothing about this game that isn’t great. But let’s get into a little more detail…First the story and writing. More often than not the stories in PC games are just there to hold everything together as opposed to telling something worthwhile. Not so in PoE. Here the story is really good and worth exploring. It’s dark and sad, has many emotional and dramatic moments, twists and revelations, interesting characters, tons of really good dialogue and a great conclusion. It never feels like the quests that move it along where there first and the story then spun around them. Rather the quests fit into the story very naturally and never seem forced or misplaced. But it’s not just the main story that is worth exploring. You will also find many sidequests, some small, some a bit bigger, that tell all kinds of interesting little stories. Some sad, some funny, some dark, some light, but almost all of them are worth your time.And then there are the books and the souls you can read. And I really recommend doing this! Yes, there is some redundant stuff there, but you will also find some really great little stories or insights about the world and its history. Especially within the souls you can reach out to. Man is there some great stuff there! Some gave me goosebumps, some made me sad, others where funny, and some unsettling, and I rarely read one that wasn’t worth it. The writing overall is excellent for story and dialogue alike, which is a good thing as there is A LOT to read in this game ;-) The characters you meet are well designed and consistent, worth talking to and learn their history. This is especially true for the companions that you can pick up as you travel around. The game does give you the option of creating your own party members but I would really recommend against doing that. Yes you can probably create more effective characters than those you will find on your travels, but then you would miss out on so much great content. All companions offer quests that you can follow, additional insights into the world and the main quest and tons of dialogue to explore. And they banter among themselves which at times can be really funny. The developers really did a great job bringing those characters to live. I just can’t imagine playing the game without them as they just add so much to the experience.As for the game world, again, just excellent work through and through. The world of Eora is deep with rich history and lore. It’s a place of wonder, beauty and adventure, laced with hardship and horror. And the visual representation on the screen is just marvelous. The maps are beautifully designed, filled with tons of detail and are really worth the time it takes to explore every little corner. Sometimes I would just sit there for a moment and marvel at the beautiful landscapes, buildings, ruins or creatures. And all of it is perfectly accompanied by an absolutely beautiful soundtrack that creates a great atmosphere.The games mechanics are also just excellent. I really love how the classes are designed and how they level. Finally a game where you are forced to specialize and cannot max out everything on every character. Once you choose a class you are stuck with it, once you define your characters attributes, that’s it, you can’t raise them further except through enchantments and temporary bonuses. And skills get really expensive on the higher levels, forcing you to specialize your characters as you will only be able to max 1 to 2 skills on each one. Also each class gets special talents and abilities unavailable to other classes. It really forces you to play each character differently and compose a party out of different classes that complement each other. You will need fighters, you will need a priest, you will want a wizard and so on. Every class brings something important to the party and its really just the right mix that will decide how well your party does in battle. The system feels well balanced and plays very naturally, and exploits are near impossible. As a result, combat is very complex and tactical. It starts with the right deployment before battle and choosing the right weapons and spells for what you are about to face. Then once battle starts it’s all about timing. For example spells need time to cast, so if we’re talking about area effects you have to aim them where the enemy will be once they fire, not where the enemy currently is. Or casting a targeted spell on an enemy that gets killed by another party member in the time it takes to cast the spell probably isn’t such a good idea either. You will be pausing a lot, give commands, look at all your options, considering the next move and so on. And you will be reloading a lot! Trust me on this, you will wear out the quicksave and quickload buttons on this game, even on normal difficulty. And don’t get discouraged because your party gets utterly wiped out without the enemy even breaking a sweat. It doesn’t mean necessarily that your party isn’t strong enough, it may be just because of flawed tactics or wrong choices during battle. Try again with a different approach and things may take a different turn. I had battles where my party got annihilated on the first try but finally managed to do just the same to the enemy once I figured out the right tactic and got the timing right. And I can tell you it is a highly rewarding experience. Combat in PoE requires a lot of thinking and effort, but it’s worth it!Is there anything bad about PoE? Well, not really. I can’t find anything wrong with this marvelous game except a few minor things that aren’t really worth mentioning. But for completeness I will talk about them as maybe for some they are not so minor.One thing I noticed and found mildly annoying is an issue with the voice acting. Now I’m perfectly ok with the fact that not all dialogue is voiced. Hell I would also be fine with none of it being voiced. What annoys me a bit however is that there are a lot of conversations where part is voiced and part not. So a character may say something that is voiced, then the next thing he says is not, and the next after that is voiced again. I can’t really put a finger on the reason for this. It seems that fixed dialogue is voiced and dynamic dialogue is not, but I’m not entirely sure about it. Doesn’t matter really what the reason is, I find it a bit distracting.The other thing would be loading screens. Since the game is broken up not only into exteriors and interiors but also the world is broken up into many small maps that you travel between rather than just one lager map where you can roam free you will see a lot of loading screens. And the farther into the game you are, the longer you will see them. Now I have a machine which is really geared towards fast loading using high performance hardware and SSD only, and I find it already a little bit annoying at times. So on computers that are less optimized in terms of loading speed it might be a bigger issue.But as I said, to me these really are just minor annoyances. “Pillars of Eternity” is a fantastic game that I can’t recommend highly enough. If you like roleplaying and are not scared away by an old school approach at presentation and don’t mind having to read a lot then this is really worth your time.			"

And I am short-sighted so when you show me a wall of text I just start mashing the spacebar.And I though the HAMMER OF GOD CRUSHING EVERYTHING AND KILLING AND YOU KNOW EVERYONE IS DEAD would be better that a knife I stole from someone's kitchen and then applied couple of enchantments on it, but apparently my character prefers knives because I made him like this.And these battles. There are so many enemies in the game so I could easily get bored if there were no other options than fight them all. Also bosses. First you get kicked in the♥♥♥♥♥so hard so you start thinking that this is impossible. But then you use couple of abilities on certain enemies and the battle kind of ends by itself in your favor.And the secrets. I had to check all the places I've been again after I've recruited the character with high Perception. Turned out there are many things that just hidden.And these options in the conversations. What do you mean [Monk]? So my badass barbarian can't use this option and I need to start playing by other class?!I am lazy. The game is just overwhelming.			"

												Well...Oh man. I'm a huge fan of top down RPGs, and the Baldur's Gate series let me run wild with that and manage a party of 6 built badasses. This product, this game here is no different and it draws on all the great things from it's predecessors while simultaneously remaining new and vibrant. unlike it's cousins it is not multiplayer, so you'll likely be campaigning solo and is probably it's biggest drawback for me. Graphically it's amazing, and VOs and ambience is fantastic. As someone who did play them a lot, it's nice to see one made with some real graphical cheese. It's so pretty, and I love the little bits of continuity, like weapon sets being shown on your character when a different one is in use.The pause break form of combat is great here, swapping between all the pieces at your disposal and assigning combat actions, with the introduction of some scripts that actually help in managing all your casters somewhat (still prefer casting things myself though).I waited for months to buy it, missed its most recent sale, and I do not regret a single thing.10/10 easily			"

												As someone who grew up playing fallout 1/2 and diablo 1/2 I've been lost for a decade with all the terrible remakes of our old classics or dissapointing sequels (diablo). Path of exile being one of the few good games we've had, but for what PoE added in good game mechanics is lacked effort in character building and story.Pillar has EVERYTHING, from huge ammounts of effort into each quest, great voice acting that actually adds to the whole experience, i didn't just sit there groaning the voices completely ruined any immersion.  It has a dead catA REAL DEAD CAT! which you can have as a pet may i add, killing feral children, stealing a gem then warning the owner his gem is under threat of being stolen, Going to kill a crazy lord then changing your mind and killing the person who sent you... this game is truely open to play HOWEVER you want. Each class feels unique, combat is fluid and difficult enough to challenge even hardcore rpg veterans. If  I could sacrifice my first born to get a sequel to  this game, i would go out and fertilize every willing subject.			"

												What can I say really? Um, how about... THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING STUPIDLY FUN.  Its crazy how it pulls you in, at times the storyline is meh but most of the time its really good.  I have beaten it twice once on normal and then again on path of the damned.  POTD was hard but only at the beginning, with good custom NPCs, you can still crush the bad guys at the end.  I did things totally different with each time I played it and the endings changed and the stories mid game changed and the quest items were different.  I am really really impressed by this game and I cannot wait for the expansion to come out.  I beat this, then said ok time for wasteland 2, after a few hours Im back at pillars.   then i say ok something new time for Divinity, then after a few hours its back to pillars.  I can't get away.

												50 hours into this game feels like the right time to start a review. The fact that I'm 50 hours in and yet have barely scratched the surface of this excellent game, should tell you something about the size and density of this nostalgic throw back to the Infinity games of yore.The first thing likely to strike you will take place in the character generation screens. It's easy to get so involved in this process that an hour will easily flick by. I can think of few games since the Baldurs Gates series or Icewind Dales that have had that effect, perhaps Skrim or Morrowind, but again this just proves the richness of the characters and backgrounds on offer here.Once into the game proper I felt instantly transported to the Baldurs Gate and Torment era. A little further scratching showed that whle POE has stayed true to those great games it does not feel like a game of that generation. Indeed Obsidian have managed to create a modern and innovative RPG that feels just as right in 2015 as would have in 2000 at the height if the Infiity engine age.To name just a few of the things on offer here, player choice, great NPC interaction, a rich and diverse world and an even richer and diverse story. So far I can't find a lot to fault. If I had to come up with one negative it could be that I will struggle to go back and play the likes of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale again, as finally they will feel aged and matched, if not bettered, by a modern RPG.

												Two very happy thumbs up. All that the Baldur's Gate series had to offer in an updated, revised and improved package.  The rules set they have developed here is better than D&D, the classes, more varied.  Everything I was looing for and many things I didn't know i was looking for. Well done and you have a customer for any expansion you plan to create.			"

												If you are a fan of CRPG's from the 90s into early 00's, then you will likely enjoy this game.  I have not had this much fun playing a CRPG since Planescape: Torment.The game feels like a classic Infinity Engine game (Baldurs Gate, Planescape Torment, Icewind Dale), but revised with modern graphic capabilities.   Some of the best gameplay improvements are:* Half Speed Movement* Double Speed Movement* Inventory Stash to remove inventory management mini-game (easy access can be disabled for the truely hardcore)* Removal of need to monster grind for levels by eliminating XP from monsters after a certain amount of kills of that monster type.  The XP focus is now on initial kills of a monster type and Quest experience.Here are some other gameplay change that you may or may not like. I find that they streamline the game over D&D type rulesets:* Trap Detection / Trap disarmement / Picklocking all covered by same skill: mechanics* Mechanics is a skill that any class can learn, so it is no longer mandatory to have a rogue in order to cover the above thief like actions.* Some spells/skills can be used a certain number of times per combat* mage/priests can cast a certain number of spells of each level per 'rest'; mages can only select 4 spells per level* AoE spells have 2 ranges, an inner range that can target both friend and foe, and an outer range that only can target foes.  In addition some AoE spells are listed as foe-only and can not harm friendly characters.  Stats can increase the radius of an AoE spell.I highly recommend this game for anyone who was a fan of the RPG classics from the 90s and early 00's.			"

												Honestly, this is THE best RTS game I have ever played of ANY genre. It doesn't feel like the characters are just randomly hitting enemies at uncertain rates; it actually feels like dungeons and dragons-type strategic fighting without suffering the boredom of waiting for turns to end. The story is amazing too. However, don't get this game on Steam unless it is $20 or less; it costs that much if you buy it from Amazon or something online! ;)			"

												Loving this game. I couldn't ever get into Baldur's Gate or the predecessors to this flavor of RPG. I always needed a more tactical approach ( Tactics, Banner Saga, etc ) but with the encouragement of a few friends I grabbed Pillars and have been playing my face off. It really feels like I'm playing D&D and I am definitely going to need to play through a few more times.			"

												I picked this up on a whim and a super quick Google search for ""Games like Baulders Gate.""  BEST Unplaned purchase I have done on Steam.  The game really gets it right.  It scratches that old BG itch and then some.  Beautiful graphics, great sound, and an easy to pick up and play system.  After my impulse buy, I just sank 10.2 hours into the game during a busy NHL playoffs day.  It's that good :)  So far my only complaints are1.) Almost too many spells for Mage types (But honestly, since when is abundant choice a bad thing?)2.) The screen can get crowded with enemies, making the action hard to distinguish.I pray that they will be making a sequal, the game is so good I want to see this become a franchise or at least carry the game system over to a new ip.9/10 would buy again.  Would suggest it to my friends.  Would skip work to play.  Did get yelled at by wife for ignoring here while playing.			"

												I actually Kick started this back when it was first announced and I do not regret doing so. If you are familiar with Baldur's Gate 2 and enjoyed it then you will love this game. It feels very familiar and yet brings a lot of new things to the table along with improvements. Even if you are not familiar with Baldur's Gate 2 you will still enjoy this game. The combat is almost exactly the same as Baldur's gate, it's an Action RPG where you can pause mid combat (similar to the modern Bioware games such as Mass Effect etc.). It is very challenging and it actually forces you to think which weapon type and which spells to use on each different enemy. Another great thing about this game is that it really is open, in the sense that there are multiple ways of completing a mission. As an example there is a certain area that you need to enter but it has been sealed off and it guarded by 2 guards. You can either:          1. Kill them and enter anyway          2. Bribe them and enter          3. Go to their boss and gain his favour to allow you entranceThere might be more ways that I haven't come across, but that's just one example. Not to mention this game has mods on steam workshop. Since it is a recent release, it won't have as many mods at the moment, but give it a bit of time and look at the mods coming in. I personally love the endurance mechanism during combat that replaces your health so that when you endurance drops to ""0"" you are unconcious but once the combat is over you are back up again, but with some sort of injury the second time your health drops below ""0"" you will die however unless you rest. Unlike BG2 you can't just rest as many times as you like, you need to have camping equipment and you can only carry a maximum of 5 at any one point. Though it's not all great. Some people have been complaining about the speed it takes to load a game once you are quite far in to the game. Personally I don't have a problem with it as back in the day the load times generally were really slow anyway. The other problem is that I feel that there is just too much talking about things that I feel are not really that important to me. I mean sure lore is important, but too much of reading will bore the game, especially when it is not directed to me. My personal issue with the story is there are moments when you can actually choose an option about your past of why you did something or who someone is exactly. (i.e. relative, partner friends etc.) And I feel like that freedom shouldn't be given because the story then feels fabricated rather than customised to you. So overall the story can use some improvement, but that still doesn't mean that the story is bad. It can definitely use some more voiced over lines though, compared to modern games this one is lacking in that area. Though again if you compare it to BG2, PoE feels like it has more voiced over lines despite being a smaller game. Overall I would give it a 8/10. I would have given it more had it not been for the amount of unnecassary lore that was forced fed.			"

What more could you ask for in a good RPG? The second age of CRPGs has arrived, and while it may have started with a few titles that were hit or miss, Pillars of Eternity throws the gate wide open with a bang.

Posted: April 11, 2015
												I would like to write a review much earlier, but I thought that it would be better to finish the game first so I can give people who read this a more complete opinion about it. I am a gamer of an older generation and a backer of this game, and I believe that this definitely influences my opinion about this game. Since this game was announced I like the idea of a kickstarter project by one of the best companies in the creation of RPGs . I hate to speak like an older generation, especially in such a thing like games which is mostly destined for young people. but:Even if I wasn't a great fun of Baldur's Gate, I miss the depth and the beautiful stories of games I was playing ten or twenty years ago. New games have graphics and use technology that we, older gamers couldn't even imagine that it would ever exist. The first game I have ever played was in my uncle's Amstrad and there I could control a hero made of less than ten pixels, let alone the limited number of colours of the computer screen (less than 16 in comparison with thousands today). Today's most games are full of great cutscenes which are technologically laudable. Does this make them better games than the older ones??? If you are a gamer of a younger generation you may be used to high technology graphics, so it may be difficult for you to play an older game. For the same reason you may not like Pillars of Eternity. The graphics are certainly of the last decade and not this one, it looks like a game created in the end of 2000's. Does this mean that the graphics do not lookl good? The answer is no. They try to compensate for not being high-tech bY BEAUTIFUL HAND DRAWN BACKGROUNDS AND BEAUTIFUL ARTWORK. the design may not be that of high technology but it EMPHASISES ON LOOKING BEAUTIFUL AND NOT BEING ONE OF THE MOST RECENT TECHNOLOGY IN GRAPHICS. IT LOOKS GOOD IN THE EYE WHERE A LOT OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY TRIPLE A's FAIL. This is is why I give an 8/10 in GRAPHICS.Another relevant you would like to consider, and gamers-older and younger-should consider is whether DO CUTSCENES REALLY MATTER? HOW IS A CUTSCENE A PART OF THE ACTUAL GAME? In the older times I was hungry for new, high tech cutscenes too, but after playing Divinity Original Sin last year, I found out that it is now for me LESS IMPORTANT THAN I THOUGHT. RECENT TRIPLE A'S FOCUS IN CUTSCENES TOO MUCH AND THEYMOSTLY NEGLECT  THE QUALITY OF THE STORY!!! THEY TRY TO MAKE GENERIC STORIES SO THEY CAN SELL IT TO EVERYONE AND NOT GOOD ONES. MOST OF THEM HAVE STUPID STORIES COMPARED TO OLD GAMES. in the beggining I thought that the reason I was tired of playing newer games was because I got older, but then there are games like this one that which give me the excitement that older games were giving me. AND A GOOD STORY MATTERS MORE THAN CUTSCENES. PILLARS OF ETERNITY IS A TEXT HEAVY GAME BECAUSE IT IS A REAL RPG, WHERE STORY DEPTH, CONVERSATIONS AND CHOICES MATTER AND CHANGE THE WORLD AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE QUESTS. OTHERWISE THIS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BE ANYTHING MORE THAN FETCH/KILL QUESTS OF RECENT RPGS. YOUNGER GAMERS COULD TRY TO GET USED TO IT. It is not easy in the Beggining but it pays off. As for me I really need to play games with a story and depth like this one. so STORY 10/10ANOTHER WEAK POINT OF MANY TRIPLE A's IS THE OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF GAMES RULES AND MECHANICS. GAMES WHICH ARE SIMPLER CAN SELL TO A BIGGER MARKET, BUT THEY ARE SOMETIMES INSULTING AND UNCHALLENGING IN COMPARISON TO OLDER GAMES. AN UNCHALLENGING GAME OR A GAME WITH FEW CHOICES IN TACTICS IS MORE LIKE AN INTERACTIVE VIDEO THAN A GAME. PILLARS OF ETERNITY HAS DEEP MECHANICS AND MAKES THE PLAYER TO TRY TO FIND THE MOST SUITABLE TACTICS FOR THE CHARACTERS IN CONTROL. BATTLES CAN BE CHALLENGING IN THE NORMAL MODE EVEN FOR RPG TABLETOPS PLAYERS LIKE ME. I would give it a straight ten if it wasn't for some bugs in the party's AI which make the use of micromanagement inevitable and a bug which I had to tolerate in one of my fighter's abilities(into the fray ability) which made the ability unavailable during the last twenty hours of the game). For this reason. GAME MECHANICS 10/10 BUT GAME'S AI 8/10.ANOTHER PART OF A GOOD GAME. ESPECIALLY AN RPG IS THE LORE. I THINK THAT THE LORE IS AMAZING. I personally prefer this lore to the lore of FR for example, as I find the lore of FR good for designing any kind of tabletop campaign but a bit too generic. BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT TRIPLE A's worlds are usually too kitch for my taste. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT QUALITY COMES IN BIG NUMBERS. A DRAGON IS A REVERED THING IN HIGH FANTASY. A THOUSAND DRAGONS IS A RIDICULOUS ONE. I FOUND MYSELF DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE LORE OF PILLARS OF ETERNITY, BUT THAT IS SUBJECTIVE. SO LORE 10/10.MUSIC/SOUND/ACTING: A Game which has not perfect graphics can invest a lot in music and sound. THE MUSIC IS GREAT BUT NOT AS GREAT AS IN THE DIVINITY SERIES. THE THEMES ARE WONDERFUL BUT THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF THEM. For this Reason: MUSIC 9/10. The SOUND IS OKAY NOT EXCEPTIONAL 7/10. The budget was limited so NOT ALL OF THE DIALOGUES OF IMPORTANT NPC'S ARE RECORDED. I THINK THAT THIS IS STRAIGHTFORWARD WEIRD!!! MOST OF THE TIMES IT IS NOT A PROBLEM THOUGH AND I WILL BE LENIENT ON THAT BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED BUDGET. THIS WOULD BE UNFAIR FOR THE ACTORS, WHO DID AN AMAZING JOB AND GIVE EXCELLENT PERFORMANCES. For this reason: ACTING:10/10A 9/10 is a fair score for this game. But in my heart it will always be one of the 10/10 titles. I DON'T SAY THAT THIS GAME IS FOR A EVERYONE. BUT I DON'T CARE. IF YOU ARE BUYING IT YOU SHOULD JUDGE IT ACCORDING TO THE THINGS IT PROMISES TO DELIVER. AND IT DOES DELIVER!!!! HAVE FUN			"

												As a gamer who thinks Baldur's Gate-games, and in lesser extent the others created with Infinity engine,  are pretty much the best RPG's ever created, I am jubilant they finally got the offspring we have been waiting for. The fact that it is no longer based on the D&D system was a concern of mine, but the new system works brilliantly. The classes, leveling and talents are solid and fairly easy to understand. Giving up on certain classic D&D rules is a good idea in my opinion. Now you can have your Cleric wield a crossbow, making it a deadly sniper from the back. However, the lack of specialization classes is a flaw IMHO. Also the lack of Party AI (behavior) is a really silly. A lot of micromanagement needed at times.Graphics are very solid, beautiful, yet paying homage to the original games. 3D characters look very good an blend seamlessly into the background. Sounds are also good and the music made me think of old Baldur's immideately. The game feels sublime and finished, and there seems to be very few bugs to encounter.However, the story seems a bit vague compared to the original Bioware games and characters lack charisma. They are not as interesting as say Minsc or Edwin, but still are interesting enough to keep you company.All in all, I am giving this game a strict 8/10.If the party AI is added I would raise it to 9/10. There is plenty of content, but I do hope there will be a substantial amount of extra content in DLC-form in the future. "

												I can't recommend this game enough! If you're a fan of old school, isometric cRPGs, welcome home! Pillars of Eternity is very much like Divinity: Original Sin, except with a more streamlined character creation system and with a more interesting story/setting.Hands down, this is the best RPG i've played in the past couple of years. If you're into RPGs that are very story-heavy and have detailed fantasy worlds, this is the game for you. If possible, I recommend getting the Royal Edition because the world and its history are so vast that it's nice to be able to read the extra digital books to get a better understanding of the game's world and its cultures. It's not necessary to enjoy the game, but it is very fascinating and helps you get the most out of it.Easily GOTY, 10/10!			"

												This game is awesome for those that are fans of Baldurs Gate and games a like. I didn't follow this at all and bought it on a whim as there was a lot of hype around it on the forums I browse. I can honestly say that this is one of the best purchases I have made recently, it gave me an itch like no other, I couldn't wait to get home from work and play.It took me 37 hours to get to the end with the majority of side quests complete (I had 3 companion ones left) and the end boss took me 3h 30mins off my own back with no guides, so your looking at around 40 hours in total for a 'normal' difficulty play through.I didn't do all the levels in the Caed Nua dungeon, I got about 1/2 way down and this would of added a few more hours on to my completion time had I completed it.I highly recommend this game for its modern formula on an old school genre and I hope that there will be expansions as I would love to explore more of this 'morbid' world.

												Pillars of Eternity is a great game in its own right. Many would like to compare it to Baldur's Gate or Baldur's Gate II, but if you wish an honest assessment then just accept that Pillars of Eternity is its own game, complete with its own stories, world, characters and immersion. The classes are vibrant and progression is smooth and enjoyable. If I had a negative thing to say about the game it would be that it isn't multiplayer. Heh.			"

												Warning: might contain spoilers.There are countless people telling you how this game is great and close to flawless so i wont be focusing on that. Ill tell you what is wrong with the game.Roleplay options, - the core stats are a joke. Intelligence recommended for a barbarian, Might not recommended for monk, intelligence on wizard is only good for debuffing and 'dialog'. There are no special changes while having stat a minimum - 3 int talking like normal, 3 dex having no problems swinging 2 swords etc. The system is extremely flawed and its a huge letdown when you make some conceptual hero, take appropriate skills and then they are almost never checked outside prologue. In the entirety of Act 1 i havent seen a single Survival/Stealth/Mechanic/Athletics*past prologue* checked in dialog or events, no finding hidden♥♥♥♥♥♥doesnt count. And it stinks. The game presents itself as hardcore old school RPG which it certainly is if you think♥♥♥♥♥♥graphics, extremely horrible party AI, massive pathing problems equals old school. The same 'roleplay' problem is felt all over - say i killed Roedric and come back to Calisa's sister she is still panicking oh no we'lll get hanged mode. Maxed out reputation with people in the village, the dialog doesnt change with anyone outside random♥♥♥♥♥♥villagers say. Really? This is supposed to be a top tier rpg. I liked how the quests adapted to what you do, like instead of doing the 'make water to brew' you instead murder everyone, that was good and it was a step in the right direction, but it ultimately didnt matter one bit how you went through prologue. The outcome is always the same, same with almost everything you do. They dont change anything on macro level. Say after the other watcher dies there are 3 options to do with his soul, giving roleplay opportunity but they are the same as an outcome... Why even have it then? To show off what it could have been? Dissapointing.The Stronghold felt exciting, yet it feels so dead and depressing when i show up, the events are not fun, they are terrirble, instead of inviting over opressed peasants to provide them heaven or w/e im visited by some duke who i cant even go have a talk with.  It could have been a great addition, but it feels superficial and obsolete since the moment you get it and all through the game. You guys talk about creative freedom for the game, yet the achievements are the most uninspired garbage ever. Kill these many or dont kill as many! Finish the game on highest difficulty and prove you are the TRUE TRYHARD or that you can make a fire godlike monk and play fine with it. Whoever was in charge of achievements - let someone else do this, you are ill suited for the task. They feel tackled on, a 'modern burdern' which they had to make for the check mark at the game launch. For someone not constricted by publishers or backers hurrying you up that was really ♥♥♥♥in bad. Dont want people to spoil story for themselves? Make them hidden or whatnot, make them fun! Technical issues with this game are few...but extremely irritating and game breaking including, removal of passives on doubleclick, having your people stuck somewhere with no option to get them out including: ladders with spaces below them,  treelines post scripted dialog. Game glitching out hard in dialogs if launched for extended period of time...and these are just the ones i saw, i struggle to grasp how many total there are. Realism: a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ village with about 100-200 people in it sustaining a huge♥♥♥♥♥castle fit for a king with more guards then villagers. And other incredible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like that all over the game.And thats all just Act 1. Almost a week past the release there is no patch. Obsidian, you can do better then that. Overall though its still a fantastic game and possible THE RPG of 2015, but it could have been so much more. I give it 8,5/10 Right now and 9.5 when issues are resolved *at least the gameplay wise, i dont expect anyone to figure out a way to fix flawed quest design. "

												I actually Kick started this back when it was first announced and I do not regret doing so. If you are familiar with Baldur's Gate 2 and enjoyed it then you will love this game. It feels very familiar and yet brings a lot of new things to the table along with improvements. Even if you are not familiar with Baldur's Gate 2 you will still enjoy this game. The combat is almost exactly the same as Baldur's gate, it's an Action RPG where you can pause mid combat (similar to the modern Bioware games such as Mass Effect etc.). It is very challenging and it actually forces you to think which weapon type and which spells to use on each different enemy. Another great thing about this game is that it really is open, in the sense that there are multiple ways of completing a mission. As an example there is a certain area that you need to enter but it has been sealed off and it guarded by 2 guards. You can either:          1. Kill them and enter anyway          2. Bribe them and enter          3. Go to their boss and gain his favour to allow you entranceThere might be more ways that I haven't come across, but that's just one example. Not to mention this game has mods on steam workshop. Since it is a recent release, it won't have as many mods at the moment, but give it a bit of time and look at the mods coming in. I personally love the endurance mechanism during combat that replaces your health so that when you endurance drops to ""0"" you are unconcious but once the combat is over you are back up again, but with some sort of injury the second time your health drops below ""0"" you will die however unless you rest. Unlike BG2 you can't just rest as many times as you like, you need to have camping equipment and you can only carry a maximum of 5 at any one point. Though it's not all great. Some people have been complaining about the speed it takes to load a game once you are quite far in to the game. Personally I don't have a problem with it as back in the day the load times generally were really slow anyway. The other problem is that I feel that there is just too much talking about things that I feel are not really that important to me. I mean sure lore is important, but too much of reading will bore the game, especially when it is not directed to me. My personal issue with the story is there are moments when you can actually choose an option about your past of why you did something or who someone is exactly. (i.e. relative, partner friends etc.) And I feel like that freedom shouldn't be given because the story then feels fabricated rather than customised to you. So overall the story can use some improvement, but that still doesn't mean that the story is bad. It can definitely use some more voiced over lines though, compared to modern games this one is lacking in that area. Though again if you compare it to BG2, PoE feels like it has more voiced over lines despite being a smaller game. Overall I would give it a 8/10. I would have given it more had it not been for the amount of unnecassary lore that was forced fed.			"

												I picked this up on a whim and a super quick Google search for ""Games like Baulders Gate.""  BEST Unplaned purchase I have done on Steam.  The game really gets it right.  It scratches that old BG itch and then some.  Beautiful graphics, great sound, and an easy to pick up and play system.  After my impulse buy, I just sank 10.2 hours into the game during a busy NHL playoffs day.  It's that good :)  So far my only complaints are1.) Almost too many spells for Mage types (But honestly, since when is abundant choice a bad thing?)2.) The screen can get crowded with enemies, making the action hard to distinguish.I pray that they will be making a sequal, the game is so good I want to see this become a franchise or at least carry the game system over to a new ip.9/10 would buy again.  Would suggest it to my friends.  Would skip work to play.  Did get yelled at by wife for ignoring here while playing.			"

What more could you ask for in a good RPG? The second age of CRPGs has arrived, and while it may have started with a few titles that were hit or miss, Pillars of Eternity throws the gate wide open with a bang. Having played this, I'm very excited for the genre's future.			"

												When I play Beemdog's remastered games, I can't help but feel something is missing.  I think part of it is we have learned over the years how to tell a compelling story, and what works for an open world game.  Take Skyrim...you can both get lost in it and you also have story queues where ever you go.When I loaded up Pillars of Eternity some how the pieces just gell.  I love that anybody can equip anything, but their are trade offs like movment speed.  Also people are just better with some weapons, like a monk with their firsts.  Also all the classes feel destinc, and the races are a nice mix of the familar and new.  I realy feel this is what Dragon Age was trying to be, and only got close to with the latest game.What I mean by that is I spent a good 20 hours exploring what I thought was a good chunck of the map.  After looking at the real map, I discovered my good chunck is about 15% of the map!  I just am realing feeling the blance between story, exploration, and characters.  I love that everyone in my party has their own vibe and that each one is TOTALY different.As in you don't have a fire mage, a enchanter,  and a genralist to chose from.  You have 1 mage, 1 chaner, and 1 Cryptic to choose from.  Each have different mechanics and really play differently.  Like mages have spells like you expect, but they work like sorcers where you have X casts of the 4 or so spells you pick.  Chanters spells can only be cast after you chant so many rounds, and even at 1st level that is 3 rounds.  Cryptics start out with small pool to cast spells from, but then every time you strike you add to that pool.  Also you have to pick your spells on level with these two classes, and can't learn more from spell books like Wizards.Also the new core mechanics deloped for this game both feel familar and fresh.  The art is gorgus, and this is great game that goes beyond the infinity games of the past.			"

Path of exile being one of the few good games we've had, but for what PoE added in good game mechanics is lacked effort in character building and story.Pillar has EVERYTHING, from huge ammounts of effort into each quest, great voice acting that actually adds to the whole experience, i didn't just sit there groaning the voices completely ruined any immersion.  It has a dead catA REAL DEAD CAT! which you can have as a pet may i add, killing feral children, stealing a gem then warning the owner his gem is under threat of being stolen, Going to kill a crazy lord then changing your mind and killing the person who sent you... this game is truely open to play HOWEVER you want. Each class feels unique, combat is fluid and difficult enough to challenge even hardcore rpg veterans. If  I could sacrifice my first born to get a sequel to  this game, i would go out and fertilize every willing subject.			"

I did things totally different with each time I played it and the endings changed and the stories mid game changed and the quest items were different.  I am really really impressed by this game and I cannot wait for the expansion to come out.

												50 hours into this game feels like the right time to start a review. The fact that I'm 50 hours in and yet have barely scratched the surface of this excellent game, should tell you something about the size and density of this nostalgic throw back to the Infinity games of yore.The first thing likely to strike you will take place in the character generation screens. It's easy to get so involved in this process that an hour will easily flick by. I can think of few games since the Baldurs Gates series or Icewind Dales that have had that effect, perhaps Skrim or Morrowind, but again this just proves the richness of the characters and backgrounds on offer here.Once into the game proper I felt instantly transported to the Baldurs Gate and Torment era. A little further scratching showed that whle POE has stayed true to those great games it does not feel like a game of that generation. Indeed Obsidian have managed to create a modern and innovative RPG that feels just as right in 2015 as would have in 2000 at the height if the Infiity engine age.To name just a few of the things on offer here, player choice, great NPC interaction, a rich and diverse world and an even richer and diverse story. So far I can't find a lot to fault. If I had to come up with one negative it could be that I will struggle to go back and play the likes of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale again, as finally they will feel aged and matched, if not bettered, by a modern RPG.

												If you are a fan of CRPG's from the 90s into early 00's, then you will likely enjoy this game.  I have not had this much fun playing a CRPG since Planescape: Torment.The game feels like a classic Infinity Engine game (Baldurs Gate, Planescape Torment, Icewind Dale), but revised with modern graphic capabilities.   Some of the best gameplay improvements are:* Half Speed Movement* Double Speed Movement* Inventory Stash to remove inventory management mini-game (easy access can be disabled for the truely hardcore)* Removal of need to monster grind for levels by eliminating XP from monsters after a certain amount of kills of that monster type.  The XP focus is now on initial kills of a monster type and Quest experience.Here are some other gameplay change that you may or may not like. I find that they streamline the game over D&D type rulesets:* Trap Detection / Trap disarmement / Picklocking all covered by same skill: mechanics* Mechanics is a skill that any class can learn, so it is no longer mandatory to have a rogue in order to cover the above thief like actions.* Some spells/skills can be used a certain number of times per combat* mage/priests can cast a certain number of spells of each level per 'rest'; mages can only select 4 spells per level* AoE spells have 2 ranges, an inner range that can target both friend and foe, and an outer range that only can target foes.  In addition some AoE spells are listed as foe-only and can not harm friendly characters.  Stats can increase the radius of an AoE spell.I highly recommend this game for anyone who was a fan of the RPG classics from the 90s and early 00's.			"

												Playing Pillars is kind of like being in a relationship.You acknowledge that the other person has his/her flaws, but... you still love them :)So... yeah, some parts of the game are better than others. Still, it's rewarding (er, not so much in loot). Whenever combat was a grind, I reminded myself that, thankfully, this is not Icewind Dale and at least there's some plot involved. And a pretty decent one too. The main quest seems a bit cliched at first but... it starts echoing Torment eventually with the questions it raises.Pillars will charm you if you manage to see past its flaws. Recommended :)			"

I give it 8,5/10.PROS+ Interesting and clever plot.+ In-depth and mature world.+ Likable and well-considered NPCs - both, those you can invite to your party, and those you just meet on your journeys.+ Excellent graphics. Beautiful, vivid scenery. + Good character creation with interesting attribute dependency.+ Enchanting. Though it needs some polishing, e.g. creating certain point in your stronghold to do enchanting or making it only available at a smithy.+ Well considered and voiced (english) antagonist (Thaos ix Arkannon).+ Well written quests. In most cases you need to think twice before completing and majority of them have more than one solution.+ Challenging combat.+ Experience gain.  You get XP mostly from quests and only limited amount from slaying enemies. It encourages to search for more solutions to quests than just hacking and slashing through enemies.+ Feels almost like good old classics (i.e. Icewind Dale or Baldur's Gate series) :)CONS- Too long loading screens.- You have to pay for hireling and they cost you a lot. Also they are always 1 level behind. No option to create custom party to play with.- Maximum character level is 12.- Lack of more choices to make at times. (Like at Readrick's castle. You have to kill either of two brothers without the possibility to spare both on your terms.)- Stronghold is useless. The only good thing about it are additional quests. Apart from that it's pretty much for nothing.**- No use for the mercenaries you hire. If the stronghold is being sieged they can't protect it. They only make diference if you arrive to defend the stronghold yourself. (Then they fight along your side, but what's the point if you can easily handle any kind of threat yourself)*- Prison? No point of imprisoning enemies/characters since you have no further use of them anyway.*- Stronghold buffs. When you rest at your stronghold you get buffs, but they are severely underpowered in comparison to what you get in any kind of inn.- Terrible companion quests. They take too much time to progress. You need to keep talking to your team and some dialogues are far too long, tiring and really boring (like Durance or Grieving Mother quest lines). Also some of them seem to be linked to the main plot which disables you from completing them when you want to but forcing you to drag the NPCs with you all the time even if you don't need them. The best idea of companion quests I ever encountered was in Mass Effect 2, where you were simply given a task to accomplish and after that the companion received a bonus ability and tightened the relationship with the protagonist. Really, THAT simple.- Spell uses per rest. I prefered to use ciphers who have unlimited spells pool and their mana is regenerated according to their participation in combat. I would like to see other casters have mana to fuel their spell uses and similar to cipher mana recovery system. OR simply applying cooldowns for certain spells so that you can use them all the time after they are ready to re-cast.			"

												Awesome B♥♥♥♥nd Planescape successor. I really like Russian translation and all the lore in the game. Story and quests are interesting as well. What is defferent from BG is this game is really pleasant to read. It is like a book. Combat and character interaction are on very good level. I play it on Path of the Damned difficulty and this is awesome. So many challenges and thoughts needs to be made to approach almost 50-80% of the battles.This game worth its time and money. And ofc beautiful environment and atmosphere.			"

												Took me a while to properly get into since I hadn't played a proper traditional CRPG for almost a decade. But once it grabbed me, it became one of my favourite recent RPGs. Pros:- The combat system, once you get into it, is unbelievably addictive. - Huge amount of variety in skills, perks, spells, etc.- The aesthetic is beautiful. It's not the most advanced game or anything, but some of the handdrawn backgrounds are gorgeous - The sheer amount of content is pretty amazing. I've put a good 70 hours into it and I'm nowhere close to finished - The difficulty, although it has a couple of strange spikes is pretty well tuned. It remains challenging for the most part.Cons: - For people new to the genre, or getting back into it after a while, like me, it's almost impenetrable early on. In my opinion, the game does a poor job of explaining several mechanics. Stealth, for example is barely touhed upon, despite it being extremely useful, and on higher difficulties, absolutely vital. Crafting isn't explained at all too.- The load times are infuriatingly long and far too frequent. A loading screen every time you enter and leave a building? Jesus.- Party AI and pathfinding is really poor. This becomes a huge issue in some of the cramped spaces the game throws at you, and with a party of 6+ NPCs, they constantly get stuck behind doors and in narrow corridors. - Disappointing lack of variety in loot.- The main plot is pretty weakOverall: Flawed, yes, but it's a real gem. Highly recommended for anyone who loved Baldur's Gate/Planescape Torment/Icewind Dale			"

And I'm not talking about romantic relationships, I mean simple human interactions between the main character and their companions. Other than that, I have absolutely NOTHING negative to say about this game. It feels like playing Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment all over again, except all fancied up.			"

Something is missing, but I just can't put my finger on it.  Maybe it's nostalgia, or maybe it's Minsc and Boo.  Regardless, the graphics are better, and the stronghold mechanic they introduced is quite nice.			"

												First thing I can say, for those of us that played Baldur’s Gate and Torment and Icewind back in the day: this is a true successor.It is not perfect, companions are interesting, but dull to interact with, and they don’t seem to have the depth of banter that you got out of BG2, for example. The story is wonderful for the first 2/3rds building up interest, questions and intrigue.... then in the final 1/3rd it... just seems to stop caring and become a fairly dull romp, at least compared to the first 2/3rds. Such a wide breadth of interesting topics for the story to go down and they just ignored them... almost like they ran out of time and had to finish the end quickly :(. Also was disappointed that I was given a Stronghold and never had to really defend it against a BBEG (I thought this was the purpose of a stronghold in an RPG? :P ).But these are small issues, and this is a great game.Pros:+Pretty. Not gorgeous, or stunning, but the graphics work, they’re pretty and do exactly what is needed.+ Interesting companions+ Lovely assortment of side quests+ Great story up to the riot, downhill from thereCons:- Dull interactions with companions- Endgame is disappointing (compared against what it could have so easily have been with a little more effort)- I needed that weekend for work :(- Still a tad buggy. Nothing game breaking, no crashes, just a few odds and ends, I’m sure this’ll be fixed within the week.9/10. Maybe 9.5/10 if mods really take off.(Or to put it another way: Puched a guy and he exploded: 10/10, would punch again)			"

												This isn't Baldurs Gate or Icewind Dale. It's not even close. It's way better.Obsidian reactivity is everywhere, with multiple endings to quests, different ways to influence your companions and a storyline that is similar in theme to Mask of the Betrayer and Planescape Torment.The backdrops are influenced by the Infinity Engine games, but with more interactivity with the environment. Much of this takes place the form of text cutscenes - storyboards that allow some player agency, usually through item or skill checks. These can help you skip past a section of enemies or find hidden treasure.As a backer of the Kickstarter, I'm pleased to see Obsidian do well with a game they've always wanted to make. It looks successful too - here's hoping they can do more games like this. I wouldn't mind seeing another game in this engine, with their kind of reactive storytelling. The next one up is Torment: Tides of Numenera from inXile. That has Black Isle and Obsidian alumni (Kevin Saunders, George Ziets, Colin McComb, Adam Heine) working on it, so my hopes are high. Pillars of Eternity certainly sets the bar.			"

												It's like being hit by the yellow oldschool bus of nostalgia, right in the face! Baldurs Gate & Icewind Dale are classics who have a special place in many players hearts and Pillars of Eternity now takes a place amongst those legends.This game follows the style and feel of Baldurs Gate and Icewind Dale in almost all aspects, it's a very long game with a rich story and massive amount of content.Battles can be somewhat unforgiving if you dont save scum a lot (just as given with the other 2 games).Regarding the DLC White March part 1 and 2, i would say it as a package is great, part 1 was a bit lackluster but it picks up in part 2. If you're a person who enjoyed mentioned games above (Baldurs Gate & Icewind Dale), this game is a must have!			"

												As of release day build:+Game plays how I wanted BG:EE to play+Has a wonderful grounding for future content/mods+Very morally grey situations - world is not black and white-It's an Obsidian game: ie. It has bugs (some game breaking)-In combat melee-pathfinding has issues and requires oversight-Quest/Faction locking before you know what you're agreeing to(caveat) not being able to play turncoat what-so-ever in obviously profitable/beneficial situationsOverall it's a fun tactical RPG that meets it's claims and has quite a bit of potential. I would recommend for anyone who enjoyed Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, Dragon Age: Orgins, or Divinity: Original Sin.			"

												This game is insanely good. I played this and bloodborne since 26 th . Now I ended bloodborne in around 30 h and in this game after 17 hours i think that i'm on the beginning of journey. Great and epic journey. This game wake some memories from baldurs gate to planescape. I love RPG and this is first good one since Witcher 2. For me most important thing in good rpg is story. Divinity was good rpg but had very flat story, Dragon Age Inquisition got fun charatcers and beautiful world but had flat story. Wasteland was buggy and boring game for me.   This game got everything. It grabs you and don't want to let go. Quest are brilliant and there is more to story than main quest. Almost every quest is interesting. Game is easy for beginners and can be hard for core gamers. It's the best game 2015 for now and I see only Witchar 3 on the horizon.			"

												This game is all hype.  The magic system is useless.  The experience system is useless.   You have to party with their npc's  (whom are useless) to get the full experience of quests.  The combat is chaotic and there is no turn-base or party A.I.   Re-visit the original Baldur's series for a more satisfying game.  I expected a better product from these companies.   Wait til it is in the $10 bin or on sale at least.  Just make Baldur's Gate 3 already for cryin' out loud.  Sheesh.Oh and please stop comparing this game to BG, Icewind, or Planescape series.  It only looks like those games.  The mechanics and rules are completely different.  It is nowhere near in quality as those games.			"

												Hi people, Casual gamer here,I am truly amazed at this game, how it pieces the story and characters together which i haven't seen this level of story and character interaction since Baldur's Gate 1,2 and Icewind Dale - of those I’ve played. It is easy paced for new comers, and holds challenges for veteran RPG players. Players who like fast-paced action, battle after battle using quick potions and hacking and slashing won't find this game to current RPG's. This game is more thinking how to organize your party, how to micro-manage, and a lot of reading - for puzzles, quests, understanding the abilities and lore. Since the game is single player any player can spend as much time as they want! Which is great for casual gamers like myself. Remembering that initially you are not immortal, but can build up to that premise which is a nice balance. There are a lot of builds and classes and has a lot of re-play ability, you could spend a lot of hours in just exploring each zone, class and story!Overall I highly recommend this game to RPG players with actual role playing capabilities "

												One of best RPG game I played.  Same level as Baldur's gate and divinity: OS if not better.  There are many improvements compared those two games.  Slow and fast mode save players tons of time.  Enemies are smarter and make fighting stragety more important.  The plot is interesting. Weapon system is more realistic.  Much better pictures and game optimized very well and run smoothly under low performance computer. However, there are some negatives.  conversatios are too intrinsic. Map are large but lack of sufficient NPC and exploration is not quite rewarded. The weather doesn't change as beautiful as divinity: OS.The weapons are not as diverse as baldur's gate and lack of personalities. No multiplayer unfortunately.  Allover, this is a must play game for those who love RPG Game.			"

												Pillars of Eternity (PoE) is an absolutely terrific game. It's not just one of the best 3rd person isometric RPG's of recent years. It's one of the very best period. PoE's main selling point, in my humble opinion, is how it immerses players rapidly and completly. The story is great with many smaller plotlines all across the map, sometimes quite literally. Your primary character is built at start but you gather the rest of your party as you go along. There's stuff to do everywhere and I've come back to several locations just to find out I missed stuff. What really helps is how the areas ooze flavour with the right look and feel and plenty of flavour text everywhere.In party creation Obsidian really shows this game was created through Kickstarter and community support: don't like the characters the game throws at you? No problem, just hire an adventurer and built one to suit you. It allows you to tailor the experience the way you like it. Now, the game party members add their own story to the mix and the tend to be fun and capable anyway so you can go both directions. But as an example: unless you build a Fighter or Paladin yourself you find yourself short of a tank for the first few hours of game play. So hire an adventurer and set off. Absolutely fantastic and 100% geared towards offering an experience you can tune as a player. You can go through all of this in any way you like. Want to be a beneficent hero? No problem. Want to be sadistical piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ No problem. And the world responds to that in all sorts of little things. Again: you get to tune your own experience which is a great selling point for this game.Graphics wise the game isn't anything special. But it runs extremely well and the graphics work well and fit the game. You're not going to get blown away with minute details or spectacular effects but it hasn't bothered me. This game is all about content and immersion and it scores off the charts on both off these aspects. The music is much of the same. Not spectaular but it fits the game and most importantly; it doesn't grate the nerves.Pillars of Eternity is one of the very best 3rd person isometric RPG's I have ever played. I consider it right up there with Planescape: Torment for those you know and remember that legendary game. Yes, I really think this game is that good. For anyone who enjoys RPG's this game is a no-brainer: get it. For everyon else: get it. it's that good.			"

												Pillars of Eternity, A return to the great infinity Engine. While the game pays great respect to its Predecessors (baldur's gate, Icewind Dale, neverwinter nights and the great planescape torment. ) What pillary of eternity does best is create its own stories and world. The combat is fantastic and very addicting while the majority of the characters are extremely interesting. For fans of the CRPG genre and people who like to read. Or even those who have never played a crpg of this calibur before. I HIGHLY recommend Pillars Of Eternity.			"

												Traditional Rating - 79Recommendation - cRPG fans, put this on your shortlistcRPGs have made a triumphant return in recent years. From the Baldur's Gate Enhanced Editions to successful(ly kickstarted) revivals of popular franchises like Wasteland, Torment, Sword Coasts, and even some new ones, there has been more than enough quasi-turn-based party management fantasy to sink your teeth into.Most of those games have been (or will be) fairly modernized versions of the genre, but Pillars of Eternity is the first one to REALLY bring to mind the original Baldur's Gate, in all its pock-marked glory. In fact, if I didn't know any better, I might even be convinced into believing this was just a thoroughly well-done mod pack.It's obviously not, though. This game was built from the ground up in the Unity engine by Obsidian Entertainment who, as you might know, were instrumental in designing everything from Baldur's Gate, to Planescape Torment, to Fallout 2, and even Fallout New Vegas. These are some genre (and industry) veterans, and it shows. Every aspect of this game is well-polished. Stability is rock-solid, the graphics are beautiful and well-optimized, sound and music is fantastic, voice acting is solid, there are lots of interesting NPCs, and the story is interesting.This game is a shining example of the genre, and if you're looking for a cRPG and you loved Baldur's Gate 1, you absolutely cannot overlook Pillars.Over the course of the 50+ hour journey, you'll be exploring numerous towns/caves/ruins/forests, battling evil monarchs and quashing uprisings, helping secure lineages, rooting out corruption, and slaughtering enemies by the hundreds. You'll make friends in one town, enemies in another, and something in between on more than a few occasions. This is a game where your choices can have a profound impact on the world, and the consequences of those decisions will be summed up in brutally painful clarity during the ending.It's hard to know what exactly to start talking about, so I'll choose story. In my 60 hours spent playing, most of my time was spent away from the main quest line, but the game did a pretty good job of tying everything in together. A game like Divinity: Original Sin (D:OS) will have a large series of self-contained quests, each of which you earn exp for, but Pillars' quests are all inter-related. Some will earn you reputation which you can use to persuade other quest-givers, some will enable or lock out other quests entirely, and some will either please your companions into confiding in you or anger them into leaving. The Baldur's Gate games did this too, and it's refreshing to see Pillars keep the tradition alive. I will say I wish there was more clashing between the various personalities within the party (everyone got along a little too well), but your actions can and do have an impact on their opinion of you. The main quest itself twists and spirals around, and while it does ramble quite a bit (and start to go off the rails) towards the end, I thought it came together nicely.Going back to NPCs, I thought that overall, they were really well-done. There's close to 10 of them, and they each have their own quests/goals/personalities, most of which develop quite satisfyingly. It was a source of slight frustration that I had to leave a few of them behind at my citadel to watch over things, but I was able to dispatch them on missions remotely, so it was OK. Interacting with the NPCs all felt very organic, too. Sometimes they would want to talk to you about important things, but otherwise it was up to you to initiate conversations. You'd have to build up trust with them before they would open up to you, and they wouldn't shy away from telling you ""that's enough for now"". I got along with certain NPCs better than others, and certain ones were stronger than others, but at least they were always interesting. Speaking of talking, not all of this game is voice-acted, and the transitions can be distracting.One area this game differs noticeably from Baldur's Gate is in combat. It's still the same pause-when-you-want, micromanaging type of party control, but they eased back a bit on the brutal realism. Don't get me wrong, there are a LOT of tough fights (adra dragon, for one), but when each battle is over, you don't need to use all your healing spells and camp twice to recover. That was one thing I always hated about the BG games, and thankfully it wasn't a sore spot here. In battles, you have health and endurance (800 health and 160 endurance, for example). When damaged, you take equal hits to both health and endurance, and if endurance drains to empty (in this example, you'd have 640 health and 0 endurance), you are knocked out (in BG, you'd be dead). If the surviving team members win the battle, that knocked out character will stand back up, and endurance will regenerate (health will not). This allows you to fight several battles in between resting/camping sessions, which speeds the game up DRASTICALLY. Obviously there are spells that can heal endurance inside battle, but you will need to rest/sleep to recover any health. If health ever runs out, a character is either maimed or killed. I had a few characters get maimed (temporary stat debuff until they rest), but never had one get killed, thankfully. Resting is always 8 hours, and always fully heals/recovers.I only really had a few sore spots about combat. The first problem is that this game falls prey to the classic Baldur's Gate slog, where it will sometimes take you 40 minutes spread across 6 different boring battles to cover a single screen. Battles here resolve quite a bit quicker than they ever did in BG, but it can still sometimes be laborious. Take step, fight Xaurips, more steps, more Xaurips, etc. I call this Baldur's Gate syndrome because parts of that game were absolutely filled to the rafters with it, so if you played that, you know what to expect. Just remember to take breaks when you start feeling weary, and it should be fine. The second problem I had is classic party management frustration. Giving orders to melee characters quite often ends with them ignoring the orders and continuing with their regularly scheduled programming. This can REALLY be a problem when my priest is getting turned into cheesecloth by archers. My warriors acknowledge my order to disengage and cross the room, but instead take 2 steps, get punished with a disengagement strike, and then turn around to continue attacking their original target again, ignoring my order and letting the priest die. So what you have to do is either re-issue orders every 2 seconds, baby-stepping the warriors across the room while they suffer 8 disengagement strikes BECAUSE THEY KEEP RE-ENGAGING, or just let the priest die. If there are 2 or 3 enemies clustered together tightly, it can be literally impossible to pull a warrior away. This is with the default NPC non-AI, so maybe there's a way to wipe them completely clean or something. As with many other party management games, the AI here is just ""smart"" enough to screw with my orders.Going along with the slog, I should talk about backtracking. There is a lot of it in this game. The world itself is smallish, and there's a lot of content crammed into it, so quests (which you will have 11 of at a time) will have you heading to A, talking to B, killing C and his friends, returning to D, and turning the quest in to E. It gets rather repetitive, but luckily a lot of side quests are not only unnecessary but also pointless (max level is 12, which completionists will hit early).Overall, I found Pillars game to be a great love letter to Baldur's Gate and its ilk. It certainly has some problems, but it's meaty and satisfying, and as long as you don't mind some momentary bits of repetition and tedium, you should find it enjoyable too. I was ready for it to be over a few hours before it actually was, but it didn't overstay its welcome too much, and I'm glad I visited.			"

												My name is Jawn. Jawn Ghor. I'm an aumaua from a small island off the shore of The Lands That Live. I used to sell drugs and if a deal ever got too hot, well... I'm a big guy and I've got a collection of blades. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't out to ruin anybody's life or screw up the community, it was just honest business. I guess at some point I realized that I was lying to myself, though. It was around that time that a deal went bad on me. Real bad. The elf in question was a pale sailor who I cursed out in front of his mates. I'll haggle with you, but you'll pay what I want and you'll keep your mouth shut about my island. Should've realized he was psychotic. I went for a drink with my mates on my way home to blow off some steam. Much later, I arrived home to find my wife Maia hung by her neck, blood pooled below from a slit throat. I guess I kinda lost it for a while. The memories are hazy from the drugs and the death and... enough. Vengeance is a hunger that can't be sated, nothing could bring her back. I decided to leave the island, having heard of a settlement called Gilded Vale. Maybe they'd have use for a man with an eye for alchemy and a strong arm. Maybe then I could leave all the bloodshed behind. Or maybe carnage is my nature.			"

												This is how it feels back to travel back in time and experience the sensation of Baldur's Gate again, except it is not Baldur's Gate, it is much better written, and the developers have a decade of experience behind them, making this RPG-experience some of the best ever. It also brings back the unforgiving, hardcore battles and gameplay that I grew to love, and others grew to hate. The generation of pacifier-sucking kids are whining on the forums, whilst the majority of the reviewers and real roleplaying game fans who grew up with ""you have to do the work to get the reward"" are enjoying this game immensely.Anyone who has anything bad to say about this game are wasting their time trying to convince anyone, I'll back anything Obsidian does that goes along these lines. And so will a lot more. Man, I'll play this game slowly to get the most enjoyment possible out of it.			"

												What we have here is a graphic novel with interactive areas and a bolted on RPG system, leveling seems to take place once every blue moon and I have found characters with a 7 in lore could not use scrolls that needed 2 in lore, so the RPG side is simply not working. It relies heavily on text based story telling to create game play, combat, exploration, all seem secondry to this one part of the games design. Unfortunately the story just is not that interesting, I have put books down that have been more interesting than this. If you check the steam stats and achievements for the game, you will notice a trend, most of the advanced features of the game are not getting used, most folk use the create an adventurer feature, only 25% have actually finished act 1. This should tell you a lot. It actually reminds me of a computerised version of the old paper and pen RPGs where the dungeon keeper tells you what you are looking at. Trouble is, this is computer game where we can see what we are looking at and half the time it does not match the text. I have seen this compared to Baldurs gate a lot, honestly, it is not Baldurs gate, its not even in the same league as Baldurs gate but the game does have its charms if you sit back and treat it like an interactive book with pretty average if long winded story line. If I was to give it a score it would be 7 out of 10. Worth owning but not for £35. I would say pick this up when the price hits £22 which is closer to its truth worth. I would ask obsidian one question though, where did the $4 Million dollars from kickstarter go because this game is not worth $4.Worth buying but wait for the sales.			"

												Hello, finally finished this game on the hardest difficulty settings and wanted to post my thoughts, I'll try to cover up spoilers as best I can.I've put a lot of hours into this game, on various different playthroughs each with a different method of playing, those being Companion playthrough / solo playthrough / minimalist playthrough.**DISCLAIMER** To start of ill point out that my experience with this genre is limited to this game alone and it may be that you are reading this knowing more about how these games work than I. To kick off right from pressing play this game immediately grabs grabbed my interest by dropping me into an event that was covered in mystery, straight it made me want to dive into it no boring introductions to plot smack bang right in the middle of something. Following this little introduction I was given the hero creation screen, to a depth I didn't expect. The game offers you 6 races, each with a number of secondary ""habitat"" options (these add to bonus stats for min/maxers)following that there are 11 classes all that can be built in their own way, then lastly the creation is finished with some personalisation/previous job roles that adds a few extra stats and gives you a starting armor / weapon set. At no point in the lower difficulties have I felt a need to build my character or her companions strictly in a single linier direction, though in the higher difficulties you may find that the opposite be true.**COMBAT**following this and the opening story portion I very quickly found that this games combat was going to slow my progress down a bit, immediately following the easy monsters in the ""training"" portion of the game. I died. Needed to restart everything all over again (hardest difficulty) You CANNOT rush this game's combat.that being said the combat in this game never got boring, each pack of monsters offered a different challange and seperate strategy with the number of different resistance types making it so that there wasn't an all rounded effective method of nuking monsters as I also quickly found out. I died again, wondering why my cool fire spell wasn't killing anything.  and take note, on the higher difficulties the game produces more mobs and higher tier creatures in packs at a higher density as on the lower difficulties.**THE PRESENTATION & STORY**throughout my 80 hours of playtime, this games art never once felt to much. The colours were very well blended, with great still painted background artwork and the 3D npc / character models fitted superbly on them. movement was very smooth, soundtrack and foley was great, spell effects were pretty and not to over the top they even included incantations which I personally thought was rather neat. so all that gets a big thumbs up from me! The story and it's delivery was interesting and well paced all the way through, mainquest was entirely voice acted, side quests had great mini stories and some were branched of the main quest. there's public tasks you can do, super crazy hard bounties for the try hards that want a rediculously hard challange and a few more progression aspects in your stronghold. so theres plenty of stuff too keep you busy in the world of Eora!In addition to all the above mentioned the game also offers a lot of very small packets of information and secrets, adding to the story telling that you gain through the abilities you gain throughout the game being that each of the attributes have both combat and social implications. Each playthrough is a different adventure, tailored exactly how you want it to be with the world reacting around you in accordance to your actions the fate of Eora is in your hands! This game gets a 9/10 from me!This is my first review, off a game I have very much enjoyed thoroughly!

												Like probably the vast majority of PoE players, I'm an old-school RPG nut, having played EOB, Ultima, Wizardry, BG and ID and dozens more.  I'd missed the wonderful RPG worlds created in the IE and when I saw the Kickstarter for PoE I was excited.Has the game delivered?  For me - absolutely!  I love the whole approach to this game.  The designers have deliberately steered clear of D&D and created a whole new mechanic, and, in my opinion, have done it brilliantly.It takes a bit of getting used to but once you work out little things like AoE friendly fire and what the different bonuses and defences actually do then the game starts to make sense.  What about the story?  I'm impressed by the story and the whole world setting and I'm finding I'm getting drawn deeper and deeper into the storyline.  Yes there are some minor gripes but given the expectation for this game I think that Obsididan have delivered a gem.If you become stat-obsessed then I'm sure there are more faults you can find, but as far as just allowing the characters to develop and getting involved in the story, then I think it is a triumph.I have found the AI a little weird sometimes, particularly with party members needing micromanaging around other players to get to targets, but I'm sure the developers will be aware of this and will fix.And the game is....beautiful.  The art and feel of the different areas is a breath of fresh air from the constant 3D churn of recent times.  Those games are great, but 3D is not the be-all and end-all.Long may PoE continue and I hope there is more to come from these developers.  Combined with Tides of Numenera then it is a great time to be an old-school RPG fan!			"

												Wonderful RPG! I highly reccomend it. If you like Dungeons and Dragons, then you will love Pillars of Eternity. I found myself getting locked into the lore and the action of the game. VERY FUN! And it is made by the same company that did Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2			"

												When I was 14 I played Baldur's Gate 2 for the first time. It was the most amazing thing I had ever played because the story and world where so believable. It was like jumping into a book, or playing a chose your own adventure only in a PC game. Well, today.......I have been waiting years for Pillars of Eternity. There have been other games close it BG/BG2. But Pillars of Eternity was ""IT"". It was going to be ""The One""....And boy has it delivered! I am not going to write a full review because I need to actually do work today, then play more Pillars of Eternity when I am not doing work. But here it is. When your in a cutsceen, it acts like a chose your own adventure book and you controle the outcome of the story, every single part of the game you feel like you are part of and that you can take part in. The combat is refined and.....well...since the kickstarter lunch back in 2012, they have just made what I think is one of the best RPG's of all time!Thank you Obsidian Entertainment!  For bringing back the best of classic RPG's, and making them better!			"

												Personally enjoying this title. - Fantastic sound track, voice acting, story, lore and animations. Haven't played much of other games from this genre in the past and enjoyed them to this extent.I'm currently around 3 hours in at the point of starting this review, and I'm pretty hooked already. There's not really a great deal to falter with it. I've not encountered any issues or bugs so far during playing, seems to be one of the more solid games I've played in a while.Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a story that they can really dedicate their time to and sink their teeth into. The price is quite steep, but for a game of this quality, - that has you wanting more from the first 10-20 minutes of gameplay, it's definitely money well spent.			"

												If you're a fan of old-school roleplaying games on the computer, games like Baldur's gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape Torment, do yourself a favour and get this game. Though not based on the Dungeons And Dragons license, the crafted world is as deep and layered as any roleplaying experience you've had. And its a visual joy, shunning a lot of modern 3D grpahics for classic artwork and stunning 2D painted maps.			"

												I only rarely write reviews, but I was so sorely disappointed by Pillars of Eternity, that I was compelled warn others. After the many great reviews for this game, including a GameInformer Gold for Game of the Month, I was expecting something special. This game is dull as dull can be.  I was bored out of my mind after only a few hours, and now cannot bear to look at this highly uninteresting game.  Any comparisons to Baldur's Gate are completely off base! There is nothing epic about Pillars of Eternity, and certainly no story or unique perspective worth all the effort of slogging from one spot to another in this utterly lifeless ""world"". Sorry to the developers, I know you spent some time making this thing, but as something that cost me money, I feel completely disappointed.			"

												Firstly, I love RPG's, Loved Baldur's gate II 50 years ago.Would have to say this feels a little old, a little dull, combat is ok, greaphics are ok, dialoogue long.If you like lore and reading, fair enough. I usually do, but I found myself being bored most of the time.I can only recommend this game to more advanced players, and people who love D&D, this is perfect for them!If you are a little slow in the head like me or a stoner, and just want an RPG or a more casual game, I think you will have a hard time getting into this.There is a ton of character creation at the start, which is obviously great, but when you havn't even played the game yet and have no idea what most of it means, creating a character that suits you is tricky.There is no co-op? I would be so much happier to play this game with someone else and would just be able to get more enjoyment out of it.I can only assume that the older players enjoyed revisiting these vast lore filled games, and if that's what you want, you can't go wrong with this. love has been put into the game and there is nothing essentially wrong with the game.I still have to recommend because I know so many will still enjoy this.

												i grew up playing games like baldur's gate, icewind dale, neverwinter nights, etc and loved all of them. pillars of eternity really did a fantastic job playing to the nostalgia of consumers like us. poe was marketed as a modernized equivalent of those titles but in the end it really fell short. i really wish steam would change their rating system to stars/points instead of a simple thumbs up/down. i would give this 2 or 3 out of 5. but because of the way it was hyped and marketed, i'll have to give it a thumbs down. you can read all the glowing reviews before me, so i'll just focus on why i just couldn't bring myself to finish the game despite being nearly at the end. i really recommend that you play divinity original sin instead.character progression is very bland in poe. i remember agonizing over which skills to take in baldur/nwn because there are so many fantastic ones to choose from. in poe, a vast majority of skills are pretty useless and most builds will be forced into very similar paths. some levels you will be stuck with only 1-2 garbage skills to choose from. some classes and weapons are so overwhelmingly more powerful than others that you feel gimped not to use them. enemies hit so hard that you end up dumping stats like constitution. dual-wielding or two-handers are very tough to pull off without micromanagement. even if try to use different classes and builds, in the end most of your party will be in the mid/back rows shooting guns with the same exact talents. while your nearly zero dps tanks try desperately to hold the line.magic is really what really makes rpgs well... magical. there's nothing more satisfying than nuking your enemies with massive aoe spells. in poe, spell damage is pathetic. your casters, regardless of class, will be doing crowd-control and shooting guns for damage. all this together really made combat a dreadful chore. every battle began with the same formation, same tactic, same opening crowd-control spells, etc.on top of all that i found the story uninspiring and the recruitable npcs were painfully dull. also, their stats are terrible. in fact, you might as well just hire 5 random characters that you can build from scratch.

												This wasn't exactly the game I was hoping for from Obsidian Entertainment. I was expecting more.It's story is a save yourself story like the one in Mask of the Betrayer expansion of Neverwinter Nights 2. I might've been fine with it - if Obsidian hadn't already told this story once. The story also loses significance and meaning since you're doing it out of self-interest and the game becomes very meta with the game pretty much saying: ""Well you gotta save your own skin. Do you wanna play or not?"" This kinda storytelling is obviously transparent and generally very non-interesting from a writing standpoint or as a means to roleplay your character since you're locked into seeing the antagonist as an antagonist much unlike Saren from BioWare's Mass Effect 1. They put so much effort of putting ""backgrounds"" and ""dispositions"" in the game - but they really don't make much use out of these tools throughout the game.Mechanically the game *could have* been interesting if it wasn't for the fact that Obsidian has a weird way of understanding difficulty shift: Normally in both video and tabletop RPGs; the difficulty scales from being easy to being more and more difficult over time. However in Pillars of Eternity this happens instantly - so much so that unless you're a good mixmaxing RPG munchkin; you're probably going to be overwhelmed easily throughout the game. This is also becomes much more difficult because you can't rely on previous experience from the d20 system since this game uses the d100 system. This makes your understanding of good builds in previous iterations of this genre pretty much useless and makes the minmaxing experience worse as well unless you're willing to learn this custom d100 system.This way to balancing makes the game test you more as a player and your skills and less about your character and what skills it has. There is a reason why feats and magics in many tabletops are very powerful for example and that is because they're supposed to be meaningful in the context of the game. Generally a good RPG assumes that you limit yourself to enjoy roleplaying, of course this cannot be done all the time in video games and it might not even be suitable here - but balancing away from characters and more on top of minmaxing certainly shuts a large portion of players out from enjoying the game. Me included.So no I don't recommend this game. I think it's a poor attempt of Obsidian, especially since they're normally very good at making good writing at least. Guess people like me has to stick to traditional tabletop. :P			"

												Solid game. I began playing RPGs since the early Heroes of the Might and Magic days. I do look forward for some old-school-ish RPGs.Things I liked:+ Solid story line with vibrant background history of fan-sponsored NPCs. Really draws you in. Plenty of reading materials.+ Solid battle mechanics. Logical and reaonable counters for each creature/weapon type. + OK Map desgin, great aesthetics. + Plenty of side quests and tasks.Things I grew dislike the game as I progress through the main quest line. I spent over 50 hours and nearly finishing the main quest.- Attribute check during conversations. This limits the choices severely, especially during late-game. When your character cannot grow on their primary attributes, you will run in problems that your character cannot pass EVERY attribute check. Then what's the point of putting them there? Don't tell me I should have known this before I create my character. I started this fresh like a new book. Can this system be improved? Certainly, can the skills contribute to the growth of attributes?- Stat buff from artifacts/armors/jewels/etc... don't stack. Seriously? What is the rationale of this? And to add the confusion, some weapon buffs DO stack. Again Seriously? This is the first RPG I played have this kind of system, which really boggles my mind as why. - The loading screens. I understand maybe it's the limitation of the engine. But for some smaller maps, like entering/exiting a house, can we not have a loading screen? It shows up too much till a point that you feel sick of it.- The combat, although the mechanics/stat make it interesting for a while, the whole strategy doesn't change once you have a team that works, i.e. one or two tanks in the front and damager in the back thing. - The monsters will not respawn. And no experience from comabat. This removes a great deal of replayability because the game becomes quite linear. And making travelling a chore in the late game.I enjoyed immensely in the beginning. But the game grew more stale as it progresses and the fun gradually worn off due to the three minuses above. This is the kind of game that starts strong but finish feebly. Do I recommend this game? Maybe. Since finishing the story is what it counts for RPGs, I have to lean slightly to a NO.			"

Obsidian got a lot of catching up to do ito story tellin and narrative.- brought forward the worst from BG2 i.e. extremly poor AI and pathfinding, no new innovation and clunky gameplay. Dragon Age Origins nailed it which is the true spiritual successor to the old infinity games.- non memorbale areas, though beautifully drawn- lots of reload on nightmare difficulty, enemies run past your tanks and heads straigh to your wizrads and healersOverall, this game could have been so much better.

The graphics and art are very well done, and the story (so far) seems very good. The party banter isn't overwhelming, but it's there when you want to chat. Plenty of side quests. Little hand holding (e.g. no big arrows on the world map showing quest waypoints, etc.). The keep upgrade system is nice, this was one of my favorite mechanics in Neverwinter nights 2, and I'm happy to see it done in PoE. THe combat is well done, as is the magic system. The wizard class (my character) feels like a hybrid of the traditional DnD wizard and sorceror, which I am very much enjoying.  "

												Half a year after its release, the game continues to have significant bugs which at times render certain classes unplayable. World building is limited and rather generic. Party members join your quest for little reason, making their willingness to die beside you feel implausible. Although the game features nice isometric graphics and a combat system which allows a reasonable variety of tactics, its lack of an engaging plot and characters ultimately makes it fall short of enjoyable.

												TL;DNR?- Nicely presented- The depth of this game is the plot which didn't engage me.- The mechanics of play are very (very) simple and frustratingly lacking in the ability to do things you would do IRL if - confronted with the situations the game presents- You'll spend hours reading text off the screen.- Story ok in the telling - but cliched in the plotMy fault. I read a lot IRL so reading off a screen is never going to compete with a good book.So...After years of loving cRPG's PoE, which is a decent game, was the one that finally broke me.I had such a feeling of deja vu as I read the texts and listened to the dialogue. I guessed the plotline and most of the twists long before they were revealed. I felt constricted by the dialog choices that were often a choice between several options I would never consider taking and can't imagine anyone in their right mind would consider.Do you want to take;The terrible optionThe not so terrible optionThe barely adequate optionWhile never giving the often blindingly obvious best choice as an option. That and the story isn't really very good. It's ok, but aimed perhaps at teens and pretty cliched,Cliche? Well maybe. I suppose if you've not come across the tropes used in PoE dozens of times before, it might not be a cliche to you - to me it feels very tired and predictable but then I'm old and been playing RPG's since the original MUD in 1978PoE isn't the worst for this. It's just the one when I finally had enough.Since the times of my favourite cRPG's (BG1 and BG2) some games have come out with complex layered game mechanics and good AI that allow emergent gameplay and situations to occur.They rely on the players imagination as a story creator rather than what must actually be hundreds of thousands of pre-scripted words in a typical cRPG.  I much prefer those. Games like Dwarf Fortress adverture mode, Aurora, Cataclysm DDA where my imagination creates the story and the where, if the complex layered game mechanics say an action is possible - it's always possible regardless of consequence.The gameplay itself is simple. There is little discovery in the game essp when compared to the ability to wander off in games as similar as the original Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate 2. There isn't much room to exercise your imagination as the game, while having choices, keeps you on rails tightly between these choices. Just because a rail line has junctions it doesn't stop being a rail line. That's what this is. A very text heavy rail journey with a sprinkling of a simple game on top.If you prefer your fiction of the cliched type and your book reading to be off a screen with the odd bit of ""choose your adventure"" and a sprinkiling of a simple game in there somewhere. Then PoE and these modern text heavy  cRPG's are for you. I never felt empathy for the character I played, or as if I really controlled ar influenced anything around me other than in the most superficial and temporary way. I'm probably in a minority of cRPG players in thatI prefer to actually create, build and explore in an RPG, and this game doesn't allow the player to do very much of that.			"

												Don't get your hopes up too high. This is a metered recommendation. I recommend this game:- If you enjoyed BG1, without BG2, where you got to reach the awesome level of... six- If you enjoy IWD, with it's dank colorless landscapes, and its inhospitable NPCs, and your silent companions.- If you want to relive the glory days of the Infinity Engine, and are sick and tired of watching Irenicus monologuing. - If you can't stand the ugly UI and 90s hairstyles of Planescape Torment.- If you got suckered into playing Torment: Tides of Numenera, and are coming back licking your wounds. - If you enjoy playing the entire campaign with your non magic, mass produced, +0 Longsword from start to finish.- If your sole purpose in your fantasy roleplay is to slay the mighty Kobold by the thousands. - If you think Shadowrun is Eurotrash.- If you hated Haer'dalis, but want to see a cool Bard in action. - If you like overachieving halflings like Mazzy Fentan.- If you like Fallout 2 / Dragon Age Inquisition Trespasser DLC, where your noble efforts and thoughtless choices end up in an epilogue of tragedy.It's a serviceable RPG. Better than any other CRPG coming out lately. Go for it if you like Old school. - The story is Meh. I forgot I finished once already until I was near the end of my second play through.- The writing is slightly pretentious. The wall of text coming up when you reach someone's soul is at first interesting, and then quickly becomes a garbage bin for your local community college creative writing class. I don't care if you can fit a lovely story within three paragraphs if it doesn't service the overall quest. Your words are articulate, I get that; now, go sit in your corner. - The graphics are pretty... and also dank.. and dark... and gloomy.But despite these harsh words. I did finish it twice.			"

												Character Classes:There is a massive imbalance between the powers of various classes.  If you like playing a spellcaster, then you will probably hate this game because of the bizarre and excessive limitations placed on their spell casting.  If you like playing an Archer, then you may be disappointed because you are stuck with a weak pet, and when that pet (quickly) dies, you will be stuck doing wimpy damage.  The melee classes are all pretty strong, and they added a strange new type of melee-spellcaster that trumps all of the magic users combined.   It's almost like the devs hated magic users, but begrudgingly allowed one halfway decent class that is ""magic but isn't magic"" for marketing purposes.   In any case, this is NOT a pick-whatever-class-you-want kind of game.  If you play at the highest difficulty levels, you pretty much are forced to play a fighter of some sort.Gamplay:What gameplay?   Most of what you do is auto-attack and waiting for the right moment to use one-shot special abilities.  If you want more excitment, go play bridge or bingo.   This game is all about cooldowns, restrictions, and auto attack.  Once you (very) quickly run out of spells, you will literally be hitting mobs with a book.  Yeah that is about as fun and effective as it sounds.  There is no real strategy involved,  Just smash things before they smash you, and try not to run out of camping gear and spells before the end of a dungeon.Story:  The writing is a bit broody and melodramatic, and really a rehash of every fantasy concept ever written.  If it were a novel, I would be embarrased to have it in my collection.  It was not even compelling enough to make it to the middle, let alone the end.Dialog:This is actually the best part of the game.  Almost immersive.  Really if you like reading dialog, you might enjoy this game.   But you have to have a high tolerance for all the other snooze-inducing faults of the game.Conclusion:If you loved Balders Gate, but thought the combat didn't impose enough arbitary cooldowns and resitrictions, then you will love this game.

												PoE would be a fantastic game - but it has some rather nasty bugs.In only 5 hours I - repeatedly - encountered (among others) the following bugs, some annoying, some game-breaking.1) Tooltips shake and jitter - sometimes the tooltip, be it for an effect or for the description of an item shakes and jitters, making the tooltip impossible to read (or giving you an headach). All, in all, annoying, but bearable.2) Inventory items sometimes become ""invisible"" - your inventory is still ""full"", but there is no way to interact (or equip or remove) any items, as the slots simply look ""empty"". You need to Quit the game, completely restart it and then it works again. Rather immersion-breaking and especially nasty since you risk bug #3...3) Items in inventory or quick-use slot are ""lost"" when loading. Exactly as it says - you save your game, load it some time later and some of your items simply are not there any more. You had the item when you saved, but after loading that exact save it is gone without a trace.So, I cannot reccommend the game as it is right now.			"

												Just completed in under 38 hours.I pretty much enjoyed it but several things ruined it completely for me:- I got cheated out of most Achievements, received 8(!) for completing the game- the final boss fight is ten times tougher than the preceding fights in the game and mega-frustrating to say the least- the talking never stops in this game- the storyline is totally pointless- after 10 hours I had the best available equipment for my party, nothing better came up later on- the stronghold part is pointless- the loading times are a complete joke and I have a 16GB ram machinePlease bear in mind that I played through all of the old RPG's from Bioware and Black Isle, most of them several times.This game looks to me like the developer just wanted to finish it somehow and did not care at all in the end.

												I tried twice to like this game. The first time I played, I got a little way into the game and got bored. A while later I restarted the game from the beginning and got a bit farther along; however, I eventually got to a point where I had lots of goals but could find no way to achieve any of them. One in particular that I went after required my crew to kill a bunch of creatures so powerful that I could make no headway at all. I eventually stopped playing because I couldn't find a way to make any progress and I didn't really find the game to be all that engaging. Too bad. It looked like it would be good, but I just couldn't get into it. Interestingly, according to the global achievements, less than 45% of people who own the game manage to complete Act 1 (I did get that far) and less than 25% complete Act 2 (I didn't make it that far).

												I was incredibly excited for this game, and bought it instantly on release. Unfortately I'm disapointed, and although i pushed myself to play it, I found myself incredibly bored.First of all, the story is a big dissapointment. It definately feels like they have spent way too many resources writing lore and conversations, but they seem to have completely forgotten to make the game 'fun'. All the quests are boring, repetative and unsatisfying. The companions were lifeless and boring and unmemorable, half way through I ended up kicking them all out of my party and making my own. I just sat and skipped through a conversation of about 50 pages of a mourning lady crying about her lost son. I want fun quests, I want quirky characters, and I want a combat system where tanks aren't immortal and wizards and rogues die in a single hit. I miss games like Baldurs Gate and Neverwinter Nights 2. I don't even remember the names of the NPCs in Pillars of Eternity, but I've sure  got fond memories of Minsc and Boo, and Khelgar Ironfist! It feels like this game was too busy focusing on creating a dark grimsly world, and didn't want to make any quirky or lighthearted fun because they were afraid it would ruin the games 'atmosphere'. Personally I found the story of Pillars of Eternity a giant bore and I didn't become attached to my character, the NPCs, the plot, or the world.			"

Posted: February 19
												This game is a throw back to the old Infinity Engine used on games such as Baldur's Gate... unfortunately it doesn't really enchance the experience much at all. There are many nitpicks and unless you really want a nostogia trip, then I wouldn't recommend playing this game.First off the storyline appears expansive but it is a lie, the game railroads you via the areas you can visit and the quests/events you have to do. While you can do some things out of order, you'll soon enough always end out back on the same path. There is variance and the end does ""change"" based on what you do but as it is just narrated walls of texts, it isn't very meaningful, also many actions like wiping out all the NPCs in a town or village are ignored in the ending.Secondly, the exploration is basic and not very rewarding, most of what you find is just caves with no point or maybe rarely an additional quest giver. This is made worse by the constant fog of war effect, apparently your character is incapable of ever seeing more than about 30 feet away but can see through solid walls rather well. Naturally as this is going for an Infinity Engine feel, everything is pre-rendered 2D with planes to make it feel 3D. In-game models (PC & NPCs) are infact 3D. The interface feels sluggish for moving around the map.Third the combat system sucks bad, there is no default AI for any companion and so you either need to pause the game constantly to control each one or tell all to do the same thing. There is Party AI but it is disabled by default (why?), and even this had to be patched in to begin with. There is little foresight over how battles actually work and leads to oddly shifting between way to easy battles and then suddenly coming across a group of about 12 orges sat outside a cave. It just isn't well balanced and quickly becomes boring, it is more about how to exploit the battle system than to actually use strategy or tactics.Fourth, The quests are a mixed basket. Most quests are quick and simple, but there is a couple that drags on too long. There are some quests that are simple but never supply you critical details and so you have to just move around until you randomly find the right place or force you to get to some arbitary point in the storyline before you can progress them. Some quests have entire areas dedicated to them but have little much else making them bland grindfests to eventually get to the quest objective (I.E. Raedric's Hold). Fifth, There is one particular task which is to clear an area known as the endless paths of od nua... it is more endlessly boring, this area is almost a completely unconnected lore to the rest of the game with only a few things actually having any importance at all. It is suppose to be a challenge but really is just more of a grindfest to clear, there is a couple of bosses in this area but generally just kill everything and move on is the only point here. There is maybe a few encounters you can pass.Penultimately, Events/Encounters are about the most interesting thing in this game. If I have to praise it for anything then that would be it, unsurprisingly this is the areas where storyline tends to work the best too. Most are pre-scripted events that trigger after certain conditions so unfortunately is lacking on the random side but else wise these tend to be well written and executed. Sometimes these do have a lack of options, such as not being able to call out obvious traps, when they are really obvious, fake messenger guy who sweats too much and is clearly lying...Finally, The lore in this game sucks, like it really sucks. Mainly this is to do with the gods themselves, while lackluster and boring the game pulls a ""plot twist"" at the end that makes the barely average lore around the gods and some ancient civiliations just seem lame and terrible. Basically trying to achieve piece by constantly spawning wars, yeah... that is something in the plot you can never call out, the grand plan to make things ""more peaceful"" actually has only ever made everything more violent.

												If even the very thinking about games like Baldur's Gate puts a smile on your face - buy it, there is a chance you might like it. If you aren't into retromodernhipsteroldschool - drop it.I loved the old Baldurs, but for me, the Pillars were just... lacking. Something got lost along the way. I couldn't truly get into the setting, I couldn't form a bond with the new characters and the very game mechanics, where your keen-eyed ranger misses a paralyzed Cyclops at point blank range, started to annoy me much sooner than I've expected. All I saw in this game, was just a shallow and aged clone of Baldur's Gate, that should be left on a shiny pedestal in the museum.I suspect, that the source of my problem with this game is the Witcher 3. I played the Pillars shortly after finishing the masterpiece from CDP and couldn't stop comparing those two. I'm aware that comparing them is like comparing the banana to a hand grenade, but still - when you go out of new Lambo and drive back home in a Chevy, you will notice some differences. For me, Lambo wins.EDIT: I know, it is unfair to compare Witcher 3 and Pillars, but I have my reasons. Firstly, the games are sharing the same price range, basic Witcher is even cheaper than Pillars and you'll get a bunch of DLC for free. Two expansion packs that cost you like, 20€ together, are swelling up the game by almost 50% and are like proper cuban cigar: big, long and surprising you with multitude of different sensations as you enjoy them. Secondly, the main factor for me in every game is fun. I don't care about graphics, heck, one of my most favourite games of all time is the brilliant Dwarf Fortress. Anyway, Witcher served me loads of fun in climatic, immersive setting, while PoE served me a bit of fun in the beggining, just to hit me with a load of painful grind, lackluster characters, unintresting items and boring combat system. I would have more fun replaying the dusty Baldur's Gate with some nice mods!			"

												I'll get the, I know RPG's thing out of the way. 37, played em all. Like...literally as many as I've been able to get my hands on. That being said, this is the best I've ever played. Seriously. I'm not trying to be ""that guy"". Deep, deep, deeeeeeep RPG experience to be had here. As soon as I finish, I will start again. However, this game is not for everyone. I'm not saying it's the hardest core experience ever to be had, but if you're into killing a game just to kill it, you may want to move on. Because you're really going to have to spend some time with this. This is like a good book, you wont be able to put it down, and you will get a feeling of great catharsis from the time spent. Yes, it feels like Baldurs Gate/Icewind Dale and that's a great thing. Weapons are more interesting, you don't see those old D&D cliche's running around (don't expect to find Drizzt sitting somewhere...at least not that I know of).I don't have time to drone on about mechanics, 4th wall, ""realism"", bugs, engine, blahbitty blah. Because it works. It's fantastic. It's thrilling, tactical, deeper than a well in the desert, fun, interesting, and just flat out one of the, if not THE, best games I've ever played.If you're one of those big RPG nuts like me, don't spend another moment looking at reviews. Go, now, purchase. Seriously, why are you continuing to read this? Go bro...go. And may your journey be as fantastic as mine.7-15-15 *Finished it and was still as happy with it as I stated above. In fact, as soon as I'd beaten it, I started over again. All brevity aside, I really cannot tell you just how much I love this game. I'll be playing this one again after this next play through. So many little nuances and things to do in different ways.			"

												So I started PE and I've been putting as many hours into it as I can to get through it, while also enjoying the game. I had no illusions that this game would be quite large, but the scale of it so far is quite impressive.I've just finished the second chapter on Hard difficulty, my main character is an Aumaua Barbarian and I've opted to pick up NPCs as I go along. The experience has been great thus far, I got my face caved in early on, but after a few hard lessons I've picked up a few tricks to help me in the tougher encounters.The game holds true to older games in the genre, however, it misses some of the finer details that really bring the world to life. Sound effects are the primary point I find lacking here. Don't get me wrong, the ambiance and music is beautiful, though it lacks smaller details like shouts and voices while moving through cities/towns. I've also found that the music can fall silent for long periods, breaking the mood at times. But since this is my biggest gripe about the game so far, I believe vehemently that it is a small and oft overlooked issue, which bodes well for the future of the game.As for story and writing. I have been tested in my vocabulary on many occasions, and to my delight have enjoyed every minute of it. Obsidian have done a great job on the script and story so far and I'm eagerly awaiting more through the rest of my playthrough.cRPG's were one of my favourite types of games to play back in college and it has given me great joy to delve into this latest offering. I still have a long way to go, but in my opinion, this has already more than earned it's place among the old school greats.			"

												Short Version:If you lliked games such as Icewind Dale and Baldur's Gate you will like this one.  It does have its flaws, but overall it is a very good game.  I would give it a 4 out of 5 stars.Longer version:The good:The story is fairly good.  The UI and Graphics are really good.  The world is, for the most part, intresting to explore.  There are a lot of classes.  You can either make custom adventuers or you can find companions in the game to join you.  In general, it is a very solid RPG game.  It also has an interesting take on character statistics where all statiscs are useful to all classes.  For example, MIGHT is just as important to a wizard as it is to a DPS warrior.  Also the game has A LOT of voice acting.  Most of the stuff you can just listen too.  It is very well done.  At the end of the game there is a summary of your choices you made thought the game.  Your choices really do matter.The Bad:The class progession is fairly flat.  You do not have talents / feats that are pre-requiests of others.  It is not like you can make a wizard with 5 different builds.  There is only one.  The most specialization is if you pick a warrior and you can either pick Tank talents or DPS talents.  All others, reguardless of class, will do a DPS build.  Their talent trees just not interesting, just providing minor statistical buffs rather than new abilities.You get a stronghold in the game, which is a great idea.  What is bad about this is that upgrading it is fairly pointless.  There are events around your stronghold which are annoying to deal with and offer no benefit whatsoever.  Crafting is in the game.  You can make food, potions and enchants.  Except for some minor buffs, it really is all pointless.  Eating food that gives you +10 stamaina in battle is worthless.    Potions have similar problems, by providing minor buffs that do not do much despite using precious reagents.  Weapon buffs are nice, but only add a minor amount of damage.  I think if all my weapons had been missing enchants, I would have hardly noticed.When your party is in combat, they tend to get clustered.  When you select a single character, it is nearly impossible to tell where your selected character is in the blob of green circles in the middle of combat.Loot is very dull.  It is all just minor statistical differences and nothing really interesting.You can find lots of traps in the game.  You pick them up and add them to your inventory.  For some crazy reason, the entire party is only allowed to have ONE trap out at a time.  These are a consumable resource.  If you want to burn 10 traps killing some ogres, then you should be able to do so.  God only knows this game needs some kind of real gold sink.  Buying traps would not be a bad one.The range of spells is redicuously short.  Even the long range spells I would consider a super-short range for a caster.The Ugly:There is NO friendly combat AI.  Your summons / npcs will stand around doing nothing when monsters are right next to them (although there is a tiny grain of AI to start attacking back when they are engaged).  Would it be too much to ask to have your NPCS drink a healing potion when they get low on health?  Or to not do stupding pathing♥♥♥♥♥♥and run right up to a monster when trying to cast a heal or buff on a friendly PC?  Or not to walk over traps you have found....After 40+ hours of gameplay, the tedious nature combat really got to me.  I turned the difficutly down just so I could finish the game and see how the story turns out.Monsters, beyond the first few of each type, give NO XP.   There is so much combat in this game it is crazy, yet 95% of it is pointless as it has NO BENEFIT.  This is a terrible idea.Then there is the resting mechanic.  You need camping supplies to rest.  Only in the hard mode, you are only allowed to carry 2 units of this.  In normal its 4.  This should have been an option to increase the challenge of the game.  Personally I wanted challenging fights, but not this other restriction. It should be an independent option you can choose.			"

												Great game! I never played the previous D&D inspired games so I don't know how to compare it. However, I really enjoy the  overall layout and gameplay of PoE. Good graphics, voice overs, story, upgrades, and mechanics. A lot going on, and with 6 party members to control there is a learning curve for newbies to this genre. The only con is that the load times are slow and many. Every time you go into a new environment or a new dungeon or building level there is a load screen. This does not take away form the overall beauty of the game, but it extends the play-time greatly. Pillars is a title with a rich plot and wholly immersive gameplay for those willing to whittle away significant hours of their lives. Well worth the investment.			"

												Absolutely.  100% Recommend. Since Bioware was purchased by EA, Obsidian has taken the RPG crown and has brought us all back to our nostalgic roots.  As a hardcore D&D/Pathfinder player, I was really impressed by their home-built RPG system.  Each attribute is useful. There's a myriad of statuses/effects/buffs/debuffs that keeps things interesting.  In essence, instead of the CRPG using a role playing system designed for pen and paper, Obsidian has created a system that would be near impossible to replicate on the pen and paper scene.Love it. I see myself playing this for many hours to come.  And I'm not even done the campaign yet!			"

												Although it has a small handful of annoying bugs/glitches, none of which are anywhere close to ""game-breaking"", Pillars of Eternity is a wonderful experience for those looking for a challenging and potentially even grueling, lore-heavy RPG that will test your patience, sensitivities and your mental acuity.The combat system is something to be marveled and if you choose to play on a difficulty of ""Normal"" or harder, you'd better be ready to learn the mechanics on the fly and then be able to implement them with a teactician's eye or you'll pay the price dearly.If you're a fan of Min/Max, this game's character abilities and attributes will ABSORB you! -- Although, on the heels of this, there are a myriad of unanswerable questions I have with regards to character stats, stacking, supression, etc. Let me clarify, it's not that I can't do the research to find the answers, rather that these questions are impossible to answer in of themselves because the game provides no clear path in order to find them out, which is truly frustrating to those of us who can spend 2 hours rearranging items throughout the group in order to (hopefully) create the most effective/efficient stats for our characters and their abilities.Having said that, the freedoms that the game designers allot to it's players in terms of how they want to play a Wizard or Rogue or whichever and every class is fantastic. It truly makes the player feel like their group is their own and their playthrough is unique.Other than that, while the story is overwhelming at times, namely the lore, it is a great one that takes you off into so many different directions and you feel absolutely compelled to search EVERYTHING and learn as much as you can.It is a wonderful world they have created, of which, it's only downfall is the fact that your decisions ultimately don't truly matter or have any real, noticeable effect on the world itself other than a few lines of text and a conversation with an NPC who is meaningless (for all intents and purposes) after you do something potentially world-changing.Overall, if you're looking for a challenge and want to be absorbed into another world for 40-50 hours, you'd be a fool not play this game.

I like spending time while thinking how to organise the party members to reduce damage taken and deal more damage to the enemies. Calculations, stats, magic cooldowns. Making different builds for heroes. Autstanding. So close to old Forgotten Realms series gameplay compare to modern ones, you know what I mean. Thank you!			"

												Short Version:If you lliked games such as Icewind Dale and Baldur's Gate you will like this one.  It does have its flaws, but overall it is a very good game.  I would give it a 4 out of 5 stars.Longer version:The good:The story is fairly good.  The UI and Graphics are really good.  The world is, for the most part, intresting to explore.  There are a lot of classes.  You can either make custom adventuers or you can find companions in the game to join you.  In general, it is a very solid RPG game.  It also has an interesting take on character statistics where all statiscs are useful to all classes.  For example, MIGHT is just as important to a wizard as it is to a DPS warrior.  Also the game has A LOT of voice acting.  Most of the stuff you can just listen too.  It is very well done.  At the end of the game there is a summary of your choices you made thought the game.  Your choices really do matter.The Bad:The class progession is fairly flat.  You do not have talents / feats that are pre-requiests of others.  It is not like you can make a wizard with 5 different builds.  There is only one.  The most specialization is if you pick a warrior and you can either pick Tank talents or DPS talents.  All others, reguardless of class, will do a DPS build.  Their talent trees just not interesting, just providing minor statistical buffs rather than new abilities.You get a stronghold in the game, which is a great idea.  What is bad about this is that upgrading it is fairly pointless.  There are events around your stronghold which are annoying to deal with and offer no benefit whatsoever.  Crafting is in the game.  You can make food, potions and enchants.  Except for some minor buffs, it really is all pointless.  Eating food that gives you +10 stamaina in battle is worthless.    Potions have similar problems, by providing minor buffs that do not do much despite using precious reagents.  Weapon buffs are nice, but only add a minor amount of damage.  I think if all my weapons had been missing enchants, I would have hardly noticed.When your party is in combat, they tend to get clustered.  When you select a single character, it is nearly impossible to tell where your selected character is in the blob of green circles in the middle of combat.Loot is very dull.  It is all just minor statistical differences and nothing really interesting.You can find lots of traps in the game.  You pick them up and add them to your inventory.  For some crazy reason, the entire party is only allowed to have ONE trap out at a time.  These are a consumable resource.  If you want to burn 10 traps killing some ogres, then you should be able to do so.  God only knows this game needs some kind of real gold sink.  Buying traps would not be a bad one.The range of spells is redicuously short.  Even the long range spells I would consider a super-short range for a caster.The Ugly:There is NO friendly combat AI.  Your summons / npcs will stand around doing nothing when monsters are right next to them (although there is a tiny grain of AI to start attacking back when they are engaged).  Would it be too much to ask to have your NPCS drink a healing potion when they get low on health?  Or to not do stupding pathing♥♥♥♥♥♥and run right up to a monster when trying to cast a heal or buff on a friendly PC?  Or not to walk over traps you have found....After 40+ hours of gameplay, the tedious nature combat really got to me.  I turned the difficutly down just so I could finish the game and see how the story turns out.Monsters, beyond the first few of each type, give NO XP.   There is so much combat in this game it is crazy, yet 95% of it is pointless as it has NO BENEFIT.  This is a terrible idea.Then there is the resting mechanic.  You need camping supplies to rest.  Only in the hard mode, you are only allowed to carry 2 units of this.  In normal its 4.  This should have been an option to increase the challenge of the game.  Personally I wanted challenging fights, but not this other restriction. It should be an independent option you can choose.			"

												This game is really fantastic. For those of us who loved the cRPGs of the 1990s, this game is really satisfying. It uses a combination of text and cinematic scenes for some really deep storytelling. The companion characters are all very intersting and the character customization is quite solid. All in all I am very satisfied and am glad to have kickstarted such a wonderful game.			"

												I was hesitant whether or not to buy this game after reading reviews and in the end decided to give it a go.  Very glad I did because 42hrs in and I'm still having a lot of fun with it!If I had to describe it, I'd call it a cross between Dragon Age and Neverwinter.The main quest line is very in depth and I like how a lot of the side quests actually tie in to the main quest line.  I'm used to a lot of RPGs that throw in a lot of random side quests and do not keep the flow/immersion like PoE.  The character development is good in that you are able to customise the ability and skill progression for each character.You meet npcs that can join your party as you go on in the game, this is good and bad.  The good part is that these npcs open up new quests for you to follow.  The bad part is that if you have a full party then you need to drop one of your other characters for the npc.  Since some quests take a bit of time to complete, you can have multiple npcs hanging out in the party while your other characters stay benched.  At the moment I have 3 npcs in my party of 6.  It would be good if you could still do the npc quests without having to have them disrupt your perfect party composition :)I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone that likes adventure RPGs, well worth it.

The combat system is deep and interesting without getting tedious. The characters and voice acting are among the best I've experienced in any game. Items are interesting and varied. All of the tiny little details seem to have been attended to with loving care. Overall, these things add up to create an extremely fun, satisfying game.			"

												I -never- liked most of those old top-down RPGs. I tried one of the Baldur's Gate titles and I got bored after a few minutes. I tried Icewind Dale and my party got slaughtered almost immediately... so I was kinda 'eh' on the genre until I saw Angry Joe's review of it.My friend had it on his Steam account and our accounts are linked so one night I decided to give it a shot... and as I was finishing up the first act I said aloud 'Son of a ♥♥♥♥♥! When did the sun come up?!'.This game has made me totally rethink those old style RPGs that I did so poorly with and has even made me want to go back and give them another try. Given how stubborn I am when I make up my mind on something that speaks volumes about the game.What I liked:- The option to fully customize your team with several choices for race, nationality, class, and more.- A very useful crafting system that allows you to make consumable items like potions, scrolls, and so on. Early on you might be better served to sell most potion ingredients (especially if you're going with a custom party as recruiting party members at inns can get expensive), but by the endgame you'll be getting a LOT of use out of this.- A rich and detailed story set in a fantasy world that is guaranteed to draw a fantasy junkie in. I'm a huge fan of fantasy novels (special fondness for contemporary fantasy, but I like traditional fantasy too) and the huge amount of dialogue and story behind various characters around the world was something I really loved.- If you don't want to create your own custom party there are adventurers who will join you scattered across the world including a large gun-wielding chanter, an insane priest, a psychic cipher girl who seems to have lost her memory, a dwarven ranger searching for the reincarnation of someone from her tribe, and more. All these characters have fully fleshed out backstories that tie into quests for them, voice actors, and some really funny dialogue bits (I love watching Aloth and his 'alternate personality' going at it). In addition, they've added three new characters to recruit in the White March expansion set; a rather masochistic monk, a soul-infused golem of a rogue, and a gigantic barbarian woman.- During play you'll get your own upgradeable stronghold that becomes your base of operations. It really adds a lot to the game and sits atop one of the main dungeons as well.- POST WHITE MARCH DLC: They've added A.I. options for your teammates which, while they can be really annoying at first, are extremely useful. Just don't make the mistake I did and set all your guys to aggressive or else you'll find out just how suicidal Durance really is.What I didn't like:- Traps in dungeons can be a bit tricky to spot and can easily take down your party if you're not careful (sneak EVERYWHERE and keep someone with a high Mechanics score).- While the party members who you find along the way can sometimes get involved in storylines, your custom made ones cannot. One quest required a cipher (either you or this girl you meet in town) in your party to get the good ending but even though I had one on my team she couldn't do what was needed because she was a custom one.- Some of the fights can be downright punishing. The final boss of the Endless Paths of Od Nua is a stupidly difficult fight if you decide to go that route (you don't have to fight them, but that's all I'll say about that) and don't even try going up against the end boss unless your team is level 12 minimum. Mind you, if you LIKE that sort of difficulty...			"

												This is a review of the main game, without The White March.StoryThe story revolves around a ""Watcher"", a person who can read souls. The whole construct around the concept of souls rebirthing is new and refreshing in fantasy RPG. I like that very much.Gameplay / ControlsThe game is easy controllable by mouse and keyboard and looks very much like ""Baldur's Gate"". That's not a bad thing, because it's the right way to do it.GraphicsThe graphics are not uber-fancy but good and useful - better than any BG-redux, that's a good thing. In windowed mode the mouse sticks to the edges, so you can scroll easily, and it even works on a triple-monitor setup quite nicely. The HUD could stick to the center monitor, but I've not seen that very often in other games either...SoundThe sounds and music are on the spot and the voice-acting is great - remember, that's not some big budget AAA-title!ConculsionGet it now!Sidenote: if you play in german and you are from Austria: please read all dialogs of Aloth's second ego - they are hilarious!

												First, the bad: there are times when it feels like the game gets lost in the weeds, and the ""backer characters, each with their own unique backstory!"" quickly cease to be interesting.  It gets to be a little disappointing to happen upon a character in the middle of a zone only to realize that they're just another dull backer character who you can view the backstory of and then never interact with again.  A lot of the secondary characters just seem to be there to take up space, which is a tragic waste.  The main plot is really well fleshed out and full of interesting stuff, but if you start exploring the sandbox that the main plot exists inside of, you will quickly begin to see the hazy borders of the narrative world as NPCs that you can actually interact with give way to annoying ""backer characters"" whose backstories you can view, and that is all.That said, overall, the game is pretty solid. The story is interesting, and the supporting characters are fun.   Combat is both fun and challenging, the classes are interesting and offer interesting tactical choices, and how you behave towards others actually influences your experience of the game as you gain a reputation based on the choices you've made.   Pillars of Eternity is not perfect, but it is fun, and that counts for a lot.   7/10.			"

												The biggest draw about this game is possibly its biggest turn-off: that it plays exactly like the early 2000 Infinity Engine RPGs that the late 20's-early 30's crowd grew up with.There are some modern twists thrown in. But at the end of the day, PoE is unapologetically old school. Which may or may not be a bad thing. If you've played any of the Infinity Engine games, you'll be met with little to no learning curve here. The 2D, isometric graphics look beautiful. The gameplay is nuisanced and well-thought out.For the most part, it's exactly what you'll expect from its subgenre. It certainly won't win any awards for innovation, but it accomplished what it set out to do very well.Unfortunately being old school also means it doesn't take many chances. Fantasy roleplaying has moved on from the early 2000s' sensitivities. Audience today are used to darker, more edgy stuff. Compared to other dark fantasy franchises like Dragon Age or Divinity. PoE's adventure failed to reach the social relevance and/or emotional impact of its 2 main competitors.Perhaps my biggest complaint though is the plethora of bugs - also a staple of oldschool RPGs. Some of the bugs encountered are downright gamebreaking. We're 6 months into release and they show no sign of being cleaned up for good.The biggest reason for me to recommend this as a must-buy though, it's the fact that it is obviously a labor of love. And as a new IP it still has plenty of room to grow and improve. I certainly hope the franchise has a long and prosperous future, where I can waste hundreds of hours on.			"

												Easily exceeds the quality of the classics on which it's patterned. Every aspect of the game seems to have been exceedingly well thought out. The combat system is deep and interesting without getting tedious. The characters and voice acting are among the best I've experienced in any game. Items are interesting and varied. All of the tiny little details seem to have been attended to with loving care. Overall, these things add up to create an extremely fun, satisfying game.			"

												Absolutely amazing game. I played through BG 1 and 2 several times in the past and I tried to get into the enhanced releases lately, but new age gaming has spoiled me and I never did finish the play through.  Pillars of Eternity on the other hand has enough new age gaming features while keeping the old BG feel. I have a feeling this is going to eat up my life for the next month or 2.Great job Obsidian.

												No game since Baldurs Gate and Fallout 1+2 can be as good in the realm of Role Play. If you liked any of those, you'll not regret putiing in the hours into this. Everything is spot on, from music that sounds like it could have come from Baldurs Gate to interesting plots and cut scenes that will make you remember what it was like 20 years ago. Pros:Just about everythingability to upgrade items/keep for those who want to invest the extra effortPlot is interesting and well paced, and makes you explore basically the whole worldCons:Complicated game mechanics to pick up onHard to know how to level characters			"

												A fun cRPG that changes things up enough to feel fresh. It takes a while to adjust to the real-time style, but after a little time it starts to feel like the older dragon age games. It's in real time but in combat you can pause like crazy to pop spells off. The character AI is pretty sufficient to allow it to run most of the content so you don't have to micro most fights once you get some confidence. The game starts off hard to master but gets a lot easier as you learn how to manipulate your characters.The writing is well done and there is a lot of it. You need to like to read at least a little to enjoy this game. The characters are fluid, leveling seems a bit slow but I'm not that far into it.The story drags a little with the watcher concept being introduced immediately but you don't really have any clue why that's important until some other key mechanics are introduced, so it can be slow to hook you but if you dig on this style game, good writing, and a fresh take on the cRPG then this is for you.

												A well done and ambitious rpg with a lot of depth, cool design mechanics, and lots of build/spell/class variety..... that sadly should have been titled Save-Scum Simulator: The Save Scummening.The party ai is infuriatingly stupid and what you can script them to do is incredibly limited and most of the time they ignore that anyway.  So in most combat situations be prepared to try to micromanage the holy hell out of 6 characters.  It will seem like it's going well and everything is under control until something starts one shotting them before anyone can cast anything to stop it, or the friendly ai sh*ts itself so hard that the one remaining enemy kills all 6 of your morons as they fail to path correctly or they disengage for no reason and get critted for free. aaaand then you end up having to reload the fight and try again.... a few dozen times.Still a *good* game, just need to have a LOT of patience to play it.

												Impressive to say the least. Gripping story from the first 30 minutes of gameplay, fun combat, rogue like death is death, loot, gear, skills. This is what an RPG should be. The price is a little steep, but if you are into the isometric(top down) view, then I'm 95.34% sure you will enjoy this game. If the cost is what deters you, just wait a while for a sale. Every game on steam goes on sale eventually. I even get a little dungeons and dragons feel from the scripted encounters, where you chose how to react and your skills determine your choices for that specific predicament.A very well made game that is still being patched to fix small bugs. Looks nice, feels nice, and lots of fun. I'm surprised this game hasn't gotten more media coverage. Every playthrough can differ so it makes for really good ""Let's plays"" and live streams.			"

												I backed this on Kickstarter, though at the time I was only vaguely interested in it.  I didn't follow the updates that much either.  I'm not sure what I expected out of this game but I feel like I got more than I was expecting.  I really enjoyed game as a whole.  The dialogue and choices are great.  Nothing comes off fiercely good or evil in the game.  The setting while a little on the generic fantasy side does interesting things  with the concept of souls and characters with awaken souls that help elevate it.  The graphics, while not state of the art, are still very beautiful. The battle system is what one would expect from a game emulating classic cRPGs like Baldur's Gate and is both enjoy but also sometimes infuriating. This game does have bugs.  I ran into nothing game breaking personally. Just some annoying oddities, that will hopefully be fixed in the future.Rarely, do consider replaying a game but this is certainly one I will be revisiting.			"

												Tim Cain is My Master now!Well, Tim cain has been my master since Arcanum of Steam and Magick Obscura, which is my all time favourite game ever, and this game, from the conception of the kickstarter project, was effectively Arcanum 2 for me. The anticipation and the wait was tantalising to say the least.I can now say, with overflowing joy, I wasn't disappointed. I can duly recommend this wonderful isometric rpg. It has a rich story, interesting character development and attention to detail that shows the game developers do it for the love of it.There are far more in-depth reviews that specify the pros and cons, I simply wanted to add my view from the point of a hardcore fan of the genre and the game in particular.Buy this game, you will fall in love with it.

Combat is fluid but  tactical and complex, decisions matter and character building and fine tuning is essential if you plan to complete the whole of the game with all its optional dungeons and hidden super creatures.That being said, it comes out a bit short once you put 30+ hours into it and find yourself wanting just a bit more content, but I believe that happens because the game is so good you just dont get bored with it.

												This game is a polished one. It has been written with the finest ink, composed with passion and made with perfection. It has awesome story, captivating moments, originality and of course, terrific voice acting. Some say it's annoying, but I see the grief, sorrow and misery beneath each line. Everyone is desperate, yet cheerful, in a black sense of humour. There are eleven classes, in which you can find anything that suits you. A classical Barbarian of good health? A Cipher who can read your minds? The classical Fighter? The noble or not so noble Paladin? The far-reaching Ranger with his/her pet? The intelligent, acute-minded Wizard? The Chanter who sings in battles? The Druid who is one with nature itself? The sure-handed Monk? The sinister or benevolent Priest? The cunning and agile Rogue? All of them are found here. I have not played so much, I admit, but I have tried many of the classes, and the game is well-balanced. And I'm hungarian, so it is worth mentioning the Budapest Art Orchestra, who composed the mesmerising tunes for this game. Rest assured that it will take hours of your lifetime wandering. There are some bugs, I know, but these guys are working hard to stomp on all of them. You will get an absolutely amazing game for your money, it is worth every single cent that you will spend on.

												This is a review of the main game, without The White March.StoryThe story revolves around a ""Watcher"", a person who can read souls. The whole construct around the concept of souls rebirthing is new and refreshing in fantasy RPG. I like that very much.Gameplay / ControlsThe game is easy controllable by mouse and keyboard and looks very much like ""Baldur's Gate"". That's not a bad thing, because it's the right way to do it.GraphicsThe graphics are not uber-fancy but good and useful - better than any BG-redux, that's a good thing. In windowed mode the mouse sticks to the edges, so you can scroll easily, and it even works on a triple-monitor setup quite nicely. The HUD could stick to the center monitor, but I've not seen that very often in other games either...SoundThe sounds and music are on the spot and the voice-acting is great - remember, that's not some big budget AAA-title!ConculsionGet it now!Sidenote: if you play in german and you are from Austria: please read all dialogs of Aloth's second ego - they are hilarious!

												First, the bad: there are times when it feels like the game gets lost in the weeds, and the ""backer characters, each with their own unique backstory!"" quickly cease to be interesting.  It gets to be a little disappointing to happen upon a character in the middle of a zone only to realize that they're just another dull backer character who you can view the backstory of and then never interact with again.  A lot of the secondary characters just seem to be there to take up space, which is a tragic waste.  The main plot is really well fleshed out and full of interesting stuff, but if you start exploring the sandbox that the main plot exists inside of, you will quickly begin to see the hazy borders of the narrative world as NPCs that you can actually interact with give way to annoying ""backer characters"" whose backstories you can view, and that is all.That said, overall, the game is pretty solid. The story is interesting, and the supporting characters are fun.   Combat is both fun and challenging, the classes are interesting and offer interesting tactical choices, and how you behave towards others actually influences your experience of the game as you gain a reputation based on the choices you've made.   Pillars of Eternity is not perfect, but it is fun, and that counts for a lot.   7/10.			"

												The biggest draw about this game is possibly its biggest turn-off: that it plays exactly like the early 2000 Infinity Engine RPGs that the late 20's-early 30's crowd grew up with.There are some modern twists thrown in. But at the end of the day, PoE is unapologetically old school. Which may or may not be a bad thing. If you've played any of the Infinity Engine games, you'll be met with little to no learning curve here. The 2D, isometric graphics look beautiful. The gameplay is nuisanced and well-thought out.For the most part, it's exactly what you'll expect from its subgenre. It certainly won't win any awards for innovation, but it accomplished what it set out to do very well.Unfortunately being old school also means it doesn't take many chances. Fantasy roleplaying has moved on from the early 2000s' sensitivities. Audience today are used to darker, more edgy stuff. Compared to other dark fantasy franchises like Dragon Age or Divinity. PoE's adventure failed to reach the social relevance and/or emotional impact of its 2 main competitors.Perhaps my biggest complaint though is the plethora of bugs - also a staple of oldschool RPGs. Some of the bugs encountered are downright gamebreaking. We're 6 months into release and they show no sign of being cleaned up for good.The biggest reason for me to recommend this as a must-buy though, it's the fact that it is obviously a labor of love. And as a new IP it still has plenty of room to grow and improve. I certainly hope the franchise has a long and prosperous future, where I can waste hundreds of hours on.			"

												A return to the golden age of isometric western RPG's with modern standards of visual presentation and gameplay.Pros:+ Excellent art direction and visual presentation.+ Streamlined mechanics such as un-interrupted resting at the expense of supplies and frustration-less inventory management.+ New races and new weapon proficiency system.+ Retains the sense of adventure, progression, and wonder that previous games of the genre (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape) had in spades.Cons:- Overzealous use of in-game text and dialogue to promote lore and story; this promotes skipping dialogue content and it becomes difficult to separate important story and quest elements from the trivial.- Poor initial stat selection for non-player created party members; this encourages players to bypass otherwise interesting characters and side quests in favor of custom party members.Overall, I hope to see a revival in this genre as I cannot stomach modern JRPG's and their cringe-worthy character design and adolescent aesthtetic.

												Pillars of Eternity really deserves the praise and awards it gets. Obsidian Entertainment managed to create and deliver a refreshing isometric RPG that stands upon the shoulders of Baldur's Gate games, looks great and comes with the story and lore that in my case even surpassess the BG titles. Your companions also come with their own interesting personal backgrounds, which are really worth digging into. Helping some of them to find the answers to the questions that trouble them deep within, although in some cases it means finding out that the answer will perhaps never be found...Of course, there are several minor flaws. There is a lot of text to read - which might be a plus for someone like me, the performance would probably be better if the game was made in a custom engine. On the other hand, the voice acting is simply great (my favourite is Edér).That being said, I backed several Kickstarter games and this one is still my favourite and most polished one. Even more so, considering the time Obsidian was able to bring us finally something they own now and hopefully will build upon in their up-coming games.			"

So far the quests have been interesting and very well written, and the characters are equally interesting and well written. To me, it feels like Fallout 2 in fantasy world setting. 11/10.			"

												Hey guys! If you're reading this, then you're wondering if this game would be a good buy or not.I was lucky enough to come across this game when it was on sale and have been looking pretty hard for a good RPG.I've cleared what looks like half the map and feel like this game delivers on its reputation. For those that don't know, this is an Isometric (Overhead) RPG, a rarity among the RPG genres (In my opinion).  It is equal parts graphics and gameplay, with a strong emphasis on content (so you may notice some stuff that is lackluster but easily ignored and hardly noticable).  Character creation is fairly typical, pick your gender, race, sub-race, class, and a physical features from a given pool.The last time I played this style of game was when good old Baulders Gate and Planescape: Torment came out (Planescape: Torment being my absolutely favorite hands down), so finding this game was a god send for me.  You start out with only your character but quickly pick up other party members and can have up to six people in your party including yourself. When you go to an Inn, you can dismiss followers and switch them with someone else from a very user friendly interface. One really cool thing I like that sets this game apart is you can build every single character you recruit from the ground up. (Note: In settings it is set default to autolevel any main characters that you find to your level. If you're like me, you'll want to turn this off to be granted full control and customization of every level of spells, skills, feats, etc.)  If you find your party really needs a beefy frontline, or maybe is lacking a good glass cannon mage, you can buy a mercenary/recruit from the Inn (talk to the bartender for all this stuff) and again, build them from the ground up. They're the same quality as any other character including yourself. You go through the exact steps you did when creating your character, race, sub-race, class, gender, even their name.  This is also a unique feature in this game which is really nice.This game is technically turn based. A little tweaking with the options and you can pretty much make it completely turn based, or make it completely fluid (theres a lot of support for in game automatic pause settings. Each setting there is explained to simple terms which makes customizing a breeze). Another unique feature to this style of RPG is Reputation.  You can build a reputation by city (good reputation for helping people, and a bad reputation for screwing people out of their money). You can also build a reputation with each Important NPC you meet (like a blacksmith) as well as your party members.My favorite unique feature so far is the ability to aqcuire whats called a Stronghold. The name implies exactly what it is. (Slight spoiler Alert, skip this paragraph it talks about all the cool stuff you can do with this stronghold) It's a large estate surrounded by towering walls with various buildings scattered around. This place is pretty big. But its completely run down. You'll have to spend copper pieces and wait a few in game days when you take on a project or multiple projects and you can also hire servents and guards to defend it against invaders. Once you establish a strong security, you'll have your very own home. (And its huge.) The reason the above is my favorite among all the unique features is I've never actually had any sort of permanance in this type of RPG genre. It's always been quest, quest, quest, sleep at the Inn, level up, sell, buy, quest.  You actually have a place to go back to, a place to kick back and enjoy your rewards and efforts. You're no longer just some drifter/traveler who happens to be destined for greatness. You own land and a big freakin' beautiful place to call your own.Lastly, as is typical with these types of games, there is also just as much reading to do. But don't let this indimidate you or put you off. It's actually one of the best parts.  Especially when you have amazing writers. No matter how graphic and cinematic intense a game is, no amount of video can capture a moment perfectly like a well written sentence and and your imagination.Cons: Okay, I don't really have any complaints, but I do wish some stuff was better thought out. Like how you start out. It's kind of lame. And there seems to be much less emphasis on your character, so you sort of take a backseat at times. Trust me when I say, these game types usually have a much better grasp of who your character is, how you get to know him/her, and a clear long term objective from the very start to the very end. In my opinion, this game doesn't have that, but its still a good game and does make up for it in other areas.If you buy this, I hope you like it as much as I do. :D(I will be buying the DLC)			"

												Not finished with my first play through yet, but I can say that without a doubt this is the best game of the genre that I have played in years.  The combat is deep and tactical.  The story is amazing.  The writting in general is amazing.  This game has single handedly cured my gaming ADD, as I have played nothing but this since its addmitance to my library.  The skills and spells seem fresh from the same old D&D spells that I am used to.  All characters can use all weapons and armor, and there are tons of unique pieces of each.  You can make your own custom party or hire the NPC's scattered thoughout the world.  I pondered purchasing this for a week but even with the higher price (for a steam game) I feel I got my moneys worth out of this, and will continue to enjoy for at least two more playthroughs.			"

												Very worthy successor to the Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale style games. I'm nearly through my first time through and expect to replay with a different main character. The only 2 serious annoyances for me are the often poor quality of the voice acting and the fact that the supporter-created named NPCs were at first very difficult to distinguish from named NPCs who are actually significant. Apart from that, the environments are beautiful, the storyline interesting, and the gameplay and combat mechanics straightforward. I really like the adjustable speed modes and whole-party stealthing, which are significant improvements over the games that inspired PoE.			"

												How is it I never wrote a review for this game?Best RPG in years. I loved Divinity Original Sin as well but Pillars gave me everything I missed from the Baldur's Gate era and exceed my expectations across the board.All the good stuff in other reviews get a plus one from me....Minor drawbacks -Story and sidequests seemed to hit a climax at around 75 percent completion. The action packed middle portion of the game was great but afterwards the third act is a bit lacklusterOn replay it would be nice to see some variety for the first two hours of the game. I love the intro and the way its played it out is great for the first two or three attempts. Would be cool to see an option to either circumvent a portion of it or change the experience a bit more drastically through player choices.The stronghold is boring and outside of the bounties mission I would not have missed itThe depth of the combat is substantial and will require: patience, reading, and time to master (oh wait that's awesome too? damn couldn't get to four drawbacks but I tried)10/10 "

Walking speed is better, animations are smoother, looting is faster - it gets many of the old interface annoyances out of the way, to allow the player to focus on the game itself.On the story, which is what I consider most important thing for a game of this nature, let's just say I didn't expect to be blown away, but I was. The characters are memorable, but the world Obsidian have created for this game is a character in and of itself. And it works.			"

===-Introduction:First, I want to bring up two games which this game reminds me of to some degree.Neverwinter Nights, and Baldur's GateIf either of these games was to your liking then I highly suggest you try this game, just based on that.Pillars of Eternity is a squad-based RPG. Real-time, Strategy, it’s all word play here. You can play the game in real-time and use on the fly tactics to cope with the situation, or pause and plan out each encounter.===-World:Without spoiling too much, the selling point is definetly the world you play in. Obsidian has a history with storytelling and RPG’s in general, and that experience definitely shows here. A well thought out world, with diversity, each nation ‘feels’ like a unique with their own cultures.Your story begins in the nation of Dyrwood, a recently liberated people from an occupying empire, now with their own problems that you end up in the center of. That’s about as far as I’m willing to spoil, but I figure it’s not too much, seeing as it’s a common theme amongst RPGs.===-Classes and Races:Like Neverwinter Nights, and Baldur's Gate, your character is varied in race and class. Each class feels unique from the other, with some basic similarities. You can (as of writing) play as a Barbarian, Chanter, Cipher, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Priest, Ranger, Rogue, and finally a Wizard.My personal favorite is the Barbarian, with his natural cleave which goes well with lifestealing that is present on a few items in the game. However I’ve recently started as a Cipher and it’s also pretty fun.Each class performs well with particular races, but you obviously don’t need to min-max to enjoy the game. Races include (as of writing) the Human, Aumaua, Dwarf, Elf, Orlan, and Godlike. The most extravagant being the godlike (varying from flames, moon glow, shadowy death, to bark sticking out of his/her head. Each race has unique abilities and bonus stats to one category or another. In every game I play, I’m always a human.===- Combat and the ‘Squad’Combat feels like DnD. I myself am not accustom to DnD (and have never actually played an actual game of DnD besides video games), and have always played these games as pure numbers, but those who enjoy DnD such as DR, Crushing, Piercing and and the like will feel at home here.Some of your abilities are limited per encounter(combat), while others are per rest. The more powerful ones you will save until you encounter something worthy of a per-rest ability. What is per-rest, or resting? It’s exactly as it sounds. There are a few systems in place that utilize resting, such as abilities, fatigue and health. Essentially you will need to rest every so often in order to function at full capacity.The game also has a somewhat unique system of health and endurance. When your health reaches 0, you die, permanently. However your health is guarded by endurance, which is more like the typical health bar. It goes up and down, gets healed with spells and potions and is very vital to staying alive.The more exposed classes are the ranged classes, like Wizards and Priests, and some of the melee, like the Rogues. To protect these ‘squishy’ classes, you need someone like a Barbarian, or Fighter who can specialize in taking a beating and shrugging it off. This is what makes the game diverse and can change your experience each play-through, the builds and groups you make are completely up to you. Regardless of if they work or not, they are yours. Not some pre-defined set of party members that the developers made that you have to make work with your own character (though those also exist).Does this mean there are no unique party members with stories and quests of their own!? Of course not. There are 8 unique members who are voiced and have their own agendas and quests that you can help them with along the way. However what I was speaking of is something that I took full advantage of: Adventurers.This is my favorite feature of Pillars of Eternity and something that I believe only appeared in Storm of Zehir for Neverwinter Nights 2(it’s been awhile, also developed by Obsidian). Adventurers are unknown, unnamed persons who inhabit the world. They are essentially a clean slate. You can go to several places in the game and hire these adventures to your own party. Upon hiring you can customize the adventurer in the same manner you made your own character. You can choose their race, class, stats and name and they become a permanent member of your party. This allows you to optimize your squad around you, instead of you around your squad.===- StoryMuch of what I’m willing to give about the story was under the World section, but I can tell you that the story is very compelling, and is reactive to the decisions you make during your gameplay. (I hate spoilers very much)===-OverallGreat story, great squad system, great combat flow, very replayable. You should definitely get this game. I can see this game getting better as the series goes on. I also recommend getting the two DLC, they definetly add to the game in a good way.			"

												A solid new RPG in the old-style isometric style, Pillars of Eternity has many familiar elements including a party, pause-based tactical combat, dispositions, reputations and a world map spanning many locations.The best parts are definitely the world-building elements and the textual storytelling - whoever is writing this has excellent skills. The narration is engaging as well as your character's interactions with everything from people to collapsed bridges. The world is very rich with a lot of atmosphere and lore to go with it, and plenty of information in the cyclopedia to go with it.The music and graphics are beautiful, too. They do a great job at immersing you in this world. Despite it being isometric, the environments look beautiful, as do some of the more interesting set pieces (such as the Endless Paths).The party characters are interesting and unique, though not as engaging to talk with as I would have liked; due to the isometric style being a limitation in this case. What voice acting there is is excellent, but it was strange that so much of the game didn't have voice acting. The main quest and character dialogue should have had a bit more voice acting done, in my opinion.I do believe there is too much praise for this game simply for being unique in its time. I've played games like Neverwinter Nights and Fallout 1/2, so getting into the mechanics of this game was pretty easy and I was able to play on Hard comfortably for most of my first playthrough. While this game improves on visuals and better inventory management; as well as party management; there's not much else distinguishing this game from the older ones. I never really got into the main story like I did Neverwinter Nights or Fallout 2, though the ending was satisfying enough. The combat is alright, but it is very difficult to know what is going on sometimes when your characters are huddled together and you can't see what's happening under all the magical effects. Characters also tend to do nothing when on their own; the AI option should give more options for idle behaviour. There were also too many spells that do similar things; these could have been organised better, and given more ""per encounter"" abilities instead of ""per rest"" abilites. Resting is a chore in this game, when it doesn't really need to be.The biggest problem I had with the game is how limited the roleplaying is. So many sidequests involve two opposing parties, you are given a bit of context, and you have to side with one and kill the other. There's no delving into the true motivations of the parties (despite being a Soul-Watcher), so I always felt disappointed when I found no third option in so many quests. You also are forced to be violent or cruel in some encounters, no matter what kind of character you are; which is especially grating when a quest forces you to do immoral acts to complete a quest, and you can't even try the diplomatic approach. There should be an option to refuse to complete either of the tasks at one point. It ruins the immersion of roleplaying when so many obvious dialogue options or attribute checks feel missing.Overall, a very solid game that had a lot of work put into it, but doesn't really do enough to earn the 9s and 10s it seems to be getting everywhere. It improves upon the old formula a bit with its narration and world but also detracts from roleplaying and immersion, with no real improvement on combat or characters. Still, if you loved the old style isometric RPG, it's worth picking this up at some point.			"

												""I wish there had been a Baldur's Gate III"", you say? There is. It's just not called Baldur's Gate. Pillars of Eternity walks like Baldur's Gate, talks like Baldur's gate, and with good reason; it's entire purpose is to be a spiritual successor, and very much mirrors the same systems, approach and ethos.  (And even, in places, parts of the same UI.)I actually got this nearly two years ago, on the day it launched, but never got around to playing it until now. More fool me. I was prompted to finally get around to it by the announcement of the sequel, and I've enjoyed every second of it so far. It's pure Baldur's Gate nostalgia at its finest.			"

												I loved every minute of this game. For me, the highlight of the game was making a character that I could actually role play. Lots of the decisions I made in the game were made meaningful because I was able to flesh out my player character and experience consequences to those decisions. I was Gareth, a Bleak Walker paladin with a reputation as somebody who would solve problems as violently and aggressively as possible. Later in the game, that reputation helped me get out of a few jams as people were afraid to attack me. Gareth wasn't a bad guy, he just saw the use of having a bad reputation.			"

												Do you like Infinity Engine Games? If you like the idea of Isometric view, strategic/tactical combat, lots of control over build, and a ton of reading, you'll probably really like this game. Otherwise, not so much. Me, I love me some CRPG, with Torment being one of my favorite games of all time, so it's a no brainer. One thing though: the stats and classes will feel slightly off if you've played a lot of D&D. Int being a vital stat for Barbarians will seem very counter intuitive.  "

												A well done and ambitious rpg with a lot of depth, cool design mechanics, and lots of build/spell/class variety..... that sadly should have been titled Save-Scum Simulator: The Save Scummening.The party ai is infuriatingly stupid and what you can script them to do is incredibly limited and most of the time they ignore that anyway.  So in most combat situations be prepared to try to micromanage the holy hell out of 6 characters.  It will seem like it's going well and everything is under control until something starts one shotting them before anyone can cast anything to stop it, or the friendly ai sh*ts itself so hard that the one remaining enemy kills all 6 of your morons as they fail to path correctly or they disengage for no reason and get critted for free. aaaand then you end up having to reload the fight and try again.... a few dozen times.Still a *good* game, just need to have a LOT of patience to play it.

												This review is mostly for people familiar with the IE games, but others might glean some use from it.Fantastic game. Mechanics don't feel clunky - it's the infinity engine's soul with some twists. Pre-release I was worried about the twists, but engagement and the health/endurance separation both feel natural and fluid so far. Engagement allows for some more refined tactics via positioning; controlling the field of combat is simultaneously more intuitive and tactical. (It doesn't reduce to casting root/web or stuffing enough characters into a door that no one can get by.) You can read up on the endurance/health distinction elsewhere, but I have a high opinion of it. Encounters are balanced around endurance so they feel ""right"" by IE standards. Health (which appears to be 3x your endurance) simply lets you ""go on"" longer before needing to rest, which was a problem in the IE games, and would have been a problem here since PoE limits the amount you can rest.Thus far I've tried a wizard and a cipher. The latter is a fresh take on an old concept (grimoires are awesome and make enemy wizards exciting), the former is an interesting new development which might be familiar to veteran RPG players, but is drastically different from anything in BG or IWD. From the companions you get in game, the other classes seem equally interesting; I've rarely found myself sitting around thinking ""gee, this guy is pretty useless."" I won't get into Sawyerian idealism, but all the classes I've played have made intersting and useful contributions to the party.The game is also, so far, sufficiently challenging for an IE veteran (on hard with all expert rules except AoE visiblity). I've even encountered an area that I decided to come back to later since it seemed a bit too strong for my characters. If hard isn't enough for you, there's a mode for the masochists out there and also an ironman setting. I'm sensing a good challenge to be had, though I will wait until I beat the game to say definitively.The sound track is fantastic as well, in my opinion. The main theme is not incredibly evocative for me, but the battle music and atmospheric tracks are wonderful. The writing seems functional, but I've yet to delve deep enough into the companions or plot to comment on the overall quality.Overall, highly recommended and very impressed by the quality and attention to detail present.

												Great game! I never played the previous D&D inspired games so I don't know how to compare it. However, I really enjoy the  overall layout and gameplay of PoE. Good graphics, voice overs, story, upgrades, and mechanics. A lot going on, and with 6 party members to control there is a learning curve for newbies to this genre. The only con is that the load times are slow and many. Every time you go into a new environment or a new dungeon or building level there is a load screen. This does not take away form the overall beauty of the game, but it extends the play-time greatly. Pillars is a title with a rich plot and wholly immersive gameplay for those willing to whittle away significant hours of their lives. Well worth the investment.			"

												Absolutely.  100% Recommend. Since Bioware was purchased by EA, Obsidian has taken the RPG crown and has brought us all back to our nostalgic roots.  As a hardcore D&D/Pathfinder player, I was really impressed by their home-built RPG system.  Each attribute is useful. There's a myriad of statuses/effects/buffs/debuffs that keeps things interesting.  In essence, instead of the CRPG using a role playing system designed for pen and paper, Obsidian has created a system that would be near impossible to replicate on the pen and paper scene.Love it. I see myself playing this for many hours to come.  And I'm not even done the campaign yet!			"

												Although it has a small handful of annoying bugs/glitches, none of which are anywhere close to ""game-breaking"", Pillars of Eternity is a wonderful experience for those looking for a challenging and potentially even grueling, lore-heavy RPG that will test your patience, sensitivities and your mental acuity.The combat system is something to be marveled and if you choose to play on a difficulty of ""Normal"" or harder, you'd better be ready to learn the mechanics on the fly and then be able to implement them with a teactician's eye or you'll pay the price dearly.If you're a fan of Min/Max, this game's character abilities and attributes will ABSORB you! -- Although, on the heels of this, there are a myriad of unanswerable questions I have with regards to character stats, stacking, supression, etc. Let me clarify, it's not that I can't do the research to find the answers, rather that these questions are impossible to answer in of themselves because the game provides no clear path in order to find them out, which is truly frustrating to those of us who can spend 2 hours rearranging items throughout the group in order to (hopefully) create the most effective/efficient stats for our characters and their abilities.Having said that, the freedoms that the game designers allot to it's players in terms of how they want to play a Wizard or Rogue or whichever and every class is fantastic. It truly makes the player feel like their group is their own and their playthrough is unique.Other than that, while the story is overwhelming at times, namely the lore, it is a great one that takes you off into so many different directions and you feel absolutely compelled to search EVERYTHING and learn as much as you can.It is a wonderful world they have created, of which, it's only downfall is the fact that your decisions ultimately don't truly matter or have any real, noticeable effect on the world itself other than a few lines of text and a conversation with an NPC who is meaningless (for all intents and purposes) after you do something potentially world-changing.Overall, if you're looking for a challenge and want to be absorbed into another world for 40-50 hours, you'd be a fool not play this game.

												A fun cRPG that changes things up enough to feel fresh. It takes a while to adjust to the real-time style, but after a little time it starts to feel like the older dragon age games. It's in real time but in combat you can pause like crazy to pop spells off. The character AI is pretty sufficient to allow it to run most of the content so you don't have to micro most fights once you get some confidence. The game starts off hard to master but gets a lot easier as you learn how to manipulate your characters.The writing is well done and there is a lot of it. You need to like to read at least a little to enjoy this game. The characters are fluid, leveling seems a bit slow but I'm not that far into it.The story drags a little with the watcher concept being introduced immediately but you don't really have any clue why that's important until some other key mechanics are introduced, so it can be slow to hook you but if you dig on this style game, good writing, and a fresh take on the cRPG then this is for you.

												This is a review of the main game, without The White March.StoryThe story revolves around a ""Watcher"", a person who can read souls. The whole construct around the concept of souls rebirthing is new and refreshing in fantasy RPG. I like that very much.Gameplay / ControlsThe game is easy controllable by mouse and keyboard and looks very much like ""Baldur's Gate"". That's not a bad thing, because it's the right way to do it.GraphicsThe graphics are not uber-fancy but good and useful - better than any BG-redux, that's a good thing. In windowed mode the mouse sticks to the edges, so you can scroll easily, and it even works on a triple-monitor setup quite nicely. The HUD could stick to the center monitor, but I've not seen that very often in other games either...SoundThe sounds and music are on the spot and the voice-acting is great - remember, that's not some big budget AAA-title!ConculsionGet it now!Sidenote: if you play in german and you are from Austria: please read all dialogs of Aloth's second ego - they are hilarious!

												The biggest draw about this game is possibly its biggest turn-off: that it plays exactly like the early 2000 Infinity Engine RPGs that the late 20's-early 30's crowd grew up with.There are some modern twists thrown in. But at the end of the day, PoE is unapologetically old school. Which may or may not be a bad thing. If you've played any of the Infinity Engine games, you'll be met with little to no learning curve here. The 2D, isometric graphics look beautiful. The gameplay is nuisanced and well-thought out.For the most part, it's exactly what you'll expect from its subgenre. It certainly won't win any awards for innovation, but it accomplished what it set out to do very well.Unfortunately being old school also means it doesn't take many chances. Fantasy roleplaying has moved on from the early 2000s' sensitivities. Audience today are used to darker, more edgy stuff. Compared to other dark fantasy franchises like Dragon Age or Divinity. PoE's adventure failed to reach the social relevance and/or emotional impact of its 2 main competitors.Perhaps my biggest complaint though is the plethora of bugs - also a staple of oldschool RPGs. Some of the bugs encountered are downright gamebreaking. We're 6 months into release and they show no sign of being cleaned up for good.The biggest reason for me to recommend this as a must-buy though, it's the fact that it is obviously a labor of love. And as a new IP it still has plenty of room to grow and improve. I certainly hope the franchise has a long and prosperous future, where I can waste hundreds of hours on.			"

												Hey guys! If you're reading this, then you're wondering if this game would be a good buy or not.I was lucky enough to come across this game when it was on sale and have been looking pretty hard for a good RPG.I've cleared what looks like half the map and feel like this game delivers on its reputation. For those that don't know, this is an Isometric (Overhead) RPG, a rarity among the RPG genres (In my opinion).  It is equal parts graphics and gameplay, with a strong emphasis on content (so you may notice some stuff that is lackluster but easily ignored and hardly noticable).  Character creation is fairly typical, pick your gender, race, sub-race, class, and a physical features from a given pool.The last time I played this style of game was when good old Baulders Gate and Planescape: Torment came out (Planescape: Torment being my absolutely favorite hands down), so finding this game was a god send for me.  You start out with only your character but quickly pick up other party members and can have up to six people in your party including yourself. When you go to an Inn, you can dismiss followers and switch them with someone else from a very user friendly interface. One really cool thing I like that sets this game apart is you can build every single character you recruit from the ground up. (Note: In settings it is set default to autolevel any main characters that you find to your level. If you're like me, you'll want to turn this off to be granted full control and customization of every level of spells, skills, feats, etc.)  If you find your party really needs a beefy frontline, or maybe is lacking a good glass cannon mage, you can buy a mercenary/recruit from the Inn (talk to the bartender for all this stuff) and again, build them from the ground up. They're the same quality as any other character including yourself. You go through the exact steps you did when creating your character, race, sub-race, class, gender, even their name.  This is also a unique feature in this game which is really nice.This game is technically turn based. A little tweaking with the options and you can pretty much make it completely turn based, or make it completely fluid (theres a lot of support for in game automatic pause settings. Each setting there is explained to simple terms which makes customizing a breeze). Another unique feature to this style of RPG is Reputation.  You can build a reputation by city (good reputation for helping people, and a bad reputation for screwing people out of their money). You can also build a reputation with each Important NPC you meet (like a blacksmith) as well as your party members.My favorite unique feature so far is the ability to aqcuire whats called a Stronghold. The name implies exactly what it is. (Slight spoiler Alert, skip this paragraph it talks about all the cool stuff you can do with this stronghold) It's a large estate surrounded by towering walls with various buildings scattered around. This place is pretty big. But its completely run down. You'll have to spend copper pieces and wait a few in game days when you take on a project or multiple projects and you can also hire servents and guards to defend it against invaders. Once you establish a strong security, you'll have your very own home. (And its huge.) The reason the above is my favorite among all the unique features is I've never actually had any sort of permanance in this type of RPG genre. It's always been quest, quest, quest, sleep at the Inn, level up, sell, buy, quest.  You actually have a place to go back to, a place to kick back and enjoy your rewards and efforts. You're no longer just some drifter/traveler who happens to be destined for greatness. You own land and a big freakin' beautiful place to call your own.Lastly, as is typical with these types of games, there is also just as much reading to do. But don't let this indimidate you or put you off. It's actually one of the best parts.  Especially when you have amazing writers. No matter how graphic and cinematic intense a game is, no amount of video can capture a moment perfectly like a well written sentence and and your imagination.Cons: Okay, I don't really have any complaints, but I do wish some stuff was better thought out. Like how you start out. It's kind of lame. And there seems to be much less emphasis on your character, so you sort of take a backseat at times. Trust me when I say, these game types usually have a much better grasp of who your character is, how you get to know him/her, and a clear long term objective from the very start to the very end. In my opinion, this game doesn't have that, but its still a good game and does make up for it in other areas.If you buy this, I hope you like it as much as I do. :D(I will be buying the DLC)			"

												First, the bad: there are times when it feels like the game gets lost in the weeds, and the ""backer characters, each with their own unique backstory!"" quickly cease to be interesting.  It gets to be a little disappointing to happen upon a character in the middle of a zone only to realize that they're just another dull backer character who you can view the backstory of and then never interact with again.  A lot of the secondary characters just seem to be there to take up space, which is a tragic waste.  The main plot is really well fleshed out and full of interesting stuff, but if you start exploring the sandbox that the main plot exists inside of, you will quickly begin to see the hazy borders of the narrative world as NPCs that you can actually interact with give way to annoying ""backer characters"" whose backstories you can view, and that is all.That said, overall, the game is pretty solid. The story is interesting, and the supporting characters are fun.   Combat is both fun and challenging, the classes are interesting and offer interesting tactical choices, and how you behave towards others actually influences your experience of the game as you gain a reputation based on the choices you've made.   Pillars of Eternity is not perfect, but it is fun, and that counts for a lot.   7/10.			"

												A return to the golden age of isometric western RPG's with modern standards of visual presentation and gameplay.Pros:+ Excellent art direction and visual presentation.+ Streamlined mechanics such as un-interrupted resting at the expense of supplies and frustration-less inventory management.+ New races and new weapon proficiency system.+ Retains the sense of adventure, progression, and wonder that previous games of the genre (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape) had in spades.Cons:- Overzealous use of in-game text and dialogue to promote lore and story; this promotes skipping dialogue content and it becomes difficult to separate important story and quest elements from the trivial.- Poor initial stat selection for non-player created party members; this encourages players to bypass otherwise interesting characters and side quests in favor of custom party members.Overall, I hope to see a revival in this genre as I cannot stomach modern JRPG's and their cringe-worthy character design and adolescent aesthtetic.

												A great RPG, firmly rooted in the old-style glory years of PC gaming,It's very dialogue intensive, so I hope you enjoy reading. There's a myriad of lore and lengthy conversations to discover more of the game's history. Learning about Gods and old wars was fascinating, if you enjoy that sort of thing.The combat intially was confusing for me. Endurance is used in a strange way; damage reduction is very mathematical; four base stats for deflecting damage, But once that's sorted out, and you get a team with different abilities, it was tactical bliss -- perhaps a tad too easy on normal difficulty.Enjoyable main plot, tons of side-quests, always multiple ways to ahieve your goals: there's not much to hate for a RPG lover. Instantly I wanted to play the game again on a harder difficulty after completing. Perhaps that's the highest compliment I can give the game. "

It really is the spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate, only with improved  mechanics & more voice actors.

												First things first - this game brought me back to the days of the Infinity Engine games, just better. Walking speed is better, animations are smoother, looting is faster - it gets many of the old interface annoyances out of the way, to allow the player to focus on the game itself.On the story, which is what I consider most important thing for a game of this nature, let's just say I didn't expect to be blown away, but I was. The characters are memorable, but the world Obsidian have created for this game is a character in and of itself. And it works.			"

												How is it I never wrote a review for this game?Best RPG in years. I loved Divinity Original Sin as well but Pillars gave me everything I missed from the Baldur's Gate era and exceed my expectations across the board.All the good stuff in other reviews get a plus one from me....Minor drawbacks -Story and sidequests seemed to hit a climax at around 75 percent completion. The action packed middle portion of the game was great but afterwards the third act is a bit lacklusterOn replay it would be nice to see some variety for the first two hours of the game. I love the intro and the way its played it out is great for the first two or three attempts. Would be cool to see an option to either circumvent a portion of it or change the experience a bit more drastically through player choices.The stronghold is boring and outside of the bounties mission I would not have missed itThe depth of the combat is substantial and will require: patience, reading, and time to master (oh wait that's awesome too? damn couldn't get to four drawbacks but I tried)10/10 "

												I purchased four games at 50%-60% discounts this 2015 Christmas break, and I still haven't played the other three games beyond the first hour.  The story is completely engrossing and has me hooked that I don't want to leave and forget my place in this intricate book.  I purchased ""The Banner Saga"", Xenonauts, and Banished but I don't want to go back to those till I finish the entire storyline of PoE at least once.This game is above my expectations of what I thought it would be.  The number of items, crafting, building your own castle, hiring soldiers and commerce workers, the entire dungeon crawling scene, the story and drama, customizable characters, customizable skills, customizable weapons and armor, wow...  I can just go on forever talking about this game.  Every corner of the main path is packed with lore.  From a broken family leaving notes for each other and you finding them, to spoiled rulers and the freedom to kill every solder, peasant, and king in the game.  It's like Grant Theft Auto in the medieval times with magic.  The controversy with animancy will force you to make a difficult decision on how you will support it, or not support it.This game deserves more rewards, it's a classic!EDIT:  I'm 58 hours in and barely half way through the story on my first ever play through.

===-Introduction:First, I want to bring up two games which this game reminds me of to some degree.Neverwinter Nights, and Baldur's GateIf either of these games was to your liking then I highly suggest you try this game, just based on that.Pillars of Eternity is a squad-based RPG. Real-time, Strategy, it’s all word play here. You can play the game in real-time and use on the fly tactics to cope with the situation, or pause and plan out each encounter.===-World:Without spoiling too much, the selling point is definetly the world you play in. Obsidian has a history with storytelling and RPG’s in general, and that experience definitely shows here. A well thought out world, with diversity, each nation ‘feels’ like a unique with their own cultures.Your story begins in the nation of Dyrwood, a recently liberated people from an occupying empire, now with their own problems that you end up in the center of. That’s about as far as I’m willing to spoil, but I figure it’s not too much, seeing as it’s a common theme amongst RPGs.===-Classes and Races:Like Neverwinter Nights, and Baldur's Gate, your character is varied in race and class. Each class feels unique from the other, with some basic similarities. You can (as of writing) play as a Barbarian, Chanter, Cipher, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Priest, Ranger, Rogue, and finally a Wizard.My personal favorite is the Barbarian, with his natural cleave which goes well with lifestealing that is present on a few items in the game. However I’ve recently started as a Cipher and it’s also pretty fun.Each class performs well with particular races, but you obviously don’t need to min-max to enjoy the game. Races include (as of writing) the Human, Aumaua, Dwarf, Elf, Orlan, and Godlike. The most extravagant being the godlike (varying from flames, moon glow, shadowy death, to bark sticking out of his/her head. Each race has unique abilities and bonus stats to one category or another. In every game I play, I’m always a human.===- Combat and the ‘Squad’Combat feels like DnD. I myself am not accustom to DnD (and have never actually played an actual game of DnD besides video games), and have always played these games as pure numbers, but those who enjoy DnD such as DR, Crushing, Piercing and and the like will feel at home here.Some of your abilities are limited per encounter(combat), while others are per rest. The more powerful ones you will save until you encounter something worthy of a per-rest ability. What is per-rest, or resting? It’s exactly as it sounds. There are a few systems in place that utilize resting, such as abilities, fatigue and health. Essentially you will need to rest every so often in order to function at full capacity.The game also has a somewhat unique system of health and endurance. When your health reaches 0, you die, permanently. However your health is guarded by endurance, which is more like the typical health bar. It goes up and down, gets healed with spells and potions and is very vital to staying alive.The more exposed classes are the ranged classes, like Wizards and Priests, and some of the melee, like the Rogues. To protect these ‘squishy’ classes, you need someone like a Barbarian, or Fighter who can specialize in taking a beating and shrugging it off. This is what makes the game diverse and can change your experience each play-through, the builds and groups you make are completely up to you. Regardless of if they work or not, they are yours. Not some pre-defined set of party members that the developers made that you have to make work with your own character (though those also exist).Does this mean there are no unique party members with stories and quests of their own!? Of course not. There are 8 unique members who are voiced and have their own agendas and quests that you can help them with along the way. However what I was speaking of is something that I took full advantage of: Adventurers.This is my favorite feature of Pillars of Eternity and something that I believe only appeared in Storm of Zehir for Neverwinter Nights 2(it’s been awhile, also developed by Obsidian). Adventurers are unknown, unnamed persons who inhabit the world. They are essentially a clean slate. You can go to several places in the game and hire these adventures to your own party. Upon hiring you can customize the adventurer in the same manner you made your own character. You can choose their race, class, stats and name and they become a permanent member of your party. This allows you to optimize your squad around you, instead of you around your squad.===- StoryMuch of what I’m willing to give about the story was under the World section, but I can tell you that the story is very compelling, and is reactive to the decisions you make during your gameplay. (I hate spoilers very much)===-OverallGreat story, great squad system, great combat flow, very replayable. You should definitely get this game. I can see this game getting better as the series goes on. I also recommend getting the two DLC, they definetly add to the game in a good way.			"

												If you haven't guessed from the vast majority of the other reviews on here this game rocks. Just thought I'd add my two-penneth!Being an oldie myself (grand old age of 40!) I have been looking for an old school RPG to get my teeth into for years. Something along the lines of the classic Baldur's Gate / Icewind Dale (and the brilliant Planescape Torment) games that ran on the infinity engine.I'd recently tried the Legend of Grimrock game (not isometric but guess I was looking for an Eye of the Beholder fix) but got pretty bored pretty soon and was gutted. A good game, don't get me wrong but not what I was after.Then this badboy came along...Right from the character creation, storyline, music, engine, intuitive controls, monsters, quests, combat etc they've got it all spot on. Its like being back in the late 90's/early 2000's again. Although unfortunately I have alot more grey hair...So bascially what I'm trying to say is if you like the old classics above check this out because its bloody marvelous.Size-wise I've played 61 hours and am only just out of Act I although I am a bit of a wanderer and like to check everything out.They've released a number of patches (not that the game was at all buggy in the first place) and have already released an expansion The White March Part I and I believe Part 2 is out early this year so this game is going to run and run and only get better.Can't wait. Now hand me that ""Just for Men""...			"

												This game brings back the magick, wonder and charm of escaping to another world. If you like Baldurs Gate, fantasy, Dungeons and Dragons or anything RPG/CRPG related, this is a must have.			"

												Fantastic game, took me a few starts though to figure out the trick to playing it.  What's the trick you ask? Make your first character as role playing rich as possible. Don't make that 'jack of all traits', make that zelot, that cruel at heart, or that save the everything Paladin... Rely on your party to actually do stuff like picking locks and killing stuff.			"

												Let's get the negative stuff out of the way. This is an incredibly dense game, especially starting off. There's a reason so many fantasy RPGs start your character off with amnesia, or as a sheltered farmboy just entering the wider world. It lets them introduce the setting and the conflicts to the player along with their character. Pillars of Eternity doesn't do that. It's not interested in telling that kind of story, and while ultimately the kind of story it is interested in telling is one of the most interesting and worthwhile in any RPG I've played, the lack of protagonist naivete does give the game a serious sense of information overload at the start. This isn't helped by the sheer amount of text. The kickstarter budget shows through when you hit New Game and are greeted with a scrolling textbox instead of an opening cinematic. Scripted obstacles, character descriptions, and a lot of other aspects of the game are printed instead of rendered. This isn't ultimately a bad thing, it's some of the best descriptive text I've seen in any game, better than a number of fantasy novels I've read, but there is a lot of it, and in order to really immerse yourself in the game you're going to need to put in effort to read and understand it. This style of delivery isn't bad, but it is very understandable if a lot of players don't want to put that much effort in to get their entertainment.Mechanically as an RPG the game is functional. It works differently than the Dungeons and Dragons simulators that it's stylistically aping, with an emphasis on designing the game to work well in a digital setting as opposed to adapting a system written for a tabletop setting, and the end result is certainly functional enough, with little to complain about. But whenever you're interacting with the perfectly serviceable tactical combat, you're NOT interacting with the game's biggest strength: The writing.The story in Pillars of Eternity is incredible. Instead of the classic heroes journey of self-discovery, you play as an older character with a fair sense of yourself on a quest for understanding in a country gripped with self-doubt. The looming crisis is not an oncoming invasion of dark forces, but rather the uncertain consequences of history, ancient and recent. This is a story about the aftermath of war, rather than a tale of the war. The ideas and themes of the story as well as the plot are developed with a depth and deftness I haven't seen since classics like Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment, and like Planescape this is a story that's going to stick with me long after the credits stop rolling. I could talk for an hour about the story of this game and probably will as soon as I can find someone who will listen, but doing so here would get into spoiler territory, and if you're not afraid of the text-heavy presentation or the old-school style, you really owe it to yourself to play through this.

												Pillars features a play-style reminisent of old school RPGs such as Baldur's Gate, but with a new story and more modern graphics/interface. A few different difficulty levels for people who prefer a more relaxing game style or conversely those who prefer a very challenging game. Excellent story-line, loads of character classes and races available. Build a stronghold, create companions or simply find them along the way.This game is quite simply fantastic.			"

												+ Style definitely reminiscent of the oldschool classics+ Mechanics inspired by tabletop RPG's, but not bound by their restrictions+ Interesting, believable setting+ Good story+ Satisfying progression+ Mature without forced 'grimdarkness' (most of the time)- Long loading times- FPS drops in areas with many NPC's- Arguably too somber and depressing at timesOverall pros far outweigh the cons. Strong 8,5/10			"

												I tried one of the older isometric RPG's and Pillars of Eternety is so much easier to get into, while still giving you the Baulder's Gate/D&D feel you're looking for. If you aren't ok with shelling out $70 for the game and the expansions, wait for a sale. It's what I should have done. A year later and I'd still say $70 is actually a fair price for the game and it's two expansions, because IMO it's a GREAT game. The reason I mention that is because included in the expansions are some mechanics upgrades, which has me wanting to wait to play till I can pick them up.			"

												If you haven't guessed from the vast majority of the other reviews on here this game rocks. Just thought I'd add my two-penneth!Being an oldie myself (grand old age of 40!) I have been looking for an old school RPG to get my teeth into for years. Something along the lines of the classic Baldur's Gate / Icewind Dale (and the brilliant Planescape Torment) games that ran on the infinity engine.I'd recently tried the Legend of Grimrock game (not isometric but guess I was looking for an Eye of the Beholder fix) but got pretty bored pretty soon and was gutted. A good game, don't get me wrong but not what I was after.Then this badboy came along...Right from the character creation, storyline, music, engine, intuitive controls, monsters, quests, combat etc they've got it all spot on. Its like being back in the late 90's/early 2000's again. Although unfortunately I have alot more grey hair...So bascially what I'm trying to say is if you like the old classics above check this out because its bloody marvelous.Size-wise I've played 61 hours and am only just out of Act I although I am a bit of a wanderer and like to check everything out.They've released a number of patches (not that the game was at all buggy in the first place) and have already released an expansion The White March Part I and I believe Part 2 is out early this year so this game is going to run and run and only get better.Can't wait. Now hand me that ""Just for Men""...			"

												The game is great.  A few bugs that can be annoying but its very isolated and not everyone is running into them.  Better than any other obsidian game as far a bugs go.  Give it a few weeks and I would not be shocked if its pretty much bug free.  I do wish they would of put the full game into early access then I believe we would see no bugs in the game.  People that want to be spoiled will test and people that dont want to will avoid beta.  The only other crit I would have for the game is the Stronghold is kinda shallow.  Guess I was expecting something like NWN2 but only deeper.  This stronghold is kinda lame.  But since this is just an extra thing I dont ding too much off the score but I would of loved to see more.9/10			"
