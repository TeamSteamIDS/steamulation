												I really like this game, although I need to admit I am a fan of just about most things related to King Arthur.  I've been playing the game a lot recently, and am currently on my third time going through it (Played it on Easy and then Normal, and now on Hard).  Before I go on though, let me explain that when I play a game with as many options or adventure/story arcs that this game has to offer, I will milk it for all it's worth, and play the living H**L out of it, exhausting my options completely.  That being said, I've found a lot of enjoyment in this game, particularly since it revolves around King Arthur.As a stand alone RTS, it is average.  The game play runs well, although I can understand others being frustrated with the speed (I'm just a very patient person, I guess.)  The choices you get in troops is wide ranged and very detailed.  The same goes for the Knights as well (although I find that there ought to be another 1 or 2 Warlord options).  When you've gotten the hang of balancing the Knights along with their strengths, it makes the game a lot easier (at least that was what I experienced during the Normal difficulty setting).With items and weapons that become better through Battles, it quickly becomes  grindfest (which I find that people either love doing or hate doing.  Guess which group I fall under...? *lol*).  And with the options of releasing your prisoners to be left out on the map with a pittance of an army to build from again, it can easily become very manipulative and easy to ""level up"" your equipment.All in all though, I have to say that I'm most impressed with the amount of depth the game has in terms of how many different adventures can be unlocked.  With the theoretical options of 4 different extremes you can take in this game, it opens up quite a bit of variety.So if you're the kind of player who casually enjoys RTS, with the occasional grindfesting, this game is enjoyable.  Admittedly, my bias and love for King Arthur mythology allowed me to enjoy it more, but even to the casual RTS player, I think this game is fun.			",35,10,0,12,1,1,18

												This game was recommended to me by Angry Joe, I checked out his review and was instantly interested into playing this. I love Total war to death (you can see I played shogun 2 for like 300+ hours) but I also love RPG’s like Dragon Age, Final Fantasy, and Skyrim, this was a very ambitious move on Neocore games and it very well paid off. Let me just go over the pros and consPros:+ The Knights of the Round: Your Knights are basicly the generals from Total war only they are supped up can kick but and take names, much like an actual RPG character they level up, learn new skills, go on quests, and gain weapons and armor, Plus who always wanted their general to wipe out an entire platoon by firing a lightning bolt.+ Total War Mythology!?: Unlike in Total war this game features Creatures and monsters from various celtic mythos both evil and good….perhaps a new Age of Mythology is in order?+ RPG Quests: On the map you will encounter various RPG Text style quests that your knights can go on, to gain EXP, Units, Abilities, and so on, these are key to continue the story and earn better stuff as you conquer Britannia.+ Moral Alignment in Many Areas: Besides the Obvious Good and Evil (Righteous and Tyrant) there is also a Religious Alignment where you can either be a good Christian or continue the Old Ways, All Alignments have various benefits and you can go many ways like Tyrannical Christian or Righteous Old Ways ect.+Plays like Total war: If you love Total War it’s a very close replica of Total war, Granted it dose have a few flaws.+ Legendary Weapons and Armor: Collect Various Weapons and Armor to Deck out your Knights to make them more Lethal.Cons:-	Your King Arthur…..and you don’t play as him??: Yeah despite you being King Arthur and having Excalibur “The Most Powerful Weapon in Britannia” You can’t actually use him in combat at all….or anything really…You can’t participate in Quests, or Join a Battle…Or Use Excalibur-	Can’t Get the TRUE Knights of the Round: I’m abit of a historic nut but I have to place this as a con, If your trying to do a play by play of the Actual Arturian Legend your SOL because of the Morality system a lot of the Classic Knights of the Round you cannot obtain, In my Case I was a Righteous Old Faith King sooo I couldn’t get Gawain or Gallahad because I wasn’t a Tyrant or a Christian-	Time Limit!?!?: Surprisingly there is a Time limit in the game by how many turns you can use, at a certain point in the game you will be unable to complete any more quests due to a event, hell you’ll skip several chapters if your too slow-	  Broken A.I: You HAVE to play this game on Easy, on Normal or Hard the A.I Breaks the game by producing units faster than you can and doing cheap tactics-	Auto Battle Whats That??: The Auto Battle is useless, forcing you to play every single battle!-	Reading…Zzzz: If you don’t like Reading your gonna fall asleep on some of the Quests-	Chapter Jumping: Your going to be jumping chapters like Crazy after Chapter 1, I haven’t even finished a quest for Chapter 2 and I already get Quests for Chapters 3 and 4-	Mythos Units OP: If you don’t have any Mythos Units your soldiers are going to get their buts kicked, Even the Lowest Teir Mythos Units can Own your Highest Teir Soldiers (Thus making you WANT to play Old Faith 80% of the time) In the End though Despite my Cons its still a Solid Game Regardless it just needs some fine tuning here and there, If most of these Cons are Fixed in Future Titles then King Arthur can be a Legend, but for now it’s a Ambitious Title that Works but could use some Improvements Score: C- ",3,3,0,5,7,0,8

												I SOOO want to reccomend this game.  But it gets more frustrating with every hour that I play it.  And not because of any sort of fairly designed challenge.Starting with the pros:The environment of King Arthur is good.  And this game has RPG elements that give your kingdom more character than you get in Total War.  There are lots of these side quests that are kind of like those text choose your own adventure stories.  And you will get alignment points from them that will affect your kingdom and unlock powers and units.  That was the main draw that got me to play this game, and I'm not dissapointed in that regard.  And the cons/long winded rant:The design of this game is INFURIATING at times!   To start with, YOU CANNOT RECRUIT UNITS until you do the first story quest involving restoring excalibur's power.  This doesn't sound like a problem, and normally it wouldn't be in a tutorial where you aren't getting attacked yet.  However, before or right after you get that quest you get a prompt about this civil war that you need to pick a side on.  In ignorance you might say ""hey that sounds cool, let's do that first.""  GOD HELP YOU if you do that because the units you lose picking a side you cannot replace.  Did the game tell me that I couldn't recruit until I did this quest?  NO!   I ended up restarting several times because I literally got wiped out of units and had no way to regain them.Maybe I just need to be more careful with conserving units?  Clearly this is just the rage of some guy who games from his parent's basement, and badly at that.   Well first, I game upstairs in my parents house, thank you.  Second, caring for your units is way easier said than done.  I could discuss how poorly the units handle, and the lack of army formations, but it doesn't matter.  Archers will SLAUGHTER your heavily armored troops, and cavalry will flank the archers. Oh, did I mention cavalry?  Because you need to research to get that.  How do you research?  You have to conquer your way through or negotiate with kingdoms who all outnumber and outgun you to conquer a stronghold that gains you research points.  Until then enjoy the much faster mounted forces beating you to the victory points that you have to capture to help win.  Then assuming you survive that which I did, and you research some better units which I did, you may now enjoy the unfair realm of enemy magic.  Three words.  Curse... of... Shadows.  It's a BS spell that can be cast halfway across the battlefield, and can strike a unit dead.  Or a group of units if you don't know it's coming.  Don't give me that nonsense about this being a strategy game and there being protection against magic.  The enemy on NORMAL difficulty should not have a superweapon level spell as early as late in Chapter 1 or Chapter 2.  PERIOD.  END OF STORY.  And last but not least the RIDICULOUS extent to which you are outnumbered on the campaign.  After conquering more than half of Brittania your people will be going hungry to maintain three armies.  I am currently battling King Cedyrn or something like that to the west.  From an empire a third the size of mine IN THE MOUNTAINS, he has at least a half a dozen armies.  All of them are more powerful than mine.   Is he feeding them with virgins and magic beans.  Did he make a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to get more power.  Because if he did, ALL MAGIC HAS A PRICE! So do I recommend this game?  As if anybody cares.  No I do not.  But I'm going to play it anyway.  I know I will.  Because it's Arthurian myth, and I want to see if I can get to the point where I can get mythical units and some of the really powerful magic.  That may be where the fun in this game is.  But right now, I'm just fried with this blatantly unfair experience.   Why do you hurt me like this developers?  Just why?			",35,6,0,18,13,0,24

												Whilst I do not deny this concept could offer more that does no mean this is a bad game. On the contrary it is a fun and new experience. Regarding the battles, why they do have a similar concept to the Total War series I think the small size and use of magic adds a degree of immersion that otherwise would be missed, it reminded me slightly of the Warhammer tabletop game with the heroes, magic, etc. Overall it gets a 7.5/10 from me.

												I am loving this game. Proper 4X strategy in a familiar format. Great campaign, karma system with good and evil on one axis, and old druid faith vs christianity on the other axis. Heroes can be recruited and maintained throughout the campaign, which can level up and be given new abilities, spells, and equipment. 9/10 so far. My only complaint is some slight trouble with selecting enemy units in battles, occasionally have to pause the game and move the mouse around for a few seconds before you can select the correct unit. Not going to stop me from continuing my takeover of Britannia			",123,29,1,33,22,0,34

												great idea for setting the game in Arhturian legend.nice design and music. pretty strategic map.but the game is crippled in it's essense and I cannot recommend it. Fighting battles are poor, imbalance and have nothing in compare to total war series, which this game try to be. I can destroy everything with magic and is enormously frustrating when enemy kill your experience veteran troops with fireball and storm. very little progress since the first game. I would like to like this game, but i cannot. buy in bundles, play with no expectation.			",285,99,4,44,39,4,69

												Knight WarA fun variation on Total War gameplay. Teleport your Cavalry into the archers, clear an entire regiment with a giant, smite your foes with lightning. The choose your own adventure style quest prompts are pretty interesting, and numerous enough to keep you guessing. On the other hand, it takes forever. 100 hours is one playthrough, and its not all interesting. I recall the endgame as a lot of wandering around stomping down rebellion, trying to capture all of England, finally.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I decided to come back to this game about a year or so after the last time I played.  It is a really challenging game that is best described as Total War - Fantasy.  The key tactical strategy on the battle maps is deciding when / how to use special abilities and spells.  There is not flanking or morale for individual units (there is an overall battle morale).  For $10 or less if you get it on sale the game should provide you with many hours of fun.It has a nice story and allows you a few different ways to play (Rightful vs Tyrnat and Christian vs Old Faith).  Game is a lot of fun and I recomend it to anyone who is a fan of total war games (keeping in mind that it is almost 5 years old).Also there are a number of people complaining that the game does not work or crashes a lot.  Just get the Demo to make sure it works for you.  I have played it on Win XP, Win 7, and Win 8.1.  On my most recent sting on Win 8.1 I have had 1 crash to desktop in about 18 hours played.

												If any game could challange the supremacy of the Total War series... this game would be it. It adds an awesome RPG and story based element to the strategy game genere and it is done quite well. Graphically, the game is quite beautiful and there is a nice variety of units and hero customization. That being said the game can be quite hard with the resource management and because of the somewhat linear story and function ""time movement"", you can feel rushed to complete missions and story objectives in time. The AI can also be quite brutal and you will have to control your armies in the field alot to even try to acheive virtocy without losing half your armies. Also your limit pool of heroes is quite small and you'll find yourself eventually dismissing heroes, you fought so hard to get in the beginning, as new ones appear. Some of the story missions become a wall of text and a type of 'Choose your own adventure"" books, where a wrong decision can alter the outcome and hurt you in an upcoming battle. But to be honest i just nitpicking on a game I obviously love and would recommend to other strategy fans.			",50,8,0,37,19,0,33

												Awsome game, its one of the best strategy/rpg type games ive played. + interesting story+ lots of units+ create your own round table+ quests con be solved in ways, that dont involve violance+ epic battles- some heroes have very high prices for their loyalty (and you dont konw the price beforehand, so you can end up with characters that will have opposite loyalty prices, like be good or be bad)- archers are too damn strong (an army of only archers can destroy almost anny opponent)- some ennemys are too strong, their morale never drop- earned loot is bound to the character that earned it- the ennemy can winn the battle, even if outnumbered, because he has 3 out of 4 strategic (or special) point on the map (and im not talking about 1000 soldiers to 1100 soldiers, no im talking about 100 soldiers to 1000 soldiers (bull**** cavalry, always runs away!)overall 8+/10If youre into strategy, give it a shot :)			",129,19,1,22,8,0,10

												Normally before I recommend a game I play 10-15 hours of it before making a final judgement. However, in this case King Arthur the wargame is not hard to explain or requires a deep analysis. The gameplay is simaliar to any of the Total War games mix with some of Civilization 3. The real meat of it's game is not the combat, but the choices you make, and what kind journey you embark on to change the world. It's straight forward and the interface system is at times buggy or unresponsive, but once you get the hang of it, it is smooth sailing. I recommend this for anyone who is a lover of RTS games.

												Exceptionally unbalanced, amazingly this title cannot even make it's beginner mode easy.A pretty game, with some neat ideas to change-up the tactical combat of Total War, King Arthur falls flat when you try to take it at it's word.Placing difficulty bars on missions, one would assume you can then gage how hard these missions may be.  Not even close, the difficulty of this games missions swing at random from stupidly easy, to nigh impossible, with no regards to the game's difficulty setting or even the description of it's missions.I'd not pick it up a second time around.

												An interesting fantasy empire simulation game similar to the Total War series. Has good graphics, music, and voice acting. The combat is very cool with some unique elements such as heroes, spells, and capturable points that give your army bonuses in battle. However one glaring issue in the battle system is a complete lack of a morale system which means units will never retreat. As well as being unrealistic this means battles tend to drag on with the losing army ultimately being annihilated. This proves to an issue on the campaign map as the game is very difficult and one lost battle can be devastating since you are limited in the amount of troops you can support with your permenantly shaky economy. Disasters, rebellions, and invading armies are a constant nuisance which plays into the games difficulty as the quest system is the only way to advance the game and these elements take up time and prevent you from completing aforementioned quests. All the elements that you would expect in this genre of game are present as well as a nifty morality and religion system that determines what spells, units, and upgrades you can get as well as a text-based quest system that advances the main story. The story of course is based on King Arthur's rise to dominion over all of ancient England but with distinct fanstay elements based on old Celtic mythology. In conclusion I would recommend this to fans of the Total War series of games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow, I had forgotten about this game. This was the first release of the game, granted to me by the awesome dev/publishers team back when I worked in the gaming industry. I truly enjoyed it. I had done a full review as press for the game at th time explaining the excellent combination of typical strategy/domination playstyle, with its most excellent rpg system built in. I recall I play for days on end, loved it! Thinking itis time to see if I can play it again or if my copy is outdated. TLDR: I had first release of game and absolutely loved it, haven't played it in ages though since it was a ""work"" releated game at the tim.			",45,20,1,12,6,0,1

												A thoroughly enjoyable ""total war"" style game, with less sandbox and more RPG.  The morality system and ""choose your own adventure"" style quests on the campaign map add a lot to the immersion and the spell system and great variety of units makes the battles a lot of fun too.  Highly recommended for fans of the genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic combination of fantasy RPG and RTS. The more you play, the more you will enjoy this great, great game. You get quests, level-ups, kingdom, resource and hero management, large battles, and more. If you get bored of games being ""more of the same old thing"", you NEED TO PLAY THIS ONE. I give it a 9.5/10!  :-)==========Ce jeu est une extraordinaire combinaison de jeu de rôle fantastique ainsi que de stratégie en temps réel.  Il y a des quêtes, des niveaux pour tous les personnages, de la magie, ainsi que la gestion du royaume, des ressources ainsi que des héros, de grandes batailles et toute une variété de choses uniques.  C'est plus que simplement ""un bon jeu"", c'est une vraie perle d'originalité.  9.5/10! :-)			",347,93,23,81,42,1,104

												Truly a hidden gem. Boasts similar combat mechanics to that of total war games, but with so much more to enrich combat. Using character that have been leveled up rpg style throughout the story to massacre enemies on vast battlefieds is something new. The various campaigns themselves are rich and full of choices which can lead to success or ruin. I have never found a game quite like this, and strongly encourage any and all to support this dev!!!

												I loved this if your a fan of anything medievil but also completely fantasy oriented, or realistic in terms of the Celtic and Christian Mythos of the medievil ages this one is a one of a kind. It is an rts of course and with it does come a long game play, its not fast paced rts like a moba if your looking for that I am afraid you may wish to look elsewhere as this game requires patience, but for each thing you earn its equally satisfying.

												Uhhhh 10$ is a bit much but 5$ or less definitely a peek is warranted it'll provide some decent fun for total war fans.I don't own a top of the line machine and this game ran fine for me I don't know what everyone else is encountering.If you're a total war fan take this game in the sense that it's a mod that you paid for and it'll be ok. The end units pagan units of archers are broken beyond belief. Stack your army with these archers and its like stacking your army with those arab ninjas from Medieval 1 that could melee and range equally. Except these are elves and so are even more overpowered. Wonderful concept for a story and realm. The quests give you a better direction than total war games. Maybe if you haven't gotten into total war because it's not THAT welcoming to people new to the genre (Civ style, RTS, or any of those in general) this would be a fantastic start actually. And if you're a fan of the series pick it up on sale and get a good few hours of fun, I did.			",148,12,0,37,26,0,47

												Not many games like King Arthur. The role playing aspect adds new flavor to a strategy game, as  well as the much-loved-by-me magic system for heroes in the game. The game has a challenging economy system and keeps you on your toes to make sure your heroes stay happy and with you during the campaign. Love the DLC content to this game also, so be sure you get those as well. The morality system adds nice replay value to the game also, as you can replay the game and take on a different role as the good guy or bad guy...or maybe a bit in between. Rewards can depend greatly on this morality system quite a bit, and I cannot praise enough the artwork lead they had in this game, as she has amazing tallent and it surely shows as you campaign across anchient Britannia. The music is captivating as well. Neocore was a big surprise developer when King Arthur came out, and their devotion to trying to make a good game shows in this beautiful creation.

												I Have only now been able to install this game and play it. It simply refused to work on TWO different systems. Stupidly I bought KA2 as well, the premise of this game sounds so good I couldn't ignore it - guess what, that didn't work either.Now I decided to install it on my laptop, just to see what it is and it works perfectly. I am not alone: Lots of people have complained that the game simply won't work. Hate to say it, but now that it is working, it feels clunky, arbitrary and doesn't offer anything that a game like Mount & Blade Warband or the Total War series offer, and both those do it a LOT better.

												This is an incredibly frustrating game. I love the concept but coming from the Total War franchise, the battles are too frenetic and unforgiving of mistakes. The campaign mode likewise features your enemies amassing huge stacks of extremely high level units, especially in the late game when Spoilers start rampaging. I love the storyline and the concept but the game play is simply too difficult for this player accustomed to the normal or high difficulty levels of Total War games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												YEAH!- i love king arthurs legends.so first of all this game is for those who like the knights of round table and all stories conected to them. also this game is interpretation of those leneds so you have to open minded. lets begin the review.   i will say in the first place what is wrong with game. The bigest problem of the game ( and like only) is game mechanics. starts well isnt it?      so total wars battle map is better than in KA-TRW. battles are not broken but are based on heroes ( the funny thing is that it is true to the lore, cause in legends heroes won the battles :)  ) and its not so strategical battle after all. Also eveling system of the units shakes a thing little( you can reaserch your troops to better troops. it changes they stats and how they look but it shakes much the game- but still to be able to play it with fun)      last thing is that you can only command one army during the battle. thats baaad... what else, ah yes. as long as computer make more mixed armies you can also make more fun based armies. but in the end you will fight against armies contained from best of the best units...and its boring and its SU***... -----so lets go to the better part of it:atmosphere- it is greate! just grate you have to see on your own eyes.campaign map- from mechanical point of view its not so grounf breaking. BUT!it is pteety open britan wher you can conquer all provinces make alliances and on the map you have quests. and those quest are heavily based on what you do on map and on all those little kingdoms you are surendered with. and the game makes you feel like errant knight going from one adventure to another. look- the game looks good, the clone units are just anoying but still they look good, there is variaety of troops and heroes and everything is in motion.story- the stories are what makes this game so good. every quest have its own storie and thanks to that even ""pls go and kill bad guy"" feels far more intresting.interpretation- i think its a great interpretation og King arthurs legends-------------------------so i would give the game like 7.5/10 cause mechanics are not to good and since battles should be the best part of the game due to mechanics they are not.

												The AI cheats and the game is designed in way the player is almost always disadvantaged. A couple of examples:- At the beginning of the fight the player's army has always a lesser amount of ""moral"" than the opponent; ironically is possible lose the clash due to the low level of moral even in the case the player's army has more soldiers and fewer loss jsut because the enemy runs all over the map.Furthermore the the player starts always in a worse position on the map.- AI has a better food/gold ratio of productionBasically AI plays with different rules than player. The DLC ""Saxon campaign"" introduces some improvements about diplomacy, army mangement etc. but the problems stated before stay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A friend of mine summed up this game pretty well -- it's basically Medieval: Total War with magic. In this case, it's a pretty good thing, since the strategic element is pretty well-done and the infusion of a fantasy setting based around the Arthurian legend definitely breathes some life into the somewhat stale historical Total War formula. That said, it's definitely not as good as the Total War games, but it's also definitely worth checking out if you've been wanting a fantasy Total War title.			",740,242,1,116,60,4,125

												I didn't like this game at first, but after playing it some more I got hooked on it. The combat is very simplistic but still is rather fun. The real complicated portions of the game take place on the risk style map where you make all the big decisions. The morality system is a nice touch as it actually affects the game. You get different units and abilitys based on if you are a rightful ruler or a tyrant, as well as if you are a supporter of the Old Faith or Christianity. The real great part of the game is the expansion packs though, which adds 2 sort of like sandbox mode style game modes, allowing the diplomatic aspect of the game to shine. I'd give this game a go if you like strategy games that have a huge outside of battle focus.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There may be a few bugs in the game, The camera may be a bit wierd, And I am not bs'ing you even though I played for like 15 minutes before my laptop turned into a molten mass of iron and plastic, THIS GAME IS AWESOME!

												A mixture of Heroes of Might and Magic, the Total War series, and Arthurian nonsense. Brutally difficult, too -- much more than you might expect from a game in which men in silly hats fight giants and druids. It is pretty excellent but runs amazingly badly so I advise you to be sure to try the demo first, or you may regret your purchase.Multiplayer is just skirmish battles and therefore pointless. Just saying.			",565,260,11,121,74,5,145

Unfortunately, UnenjoyableI really, really wanted to like this game. I was excited by the look of it and the quest system. However, as I played, I found the battle mechanics clunky compared to the likes of Total War. The campaign map was nowhere near as good as what I had experienced in Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis, and I was left wanting. The simple fact of the matter is, although this game's quest system might be good, and it's Christian-Pagan powers are a novel way of bringing the era to life, there are other games that do the grand-scale combat and the grand campaign map diplomacy better. I found myself lacking the motivation to play after my first go. I have played some offline as well, so that's why my gametime is a little low. I just found I wasn't having fun. I really wished I could have liked this game, and I can see why others would too. Unfortunately, there are just other games that are better than this one. jmcone's Personal RatingNot Recommended ",68,15,0,36,9,0,20

												This game has the promises of being a great RTS. It has great kingdom management and awesome troop building. But it's so ♥♥♥♥ing hard. It begins by being laughably easy and then game's difficulty spikes through the roof. The RTS battles become nigh on impossible to win. There's a morale mechanic in the battles that tick down for both sides either as you engage the enemy or capture points. This sounds like a great idea, but it's awful. The maps are horribly unbalanced, forcing you to engage the enemy head on instead of taking a strategic position and lying in wait for them. The game outside of the battles isn't much better either. You'll never get a chance to replenish your armies because you'll always be fighting something. The game forces you into battles non-stop. Aside from that, there are text-based quests you find on the world map which are pretty enjoyable. There's also a kingdom management bit where you get to construct buildings, tax your peasants and research tech, but you only get to do that during the winter, the rest of your time in the game being spent hating your life as you hopelessly try to fight the AI's armies. Overall, this game is an RTS masachist's haven, but for the casual player, I would suggest you avoid this like the plague. It's simply ridiculously hard. Oh, and don't bother with any of the DLC, they barely even work.			",208,36,5,46,34,3,46

Heroes powers a bit boring and not developing enough.The strategy map - HOMM style, but with less options and posibilities.It's not an awful one, but not worth it's 10$ so many years after release.

												This is a pretty unique little game, definitely worth checking out. To give some idea, think Total War with RPG elements, and far better empire management (compared to the older entries, Shogun 2 is much better in this regard). The controls are fluid and easier to pick up than use too, no more making your cavalry into a 2 wide column. Turn-based empire/character management, real-time battles ala Total War.Unlike Total War though, combat places a heavier emphasis on the mentioned RPG elements. There is no actual ""morale"" per se (it works differently) and units do not rout, so a number of strategies the Total War player would be used to are out the window. Archers are very strong but so are every other unit. Units are actually balanced omg!And it's not just a standard ""conquer the map to win"" game. You follow a plot, and there are plenty of side-quests to do. Endless adventures await!Oh yeah, this game is pretty hard even on normal. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When King Arthur tries hard to be a low fantasy Total War clone, it succeeds in some areas, while in others not at all.Main issue is the NPC balance issue, you'll reach a point when you get destroyed no matter what army you got.Besides that, it's a great game for the strategic fantasy lover.

Turn-based campaign map where you build, capture, attack and defend, and real-time battles with an emphasis on tactical use of terrain and unit strengths, careful positioning, and formations. I've had a great time with it, and would recommend it to anybody that liked Lords2; you owe it to yourself to try this. If you like TBS but somehow missed Lords2, at least give the demo a shot and find out for yourself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Decent game, but scripted all to hell so that you are railroaded. Really odd out of something so like a Total War game. So long as you dont play too well and move too fast through the story before you have the armies to back it up, its a great experience.			",106,40,0,45,14,1,43

												This game is truly a gem. It has a great pen and paper style story and side dialgues that offer great incentives. The combat units are simple but the heros fuel your conquest and have fun skills. They eventually can become Gods among men. I would high recommend this to any fantasy or strategy lover.

												Overall a very good RPG. Its got a nice balance between army fighting and adventuring. If I were to summaries it I'd say its like a Total War meets a Civ light. You don't do a lot of mirco managing like in other games, but enough that you have to keep on top of things. This is a favorite game on STEAM currenlty.			",110,24,0,43,11,1,38

												Heavily influenced by the Medieval: Total War series, this game takes off from there, delving into much more fantasy-themed/Arthurian legend goodness. Following along the huge story, role-playing in the campaign map brings up interesting paths for magic, religions, units, and leadership powers, and ultimately affects the entire tale you're weaving. Along with wizardry in the battles, facing/recruiting fantastical beasts and sorcerers really make this game stand out as an inspired take on an existing game.			",463,115,3,46,24,4,52

												The game is kind of unbalanced where the enemies level up too fast and they alwyas seem to outnumber you. The game can also get confusing at times and you can do an easy quest with 2 lvl 7 knights that triggers an army of max level elite units with a lvl 15 leader. But all in all, its just a fun experience. Its fun to get a few knights and an army and kick butt with them. I recommend this. it is rts btw.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I find myself wanting to like this game, as it does have some very fun moments, the overall lackluster polish that is the glitches and crashes, ruins the game for me. Far too often I would be fighting an epic battle against insurmountable odds and have fights that I could only win 1 out of 10 and I manage to win, just to have the game crash at the victory screen and force me to do it all over again and lose, this game has a lot to offer, but with almost no support from steam or the makers of the game, in the way of updates, it is an example of a game that far underachieves what the developers view for the game was to be.

If I were to personify this game: It would be a high-ranking Lieutenant Officer who you can depend on to do virtually anything well except for commanding the troops.People looking for a more decent fight are encouraged to try one of the Total War games instead.

												You ever play STALKER? How about the Witcher.Know how they feel really janky, but at the same time have really great ideas nobody but Eastern Europe would try, and are solid enough to showcase those ideas? And how you wouldn't really say they are the best games possible, but how you still love playing them?King Arthur is the Witcher of RTS games, more specifically the Total War style of RTS games. Its an extremely janky game, that launched with some really puzzling design decisions ( not very well defined tutorials, very powerful magic, a linear story in a genre known for choice. ), but at the same time, with some really cool ideas, such as CYOA adventure style quests, interesting heroes, magical combat, and other nifty things.Over time, they fixed up almost every major issue, and launched DLC packs that allow people to get around the linear story. While I still wouldn't call it a game of the year, its now a great game for fans of the Total War genre.			",1130,345,12,219,112,5,212

												This game appears to have been inspired by Total War. The top down map view certainly resembles the campaign map in the Total War series. Anyone familiar with Total War's battle map will find this game's battle map familiar as well. Economy has been streamlined to manage the Kingdom rather than province.The RPG part of this game comes in when you are allowed to configure King Arthur's Knights. They level up through gaining experience through battle or resolving quests. Upon leveling up, the Round Table Knights are given one point to distribute to their general skills and are allowed to learn one spell. The Knights can also gain experience and abilities through events. There is also a moral and religious alignment system in place, allowing players to be either tyrannical or righteous and Christian or Old Faith. Affiliation confers abilities, so players are encouraged to be consistent. Quests are text based, but suprisingly fun and dependent on the Knight performing the quest.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Add in fantastical units such as Giants, Demon Fairie Things (Sidhe), epic Crusaders.  Now add in Magic Spells.  Almost forgot - add in epic heroes from Arthurian legend such as Galahad, Lancelot, and Mordred.  What do you have?  Probably a top ten favorite game of all time.

												King Arthur is a fantastic mix of real-time strategy in the vein of the Total War series, and story-driven quest-laden RPG. It sounds an unusual combination, but it blends well and leads you to make moral choices and think about which knight is best for each situation, whether it be leading armies, ruling provinces or seeking out adventure. The DLC is also great value and adds many hours of additional gameplay. Well worth checking out, it's a great RTS in its own right, with a whole bunch of interesting cross-genre elements on top.

												This is a pretty unique little game, definitely worth checking out. To give some idea, think Total War with RPG elements, and far better empire management (compared to the older entries, Shogun 2 is much better in this regard). The controls are fluid and easier to pick up than use too, no more making your cavalry into a 2 wide column. Turn-based empire/character management, real-time battles ala Total War.Unlike Total War though, combat places a heavier emphasis on the mentioned RPG elements. There is no actual ""morale"" per se (it works differently) and units do not rout, so a number of strategies the Total War player would be used to are out the window. Archers are very strong but so are every other unit. Units are actually balanced omg!And it's not just a standard ""conquer the map to win"" game. You follow a plot, and there are plenty of side-quests to do. Endless adventures await!Oh yeah, this game is pretty hard even on normal. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												King Arthur is very close to the Total War games in spirit. You have champions (called Knights), leading armies on the strategic map. When these armies fight, you can control them on the tactical map where it goes from turn-based to real-time.The main differences are the era (which involve a lot of magic), the numerous quests that the knights can do (they are completely text-based, with multiple choices), the very important personnalisation of the heroes, and the lower importance of the economy.This makes this game a very nice merging of role-playing and strategy.Another high point is the music, a bit repetitive, but quite adapted to the mood of the game.The only clear weakness is the AI (a bit weak), and the overall difficulty of the game which is very high (it is not rare to fight at one vs 2 or three). I just finished the normal difficulty campaign, so it remains perfectly doable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
