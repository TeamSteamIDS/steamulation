												7/10This is a classic comic book game.It's a classic game about comic books.It's a game about classic comic books.If you remember the classic days when comics were cheesy and entertaining. If you ever saw the old 4-colour editions of Marvel or weird tales, then you know what to expect here. The game controls are a little clunky, but you soon forget  that as you get lost in the narrative complete with Golden Age staples like the patriotism and clear dividing lines between good and evil, right and wrong. The ability to create you own hero is great, it also provides a deal of complexity and possiblilities that outstrip any modern game. The only thing I've seen that tops it is ""Marvel Super Heroes- the Role Playing Game"" but that was paper and dice, so it doesn't count.			",514,169,14,124,78,7,213

												This isn't really a review but more of a warning to those that consider playing this game. The game itself is quite old that makes it very prone to some technical issues. And one of these problems is the pathfinding, which is makeing the game nearly unplayable but there is an easy solution  to that problem and down below there is a link that is fixing that problem.steam://openurl/http://steamcommunity.com/app/8880/discussions/0/358416640398103145/#p1Now making this review I also wanted to make the game score go a bit higher, the reason to that is that the game itself is getting very negative opinions that could be (possibly) eraesd just by downloading this patch. So anyone that is already considering giving this game a bad mark just for the controls that can be fixed can rethink writing the review and try the game that is actually playable.

												I love this game.   The game is really old so people don't know about it but it has a huge library of custom content.  you can basically put any hero you want into the game if you probe the internet for content.  This game is a must have game as its pretty unquie.   The ability to make your own hero goes far beyond any hero editor on the market today.  the story line is very enteraining as well.

												All you need to do is ask yourself how many games can you pick up a taxi cab and throw it at a mobster or beat giant robots with lamp-posts. Does that sound like fun to you? If so this could be right up your ally.I must have played over 400 hours of this game heck maybe even more, I re-bought it here on steam as my old disk became unable to load after 15 years of dragging it in and out of the CD rom.. It is a wonderful delight for any old comic book fan. the characters are campy like the old batman/superman tv shows. The stories are fun and characters are a hoot. Characters like the fun loving sea urchin, or the speedy southern boy ""Bullet."" Mentor the master of mind control or Melancholy ""Man-Bot"" will keep you going through the different stories and invested in the them The only thing better than the characters are the villains, and the guy narrating does a great job. The game has many short stories, which play like episodes and they all lead up to a final showdown, worth getting too. (20-30 hours on average i would say)The game has massive re-playability with leveling different characters, I think there are 12+ and  you could play through the game 10 times and still have more characters to try. Not to mention the many character combo's and who to use the XP canisters to level up more. Leveling up certain characters can really makes them shine and give a whole new way to play them. Mixing and matching can lead to tons of different ways to play the levels. Who you bring on each mission, and which ones you give canisters too can really change the whole feel of the game. I will say, the interface and game play takes a lot to get used to, if you aren't familiar with the older GUI's from the 90's it can be tough. But once you figure out how the hits work, and AOE powers and such, it really is fantastic.  Just play the game in win98 Compatibility and run as an Admin and you should have no issues, but some do, and I am not sure why. Try reading some of the trouble shooting tips if you are having issues. Outside of the getting to run issue, I have very rarely hit a bug, and typically when they happen you can restart the mission and you should not see it again. Just remember to make a save after or before each mission just in case, as the auto-saves are not very often.This is one of my favorite games ever made, while FFII, was good, it just is not as good as the first. But if you do like this one, I highly recommend the sequel as it really is more of the same with some better balance. The second is a bit shorter, and is lacking in the amount of new characters. The game is more of a continuation that feels like an expansion verse the whole game of the first. That said, it really is to bad that Irrational never made a third because even an expansion of this to me is better than tons of stuff out there on the market. Maybe one day, but till then try it..  The game is ""Antastic!""(there is also a GoG version now that fixes the dread cursor bug, so you might wan't to take that into consideration)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Firstly, I'd just lke to say that I bought Freedom Force (FF) at full retail years ago, and I've only just bought it on Steam due to ease of use. Don't let my 'time playing' mislead you as to my level of experience with this game.Secondly, I am a massive turn-based tactical (TBT) nut. I love TBT games. A game in which intelligence rather than reflex speed rewards the player is my idea of heaven. I'm an older gamer, and despite plenty of time in Doom (and sequels), Duke Nukem 3D, Borderlands, ARMA, BF2 etc., I find my reflexes just can't keep up with the young'uns any more. And so this brings us to Freedom Force, a realtime-with-pause superhero game that pays shameless homage to the pulpy artwork and storylines of Jack Kirby, the single most important figure in Golden Age comics (sorry, Stan Lee). While not a TBT game per se, Freedom Force has the same structure of rewarding mind over muscle. The game starts slowly enough, with a single brawler-type character called The Patriot- an analogue of Captain America- and soon expands to incorporate other hero and heroine archetypes. Gaining experience gives you resources that allow you to add new characters from a bank of heroes that you encounter along the way.One of the primary points of difference is the ability to also use these resources to recruit a custom character. I've played a couple of superhero-themed MMO's and the area in which they all fall flat is character creation. Where they offer 'archetypes' that require your superhero to conform to a template, Freedom Force gives you complete leeway to create any kind of superhero you want. The only limitation is that the more powerful you make your custom character, the longer it will take to obtain the resources you need to field that character.Now, I'm not exaggerating when I say 'complete leeway'. Want a flying character who drains enemy special powers in a brilliant purple beam then fires them back in a green fireball that does AoE and DoT damage? Done. Want a 'Hulk' style character who throws cars around and absorbs enemy attacks to get stronger? Easy peasy. Want a male toon that seduces enemies into leaving cover using blown kisses, a la a cross-dressing Bugs Bunny, so that your compatriots can smash them flat? Well, it's not very fifties, but I'm sure it's possible. In playing Freedom Force, you will encounter all kinds of classic 1950's enemies, from evil, Communist ice-villains and  giant radioactive ants to self-duplicating cloners. This is where the incredibly deep customisation system comes into play. Every defence has a counter. Every counter has a counter-counter. It's a lot like the Cold War in that respect.But all that aside, Freedom Force looks and plays brilliantly for a twelve-year-old game. With a fiendish, but not ridiculous difficulty level, amazingly deep customisation, cerebral gameplay and a perfect Kirby aesthetic, Freedom Force is likely the most underrated game ever released.PROS:-Deepest customisation ever seen in the superhero genre-Great storyline-Loving homage to Golden-Age comicsCONS:-Graphics are soooo last-generation.-Takes ages to get stupidly overpowered custom characters into the game.NEEDS:-A reboot, with better graphics, possibly set in the Silver Age of comics (1970's-1980's) incorporating new threats and themes. I'd buy it in a heartbeat.WILL APPEAL TO:-Golden Age comics fans-Superhero fans who really want to create their 'perfect hero'-People tired of superhero MMO's but still looking for caped action-People looking for an tactical game with more flexibility than traditional TBT ",115,23,1,57,25,3,61

												If you like squad based RTS gameplay you should love this game. If you also enjoy classic super-hero storytelling and to fool around with the might of superheroes then why aren't you playing this game instead of reading this recommendation?FF is a game that the creators obviously put a lot of love into and it shows here and in the sequel. If you have any interest in the genre and/or subject matter then you'd be remiss not playing this game sometime before you stop playing games altogether.			",2198,857,88,271,225,28,362

												     My dad had the disc version of this game, but lost the CD code. I wanted to play it, but was never able to. So I finally looked up the CD code and loaded the game. Then I found out it was outdated. So naturally I looked on Steam. I was excited to find it, but when I got it I found it had some compatibility issues with Window 8. I knew this would happen from reading some reviews and followed the steps one of the reviews listed and ran the game that way. It worked perfectly!     Gameplay was torturous at first. If you directed a character to a location, he (or she) would run off in some other direction most of the time and it took a lot of attention to keep the characters on task and became impossible eventually. When I followed the suggested steps, the gameplay was perfect!     The game is hilarious at the same time as being action packed. The click discriptions are plain funny and the catch-phrases are comically old-fangled. The graphics are simpler than modern games (as it is old), but it's altogether awesome! The role-playing mechanics are very sound and make a lot of sense.     This game has all the elements of a good comic superhero world. Colorful heroes and villains, clever catch phrases, and an amusing story line. This is among the best superhero-themed games I've ever played!			",4,1,0,4,4,0,2

												Although I love a lot of things about this game, the short of this review is that the game had a lot of technical issues back in the day, and still does- it's a pain to get running, and it's a pain to get things like the pathing bug resolved.  While one can expect PC users to be problem solvers, I still think it's important to raise the flag with a non-recommendation.With that (mostly) out of the way:Freedom force is a top-down squad game with superhero motif and themes and character progression elements.  The shining features of the game are undoubtedly its self-aware corniness, the ability to create your own superhero and fight alongside freedom force with them (Cancerquake did his duty well), and the voice acting.To my knowledge besides its expansion, Freedom Force is one-of-a-kind, and tries to hit all the theme notes- secret societies, giant bugs, giant robots, aliens, gangsters, communists (in particular nuclear winter's theme song is a thing of greatness)- however it generally involves the same small sets of enemies for a number of levels in a row, and levels get really long with limited healing.  I ripped through it due to a great custom character, and it still took a long time; the game manages to be both erratic and kinda boring simultaeneously.  The giant robot enemies in particular are enormous wads of healthpoints.The combat is serviceable- but arbitrarily either tough but manageable or an unending onslaught.  One particular issue is when you're forced to bring heroes that are woefully unqualified for their required tasks.  A couple notable examples are El Diablo's early battle with mobsters and freeze soldiers, any map where Minuteman actually needs to hit something, Liberty Lad's levels wherein he needs to survive eight fights when he can barely win three, anything with Eve or Deja Vu, and any part of the last gamut of levels wherein you will inevitably run out of steam many times.  You are going to have to save and load to disarm Nuclear Winter's bomb.  Probably a lot.The combat is simply not balanced- throwing objects and area attacks are the only reliable ways to deal damage (and the latter don't work against fliers).  Beams miss more often than not, melee is required but most of the good fighters miss often or take forever to swing and get trounced, and healing is a nightmare. Through this tirade of flaws, the game still manages to be fun with its corniness- but that's sure to be a turn-off for some as well.  There are a few points where maybe a little subtlety might have worked better, but the cheesy narrator and the hilariously sketchy comic-book origins are worth a lot of laughs, as do the alliterative item descriptions.If you can struggle past the bad and you're not scared of a lot of savescumming and obtuse scenarios, the fighting is strategic to some extent and there's a hell of a lot of customization- as well as mods for traditional superheroes if you know where to look.  Some people are going to love Green Latern helping the freedom force, and it's hard not to see that appeal.Long of this review is, the game is cheap and novel, but you're probably never going to play it because it's a pain to do so.  I ended up playing it due to a roulette.			",370,57,3,64,25,2,37

												A 2002 super hero game.  It was near the time that I really hate EA for all the things they did to the game industry and decided to boycott the game and didn't buy it. From what I heard from other friends this is still a quite decently made game that drags long long time.Despite the bad impression I got so many years ago I finnaly decided to give it a try since it's a squad based RTS with all the different unit powers.Yes.. it does drag on a long long time and I am finnaly near the end of it. The game itself was the way before all the super hero movies and strange heros that not native to DC or Marvel universe didn't get much recognition. Objectively this game have fun old school comic graphics with old sound effect in text box trick to attract hardcore hero comic fans. All the different super powers from strength, regen, ranged blast, psi control are all in the game with nicely planned balance. Music is also very comic like and pretty fitting for the game.  The game difficulty is quite hard and you can fail some objects easily and have to save and load offen. For most level I had to try 2-3 times to learn all the surprises before I can do it perfectly. There are also many many levels of this game and the story develops quite linear and semi interesting. It does feel like plots that you seen or read before from other comics if you are a hardcore fan of comic. For new fans of heroic games its just not all that suprising either. Overall  it's just quite so..so.. game that will provide some entertainment though the not too aged graphics and cheessy fun. 6.0/10 for a bare minimum recommendation. IF you have something else to play.. don't try this as it will take long and just so so...			",2441,943,81,289,309,25,343

												This is a bit old and the controls will sometimes be frustrating if you expect a very polished game. On the other hand, Freedom Force will appeal to the comic book fan in you, with a cheesy superhero story and many heroes met along the way.All characters have a different set of powers: some stick to walls, some can fly and some can pick up heavy objects. Plus, the buildings can be destroyed.It's an old flawed game, yet controlling a team of superheroes is as fun as I remember it to be in this game that hasn't been totally replicated (except for its sequel of course).The developer made System Shock 2 and would go on to make BioShock.

												Whimsical is probably the best game which can be used to describe this game. Set in an alternative history where random individuals were given super powers, they decide to become super heroes and villains, and the sort of stories we normally see in comic books are what results. You control a squad of these do-gooders over the course of the campaign, and level them up how you see fit through all sorts of random adventures. Combat is real-time, albeit with pause. I only played through the single player (I presume the pause is not present in multiplayer), but the controls basically feel like a very early form of what is now considered the norm in MMOs.All in all, it's a fair bit of fun. It's old, and so comes with the general baggage one would expect, but it's an excellent example of gaming from the time and can still be fun to boot up.			",499,185,8,84,55,5,102

												The game is entirely unplayable in Windows 10. I have not found a solution. I've poured several hours into attempting fixes found on all forums trying to get the ""Fist Bug"" to go away. I've tried dozens of options and nothing has worked. Once, and only once, did it work. I was able to play joyfully for about an hour before I had to shut it down. Looking back, I should have left the game open and just powered through the entire game.I would love to have this game playable for years to come as it's so incredibly fun and would be interested in funding someone to correct this problem through a patch. Why can't Steam get involved in this? Why sell a game that is unplayable??!! Refund? No. I want a playable game. (Even the old disc version didn't work. We need a patch.) Specific Windows 10 64bit fixes are welcome here. Good luck.			",12,1,0,3,0,0,0

												I first got this game several years ago, played a ton of it, and was pleased to find it was on Steam along with its sequel (which I unfortunately haven't played as of yet). It's an enjoyable real-time pause-based strategy game set in a 40s-50s era metropolis filled with superheroes and villians.Overall, the main appeal this game has (at least for me) is how much like a comic book it actually is. The writing is fun and incredibly campy (and revels in it), and very cartoonish, but it has its more serious moments too. The characters are all knockoffs of actual comic book superheroes and villians (though I didn't catch some of the parallels. Granted, I'm not well-versed in comics), but each has his or her own twist, and I found them all enjoyable, and while fairly cliché, they worked well. Personally I found the game to be hilarious, but I do enjoy some campiness now and then.The gameplay itself, as I mentioned, is a mix between real-time and turn-based gameplay, with events happening in real time, and the issuing of commands done while the game is paused, though you can still issue some commands (such as a certain attack or movement) in real time as well. Sometimes the pathfinding is a bit clunky, but it works, and any little quirks can usually be fixed with a quick pause or micromanagement. The game also features many destructible objects (including buildings) for you to knock down, pick up, wield as clubs, throw, blow up, etc., all the better to dispatch the enemy henchmen with. Enemy variety and the simple aesthetic of the game make this all the more enjoyable. Something that also pleasantly surprised me (although I could just be bad) is that the game is fairly challenging, and a few moves can mean the difference between failure and success. It's not particularly brutal or anything, but it's not exactly a breeze, which is nice.The game is structured in different missions (complete with a comic book cover loading screen, but with modern systems you might not have time to appreciate them), with several usually spanning a certain villian, before their inevitable demise. Between these missions, you have several different options to upgrade your heroes using experience you accumulate during the missions, as well as hire new heroes with a 'currency' called prestige which you gain from completing objectives. The most enjoyable part about this is that the game also includes a hero editor, wherein you can create your own superhero, and you may then hire them using prestige to play them in your campaign, though this isn't necessary to complete the game by any means.As for the Steam version, I did have a bug when I attempted to play the game, in which the default left click action is set to attack and cannot be changed (on the forums this is sometimes called the 'Fist Bug' if you need help), meaning you can't click to move (though you may still move and use other actions using the right click command interface). For me, this was fixed by verifying the cache, but this may not work for everyone. (EDIT: If this did work and you have the issue once again, I found you need to verify the cache each time you launch the game. It's a bit annoying, but it only takes a few seconds. However, I personally need to redownload a 24 KB file (though this does happen automatically and quickly after hitting the Verify Game Cache button in the preferences), so if constant internet connectivity is a problem, be warned.) Keep in mind this game is over ten years old now, and you will likely have some compatability issues. From the sound of it, most can be fixed, but do be warned.Overall, I found it a fun little romp through a comic book world, and I highly recommend it if it sounds remotely interesting. You can pick up both this game and its sequel in a bundle for the same price as one, so why not try both? (EDIT January 1st, 2016: During this winter sale, it appears the bundle with both games is now about 40 cents more (unsure of other regions). Still, it's incredibly close.)EDIT: If this isn't enough, John ""TotalBiscuit"" Bain recently called this game ""f***ing great"" on the December 17th episode of the Co-Optional Podcast.

												Windows 8.1 or 10?  Don't bother.From what little I've played, it seems like a great game-- however, due to compatibility issues this game is downright unplayable.  The pathfinding is just broken so that you'll indefinitely run the wrong way and have to click 3 times in arbitrary points to do any interaction, and the game is very prone to softlocking.  This is especially problematic as WHEN (not if) the game softlocks and crashes, it locks your cursor, meaning either restarting your computer or going through Task Manager with Ctrl-Shift-Esc and keyboard controls without looking at the screen will be necessary just to close the game.I'm definitely glad I got this from a Humble Bundle, otherwise it would have been a huge letdown.  Even then, it's disappointing because these problems stand in the way of what seems to be a genuinely great game.  Go buy it on GOG instead, from what I've read they fixed the problem.  The 1.3 version Steam has is broken on Windows 8 and above, and quite possibly 7 as well, so once again, GOG is the first place you should look for old games.  Accept no substitutes.On the bright side, the sequel ""FF vs. the 3rd Reich"" seems to be fine on modern systems, even with the Steam version.  You're still a fool if you buy it on Steam instead of GOG, but hey, you'll be a fool with a working game.			",220,27,4,11,15,2,25

												Growing up, I always wanted this game. It looked super interesting and tons of fun for what it was. I finally picked it up today and... it is unplayable. When I give commands, Minute Man does not follow them. He runs around where ever he pleases. That was very frustrating. I somehow got through the first level by left clicking and I selected an option with the right click (i.e. I should just have to right click then left click but I had to right click then left click the option I wanted then left click again once Minute Man started moving.) But I can't start the second mission. I'm so confused. I do not know if there is a problem I need to fix in my settings or if this is truly unplayable as it is. I wish steam support wasn't down so I could figure this all out. It's very upsetting. I'm extremely disappointed.			",110,14,1,24,12,2,7

												I'm not sure whats happening to other people but this game is working very well on my Windows 10, especially after I went into properties and changed the compatability to windows 98.I used to play this game a lot back in 6th grade in 2005, and this game is one of the very few that I love to play even now! Its got a fun, cheesy comic book story and feel to it which is great, customizeable team, decide who you will bring on missions, and has some fun charcters to play or make yourself. It can be played by all ages and you can spend a lot of time with it! This game is defenitely timeless and well worth the $5. I defenitely recommend it! :D			",214,53,3,14,13,2,7

												Ok this game is just a guilty pleasure. I loved how you can customize your own hero and send him/her into combat to fight evil. The game feels like a 1940’s comic book without being so cheesy you have to smash your head with something hard just to convince yourself to play it. Despite the game being dated I think it’s still a lot of fun. Complaint, the game drags a bit which leads to an eventual outcome of “don’t care, I’m done.” ",92,11,0,19,10,2,16

												This game captures the feel of 60's and 70's comic books so perfectly that it sometimes feels like it's entirely possible that there is an alternate universe somewhere where these comics exist and the Avengers comupter game is getting this review.So it has a great theme, and excellent tactical gameplay that is, unfortunatley, still pretty rare (outside of the excellent sequel).One of a small number of games that truely captures the feel of playing as a superhero group, instead of a solo superhero (the other being Sentinels of the Multiverse).

												8/10It's the basic formula that the sequel (Freedom Force vs the Third Reich) improved quite a lot.- Pros;It has great cast of characters, most of them have an actual purpose.Art style is pretty nice, comic-book like, a bit too much if I may say so myself.A lot different than most of the games you'd see, and yet as easy as♥♥♥♥♥♥to play.You can even make your own character and a lot of mods and stuff.Graphics are great even for that old of a game.Not buggy at all, no technical problems, it runs fine on any PC possible.Battle system is fun, when you get used to it.Great backstories on the characters.- Cons:MULTIPLAYER IS DEAD, NO ONE EVEN PLAYS THIS ;_;The price is a bit too high for the game now, I bought it back when it was on sale for 2 euros both games. Amazing deal, I had the sequel bought retail a while ago and I just had to have this.The campaign sometimes gets a bit stale at some points, but it's a fun over the top RPG-like game.

												Do you want to punch EVIL in the face? Of course you do! In this comic game player takes control of superhero band - each with their own strengths and weaknesess. We play through the campaign, while taking care of recruiting new heroes and getting up the abilities of the older ones. There is of course an option to create your own hero - and why not?Amongst many others there are such character archetypes as Captain America rip-off (main hero) and his sidekick, Jalapeno Guy (Mexican with fiery powers), Ant Man (selfexplanatory), compulsory Good Alien From Totally Evil Alien Race, Magician Girl, Ironman rip-off (based on his early images), an Reprogrammed Android Turned Good and many more (there is even Aquaman rip-off).Overall the game isn't hard, but forces player to really plan his movies. There are also weaknesess and special abilities - some of our guys can fly, other just hop on the buildings, while trying to look cool. Even simple thugs with weapons can be dangerous for our merry band of heroes. There is no life regeneration, so the only health we'll get back is because of use special health kits or hero medals (which are special 'one-off' abilities and can be also used to ressurect or buff our characters).Option of active pause makes the game really interesting, especially because without it everything would dissolve into colorful chaos. It's not really that heavy on computer because cartoonish graphics don't really use any fancy effects. Even on my olden laptop I didn't really got any slowdowns - and that's something with all the stuff and explosions on the screen.The worthy successor to the game is Freedom Force vs. the Third Reich with deals with different main villain and wholly different story - and time travel of course... because, why not?

It also helps that the game is hilarious, honest to god one of the genuinely funny titles I've ever played.

Good replayability with loads of characters to level up, skill sets and a comprehensive create-a-character.- It's a bit buggy, save often. The sandbox element is at once it's greatest strength and most annoying weakness - throwing cars and punting guys with telephone poles never gets old but most of your heroes don't take kindly to the same treatment.

I couldnt even get through the first mission without the unit pathing and player controls flipping out in gamebreaking ways.  Doesnt seem to be much support (or any)  from the publishers or makers of the game.  I am running windows 7 and have tried running in various compatibility modes and messed with all kinds of things to try to get this game playable but I havent been able to get it working well enough that I can tolerate all the issues.This could be a great game to remake or for the publishers to fix up and re-release but until then save your money (or buy xcom or a Marvel superhero game or something else thats similar instead!).  I loved this game as a kid but in its current state its just not worth your money.Valve should be a bit embarassed for promoting (putting on sale!) stuff like this without checking if its actually playable.  With a 90% metacritic review, and reasonable price, I bet a ton of people have bought this only to discover they've thrown money away on something completely unplayable.I hope the new refund policy helps people avoid traps like this and helps games like this get cleaned up or get taken off the store.  I purchased this years before the refund policy so I doubt they will honor it, but I will be pursuing a refund on this one.    ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The action is a little clumsy, but since you're issuing commands to your character rather than controlling them directly, I can take it as part of the package.I would love to play it some more, but there are a variety of devastating bugs. After trying several fixes recommended in the forums, I finally fixed one problem, but then hit another that won't let me continue past the first mission.Even though it's cheap, I can't recommend this game if so many people are having the same problems I did.

It renders the game buggy at the best of times, unplayable the rest of it.  If a consistent fix could be found I would recommend this game heartily.

Nothing works.The only ""fix"" is to try and get the cursor into a corner where there is no destructible object and hope that it isn't hovering over one when you load. Which means you could start the game 40 or 50 times and it will be totally unplayable.Look - I realize that the game is old, but this is the kind of kink based on resolution that should be worked out for modern systems if it is going to stay on the market. Irrational isn't defunct, this could be fixed fairly easily. While the game itself may be fantastic, I can't recomment this copy until they actually hotfix modern resolutions for gameplay - or remove them from the options so that people don't find themselves with a game that doesn't work.

												Short and sweet: do not buy this game!It is an old game, and the issue lies in the fact that the game is bugged from the start on newer PC's. The tutorial mission already wkill not respond to my commands to move the character, resulting in the character randomly running off the map and ignoring any player prompts. There is a, ""fix"" to this bug, being you have to put your mouse in a corner of the screen during loading where there is no enemies. Also, the audio needs to be tinkered with on newer machines in order to make it work.Overall, I had no clue what this game was, and couldn't really play it due to the amount of bugs I faced in the progress of attempting to play it. If you feel like putting in the effort, then take a gamble as it is a cheap game anyways I guess,  ",59,13,1,6,6,1,11

Nuclear Winter o-o-oturn your around to snow<something something :P> for the Motherlando-o-o― Nuclear Winter Boss Theme. Will stay with you for a long time ;)Freedom Force is a game, which I remember from 2002 release time. I played it short and always wanted to return. I went back and... sometimes you can never swim in the same river twice. In this case, in murky pond.After 20h (probably interrupted just before the final):PROS+ comic-book missions' style (Issues)+ comic-book combat style (KO, BUMP, etc.)+ funny dialogues' pomposity+ stories ""how I became a superhero"" (secret origin stories)+ friendly fire+ lot of interesting hero-powers+ own hero editor and possibility to add him to the team+ many superheroes to create our unique team before each mission+ nice soundtrack+ long campaignCONS- dialogues' pomposity sometimes too funny and embarrassing- a lot of bugs that hinder smooth gameplay, and in my case - even complete the game- some secondary objects require almost divine skills and timing- lack of information about secondary objects progress- sound problems- very average camera's quality - if we choose the wrong team completing the mission may not be possible- throwing cars inflict 9 dmg, but simple punch inda face 20...- friendly fire + a HUGE lack of superheroes' accuracy (when from a distance of 2 meters your superhero doesn't get enemy three times in a row, but from 100 m can send perfectly critical 30 dmg backstab companion :?)- no ranged superpowers repeated attack, you have to click, click, click...- buildings demolition with a rifle & pistol o0- plenty of superpowers totally useless- lots of annoying enemies- in later parts of FF enemies are OPSubjective rate: A for comic book fun & story; C-/D for technical sideI haven't finished the game because of bugs and the fact that at some point FF makes more frustrating than fun. I would recommend this game only hardcore and loyal Marvel/DC fans. I wish you luck and a whole ton of super-perseverance.			",87,29,1,10,3,2,13

												I'm not entirely sure what this game is or what it's about or why I have it or if I even bought it, but it's here in my list and I'm feeling like reviewing more games so I'm just going to make up some♥♥♥♥♥♥and we'll pretend it's what this game is really about. So there's this team of super heroes, right? There's a vampire hunter, a lucky French woman, a kid who is also a robot and loves Ovaltine and a man who owns a pizza shop and likes punching things in the face. They need to fight the crime in Pittsburgh, because there are criminals out there who need to be fought. The plot is a bit circular, but you can forgive the game for its amazing fight scenes. Later in the game, the team stargates to Bajor and helps the resistance fight off their Cardassian oppressors, improving Pittsburgher/Bajoran relations and making it socially acceptable for cities to have open relationships with planets. The Freedom Force successfully destroyed Gul Dukat's ship, saving the Bajorans forever!			",101,47,1,14,19,2,19

												Not sure why I got this game. I thought I had good memories of it. I was mistaken. The controls are lackluster, the graphics are really old by now, the voice acting is ATROCIOUS and the story is just meh, so what is there? Technically it's a squad based tactics game, but to be honest the controls are imho to finicky to really make use of the game mechanics. If you're desperate for some 3rd grade superhero action, go ahead. Otherwise just leave this be.If you DO pick it up, be sure to check the community hub for the cursor fix on modern systems. Otherwise your commands will just not work properly (left click completely disabled apart from attacking) and your character will run off screen eventually, breaking the mission.Oh and the game crashes after every exit on Windows 10.

												Wow! What a game.  This game is so bad, not because of the story but because this game is so broken it is rediculous.  I read the reviews and every single person is saying the same exact thing.  It just doesn't work and apparently it is not getting fixed anytime soon, because there is a sequel but ironically that has very positive reviews.  If you haven't already gotten this game in a bundle or have purchased yet; don't.  Let me repeat that DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥ Unfortunately I got this game in some sort of humble bundle I can't remember which one, but wow do I regret having this dog♥♥♥♥♥♥in my library. Speaking of that bundle it came with the sequel as well, so hopefully that one actually works.  Currently I have about 140 games in my steam library, about 90% of those games came from humble.  Don't get me wrong Humble is amazing, I am even subscribed to Humble Monthly, but sometimes they'll sneak in♥♥♥♥♥♥like this and it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.

												This abject failure of a game made the most amateur mistake that you can possibly make: NOT ENOUGH NAZIS. That's right, Freedom Force features few if any Nazis, and it's all the poorer for it. The developers were smart enough to address this in the sequel (Freedom Force vs. The Third Reich), but if you're unfortunate enough to get stuck with the original game, you'll probably have to make your own Nazis with the amazingly detailed character creator. I made 8 Hitlers and a Goebbels before I got bored, but honestly, this is the kind of thing users shouldn't have to do on their own time. The ability to add Nazis to my game manually doesn't make up for the fact that the developers themselves pulled some sort of reverse Holocaust and left their game disturbingly Nazi Free. Stay far away from this unless you want to hunt for some Nazi mods, which are all hosted on white supremacist sites, and those guys learned all their web design skills from Geocities and Angelfire back in the day.

												Pretty fun game, just wish the upgrade system was quicker so it felt more rewarding.Basically this is a real time tactical combat with super heros.  You can pause, tell them all what to you, then unpause and watch it happen.It was funny and enjoyable ~ my regret is that upgrading the charactors is really slow.  After 8 levels, most of the chars still had the same abilities and few upgrades so the combat became stale.  Just my opinion but I would rate the game awesome if it was shorter with quicker upgrades... would add fun and replayability.			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

Not only was it an extreme hassle to get a multiplayer game running (about 18 of the 20 minutes I spent playing it was on trying to get it to work), but once the game did start, it barely functioned, with my brother unable to even act while I wailed away at his characters.We tried restarting, thinking it was just a bad connection, but the game refused to allow us to enter a game together again. So I tried to restart the entire game, and it crashed when I hit Exit Game. My brother couldn't even close the game.This game barely functions, which is completely unacceptible.

Can't click the mission briefing menu.- Minute man was unable to follow command. Go in a direction for eternity or in circle.I feel king of sorry, but this is unplayable.			",220,48,4,28,18,2,24

												I wish I could give this game a glowing review. The whole concept of it sounds amazing, the graphics are fairly good, and the comic book geek in me sobs at having to admit that I didn't like it. However, after giving it a try, I have to say just that: I didn't like it. The controls gave me some trouble, the hit boxes seemed to be annoying, and the interface drove me up the wall. I was never a fan of this style of 'overhead gaming' in the NES, and here, it didn't do anything with it that made me like it even more.One day, I may come back and try this again, and see whether the game may live up to my expectations with a rest break. However, until that day, I have to suggest that you get the game on sale if you want it at all.			",23,10,0,22,8,0,6

												One of the finest tactical RPG experiences ever made, Freedom Force is also one of the most purely satisfying, faithful comic book superhero games. The writing is a loving homage to (and satire of) 50s comics, and the level of environmental interaction and destructibility has yet to be matched by other games in the superhero genre. It does have a few balance and design issues, and I found custom hero creation much less satisfying than simply using the pregenerated options, but ultimately these are minor quibbles.

Something like Marvel Ultimate Alliance is probably superior to it, but FF gives you a more strategic experience while capturing that golden age of comics cheesiness. If you don’t mind the graphics and slightly awkward controls, you will have a blast with this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The characters and plot are loving homages to silly Golden Era supercomics... a race of aliens bent on enslaving the galaxy comes to earth, and grants random humans superpowers though ENERGY-X! (something about us generally being stupid, evil and warlike, so we will tear our planet apart ourselves without them having to raise a finger. ) The aliens are however opposed by one of their own who turns traitor, and FREEDOM FORCE! led by super patriotic American MINUTE MAN! and assisted by among others THE ANT! who got bitten by an ant infused by ENERGY-X!Strategy can get surprisingly deep in this, you need a create a mix of different abilities, and strengths and vulnerabilities in the heroes you select for a mission. Some boss battles can be really hard, you have to use the environment to your advantage and protect the more fragile heroes.It was created by Irrational Games, one of my favorite studios.

Further, sometimes the after mission briefing glitches and forgets to give you a next button.  Frankly, under win7 64bit this is so buggy as to be unplayable.

												This is an old, but classic, game.  If any game franchise deserves a reboot it's this one.8/10 for RTS superhero gameplay.10/10 for nostolgia!NOTE ===================================================I completed the campaign dealing with 2 persistent issues.  Your workaround may need to differ, but for me playing on Win-7 64bit.(1) Fist icon that won't change to move or interact:  In STEAM I deleted the local files through the LIBRARY-> GAMES menu and then reinstalled them using STEAM.  I had to do this every time before I played the game again.  ""Deleting the local files"" does not delete your saved games.  This worked 100% of the time...although I guess I did have to delete the game...reinstall the game...restart Windows twice.(2) The missing NEXT prompt on the hero exp screen:  This issue was a bit more irritating.  You need to do one of two things depending on where you're at in the campaign.  In the mission summary screen there will ALWAYS be a NEXT button.  On that screen you either:   (a) save the game  (b)exit the campaign (c) load the save you just savedORpress NEXT and go to the exp with a NEXT button.Saddly it's very contextual which way works.  I made sure to save the game before ending a mission so if I picked the wrong way I could just reload at the end of the mission and use the other method.Not many games are worth this much hassle to play, but I'm glad I went through the bother.This is a GREAT game.

												The main reason I cannot recommend this game is that the Steam version is buggy.  It took me a long time to find a partial solution to the cursor (fist) bug.  The solution I found does not work all the time; when the Steam client is open, the cursor bug comes back.  Lauching the game frequently automatically launches the Steam client, something I have not been able to prevent.  Perhaps I am wrong about the cause of the bug, but the point is that after hours of reading and experimenting with solutions, it still takes several game re-starts to get the game working without the cursor bug.The character editing tool that comes with the game just flat out does not work on the Steam version.  Again I have read extensively for fixes and tried many things, but nothing works.  The game is playable without the character editing tool.  However, part of the appeal of a game like this is making one's own characters for campaign play, and that is a part of the game I cannot experience because the character editing tool does not work.The bugs are a shame, because it seems like a fun game.  The gameplay and mechanics were well-done, and the interface is easy to learn.  I do have one major complaint with the camera, in that it is hard to control the camera rotation feature.  That makes some maps frustrating to play, when I need the camera at a different angle to get a clear view of what I want to see.Since I have already bought the game, I intend to try to finish the campaign mode, so I will probably play it a bit more.  However, had I known about the bugs, I would not have bought it even at the sale price.  (Or perhaps I would have researched to find whether I could buy a more functional version elsewhere.)  Hopefully the sequel game (Freedom Force v. the Third Reich) will be more functional.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the games that I consider a ""classic must-play"" game. Sure, some of it has to do with my extreme romanticism of superheroes. Some of it might be about this game coming out in my formative years of PC gaming. Some of it may even have something to do with the destructible environments. But don't let any of these biases fool you, this is a wonderful game that deserves any and all praise heaped upon it.Form the common comic book tropes that are taken and slightly skewed, to the awesomely imitated art style of the Ditko/Romita classic Silver Age, to the isometric part real time strategy gameplay that focused on mixing superpowers (even of custom characters!) to best effect in destructible environments, this game checked off so many things that I adore.It's a shame that Irrational studios is downsizing because I always hoped that they would eventually go back to the proverbial well and give us another Freedom Force, but it apparently is not in the cards. I'll just have to console myself with another playthrough...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Seeing each backstory unfold like a comic is wonderfull. The turn bace style gameplay may take a bit of getting use to but once you do you are hook.

												If you are unfamiliar with these fun and hilarious games, then you must buy them and play them immediately! FF and FF vs the 3rd Reich are not just an excellent homage to the Silver Age of Comic books and indeed America in the 50s and 60s in general - more than that they are very skillfully produced strategy games, with the added charm of rpg-style character upgrading and customisation. If half of the bad games produced in the name of the big hitters of the comics industry such as Marvel and DC comics were as ernestly produced and with the same love and care for the medium of comics as Freedom Force, many of them would dominate the charts without any problems. However until that happens, I'll be sticking with the Minuteman and his loveable, crazy crew!			",112,22,2,45,9,0,36

												It's as if you took the Golden Age of superheroes and combined it with a real-time strategy game engine. It's slightly dated, but it has charm.			",640,247,17,92,65,8,94

												One of my favourite games of all time, a fantastic real time action RPG that is also a love letter to every Golden and Silver age Comic book trope imaginable.			",326,104,8,32,20,1,40

												Game doesn't run in compatability modes; why it is for sale when Steam doesn't even work in those modes reccommended is beyond me.  Could never click on anything, right click only was enabled...  Great old game that I thought was brought up to snuff by Steam for today's systems; I should have read reviews of the issues before purchasing.  Here I thought they had since they had multi-player listed; which the game hasn't had in many years...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This, and its sequel, are potentially the greatest superhero games ever made. The sheer amount of customization of characters you can do, mixed with the lovable corniness of the story, makes it a timeless clasic. I honestly canot recomend it more, even with the low-end graphics. The only problem I really have is that you can't customize a custom hero's appearance, you can only make them look like another character in the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Classic game, really addictive and all round fun to play.Despite many mixed reviews all I can say is that it works on my Windows 7 rig  at 1440x900 resolution with no issues beyond the following.A menu freeze on first boot, but this was fixed by Alt+Tab out and back into the game.Then experinced the infamous fist/attack bug but simply changing the ff.exe to run as Admin fixed this.No other issues with control or freezes noticed as yet even without compatibility mode settings.

												I loved this game back in the day, but there must be something wrong with the steam version. Within one minute my character was walking halfway across the map to move five feet, clipping through hills and getting stuck and wouldn't talk to an npc to progress the story. If there is a way to fix this game I would love to have it.			",291,58,6,58,19,2,44
