												I'm a sad man. I'm late-40s and I still like cute things. I also love RPGs, so you can see why I looked at Recettear and liked the look of it.The game wasn't quite what I thought it was though.... but in a good way. I was pleasantly surprised.You'd probably be forgiven for thinking as I did - this is a typical JRPG with the theme being centred somehow around a shop. Well, yes it is... and it isn't. The game essentially has two parts to it. The RPG part takes the form of a fairly typical top-down dungeon crawler a la Chocobo's Dungeon, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and a host of other similar ones. That's about as standard as it gets though.Recettear does things rather differently - you are a young girl who has inherited her father's item shop which serves the local townsfolk with equipment for their day-to-day use and more importantly, stuff to go a-dungeon-crawling with. You also have a guardian of sorts (who also turns out to be a debt collector too) who's a fairy. Well, this is a Japanese game - 'nuff said. The relevance of this is that Recette (you) have also inherted some burden of debt too, who naturally you owe to your ward. So, the crux of the game is to run the shop, and earn enough each day to enable you to pay off your monthly debt payment.I know, that might sound a little boring, but it isn't. It's actually where the game really shines. Your day is divided up into a maximum of 4 sections, which you can ""spend"" by either visiting town for certain things, visit the adventurer's guild (more on that later), or open the shop. Your shop has certain shelf spaces laid out, and arranging the stock so your best stuff is visible from the window is an essential trick. Put the boring, common and cheap items in the window and you'll attract less passers-by. Put the really expensive stuff in the window and you'll also attract less passers-by. It's a balancing act.Once customers come in, they'll flit around looking, and approach you with items they want to buy from the shelves. As with any real-world store, the trick is to maximize profit, while retaining custom. So, sell higher than you bought it, but low enough so they don't get annoyed and never return - another balancing act. Some customers will ask for certain special orders in advance, which you almost always never have the stock at the time to fulfil, so you make a gamble on whether you can acquire the stock they're asking for - accept and fail, and they'll get annoyed, but refuse and they'll get annoyed too. You can't please everyone...So where does the stock come from? This is where the adventurer's guild and the dungeon crawling comes in. Instead of opening the store, you can toddle off to the adventurer's guild where all the adventurers hang out. You can recruit them, for a fee to go and dungeon crawl with you.  There's a great element of risk/reward here, as at the end of each level, you can choose to duck out with the loot, or proceed onwards with the chance of more and better loot, but with the added risk of costly failure. As Recette, doesn't fight (well, she's only a girl), you take the role of the adventurer here. Her role is to tag along and store your part of the loot.So, you fight, you level up your adventurers, you gain better loot to sell for better prices, you get money to pay off your increasing debt, and so on.There's also some added little nuances such as it being wise to look after the adventurers you are hiring by selling them stuff cheap when they visit your store, as they'll use that stuff when crawling the not-so-murky depths. As the game progresses, you'll need to get a bit inventive in how you manage your stock and customers, but I won't elaborate on that as that would be spoiling things!It's not an easy game to describe, and it probably sounds a bit dry on the face of it, but if you like the straight up old-school action-RPG dungeon crawler, I wouldn't hesitate to grab this - it does that part of it very well, but the light startegy side of shop management and how it dovetails so very, very nicely is what makes this game utterly unique. I can't recommend it highly enough.So I have no hesitation in saying this is easily worth £15 on my value-for-money scale.			",387,109,17,60,35,4,100

												You think this is a cute little game about running an item shop and having fun, but it's not. It's a game about crippling debt and trying your hardest to claw your way out of it. The bank comes to your house and tells you that your dumb deadbeat dad is probably dead, and that they're going to repo your house. Instead of making you homeless, the bank fairy just turns you into a slave and turns your house into an item shop (because zoning regulations and child labor laws don't exist here) and you spend the rest of the game trying to make payments to buy your freedom. Fun game, but god help you if your hustle isn't strong enough. Would not recommend to the capitalistically weak.			",316,24,4,18,6,0,24

												Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is, without exaggeration, my favorite game of all time. The art and characters are absolutely adorable, the protagonist is even more so, and the gameplay is incredibly addictive. You not only get to spend plenty of time squeezing every last possible cent out of your customers, you get enormous dungeons to go adventuring through and plenty of amazing spoils to bring back to the surface, craft into amazing items, and sell right back to the adventurer who helped you acquire them. And once you pay off your loan, you unlock Endless Mode and get to finish exploring those dungeons and becoming a billionaire. I have 225 hours of this game under my belt, and I STILL haven't finished finding every item in the game. The plot(that is, the plot that isn't related to your loan - yes, there's more!) is definitely fun, although you won't be able to see the whole thing during your first story mode, but since Endless Mode allows you to pick up right where you left off, it's not a problem.Basically, what I'm getting at is that Recettear is an amazing game, I love it, and you probably will too. Base price for hours of entertainment? It's a bargain. Capitalism, ho!			",83,41,0,28,16,0,8

												Finally a game where I can live out my fantasies of becoming a merchant who crushes hearts and dreams under the weight of his fat profit margin. Y'all can keep your Poorly-Lit Life Forces 2 or whatever the f♥ck it's called, Recettear blows that all out of the water.Ok first of all you play as a loli. Don't be deceived--beneath her cute, naive exterior lies a heart as black as coal and a mind as shrewd and cunning as they come. This little sh♥t will bleed you for all you're worth with mark-ups that would make Best Buy blush. And she will love every minute of it as she watches you carry your broke ♥ss out the door with a ham sandwich. Thank you and come again mother f♥cker.Recette's rise to power begins when her piece of sh♥t dad racks up a dickload of debt and skips town or dies or something I dunno I kind of spaced out at that part BUT THE POINT IS he's an ♥sshole and Recette don't need that sh♥t in her life.So Tear, this really unprofessionally dressed loan shark fairy with a personality as vivid and exciting as a piece of corrugated cardboard, comes up and is like ""yo I'm takin your house.""Long and short of it is that Recette has to open an item shop and earn some money to keep her house from being seized, because Tear is a soulless harpy.That's how the story begins. And there's a decent amount of depth to the economic aspects of this game. I mean you can't check on the DOW or whatever but this is f♥cking Recettear, not Wolf of Wall Street: The Video Game (someone should get on that tho c'mon nintendo).There's buying, selling, taking specific orders, taking orders IN ADVANCE (take some time to collect yourself, I know this sh♥t's amazing), and upgrading and changing up your shop.The fun comes when you can take advantage of a crash in the price of goods to stock up, then wait until their value's jacked up later to sell them off at 250% of their price or higher. I basically gave up masturbation because making bank in this game feels so good.Different customers have different purchasing behaviors, including limited funds and a certain percentage mark-up they're willing to deal with. Common visitors to your shop include: Finicky House Wife from Hell, Crusty Old Man, Rich-♥ss Regular Guy, and the lovable Broke-♥ss Little Girl.There are also dungeon crawling segments which you need to hire adventurers for, and to hire them you need to get their card by doing some specific sh♥t to make friends with them. The first dude you get is a lovable street urchin named Louie, and he's....ok I guess. He uses a f♥cking sword like a scrub but whatever you can unlock other people.Dungeon crawling is how you get free sh♥t and ingredients to make even cooler sh♥t, but you can't really bring much back with you because apparently a f♥cking knapsack is not considered standard issue gear for adventurers.Overall, this game is exactly what the title tells you it is, and maybe a little more.I highly reccommend it. Play this sh♥t.also f♥ck this steam censorship we're all adults come on			",96,11,0,12,2,2,4

												You know how when you play The Elder Scrolls, all you are really doing is1) Go into house/dungeon2) Loot/steal everything3) Schlepp it back to town and sell it4) Use money you made to buy better equipment5) Repeat for 300 hoursWell imagine if, instead of simply selling that stuff to NPCs, you had your OWN shop, and you put all of that loot you collected on sale in your shop and people came in and bought it from you, and you made your money from it THAT way. But sometimes a bratty little girl would come into the shop and say that she wanted to buy a murder weapon for stabbing kids on the playground, and you think that's pretty cool, so you sell it to her at a discount. Then other adventurers start selling you THEIR loot to resell. And you can even set up your shop to keep running and selling things while you are out getting MORE things to sell. And old men will come in and haggle with you over the price of a sweet roll. And there is an actual fluctuating economy that effects the demand for categories of items and what people are willing to pay for them, which you have to work around but can also exploit! And if your shop makes a lot of money, you can INSTALL FANCY CARPET.Best loot loop ever. If you thought you were a constantly-encumbered hoarder in Elder Scrolls, just wait until you play recettear. I MUST SELL EVERYTHING. IS THAT A ROCK? I BET I COULD SELL THAT ROCK.Seriously, though, why isn't this an official part of Elder Scrolls yet?On the rating scale below, I give this game a hearty 7!7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A pretty good game, but I would recommend buying it discounted.3) Worth checking out, but I would recommend buying it heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs.

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE:I'm reposting some of my old reviews because I adopted an easier to read format (and because for some reason I can't edit my old reviews)INTRODUCTION:We all played the Armored Knight, the Raging Barbarian, the Wise Wizard or the cunning Rogue, going into a glorious quest for honor, wealth or fame. But have you ever wondered what's the life of the regular citizen of the fantasy world, specially the all important Item shops who sell you armor, weapons and potions? Well here is Recettear, a game who will answer just that.Recettear its a retail simulation game with an RPG twist to it. You'll have to maintain your shop, restock your supplies and go on quests along side adventurers and receive items during the adventure. This is, for me, a pretty fresh new take on the genre.PROS:+ Lots of Items to sell, both generic shop items and special custom made items by you+ Well implemented crafting system+ Customizable and upgradable store which directly affects how many people visit and what kind of people visits. (People who are rich and pay more, or people who will haggle)+ A lot of interesting characters with varying personalities, traits and abilities.+ Good time management system where you are constantly under-pressure to either open your store or go raid a dungeon.+ A surprisingly advanced economy involving supply and demand.+ Easy enough learning curve.+ High replayability. Different modes are unlocked after the initial story campaign as well as a new game plus.CONS:- Campaign (Story Mode) is short, although New Game+ and other game modes are unlocked later on, it should not be an excuse to totally limit the Story Mode, specially in an RPGish game.- A bit too simple combat mechanic- Art Style is not for everyone. This game is clearly made in the Japanese Anime art style which means some people love it while others hate it.- Character sprites are low resolutions- No Widescreen Support- Limited enemy and npc designs: Some of them were clearly just reused and palette swapped- Restrictive map: There are different areas of the town you can visit but activity in those places are limited and only event triggered. Meaning, visiting a place (ex. Pub) without an event will just be a waste of time.CONCLUSION:FUN GAME. Highly recommended to JRPG fans who is looking for a fresh new take on the genre, or those who are genuinely curious what an Item Shop is like.Although I feel like, given enough time or funding, the developers of this game could have expanded the world and given more complexity on the mechanics that this game is based on. Still, as it is, the game is good and well worth its price.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												A game with enough charm and simplicity to be appealing to kids, but its higher levels are a challenge even to adults.  The game is broken up into two parts: One is a store-management game, where you have to learn the tastes and the size of the wallets of your customers, so as to exploit them as much as capitalistically possible. The other is a real-time roguelike dungeon crawler you go through for loot and glory.  The dungeons are ostensibly in there for the loot you can then turn around and sell, and they work in that regard, but they serve as the real point of the game once you've actually completed the story, when you're trying to equip adventurers to be able to survive deep explorations against the most challenging dungeons.  Colorful, fun, and with a degree of challenge for all but the most hardcore of players, it's an easy ""recommend"" for most players who enjoy having a game that keeps a lot of variety in their play.

												Business sim come dungeon crawler; a game with a difference. A well structured, yet pleasantly simple business simulation in which you simply buy cheap and sell for profit. Paired with a retro style dungeon crawler, where you can play as many different adventurers that increase in number as you clear dungeons and progress in the story. The dungeons have a dual purpose, as well as giving retro gamers a little bit of a nostalgic feeling, you also find numerous items in your travels which you can sell in your shop. Align this with attractive anime artwork, entertaining characters, multiple interactions and mini stories and you have a real hidden gem of a game for those off beat gamers.In short, buy stuff and sell. Too poor to buy? Go kill some monsters for their closely hoarded treasures and sell those instead.			",69,32,0,37,20,0,16

												Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is the story of an item shop, the girl who lives in it, and the fairy who turned her life upside down. A capitalist shop manager with a unique storyline of a girl who is forced to open a shop and to make profit out of hundreds of items and objects in order to repay her missing father's debt or otherwise, her house is taken away from her.An interesting cute looking game with unique content and gameplay capable of taking players to show off their persuasive skills and fighting abilities during challenging and entertaining dungeon exploration!Some good and not so good aspects of RecettearIt isn't just another store or shop management game where you simply obtain profit through the act of selling, or buying stuff. Recettear is maybe one of the most unusual store management games out there that mixes in a good catchy main storyline along with some RPG freedom outside of your store.Why choosing Recettear?Recettear is an appealing cute looking game, but don't be mistaken by its looks, because Recettear is a game that highly values the importance of your skills as a trader depending on each customer and events currently going on. Recettear manages to successfully mix both simulation and cuteness into one without lacking one another.GraphicsThe weakest point in Recettear is probably its 2D graphics that simply looks too plain, leaving a lot to wish for... and the Japanese anime looking graphics might also be a problem for those who don't like anime.Music and voice actingDespite the game being located in the European medieval time period, characters especially the main one, which you will be controlling, say different phrases in Japanese with a cute tone that will enchant you with its loveliness and cuteness!  If not, then you might find it annoying or childish.Game playDespite the challenge and the cuteness this game has to offer, its game play is extremely interesting with a big diversity of events that occur with the addition of the RPG touch into it. Although, it may become slightly repetitive over time and players will find themselves doing the same thing over and over again for a long period of time without many changes which will make you waste time without reason.Unless you get attached to the game, this game may become slightly repetitive over time.User interface/Game MechanicsBoth user interface and game mechanic are simple and easy to learn either by the player self experience within the game, or by the initial tutorial that greatly explains how the game works. Along with the addition of a business partner that can be used by you to access whatever information you require about your in-game progress and to view your stats resulting in a refreshing way for players to access information they require in the middle of the game.DifficultyThe difficulty in this game is mostly measured by how well you can persuade your clients into paying the projected price that you have given to them for an item they have requested or vice versa. Most of the times it will be a surprise until you get the hand of it resulting in a pleasant challenging experience.PriceDespite how unique Recettear can be in mixing multiple genres into one, I personally believe that the current price of 14,99€ is slighty too much due to the simplicity this game has to offer and its low diversity and variety.ConclusionI would rate this game 65 out of 100 or 3,3 out of 5,0. A funny cute-looking challenging simulator game capable of pleasing a huge variety of players from completely different game genres.			",147,18,7,14,14,2,20

												Forget the shiny veneer of anime girls. What you have here is a solid, simple item-shop simulation with a dungeon crawler attached.You can haggle with customers over prices on specific items, buy items wholesale to sell, take advantage of market fluctuations to maximize profit margins on sold items, and explore dungeons with heroes you train up yourself in order to gather valuable items and crafting reagents with very little overhead.There is a fair variety of enemies to slaughter, a system for taking advanced orders on bulk goods and an item crafting system that takes advantage of monster loot.It is a lighthearted and fun economic game to enjoy for a few evenings. If you like ditzy anime girls getting into trouble, then it's all the better.Give this one a try. It's worth even the full price of $20.			",159,24,5,23,25,0,21

												Holy crap this is a surprisingly good game for how mixed the reviews are. It's got a little bit of everything, sprinkled with a dash of cuteness and humor on top.You're a little girl who has to pay off her father's debuts yada yada...I recently got my first Game Over, and I was pretty scared over what would happen, seeing as you lose your house and live in a cardboard box when you fail to pay your debuts... Luckily, the game may be difficult, but it's not that cruel. Honestly, many people think that running a shop is an awfully boring prospect, but every sale feels like a little gamble, seeing as you can set your own prices, and every deal you make feels like a small victory I3Also, if selling things gets you too little cash, you can also go dungeon crawling for plenty of goodies! And honestly, the dungeon crawling mechanics aren't as grind-y as many others that I've played. 10/10 A diamond in the rough, especially coming from a FPS fanatic.			",477,147,13,52,44,6,56

												Capitalism, ho!~My my. What a fantastic journey it has been, exploiting every poor soul that has dared to enter the hellish realm of lust and greed, also known as ""Recettear"". You, ""Recette"", are set to manage the finest establishment in the depths of the town slums, and together with your obligatory assistant-tsundere fairy, ""Tear"", the two of you seek to put the common folk in as much debt as YOU currently are.Does the idle life of multitasking an item shop not sound appealing to you? Fear not, for it is the ""adventurers"" that roams the Adventurer's Guild, that you will be sending to a certain doom, with the simple aim of personal profit. These adventurers are the lowest of the low. Forced into a life of servitude at the snap of their employer's fingers, they also have to buy their own equipment for what money they may not (or at least, soon will not) possess. But, where would an adventurer purchase their gear? Why, at your shop of course! You see, like any good patron, a shop tends to have regulars, these being a select handful of adventurers you are introduced to throughout the story. So not only are you the hand that feeds them, but you also are their liege and go-to person when poverty hits. Ironically, this works the same way around, as your business would be somewhat weakened without their patronage. Be good to your regulars (non-independed individuals), and they will be good in return. A minor occurence of Stockholm-syndrome may be present, as they are bound to your will, yet seem to have a somewhat carefree mind of the things they choose to do (such as purchasing lower-quality adventuring gear, replacing their already suffiecient pieces).Running a pawn shop (this is a very accurate term), you (the player, ""Recette"") will come to meet the variety of generic NPCs willing to buy whatever you may have on display or they ask for.These townsfolk are: Old man, Man, Girl, Woman; which all have their own unique threshold as for how high/low you can haggle with them. Lower the price? Get out of my shop, plebian scum.All in all, I rate this Mercantilism / Capitalism - Exceeds expectations- Seldanas, a satisfied customer			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Capitalism ho !This game is fun, and i'm kinda shocked that i have that much fun playing this game.You basically run a shop in your usual fantasy world, so everyone that like playing RPG will get the feeling ""So, this is what is like to be item shopkeeper"". You can even give an escort quest (Escorting you) to adventurers ! (That most of you hate when playing RPG. lol) When you do that the control is change to the adventurer that you pick, so the gameplay is change to your usual real time RPG game.The buy and sell system is simple, yet kinda tricky to master because you need to learn how much is the spending money of each customer.So overall this game is good and very addicting, recommended !Once more, Capitalism ho !

The ability to continue a fresh game with previously earned rewards ensures that even if you loose the game, you never really loose all of your progress.

												NOTE: This is a shortened review without screenshots.For my full review, please visit  RealGamerReviews[realgamerreviews.com]This is the worst game I’ve ever been addicted to.No, I don’t mean it’s the worst I’ve ever been addicted to a game. I mean this game has the lowest quality-to-addiction rating of any game I’ve ever played. SettingYou play as Recette Lemongrass, a young girl doing her own thing when suddenly, a fairy named Tear (get it? Recettear) pops up and tells you that not only is your dad missing, but he’s also left a humongous debt that you have to pay off. The fairy then comes up with the bright idea of turning your house into a shop, so that you can earn money to pay off the debt in instalments. Of course, the shock of your missing papa and the huge debt does absolutely nothing to dampen your spirits and enthusiasm. You open your shop without any semblance of despair and carry on earning money for the rest of the game.Throughout your journey, you’ll meet some very odd and annoying characters that will either help or ridicule you, none of which are particularly memorable or likeable. Thankfully, the game gives you the option to skip all the dialogue (or at least scroll through it really fast). GameplayThere are two main gameplay modes available in Recettear – the terrible plain item shop simulator and the repetitive randomly-generated dungeon crawler. Let’s examine these two portions separately.Firstly, the shop. This is really mundane. You display a bunch of items in your shop and throughout the day, assuming you choose to have your shop open (which takes up ¼ of the time you have for each day), people will come in and buy it. A bartering system exists that allows you to adjust the price depending on how much profit or loss you’re willing to take. If your price is too high however, the spoilt morons in town will get unhappy and leave you without a sale. Successfully selling stuff to the idiots in town will reward you with experience that goes towards your “merchant level”, with bonuses experience awarded if you’re able to chain a few successful sales in a row. Increasing your level opens up additional features that you can play around with. For example, whilst at the very beginning customers can only purchase the items on your (limited) shelves, higher merchant levels will allow customers to request an item from your inventory, sell you items or even order multiple items that they want to pick up on another day. Other bonuses include larger shop sizes, wall/floor/counters/layout customisations and even the option to put a vending machine down, to make all the hassle of selling items just that little bit easier on you.There are several factors that influence which kinds of customers and how many customers enter your shop. The first way is through your showcase display, also known as the “table-next-to-the-window-that-people-can-see-from-outside”. You want people to look at the junk on your table and think “Damn, I wanna go in there!” So your first instinct is to put all your expensive, high-in-demand stuff on that table, but by doing so you risk alienating the poor little girl that can’t afford anything. So in the end I have no god damn clue how you’re meant to attract the most people. The second way to influence everything is by changing the walls, floor, counters and so on in your shop, which is collectively referred to as the “store atmosphere”.  I’m not 100% sure of how it works, but I imagine light and gaudy things attract little girls that can’t afford anything and call you a big meanie poo for marking up the price even slightly, and the more plain and dark ones stores some other weird population. Who knows? So where do you get the items that you sell? Well there’s two ways to get your hands on some goodies. The first one is to buy them in town, either from the Market or the Merchant’s Guild. It works just like real life – buy low, sell high. Every so often you’ll hear a news bulletin saying that the cost of this is temporarily decreased and the price of this other thing is increased. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out how to approach the situation. The other main method of obtaining items (which incidentally also makes up the remainder of the game) involves dungeon-crawling. Rather than having your useless little girl go out and magically have the ability to fight, the game allows you to visit the “Adventurer’s guild”, in which you pick from a number of heroes-for-hire who will go do the dungeon-crawling for you. Once you’ve made your choice, you take control of whichever hero you pick and embark on what has to be the most monotonous and tedious dungeon-crawling game in existence. If repeatedly killing incredibly inspired and original enemies such as slimes, bats and bunny rabbits appeals to you in any way then, boy, you’re in for a treat. Each level is set out so that there’s a number of chests, enemies and a goal to get to, which takes you to the next level. Every 5 levels, you’ll generally encounter a boss battle. Did I say it was monotonous and tedious? Because it is. You’ll encounter the same enemies over and over again (with slight variations from time to time). None of the boss fights are particularly interesting or challenging and although you do eventually unlock a handful of different adventurers to choose from, all of them are limited to a maximum of three abilities, none of which are particularly impressive. Whilst torturing yourself in the dungeons does reward some goodies for you to sell, the main purpose of dungeon-crawling is actually to collect ingredients, which can be used to craft (or “fuse”) better items or equipment. Every week or so, you’ll be forced to pay off a part of your loan. This begins at 10,000 pix (the currency used in the game) and increases exponentially for every week that passes. If at any point you fail to pay up, the game is over and you’ll restart. This would be horrible except for the fact that you restart with all of your items and upgrades. As a result, losing the game just makes it infinitely easier next time. For those that have paid off their debt and want more for whatever reason, you’re in luck – The game allows you to play on in endless mode, start again in New Game + mode or even a survival mode, where the debt keeps becoming exponentially larger until you get overwhelmed. All in all, there’s a lot of “game” to be had here, although whether or not you enjoy what you’re playing is another matter altogether. PresentationTo be honest, the game looks like an early PS2/Dreamcast-era game. There’s no support for wide-screen or any resolution higher than 1280x960. The aesthetic is certainly cute, but otherwise unremarkable. Also worth noting is the fact that alt-tabbing appeared to glitch the games graphics so that one half or more of the screen is completely whited out when selling items. I can’t say for sure if that happens to anyone else though.The music is adequate but also unremarkable. I’d liken it to a poor man’s version of the music in Pokemon games. OverallDespite crapping all over this game in this review, it’s the intangibles that really matter. For whatever reason, despite all its flaws, Recettear was a stupendously addictive game that I just couldn’t put down. It takes a bunch of repetitive, unoriginal and uninteresting ideas and meshes them into a unique game I both love and hate simultaneously. All that said, I do recommend that you give it a try, because if nothing else, it really is a unique title and one that you should experience for yourself.			",1146,480,42,159,145,13,200

												Recettear is essentially two games rolled into one, and neither is particularly deep, though the store management aspect is still pretty fleshed out. What it does, it does well (minus a few gripes) but somehow manages to both drag itself out and rush you to the ""end"" of the game. The problem with the end-game is that, while it has plenty to offer, it arbitrarily bars you from it with unnecessarily padded goals.So the shop sim is the meat of the game. There's no point detailing the mechanics, so I'll just point out the failings and oversights I didn't care for.Patrons have a finite amount of money when they enter the store. This value is influenced by how much they ""like"" you, or what ""patron level"" they are. The maximum amount of money they have when entering your store is a very important number and it is also completely invisible to the player. So when a patron says ""I don't have that much money!"" there's no option to say ""Well how much do you have?""Buying items: some patrons will sell YOU things. You have no option to politely decline; you either make a reasonable offer for something you may or may not want, or you make a terrible offer and♥♥♥♥♥♥them off. Patrons also have their own dialog style, and occasionally it is unclear whether you're buying an item from them or selling an item to them.The goal is to do a capitalism until you pay off all your debts. This happens rather rapidly and they kind of rush you through this section of the game so that your time limit is over and you can go at your own pace. This is particularly good for the dungeon-crawling portion of the game, as entering a dungeon will consume most of an entire day and leaves little opportunity for vending.The dungeon crawling plays very smoothly and each of the playable characters has enough uniqueness to their playstyle to give them all a wholly different feel. There's a considerable number of dungeon and environments. And they're all the same randomly-generated box rooms and hallways given fresh paint at regular intervals. After a short while, it gets stale, and as much as I enjoyed the gameplay, I did not feel compelled to complete even the Obsidian Tower. They just don't keep it fresh or interesting, and that kind of killed the game for me. There's lots of end game content and no motivation or reason to experience it.All said, I'd still recommend the game if you can nab it for a few bucks because the first 5 to 10 hours are a pretty fun ride.

												A ten year old girl gets a visit from a loan shark fairy and has to pay off her AWOL dad's humongous debts or get kicked out of her house. So you hire an adventurer and go dungeoneering to get items to sell. You sell swords to little girls. (""It's an errand!"" Sure it is...) And NOBODY bats an eye! Also some kawaii factor but do not be misled, this game is harder than it looks. Getting the debt done without a ""loop"" (starting over at day 2 but with the items you've colleted so far) is extremely difficult - wouldn't say impossible but I haven't pulled it off - yet.There even is a bit of storyline, which is cute and keeps it from being monotunous. It's absolutely impossible to complete the game (getting all dungeons, adventurers and items) in one go, so there's nice replay value there.I played 100 hours and 6 loops to beat the final level endboss - OR SO I THOUGHT, and got the encyclopedia 61% complete. Don't even ask me about the ""true cards"".Great value for money, sorta casual dungeoneering + item shop simulator.10/10 great dungeoneering+shop+kawaii combo, capitalism ho!			",16,41,0,7,14,0,9

Introduction: If you’re the sort who enjoys whimsical and innovative games featuring various RPG elements, Recettear is for you… Unless you dislike anime and/or gaming, in which case: what are you even doing here? Recettear is a commerce simulator, rich in story, and inventive in its own entertaining way. While the story itself is short, it is highly addictive and extremely entertaining. Just remember to maintain your stock and prices when you find yourself on a questing spree.Story: Recettear is a charming tale revolving around a little girl, and a fairy loan shark. Recette Lemongrass is confronted by hardship when her father mysteriously vanishes, leaving her accountable for settling his debt. With the help of a fairy named Tear, Recette takes the necessary steps to pay back her father’s loan by turning her house into an item shop. She quickly learns that a lot of work goes into maintaining a shop: From interior design, to questing, to restocking, and to haggling prices. Recette must pay off a certain amount of the debt each week in order to keep everything that she knows and loves. Gameplay: There is a lot of ground to cover in this category, as Recettear is an extremely well-developed game. As stated previously, this gem has introduced both RPG elements and commerce simulation in an innovative style. Let’s start with the RPG elements. As a store owner, it is Recette’s responsibility to keep her shelves stocked for her customers. As a result, she has the option to accompany a dungeon crawling adventurer once a day, in order to acquire items and ingredients. While the dungeons can become a bit tedious, they are extremely worthwhile - and profitable. It should be noted that these particular ventures take more time than actually managing the shop. Did I mention that these dungeons are randomly generated? Guilty pleasure. After a dungeon crawl, don’t forget to check in with the Merchants Guild to fuse some new items. Recipes for these fusions are unlocked by your Merchant Level.There is a time management system in place, so Recette will only be able to do a certain number of things per day.Back to managing the shop, though. Eventually, Recette will learn to take orders in advance, and the player will need to ensure that the items are available when the customer returns. The haggling system in this game is worth mentioning, as Recette will be able to barter with her clientele. Much like the real world, if the price is set too high, the buyer will lose interest. Don’t fret too much over lost orders though, there are always more fish in the sea. Apart from purchasing random doohickeys from her customers, Recette will also be given the option to utilize vending machines for quick sales with set prices. It should also be noted that different aesthetic customizations made to the store will attract different pools of people.Another really cool feature in this game is the shifting economy. While this won’t occur instantaneously in your first playthrough, you will eventually be alerted to certain goods becoming more valuable. When this happens, Recette can stock her shop with the rare goods (for instance candy), and sell it for ridiculous amounts of profit.While the game might seem overwhelming at first, rest assured it is easy enough to learn, and quickly (if not instantly) becomes enjoyable.My favourite feature of this game is its diverse set of characters. Too often in games, we’re subjected to multiple characters of the same flavour. Not in Recettear. Each character is unique, offering different lovable quirks.Controls: The controls are pretty smooth, and there’s not a lot to complain about. The only problem I found was almost exclusively during dungeon runs. Sometimes the camera angle will deny you visibility, but it seems like such a small problem in the grand scheme of things. This game does offer controller support, which I recommend taking advantage of.Graphics: One thing that really stood out to me was the artwork in this game. Sure, it might seem a bit outdated if put in a side-by-side comparison to a few new releases, but overall the aesthetics are equally as cute as the game. I seriously doubt that the visual aesthetics of this game would be distracting to anyone who enjoys a retro feel. Sound: I might be one of the strange ones, but I found the music to be oddly addicting. The OST is the perfect fit to emphasise the extremely pleasant atmosphere of Recettear. Unfortunately, for some, there really is no option for widescreen. Replay Value: In my opinion, the replay value for this game is extremely high. Once the game has been cleared once, the player will be faced with three choices: New Game +, Endless Mode, and Survival Mode. Just be mindful not to play it if you have other commitments, this game is so hard to put down. Good luck finishing out your Item Encyclopedia! ",83,20,0,36,0,0,0

												Live the life of a character that is the staple in classic jrpgs: the item shop owner. You find stuff, you buy stuff and you sell that stuff so you can have your profit, upgrade your store and repeat that cycle. Sounds tedious, but the different customers' habits and the dungeon crawler part of the game (where you hire and equip heroes to risk their lives for - of course - rare stuff that you can sell) keeps the game fresh and entertaining.Plus, if you fail, you are responsible for making an orphan kid live in a box.CAPITALISM HO!

												Have you ever gotten a coffee from Dunkin’ Donuts? America runs on Dunkin’ so I know you have because no civilization exists outside of the borders of this great nation, trust me. I visited England once, there was nothing but football hooligans and CCTV cameras. Anyway, back to the dunkin’ analogy, when you start drinking it it tasted bitter, unpleasant, there’s too much milk and it’s bovine creaminess threatens to choke the breath out of you. If you manage to survive that stage you’re near the end, it’s starting to to sweeten a little and you think: ‘Maybe this is what victory tasted like.’ With only the dregs left you throw your head head back and down the last of the liquid, knowing that you’ve won and nothing will be able to stop you today.After you’ve thrown up the sickly sweet goop that slid down the back of your throat along with the the tooth enamel it grabbed on the way past you realise that the jerk behind the counter didn’t even give the cup a shake to dissolve the sugar.That’s kind of the inverse of this game.It’s all a game of deception, you see, it fools you into thinking you know what you’re in for: Here’s a homeless little orphan girl, here’s her fairy manager, set up shop and do business. But hold on there, Ken-Sama, get your nose out of that doujin! That stuff will get you arrested if one of those British CCTV cameras catch you with it. They’ll sentence you to life imprisonment with nothing but American tea for sustenance. Once you get past the saccharine sweet character designs and voicework  there’s some bitter, milky gameplay to get familiar with.	There’s no fantasy here aside from the setting, you’ve got to start setting prices for your various wares won through old-fashioned dungeon crawling along with the various stupidly loyal or dangerously self-interested cohorts you’ve set loose to murder the peaceful inhabitants of said dungeons. Try as they might to defend their homes and loved ones, let none stand against your (Simplistically controlled yet still enjoyable) bladework, their property WILL be yours to peddle to the various citizens of your town.As in real life, of course, this is the far more difficult proposition. Convincing someone to kill for you is a simple matter, maintaining domination of even a relatively docile population from behind the scenes via market control is a more trying task, just ask the Reptilian overlords deciding our fate. All I can say to that is watch out for the little girl, she may play innocent but she knows far more than she’s letting on.Get that money, little merchant. Get that money.			",249,73,8,30,19,0,16

 A Gem in the Midst: Ah, Recettear. One of my most favourite games I have played in recent years. This little shop-owning game is a sweet little gem by the developer EasyGameStation. This game has to be the best game I have played, and it is in such an underrepresented genre it's unsettling.  TLDR: One of my favourite games I have ever played and it is definitely worth the money. This game is also almost always on sale, so make sure to pick it up then for maximum value. Latest reported Price: $3.99USD - Steam Winter Sale 2016  The Good:  Entertaining dialogue Decent Replayability Good progression Many fun and interesting characters Innovates on the genre by mashing the shop sim and dungeon-crawling together Capitalism, ho! The Bad:  Rather repetitive at a certain point Localisation is a little off in some parts of conversation Controller practically required because M&K controls are dumb Story is boring and unattached. Basically your father died and the fairy mob is like he owed us money, so you owe us money. Pay us back or we take your house. THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LITTLE GIRL THAT WANTS TO BUY ALL MY STUFF FOR UNDER WHAT I PAID The Verdict: This is the best game that this developer has created thus far, and it is such an overlooked gem in a very underrepresented genre, and I have to say I enjoyed the hours I put into it and would not regret doing it all again. The dialogue and interactions between all of the characters in the town are hilarious, and the progression is pretty good throughout, with the standard stakes being raised(Debt increase) and bigger shop to compensate. The biggest downfall I must say is the mouse and keyboard controls are atrocious, so save some pain and hook up that old 360 controller lying around, or that Steam controller you picked up during a Sale. This game is fantastic for the price it almost always is ($4.99USD roughly averaged). I would not buy for $19.99USD as much as I praise this game because of the M&K controls and all. But it is a very worthwhile game.  Thank you for reading this review, and I hope you all have a great rest of your day!  ",141,38,6,22,19,2,25

												This game may have a select fan base but it does provide for those that love even one of the aspects of the game.  The main point of this game is running an item shop, you can either buy, craft, or hunt for items to stock it with, but one is all that is needed.if you like dungon cralls you will like the hunting aspect of the game, takes a few game days to start and you have keep diving or interact with others in shop keeping to get more characters to enter the dungons with.if you like being an auntipanure (dont hate for the spelling) you will love the shop keeping aspect of the game. if you like vitural novels you will love the simplistic and intreaging story.  even the characters could be pulled from a weekly manga.basicly this game is a few of a good things, but nothing extreame or hardcore enough to grab those that have to have the best of set genres.

												I absolutely adore this game. It's a fantastic mix of two distinct genres, without making them feel like two seperate games. Like how Actraiser mixes city building with action-platforming (Excellent SNES game, by the way), Recettear mixes shop management with a dungeon crawling RPG. Items you obtain in the dungeon have their own in-dungeon uses (usually), but can also be sold at your shop. Some items are far more valuable than others, but trends in value, item placement, trying to impress certain customers, and other variables make stocking the shop very interesting. It's realy fun, but so is the dungeon crawling! Dungeons are randomly generated, with their own unique items and foes. As you progress, you unlock various different characters to play as with their own unique playstyles. Staying alive, cleaning out the floors, and managing your inventory are all enjoyable tasks. Honestly, you can spend most of your time exploring dungeons or just managing your shop, they compliment eachother well and both will let you progress. The visuals may be gross to some, but I personally enjoy the PS1 anime styled visuals, and it makes the game run well on everything. Once you complete the story of paying off a debt, you're free to do as you please and really explore the game to its fullest. This game is absolutely worth your time, I love it.

												For people who have played games from the Persona or Atelier series, this game is right up your alley. It is partially due to the time management aspect, but the real reason is that you can break the game if you aren't horrible at it. Oh. And it features little girls that speak in Chinese.  The only difference between the games is that in Recettear, you hire manservants to fight for you while you remain safe, take the goods they find for you, and sell them to the uneducated masses with your superior loli bartering-brain. The game has many funny moments as well as important life lessons such as, ""Don't let the little girl in your store. She doesn't have enough money for anything and will ruin your bartering streak."" All in all, this game is pretty good if you wanted to be a little girl when you grow up. Also bartering. I give this game a yes out of buy.			",50,8,0,4,1,0,11

												I find it hard to recommend this game because of the writing and dungeon/ combat system.The writing, while silly, gets really redundent... ""whats that Tear?"" ""that's a door."" No really!?!?!? While the tutorial is very thorough, they treat the player like a child, they explain simple concepts like ""you have limited amount of time per day"" in long drawn out Dialouge.The dungeons are where i was expecting a bit of excitement. Instead they're just long, boring, randomly generated dungeons with one exit every 5 floors. you can't call it quits in the middle, nope, you have to keep moving until you find an exit or die and lose everything. This would be OK, if the combat didn't drive me nuts. It's simple face target, hope you're close enough, swing mechanics will have you rage quitting on the first boss.Did i mention this game does not support any normal resolutions? all the available resolutions turn out stretchy and blurry. Not to mention the constant frame drops in dungeons drop to the low teens.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I put off buying this game for 3 years, decided to grab it during the sale. I haven't been able to stop playing it since I started it. I love it! Beat the game twice and then started the endless mode to gain better items and build a bigger store. Having a store and selling stuff  is addicting, especially when the money adds up to millions later on!!  It's a simple game. A young girl needs to pay off her fathers debt, and to do so her and her fairy companion start a store in her house. My favorite is hunting for items in the dungeon!! Fighting the monsters is really fun, and not hard at all. I'm so into this game, looking for other's like it. Maybe, Chantelise - A Tale of Two Sisters next.

												Very fun game, graphics are interesting, large variety of themes for the dungeon floors, a fair amount of the enemies are reskins but they do act slightly differently. Running the item shop is actually amazingly fun, especially playing around with the market to see how much profit you can turn in a single day. The only real issue I have is you do not directly equip your adventurers, you can bring equipment to lend them, but that will take up coveted spots in your very limited inventory while in the dungeons. For most of the adventurerers this is not an issue, but a couple of them almost outright refuse to buy equipment. So they have first dungeon equipment with the exception of their weapon... which took an in game month for him to finally buy a weapon.			",107,23,1,13,4,0,13

												Recettear was that game always in the back of my head.  It sounded good, running an item store, hiring adventurers to lug your stuff back so you could sell it.  It was unique.  Grabbing it in the Anime Sale, I dove in and instantly knew I'd be running the most fair adventuring item store.  In the lore of the game, 130% of base price is a 'respectable' sell price, which is assumed to mean, fair. I set my constant initial offer to 120%, and that was that.  70% of customers didn't want to pay that, they believed the guild who ran 130% baseline were cheaper.  This went on for three days, until I was ripping my hair out, wondering how the customers couldn't see the fair deal they were being given constantly.  Through frustration, and necessity, the fourth day I gave huge prices to my items, 150% ~ 160%, none of them stormed off at the initial offer...""Can't you make it just a little cheaper?""147%""That's a fair price!""That lady who wants the bread?♥♥♥♥ her.That old man needing clothes?  ♥♥♥♥ him.That little girl who needs gardening gloves? ♥♥♥♥ her too.The next customer?♥♥♥♥ them the hardest.Welcome to Recettear... how can I ♥♥♥♥ you today?Capitialism, Ho!

												Great shop simulation/adventure game, enjoyed every hour of it and still not complete it 100%. Lovable characters, cute pixely visuals, simple but fun story and charming music, dozens of hours of entertainment. You should get it, there are not very much games like this on the market.

												Be me, little girl.Pops died some how and now I’m being extorted to provide a fairy with lots of money for a load pops owed.I work my butt off in store to pay loan of which there is no proof. I make lots of new friends, that is cool I guess.Capitalism ho!Robot lady overpays. Little girl never has money. Somebody keeps trying to sell me useless crap. Everyone loves food. No one wants to buy books. Someone is always looking for a hat. Stupid wizard keeps coming in wanting me to get him stuff, I really don’t care though.Such is life. I do not complain though. If not for this I be living in a gutter. I am happy and make friends. I am dumb.Well that’s the game in a nut shell. Weak plot and characters, game mostly revolves around you learning how to sell stuff for maximum profit. Once you learn all the margins you can just grind selling things.The RPG elements are weak. You do have different classes and a few different dungeons but they are mostly the same and don’t really seem to add much to the game. The only real reason to do dungeons is to get items that you can sell for basically pure profit, but I found after week 2 I really was not getting even remotely good stuff. Not sure why, just ended up being a big waste of time. It's easier and better to focus on exploiting price fluxuations rather than go to the dungeons.Single biggest gripe is it can be difficult to tell when you are buying an item from a customer rather than selling. I've accidently bought items for what I would sell them for so many times.The game seems to encourage you to play through more than once, as it doesn’t seem like you meet all the characters on the first play through. At least there was one that you couldn’t even use up until the end of the first play through. Honestly there just isn’t enough there to really make me want to play again.It’s an OK game, if not a bit simple. Will kill a few hours of your time. Don’t expect anything too deep.

												This will be a fairly detailed review--the gist of it is that this is an extremely well polished game whose core mechanics--which is managing your item shop--are splendidly executed and introduced to the player smoothly, but this is all rounded out by the charming and endearing--optional--story, as you meet and interact with the townsfolk around the area. The characters are likeable and you learn more about them as you take more time out of the day to explore the city. It's almost like Final Fantasy 6 in the second half of the game.All I can say is--this game is amazing. Honestly--the best way I can describe this game is a item shop tycoon/dungeon crawler/visual novel, all jumbled into one game. And yes, I said visual novel, which I will get into later.So the primary premise of this game is that you run an item shop on a day to day basis, kind of like a Diner Dash-esque sort of game. From start to finish, the primary goal of the game is to make enough money to pay off your debt in weekly installments. That might seem boring, but in actuality the plethora of options that are given to you at every given moment make the game so much more than an item shop tycoon game, and it makes for such a fun and unique experience.Regarding the item shop tycoon aspect of the game--it is spectacularly done. There is just so much that goes into managing your shop, that it just feels fresh while you progress through the game. What do you decide to put in front of your window, which will affect what kind and how many customers will come in? Should you decide to invest in expanding your shop? Should you buy vending machines for your shop, which allow for increased and automated sales at the expense of customer interaction?But I think the absolute best thing they did with this game is the PROGRESSION that you learn all these things. Sooner or later, as you start to buy and sell more things, and decide what to do with your shop, you start to distinguish between the different kinds of customers that want to buy things. There is simply a consistent pattern--this kind of customer just won't pay that much for an item (and you will learn to hate those customers), and maybe this other kind of customer has a bit of coin left in their pocket, so you can maybe offer him a higher price. It's all very subtle and unstated, but learned by the player as you sell more items. It's honestly magical.And what will be your main strategy to earn your keep? Should you go buy from the market and take advantage of item booms and lows? Or go dungeoneering into the depths to procure items and sell for 100% profit? Should you choose to go dungeoneering, you will learn that it's a very difficult balancing act of opportunity cost. Should I keep this item, or toss it to pick up this one? Should I use this healing item, or risk killing mobs to wait until I level up, which will heal me fully? Should I progress through the dungeon to use the day more efficiently, or not take the risk and use the checkpoint to go back home?The day is divided into four slices. For each slice, you can choose to open your shop, go to the market, explore the city, or go dungeoneering, all consuming a certain number of slices. However, should you choose to go to the market, exploring the city will not take up any additional time. It's an ingenious way to make the player able to enjoy the story-side of the game. When you explore the city, you will interact with the townsfolk, which will bring up a short scene with your characters and their friends. As you take the time to explore the city more and more, you realize that each character has a backstory to them, and they develop more and more. It's one of the things I enjoyed most about this game.The only gripe that I may have about this game is that the dungeoneering is actually very difficult. The controls are tight and fair, but some of the bosses spike in difficulty and you may easily die if you are not prepared for them. Dying in a dungeon renders your day obsolete, and all the time and effort you put in getting up to that point.			",106,44,0,21,4,1,7

												Most realistic shop simulator. This game really captures the essence of what it means to be a orange salesman. The profit you have to s̶c̶a̶m̶ earn inflates faster than Germany printing out marks. This is a very realistic game with a true to life message. Everyone should play this game atleast once in order to learn the valuable lessons this game has to offer.Lesson #1: You can't get rich off oranges because people for some reason NEED 8 SCARFS.Lesson #2: You will end up on the streets in a tiny box if you can't pay up.PS: Tear you happy for booting me for 1 pix?

												I can remember when this game first came out on steam, I saw it on the sales page and thought 'eh, this looks cute, and it's fairly cheap, why not', I got it on a whim. What I DIDN'T expect was for this game to be a gem among all the indie games on steam. So the premise - you are a Recette Lemongrass. Your father ran off to go adventuring, left you with all his debts. and the loan Fairies are after you to collect. What's the logical solution to this problem? OPEN AN ITEM STORE. Cue the start of the day-to-day antics of trying to repay your debts, hiring adventurers to beat up giant crowbar-weilding mice, and selling a book that comes with free Alcohol to small children.When it comes to the buying/selling system, the mechanics are easy to pick up and the game gives you plenty of information on which items are hot and which are not, and even if you do fail to pay back an installment, your only punishment is a CG of Recettes new house (THE BOX) and then you are thrown back to the start with all the items you had when you Game Overed, which makes it easy to get going again. My only issues with the shop part of the game are that as you might expect, there are certain tactics you can employ to rake in the cash far faster than the game really intends, removing all challenge, and the way you can more or less ruin your file by playing badly and have no idea that you've done wrong, as the story often requires you to have certain characters visit your store to trigger story events or unlock new dungeons, and if you end up giving your store the kind of atmosphere that a character you need doesn't like and/or annoy them by failing to provide them orders or overvaluiing items so they leave without buying, you can end up getting stuck without any indication that you're stuck. It's also not really a criticism per-se, but it's a little annoying that you can't directly offer equipment to your adventurers-for-hire - it's annoying when you spend hours hunting down all the ingredients to craft an ultra-laser cannon, then having to sit there hoping that the character that can use it comes into your store, then hoping they want said cannon and not one of your 10 ham sandwitches, THEN hoping that them and not one of the 20 generic villagers in your shop decide to buy it...the randomness factor there is a bit of a pain.As for the dungeon sections of the game...I would say they are good, but a little bit standard. Each adventurer plays a lot differently to the rest, and most are fun to play, but you'll probably end up using Charme or Tielle for most of the game when you unlock them, since they're much better than the rest. You do get an extremely versatile character that some might consider the best, but only after clearing the entire game, so I can't really count that character in there.The dungeons themselves are as I said, fairly standard rougelike affairs. Each dungeon has a set number of floors, and there are different themes throughout most of the dungeons, with randomly generated maps, loot and traps (BEWARE THE TUNA). There's a decent variety in the bosses even if they are a little simplistic for the most part, but the game does  repeat a little bit (Like King Slime? Now fight TWO King Slimes!). There's also a good range of enemies throughout the dungeons, enough to keep things fresh, but your enjoyment here really depends on whether you like these kinds of 'Rouge' mechanics. There isn't permadeath, but dying in a dungeon means you lose all but two items of your choosing, which means you can end up losing items that you brought into the dungeon if you fail.Overall, the game is a unique little adventure. The story is cute and amusing for the most part, and the mechanics are generally quite fun overall. At the time of writing, the game is £12.99, which I would say is a reasonable price for what you get, easily worth it if you do end up enjoying it. If you still aren't sure, there IS a demo available, which should give you more of an idea if this game is worth the asking price for you. Just be warned bargain hunters, this game deosn't go on sale very often.CAPITALISM HO!			",94,17,3,20,4,3,8

												I've had a keen interest in economics for some time.On the side of that, we have Recettear; a game that is about managing a store as a means to pay off a debt left by your (possibly deceased) father, which sounds kind of cliche. However, there aren't many games that come to mind which result in handling stock and trying to make a profit off them (or at least try to do better than break even). Your starting week will probably end up being pretty confusing, even with the 'tutorials' and tips given to you by Tear as you go along, but it's generally a game that doesn't really want to hold your hand, which makes the game more enjoyable when you do realize how the market works.You attain goods through ""second party"" sources, which you then must sell at your own accord to customers that will buy what they desire. As a footnote, each character has their own threshold of how much of an increase over the base price they will generally be content with. It's mostly about experimentation, and knowing what your customers want to fulfill their window shopping into actual purchases (adventures will rarely buy anything outside of weapons/armor etc. but do sometimes request other goods), so having at least one of each selection will help your store and profits as the weeks pass.Generally, your success for each week may or may not be enough to pay the debt, but one thing to note is that Recettear has no true end. If you do happen to fall on the payment, you still maintain everything you have, which allows you to keep trying new approaches to making good on each weekly payment the next time around. It's not a particularly challenging game, but it does require you to think about your investments, and what to sell. That said, if you consider Recettear as a stock market... it should give you a push in the right direction if you follow through.While Reccetear does have an anime theme style, it doesn't really detract from the game itself. You can even turn off the voice acting cuts that crop up every now and then. You'll be reading text boxes throughout anyway.An enjoyable and interesting experience, for sure. Give the demo a try. Highly recommended purchase if it ever goes on sale and/or if you like the concept of buying/selling. Mmm, meta.300% Base Price/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game...oh this game.  It's adorable, it's fun, it's interesting.  Recettear is indeed an Item Shop's tale; you take on the mantle of your father's incredible debt as Recette, an earnest and sincere young girl who's eager to preserve the house in the name of her father and facillitate the alleviation of said debt by turning it into a nifty little item shop at the behest of an authentic loan shark Tear, the fairy representing the people Recette's adventurous father owes all her money to.  To do so, she needs to sell items and make weekly payments while balancing other economic decisions, such as buying stock, and time itself is also a commodity.  There're truly different faucets of gameplay to this wonderful gem: dungeon crawling and making dough (not literally, she isn't Alicia and thus doesn't work in a bakery.  There is another guide for that kinda thing.)Time is important as it determines what you can do.  You only have X amount of time to do things each day, and certain activities, like going to the pub (no the girl won't get drunk, don't even think about it) for some reason or another, or going dungeon crawling, or operating the shop, or going to the park; interactions with other characters will often happen in places that don't serve an obvious purpose.  Operating the shop involves managing the general ambience, as well as determining item placement (window shoppers should be taken advantage of folks), and involves attracting customers to investigate your stock and then haggling with them to get a better price.  People will come in and ask for things you have set out, as well as things you have in storage.  They'll also try to sell things to you, in which case you haggle for a lower price.  Don't be like me and confuse the two, resulting in a loss of product or blowing all your money on a soggy loaf of bread.  Successfully haggling and other things improves your rank and what not, increasing your access to X benefit and Y item, etc.  Haggling in and of itself is mostly intuitive; you'll quickly realize that different people, like in real life, are malleable to different degrees when negotiating price, and they'll let you know if the price you selected bothers them (or walk out flustered.  And beware of the little girl, she's stingy).  The items themselves come in a wide variety, from food to clothing to weapons and the expensive dish thingy I found that people ignore in favor of chocolate.  Why chocolate?.  It's a blast to run through a cave picking up all these weird things and assembling your flying circus of a collection at the store to reintroduce them to society via CAPITALISM HO!To get items, you can buy stock, but it's best to get it through dunegon crawling; over the course of the game, Recette will encounter various characters, many of whom will become available as dungeon buddies who will slaughter hordes of strange bouncing goopballs to get you chocolate (and a plethora of other items; there's some RNG thrown into the whole thing).   You crawl the dungeon, hacking and slashing and using special abilities and picking up items and eventually finding doors to let you exit the dungeon, for if you succumb to the horrors within your ability to leave with all the nice loot you got is severely limited.  Boss fights are interesting and fun and the integration of action adventure hack and slash combat with the rigors of running the weirdest store ever provide a unique and delightful game play experience that actually, despite being a mashup of entrepreneurship and super spelunking, works quite well and delivers something I haven't really been able to compare to anything else.TL;DRAdventure RPG with hack and slash mechanics, as well as business simulation.  Loli kawaii shopkeeper and friends slay baddies to get goodies and sell them for $ to save the world her livelihood.  Cute, fun, unique, I totally recommend this, it's a great experience for me, and hopefully it will be for you too ^_^			",282,62,1,77,29,1,39

Posted: January 15, 2015
												I'd like to start by saying, 'Capitalism, ho!' That's the catchphrase of the main character. It's also this entire game in a nutshell.EDIT: I always forget that it censors my words. Replaced censored words with the cute stuff Recette says.Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is a game about running an item shop, as the name suggests. Meaning, y'know when you're playing an RPG and you find a city with a shop that's full of high powered items so you sell your car and put a mortage on the house so you can buy everything and be really powerful, and then it ends up the next dungeon has a ton of items way more powerful than all of the things you just bought? Well, fear no more! Now it's your job. Recette, our main protagonist, and half of the name of the store Recettear, is on a quest to pay her father's debts by running an item shop (as running an item shop (even though she's like, ten years old) is the best way to pay off debts, and doing so would prove Recette a strong, independent woman of color). Tear, the 'Pie-kay!' fairy/debt collector who's forcing Recette to pay for her father's negligence, is the other half of the name of the store. As Recette is ten and has no idea how the economy works and how to pay back debts, Tear decides to help her start and run an item shop, acting as an advisor and a tutorial teacher. Other than that, she's just a jerk, which is pretty typical fairy behavior in Japanese games, so I'm not that surprised. The game is entirely about finding items in dungeons (you dont do any of the fighting yourself, but we'll get to that) and selling them for around 120%-150% of the original price, depending on the person you're selling it to and how much they like you. There are also daily and weekly economic changes, so food prices might go up and weapon prices go down, things like that. The way you organize your store is very important, and you wont be able to stock everything on shelves,  which is important to note, because even if you cant stock something on your shelf, there will still be that one 'Yayifications!' who's like ""Hey, do you have this thing, I didn't see it on your shelves."" You better be happy this isn't the real world, because most of the time, if it's not on the shelves, we dont have it. Lucky for you, Recette has infinite coffers to hold all of her capitalism, so yes, I do have that back scratcher you wanted so much. And back scratchers are listed under the 'treasure' category in this game. So that's a thing, I guess. Anyways, to the dungeon thing. You dont do any fighting yourself. You're ten years old. Sorry, but you aren't Tengen Toppen Recette Tear. Though that 'Yepperoni!' would be 'Easy as pie!'ing radical. I'd do a review of that fanfic. You pay explorers and let them use your equipment, and in return, they give you items from dungeons that you can sell in your store. It's easier to just sell them the equipment you want them to have so you dont have to equip it every time, but most of the time the 'Capitalism, ho!'ing dungeoneers come into your 'So! I have an item shop! And stuff!'ing store, they dont buy the 'And it's cool and awesome!'ing weapons you put on display for them to buy. Instead, they'll 'Stained-glass yayness!'ing buy a 'Aww, but I wanted to leave through the window, like an action hero!'ing orange or some stupid 'Holy Carp!' god dammit why dont you just let me give them the items. I dont want this 'A HOODLUM'S GONNA STEAL MY CUUUUUTENEEEEESS'ing knife. I'm not gonna go shank some '...I sold stuff. Like. To people.'. TAKE THE KNIFE YOU DRUNK HOE. Every dungeoneer is different, starting off with a poverty-striken swordsman, and moving on to wonderful characters like an alcoholic rogue who's constantly trying to sell you '...I wonder if I can survive with only two internal organs?' she stole to a creepy-but-hot golem chick who has big fists that she fists things with like Vi from League of Legends. Oh man, I know I'm going to get '...Maybe if I eat a lot of spinach, that can replace my blood' for talking about League of Legends on Steam. Come at me.Oh, and by the way, you actually play as the characters in the dungeons. Yes, there is actual gameplay, folks. You get to play as poverty and alcoholism. In perspective, it sounds like a metaphor for capitalism, but hey, it's just a video game, and I'm too shallow to read in to that kind of stuff. I do have some tips for you, though, as it might help your first play through:The man (there's only like, four NPCs in the game. He's just a normal looking dude) usually buys for the highest, typically being around 125%, but you can go a bit higher, like 130%. The old man does 130% occasionaly, too. When buying, paying 30%-40% is usually a safe bet. If not, go up to around 60% just to be safe. Alouette is a girl much like you, who also runs an item shop. She a hoe. She has a fairy, too, named Prime. They'll both occasionally come in and buy things from you. Alouette is willing to go up to around 140%-160% typically. Dont worry about deadlines. They'll catch up to you and 'You need to pay me some money y'know!' you over, most likely. And if they do, you restart the game from the beginning. Dont worry, though, you keep all your items, so you have a pretty big advantage. My first run through, I restarted around 3 or 4 times. Oh yeah, there are cash deadlines in the game that require you to have a certain amount by the end of the week. Should have probably mentioned that before.The little girl is an 'Totally a tree' and typically wont buy anything over 110%. Just hope she doesn't go for anything expensive if she goes into your store. When she sells, you have to go around 60%-80%. She a crafty 'because I'm bigger, I'm the big sister, right?'. While your usage of the dungeoneers depends on your play style, I pretty much exclusively used Louie (the swordsman you start out with) and very rarely ever played the mage character because he's fairly difficult. There are some resolution problems, as it was originally a Gamecube game, so I recommend playing in windowed mode and keeping it in a square instead of full screening. Otherwise it looks kinda 'But I don't wanna be a sailor!'. But that's up to you.9/10. It's a solid game, and I got a lot of play time out of it. It's an honestly surprisingly fun game. You don't really expect an item shop sim to be fun, but hey, it is. I dont have much else to say about it. Keep on capitalizing.			",133,16,3,15,12,3,11

Yet, its bubbly feel and cathartically simple strategy and combat make this one a winner by my estimation.

												While I love all forms of gaming, Visual novels don't rank very high with me. I find them to be a linear experience and pretty much akin to reading a comic book with less panels. It's a genre that for me to really enjoy, it needs to have something extra thrown into the mix. War of the Human Tanks had a strategy aspect to it. Loren the Amazon Princess was a turn based RPG.Which brings me to Recettear, This game has been on my radar for many years but I was always afraid to make the plunge but Steam sales being what they are, here I am twenty hours later and I loved every minute of it. Recettear takes the style of visual novels for its storytelling and throws in shop management and an extremely in depth dungeon diving/crafting system.The games story is rather simple, one day a fairy named Tear shows up at your door.(Hence RecetTEAR) She explains that your father has disappeared/passed away and now all his debts have fallen to his daughter, Recette. Our main character is daft as a bird so Tear decides to help her run an  item shop so she can pay back her debt. Spoilers! You owe close to a million bucks in debt and have a month to pay it! Capitalism, Ho!You will have to buy low, sell high, bargain, and pinch every single penny to be able to make all the payments in time. While it seems daunting the game gives you plenty of opportunity if you're smart.Recettear is a cute game. When I say cute, I mean this is bubblegum and rainbows type of visuals, story, and mechanics. If you happen to be a fan of anime you're going to be right at home here, but those who are unfamiliar with the style may be thrown off by it. Just expect giant cute googly eyes , fairies, and plenty of over the top emoting. Obviously the game has an anime aesthetic when it comes to character design so I am not going to talk about that all that much. It's a 'you like it or don't' type of scenario. I thought the characters were well designed but general run of the mill fantasy anime stereotypes. Where things completely change is in the dungeons and shop management.One very important thing to note is that the game is not in a 16:9 resolution. This like most other Japanese visual novels comes in a 4:3 aspect ratio.Shop management is done in an over the top view where you can control our main character, Recette. The game really reminds me of Paper Mario where you are a flat RPG sprite running around 3d environments. Its really well done and gives the entire game a dynamic feeling. Your shop is your bread and butter. You will spend about half the game there. You can re-design your shop, re-arrange just about everything and place items to sell.There is an atmosphere system that depending on how your store looks will attract certain customers. Lean towards gaudy and expect a couple shady people, design in heretical tones and maybe a demon might show up. It's something I really thought was great and wish it had been expanded upon more. There are only about two dozen people in the game to sell too. So don't expect it to get that deep sadly.If you are a wise shop-keeper, the best idea is to get something for nothing and sell it at a high price. Enter the Adventurers guild where you can hire a character you've befriended and go into dungeons for rare treasure. This aspect to the game is almost in itself a whole other game. This is where that Paper Mario aspect really kicks in, except Recettear is all about real time combat. Which can lead to some moments where your depth perception is going to be thrown off. It's not a huge deal but it happens frustratingly.You run around randomly generated environments battling monsters, bosses, and avoiding traps. There are a total of eight unique heroes that you meet throughout the story and some you can access playing in the games Endless mode. Heroes all have their own unique equipment, abilities, and different fighting styles which is amazing. The adventurers all buy their equipment from your shop, so its up to you to equip them properly. You can let them ""borrow"" items for a dungeon delve but that takes up valuable inventory space for treasure. Level progress is done in a survival of four levels and then a boss level, you have to option to leave at that point or move on for another five levels.The entire dungeon system is really awesome and for the first part of the game is super useful. Things start to fall apart though nearing the final weeks of the Story mode. Most of the treasure in the first 3 dungeons don't scale up with the amount of money that you need to pay your debt. By the time you get to the final week where you owe 500k, you are hopefully dealing in sales around 20-70k per transaction. Where dungeon loot maxes out at 1-10k. The reason being, is that the developer wanted the end game content to be all about that shiny treasure you find and give you a reason to come back. Once you complete the initial story mode, additional dungeons are available that have upwards of 500k type of treasure. I understand to control balance, why this was done, but it doesn't make dungeon diving a rewarding experience in the later half of story mode.As you progress through the weeks, you earn merchant levels that give you access to more crafting recipes, more customization options, and store expansions which allow you to put up more for sale. You earn merchant levels through successfully haggling with your customers. It's a rather awesome system and feels super rewarding when you sell that big ticket item you wanted. There are market fluctuations, trends, and people who will want to sell items to you. These market fluctuations are a BIG deal and the key to beating the game. Buy low, sell high.People selling you items is my BIGGEST gripe with this game. Imagine dealing with hundreds thousands of pix(gold) and selling antiques, magic weapons and armor and then suddenly someone wants to sell you a lottery ticket and haggle over the price. This happens quite often and by the end of the game If I bought one more dang cherry I was going to lose my mind. While customers gain more of a gold pool through successful interactions and earn trust levels. It would seem that the item pool that they draw from doesn't ever upgrade. Keep in mind, this is solely based off my experience in Story mode.Aside from the minor gripes mentioned, Recettear is a fun and enjoyable game. It never gets dull to set up your shop just the way you want it and make oodles of money. Dungeon diving, while not super rewarding near the end, is far more complex and extends well beyond the end of the game. The item encyclopedia is robust and you could probably triple my game time trying to fill it out completely. Additionally from the Endless mode, you have New Game+ mode which is more or less the same experience except you keep all items, levels, etc. There is also a survival mode where the amount of money required to pay your bill keeps rising until you can't keep up.The game features controller support, delightful voice work and a jaunty little soundtrack that matches the tone of the game very well. The game doesn't have steam cards or achievements which is kind of a bummer. I can only assume this has to do with Recettear being translated for an English audience and not the other way around.As mentioned earlier, I got about twenty hours purely out of story mode. The game has amazing replayability if you enjoy its mechanics. I got the game on sale for $2.99 which made the game worth it and more then I could have ever hoped. I still think the game is worth it even if you can't nab it on sale though. It's not a perfect game but its unique and innovative and mixes genres very well. I couldn't stop playing the game from beginning to end and there is still more to do to the games credit.If you are in the market for a visual novel but want to stray off the beaten path, Recettear is an easy choice. It's bug free and really well made.			",410,162,2,62,49,2,32

												This game is freakin addictive! There are 3 options for you after you finish the story(paying the debt til 31st):>Continue on with your first savefile (This mode, you can continue on playing onwards right after you have paid the last debt. There won't be any debt and you can do anythng that you want.)>New Game+ (Start over again from day 2 but you get to retain your items, your merchant level, your adventurer's level and equipment if ever you get close to him/her, customer reputations. The debts will reset in this mode)>Hell mode (What I'm currently playing right now lol. The debt will continue on to increase further and further as long as you are able to pay them per week. )And did i mention that I'm playing & writing all of these 2 AM of Christmas day? LolTips: Try to read some tips from wiki/google if you are having a hard time. It's not really necessary and you can still enjoy the game the way you want it to. but if you really want to get the most of it. or should i say, the balance of it, go check the guides/tips. Some stuffs aren't really explained in the game which kinda suck but that's why there's a wiki! yay!>104%>233/236%>Boom!>little girl>Euria>Alt + F + N >Capitalism, Ho!10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My First Playthrough:Day 4 - Hired a Swordsman to explore a Dungeon; Found a Longsword among the lootDay 5 - Sold the same Longsword to the Swordsman at a markupDay 9 - (Morning) Sold a Shortcake to a Man at 200% base priceDay 9 - (Evening) Bought back the same Shortcake from the Man's Wife at 66% base priceDay 15 - Recommended a Cloth Hat to a young Girl; Gave her a small discountDay 18 - Fulfilled an Old Man's order of 2 Melons; Felt slightly disturbedDay 22 - Forgot to save money to pay off the loan company; End up living in a cardboard boxAdventurers from all over the world visit the city of Pensee to explore the mysterious dungeons that have recently been discovered nearby. Rumor has it that dangerous characters are behind the increasing monsters. Some even say that they plan to bring about the end of the world.That means only one thing to the item shop Recettear - more customers! Play from a different point of view as you buy new stock from the Market or hire Adventurers to find treasure from dungeons. Increase the variety of your inventory, sell high value goods and haggle your way out of poverty. Can you pay off your missing father's debts and keep a roof over your head?Recettear is a light-hearted indie game that pokes fun at the typical JRPG game setting. But make no mistake! Behind the cute anime characters and relaxing music lies a fairly complex management sim. And while mostly optional, its roguelite dungeons get steadily more challenging. Overall, this game is great for those looking for a fresh and fun management sim / roguelite.			",45,14,0,9,3,0,3

												I was interested enough to buy it after playing the demo, but don't feel motivated to keep playing after the first few hours. The main character is a grinning idiot doormat in debt slavery to a fairy who won't tell her the actual amount owed on the family shop. The shop-keeping system is kind of interesting (as I would hope) but quickly bogs down in randomness and odd design choices. For instance, for days on end armor was arbitrarily low-valued, making most of my stock basically impossible to sell at a profit even as a massive debt payment came up. About 1/4 of your customers walk in not to buy anything but to sell you random garbage with insane dialog: ""Want this [bowl of stew] I found in the forest?"" ""It's time to sell this family heirloom, [a chocolate bar]!"" (I'm disturbed by the little girl who keeps selling broken god statues.) You get berated if you don't buy these things and lose out on experience point combos. Haggling consists entirely of raising or lowering a number; there's no rhetoric, advertising, personal relationships, competition, offers of throwing X in, &c. Character interaction is entirely scripted and consists of your character grinning against insults and attempted murder.There\'s an XP/level system for the shopkeeper, unlocking features like expanding the store. That's fine, but according to Internet guides, the actual rules defy both common sense and the actual tutorial. You're supposed to sell at a *minimal* profit because this somehow makes you more experienced and causes your endless array of generic customers and named, abrasive jerks to become richer. The two points I like here are that the shop can have a distinct light/dark or plain/gaudy rating (though this affects almost nothing) and that it's in your interest to give a good price to adventurers wanting to upgrade their equipment (though they also buy equipment they can't use).You get some of your item stock by hiring adventurers to explore the random dungeons next to town, this being a generic RPG world. In this mode you control the hero while your own character and her debt-master follow passively. At first I liked this gameplay because there's a variety of enemy movement patterns to figure out, requiring some thought to avoid damage. But since you're fighting the same few enemies over and over (red slimes! yellow slimes!) and your tactics mostly consist of ""hit with sword"" anyway, the novelty wears off and you're back in random dungeon land, where everything is a meaningless grid of halls and rooms and you\'re hoping the random number gods will stop granting you bits of wooden armor when there's a 200,000 coin payment due Thursday. Besides ""vendor trash"" items you also collect random ingredients that fuel nonsense recipes for turning items into more valuable items. Eg. iron+bug traps to make a cute maiden's bracelet; adventurous clothes plus fur and walnuts or something to make chainmail. The rules don't make sense, there's no real plot, I don't like the characters, and there's not much to the gameplay.So, at this point I think I'll abscond with my stock of used candy apples and discount armor. Hopefully the fairy won't see me sneak out.			",45,13,0,15,3,0,1

												It's a shame so few people have actually played this gem. Perhaps if they had, it wouldn't somehow still be unique among games available out there. There was something really satisfying about running an item shop and building up your store, though at times the dungeon crawling felt a little unpolished, the game as a whole is a rare gem, and something I will always remember fondly.

												It's a great little game, emphasis on little.In no particular order, here are a few things to note:Visuals:The illustrations leave a lot to be desired, but the sprites are lively and cute.Like many small games, Recettear uses 2D sprites on ugly 3D backgrounds when you're in combat (which is a LOT).There are only four customers. Sometimes, a lot of the same one will show up... and it's kinda creepy.Enemy designs are also limited. Most are just palette swaps of the first dungeon's enemies.The HUD is clean & easy to navigate. It could use some polish, but it's fine as it is.It offers windowed & fullscreen.Music:The shop's theme is pleasantly happy.You'll get tired of the looping dungeon music... but it's nothing that bad.The game has full volume control. You can mute effects and music independently.Story:By far, the worst part of the game. Characters are flat, one-dimensional and generally boring. So, don't be expecting some Harvest Moon-style relationships to develop.Each companion has a miniature story that's revealed through events.This is not a RPG, its story is extremely short and it resets to the beginning once you pay off your loan.Due to the reset, you'll often see a character's first event several times before you see their second, simply because you weren't focusing on their story in your previous playthroughs. Events ARE skippable, though, so don't panic.The dialogue often strains to be funny, but just sounds dumb. There are a lot of flat jokes, clumsy references, etc.GameplayRecettear uses a mix of time management and dungeon crawling that's like a very stripped down version of Persona 3.This not a shop simulator. It's a dungeon crawler with a shop mini-game. You will need to spend a LOT of time in the dungeons.Combat is really simple. Companions have only one normal attack and a few, often useless, special attacks that consume mana. It's boring and mindless, but sometimes that's what you want in a game.The shop mini-game is fun and relaxing. You can change the shop's look, put items on display and haggle over the prices.Unfortunately, haggling is pointless (and the game penalizes you for doing it). Since all generic customers have one of four fixed budget ranges, you'll quickly find the ""sweet spot"" for prices and stick with it.Spoiler-free Tips:Remember to visit the blacksmith. He'll eventually offer item crafting and shop expansions.Items that you're buying will still show the ""Price Up"" and ""Price Down"" colors (red & blue). Don't be fooled, you're the only merchant these matter to. The blacksmith & wholesaler will still charge the normal price. This means you can buy a bunch of hot items and turn them for massive profits. (Assuming you don't overbuy!)The ""mood"" of the store's decorations affects which companions show up to shop.Customers start with small budgets. It is absolutely essential that you increase them by buying/selling items WITHOUT haggling and at prices within their ""sweet spot"". If you don't do this, they won't be able to afford the more expensive items... and you'll be screwed.Don't neglect your Merchant Level. Raising it is how you unlock crafting recipes and store expansions. Your Merchant Level increases the same way customers' budgets do... so that's one more reason to NOT haggle and make sure you hit that sweet spot.In case it wasn't obvious, the ""Near"" and ""Just"" bonuses that you see after transactions are indications that your price was in the sweet spot. (i.e. near it, on it)All told, it's a simple game that offers simple joys. People who like grinding for crafting ingredients will enjoy Recettear, since that's by far the largest part of it. The rest of us can also find some fun redecorating the shop and playing the mini-game. Get it on sale, if you're interested.Oh, and I strongly recommend newcomers google a guide on making money. The game is short and the loan payments ramp up VERY fast. For those who don't want to ""cheat"", let me just say reselling sweets (Watermelon, Takiyaki) is a good starting point and Mermaid Shoes (Level 1 Shoes) are very profitable once you unlock item crafting. They're made of Leather Boots (from the Wholesaler) + Water Crystal (dropped by black knights).			",62,4,1,19,7,0,15

												This is a merchant game. It's a good idea to look at a guide before playing because the game contains a lot content that can be confusing. The story can be beaten fast or long depending on how you choose to play, but unlocking everything seems to be very time consuming. There is a new game plus and survival mode as well. If you fail to pay your weekly debt on the last day of the month or anytime before that you will reset to day 2 and loose money, but keep all progress and items. I can't find any flaws with the game but I recommend you read a guide with the pricing tables before playing.			",534,191,31,67,68,4,95

												I beleive that this game is one of the best, dare I say, ""Teaching"" games out there. Not only does it teach you the fundementals of economics in a fun way, but also about knowing your costumer. I believe this game should have more attention than it has at the moment, and is worth the money to play.			",33,12,0,12,8,1,6

												I'm going to keep this short and sweet. I love this game!! Everybody should play this. Fingers crossed for a sequel!When I first picked this up, I thought it was incredibly silly as I worked through the beginning dialogue. But then I found that it was sort of endearing and it really grew on me! This is an awesome game that I dust off every once in a while and easily play for hours customizing my shop, fighting monsters for merchandise, and knowing which of my customers has the best spending power. The side story is great too. Pro tip:  Don't worry if you can't pay your bills on time! The game just restarts with the money and inventory you acquired in your previous game which makes it a lot easier to do better.  :) ",379,188,4,91,76,4,48

												Recettear is a very cute game about a girl and a fairy owning a dodgy item shop that scams the hell out of your customers while putting on an innoncent smile. The main gameplay inside the store involves a lot of haggling and knowing just how much money you can squeeze out of your customer's wallets before they cry and leave your store. Outside of the store, you get to pay other suckers to go into a dungeon with you to kill monsters that are also trying to kill them while you collect all their hard-earned loot, which you can then sell at your shop for more money. The battle mechanic is also unnecessarily amazingly interactive for a game whose focus is on ripping people off owning a store. Coupled with a lot of cool character interactions, cute and catchy musics and a lot of end-game exploration/content, the game really offers a lot of addiction replayability.Overall, a very realistic game about owning a business. 10/10 capitalism, ho!

												Capitalism, ho!~The gameplay is different from other RPG I’ve played. Recettear divide the game into two part :1. The store management part . you can either buy, craft, or hunt for items then sell them for money to pay the debt your father left you with :(2. Dungeon crawler you go through for loot. you can use the loot to stock up your store or use it to eqp your adventurersThe only annoying thing in this game is the little girl who has a little amount of money , sometimes even i have to sell thing below the base price for this girl . Don't come here little girl , my item shop really hates youps : my adventure friend Louie sold me a cake in the morning for 1500 pix , in the afternoon he got hungry , and i sold him the cake for 4000 pix10/10 would sell again			",766,284,24,70,96,5,81

												This is a great game. There' plenty of dialogue and pretty funny events throughout the game. There's also plenty of slightly less intentional humor when a customer walks in to sell their family heirloom, a ham sandwich. If you like capitalism, then this game is for you. Otherwise we'll have to take you in for some questioning as a potential Soviet spy.			",19,4,0,6,3,0,1

												Favorite moments:Old man comes in an says his grandson has been pestering him for some anti-venom, I can't help but imagine his grandson in the basement slowly dying to poison and being all like: ""Grandfather, I beggeth thee, I need anti-venom"" and then the grandfather goes into a ""In MY day..."" about how they didn't have anti-venom and they became men by enduring it, I didn't sell him the anti-venom 11/10 would not sell him anti-venom again.Family Mother comes in: ""My family is in dire need of a hat""....huh-uh, your FAMILY needs ONE hat....NO, NO don't lie, your family doesn't need a hat, YOU want a hat and are using your family as an excuse to treat yourself. Louis comes in: ""I need a scarf"" OMG GO F*** YOURSELF I SOLD YOU LIKE 2789 SCARVES ALREADY, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I GOT THIS 30000 pix ARMOR JUST FOR YOU, SPECIAL F***ING PRICE, JUST ASK FOR IT AND IT'S 15000 pix....nope scarf scarf scarf scarf scarf.....I lost my mind when this occured.I want to say that this is my FAVORITE game, 100%, whenever I'm feeling down, whenever I'm feeling sad...this game makes me go through all the emotions.Happy to clear a dungeon, find a rare Item, get my combo going, Sad when I have to make a choice, buy more stuff (sale) or go exploring, Anger when the little girl WANTS THE MOST EXPENSIVE ARMOR IN MY SHOP AND SAYS SHE CAN'T AFFORD IT! OMG little girl, you don't go with your sh**ty 30 pix and think Imma sell you a 300000 pix armor, A) F*** YOU!

												The appeal of Recettear is not immediately obvious. Gameplay which is a lite mesh of dungeon crawl and economic sim, limited and cutesy graphics, irritating sound with untranslated voiceovers… However, it is definitely a case of the sum being greater than the parts. It is certainly a game which you can jump straight into – well, once you figure out how to get past the menu. For keyboard users, the select button is not obvious (for the record, it's 'z', which was only discovered after a minute of keyboard mashing…). There is regular and in-context help through the game which establishes the basics. Success, however, requires a lot of experimentation and awareness of what works. Some parts of the game feel a bit like a cross between Majesty and Diablo. While you control them directly in the dungeon, they buy equipment and make themselves available at their own initiative. It's quite possible to go through the main storyline with several adventurers never becoming available. Also, while you can loan them items, this takes valuable loot space. It's much better to sell to them, but since that's something you can't control, it takes a lot of manipulation (or luck) to get them properly equipped. The game's key storyline – paying off a debt weekly through profits from the item shop – lends purpose to the gameplay without completely restricting it. Indeed, the tight time limits provide much of the game's fun and challenge. Choosing to go for a last-ditch dungeon run to pick up high-priced items and risking not having enough time to sell them and make up the debt is just one example of the agonising strategic decisions to be made. Indeed, weighing up choices is a big part of the game. Stick with an expensive and high-levelled adventurer who can work the tougher dungeons or sacrifice the bigger rewards to build up another who may prove to be more powerful in the long run? Sell a useful item to an adventurer at a discount, or get every possible bit of money from a non-adventurer? Attract a certain type of customer with a dark store, or keep things light and draw another? Sacrifice several items to forge one? For what looks like a very slimmed-down mesh of two types of game, it presents a lot of challenges. Though failure is very possible, especially on a first run, it's possible to carry on with some of the assets you have collected. This makes the next attempt easier, eliminating a potential frustration. The writing is generally good, with some entertaining, and occasionally quite heart-warming, dialogue. The setting is interesting enough, though there is not that much to learn about it. Bring on a sequel! Sound is probably the least impressive aspect, and it gets downright annoying in dungeons. Switch it off and put on your own music.Just look at the hours played - that's the best endorsement I can give it.			",417,156,10,77,70,11,98

You must sell goods to your visitors. So how do you do it? Go into the dungeons and kill enemies there. Collect items, level your heroes, unlock new ones.Go shopping yourself, buy cheap items, then sell them gaining 2-3 times more money.----Maybe the game somewhat repetative, but worth the money and your time.

On top of this, it features extensive dungeon-diving and item-collecting components.

												Recettear is, Simply put, one of my favorite JRPG's ive played, and will continue to play. You wanna know how addicting this is? I once played this game for a total of 9 hours straight, through the night and until dawn at 5:00AM, not pausing once, or taking a break for food.Yeah, i felt dissapointed inside as well.The concept is incredibly simple. You're a girl, who's dad went off to go be a JRPG hero himself, and left you, his daughter...In massive debt. So, the option is simple! Start your own item shop, hiring adventurers to go collect items with you, selling them for a reeeeasonable feeeee, and watching yourself reach Mob-boss levels of upsurd wealth and greed.Recettear, for once, is a perfect 10/10 game. I never regretted buying it, and ill probaby continue to play it for times to come.			",208,44,0,37,25,1,10

												I didn't think much of the game at first - it sat in my library from a Humble Bundle for about 4 years.Then I picked it up because I remembered my friend talking about capitalism and such.Needless to say, I instantly got hooked onto the buying & selling gameplay - and the little mix of JRPG dungeon crawling elements added onto that really create a nice balanced gameplay. Recommended for everyone, especially those who love the concept of running their own shop.In terms of actual content and replayability, I'm 35~ hours into the game but haven't even completed ""the major dungeon"" yet. Not to mention there are a whole lot of characters you can play as in dungeons - I've only tinkered around with 2 or 3.10/10, amazing.			",70,4,1,3,2,0,6

												The only word I can really think of when I try to explain Recettear or rather how much I've managed to get into this game is ""silly"". The fact that it looks like some Peggle level casual game glazed in Moe and sprinkled with babies first market simulator should be more than enough to keep someone away from it were they to just skim the surface of it but believe it or not this is surprisingly immersing.  There are more than enough items in the game to make you have to put in effort to get a hold of all of them and in some cases causing you to work for hours to get  a single item (That's right folks, the dreaded RPG grind is present). Every sale will net you ""Merchant experience"" which will help you make it further into the 50 levels required to unlock all 29 level bonus which are expansions to your store, dungeon backpack and range of items available for you to buy or craft along with new abilities such as buying items from customers and taking orders in advance.But buy and selling items alone wouldn't make the game all that much fun would it? There are also Six dungeons for you to adventurer into with one of the eight adventurers you've managed to acquire. The floors in the dungeons range from 5 to 100 and the monster vary from dungeon to dungeon and floor to floor making each of them feel different from the last. The dialog is quirky and cute and the gameplay is usually simple but fun. This game has my yayifications and I would recommend at least trying the demo to anyone. CAPITALISM HO!

												Next time you’re off galavanting around a massive RPG world, slaying monsters and fulfilling your destiny, spare a thought for the shopkeeper in the last town who sold you all your gear. Without them, you’d be a nobody – you’d have no sword, no armor, no healing products. Confined to a live of standing behind that counter, all for your benefit. Except that, thanks to satirical shopkeep-em-up Recettear: An Item Shop’s Tale, we now know the truth – RPG shopkeepers lead an even more exciting life than their customer heroes. It can be a little too difficult to begin with, but stick at it and you’ll find one of the best RPGs of the year.With its delightful mixture of store simulation and dungeon crawling adventure RPG elements, Recettear is a refreshing twist on the usual adventure style RPG. It’s funny without being annoying, addictive without being too repetitive and has deceptively deep gameplay.Overall, Recettear is a charming game well worth the money!			",914,575,25,175,192,10,134

												Remember how the most fun to be had in Skyrim was trying to get the maximum most valuable loot from every dungeon, cackling with glee as you then sell it off to about five different shops, amassing huge amounts of cash, so much that money becomes meaningless to you, the glorious and unstoppable trillionaire Dragonborn?Yeah, me too.If, however, methodical and obsessive treasure selling and cash hoarding is actually not among your favorite RPG memories, your mileage with this game may very. Forget robotic NPCs, dragon hunting, falling off mountains. This game cuts out all the extraneous crud, leaving you with only the very best: treasure hoarding, buying and selling. All the cackling with glee, none of the frustration. Nothing to stand between you and the rapidly increasing numbers, the juggling and sorting of a thousand little items, the excitment and joys of haggling and customer service. It's the game you never knew you needed but always secretly wanted in your heart of hearts. You might stare at the screen in disbelief, thinking no game about just buying and selling items has any right to be so dang fun. But I never stop loving the ring of that cash register, or high-fiving the nearest living human or cat or whatever's nearby when I amass 500,000+ moneys in one day because sweets were on sale, and just sitting and smiling as I enter dungeons with my wizard friend, exploding enemies in bursts of beautiful fire so we can gather more items. It's addictive and fun and basically the best thing ever. Of course, because this game truly knows the joys of the methodical and obssessive item seller, it knows you'll get burnt out if all you do is sit behind a counter and watch numbers roll, no matter how satsifying and enjoyable that may be for a while. So it's the delightful writing and characters, the brief but highly enjoyable story events, that truly make this one of the best games I've ever played. You've got a lovely cast of truly charming characters keeping things interesting, and stories of just the right size, scale, and length, that add to the game without detracting from it. You've got simple but fairly fun dungeon diving that manages to not be too tedious. And the game is drowning in humor, and some inexplicable, surprising things that can be delightful to stumble across (fish? FISH?!). The game is laughing. You're laughing. We're all laughing. It's even got a corny theme song. How can you not love it, I ask you!? Only some fiend who hates items would hate this game. Begone, fiend! Stick to your mountains and troll slaying, why don't you! Ride away on your dragon! We'll be rolling around on our mountains of cash, partying with our customers, buying awesome new decor and counters and books about DOOOOMSDAAAAY. You won't be missed.  One thing I was worried about was replay value, and just how long this thing could actually go on and still be fun. My fears, however, were soothed! There is a surprisingly large amount of story content, enough to last you for months (mabye even years, I don't know, I'm not there yet) if you don't binge-play the game too intensely. There's more than one game mode and lots of items to collect and dungeon diving to do and you can just keep trying to get better and better at haggling and learning all the characters and basically there's all sorts of goals you can strive for and stuff that'll keep you busy and invested. So that's good! I was dreading that it would all come to a halt or wind up boring but nope, it just stays awesome forever. Dream come true.I also like that it's casual enough that I don't have to invest huge amounts of brainpower to it, but deep enough that I can dive in and have fun and it's still a satisfying experience. If you're a busy person you can devote a few hours to it (or even thirty minutes, fifteen minutes, you can save whenver you want) and it probably won't suck your life away. YAYTL;DR: play this game if you like items and/or selling stuff and/or numbers/moneys			",21,17,1,7,3,0,0

												This game does nothing better than completely make you one with the world. At times you'll feel filthy rich, and other times, completely helpless. As you run the shop every day, the game teaches you very early on that you must be as efficient as possible to maximize profit and not lose the game (and your home). Even though collection day seems like a far-off hurdle, you must not remain complacent with your business. All it takes is a haggle taken too far, or purchases made too carelessly to ruin you. As Tear counts your 80,000pix fee only to count 79,860pix.... Well, game over. Your payment is void.Much like running a business, this game is difficult. You have get it right once. When you lose you have to start over from day one. Fortunately, you and your adventurers retain all levels, experience, and materials you've acquired, except starting with 1000pix again. Unfortunately, you have to run through all the dungeons from the beginning.There's a lot to stomach when you first run through the game. Eventually you have to keep track of orders and making sure you have a wide variety of stock. I have notes scribbled on my desk about how one customer never purchases anything at 115%, and how this customer buys at around 125~130% of cost. It can also feel grindy at times when you're in the dungeons fighting enemies. But what makes Recettear so warm and inviting is the fact that you are so much a part of this world as much as the next NPC. No matter how hard it is to make ends meet in your store, you are still a participant in the town around you. Your business, customers, and explorations are as real and as stressful as you want them to be. To paraphrase Tear, ""It's more of an art than a science. There's no map to follow."" There are so many variables to take into account. Recettear is not so much a simulation, than it is an experience.			",19,3,3,2,5,2,2

												In most RPG settings you clear out dungeons, then go and sell the unwanted items to shopkeepers.In Recettear, however, you are the shopkeeper. Forced into opening a shop by a loan shark fairy to pay off your father's huge adventuring debts, you need to pay off increasingly huge installments each week or lose your home as collateral.The game starts of simple enough, but as you progress the game will introduce new features, such as customers placing orders for you to fulfil later, and market fluctuations that will allow you to both buy low and sell high, increasing your profits significantly given the right situation. You can even sponsor adventurers to explore dungeons for you, and during these sessions you'll control them as they fight monsters and explore ruins. The main reasons for doing this is to give you ingredients to combine to make better equipment for the shop, and to unlock more adventurers to play as. Some of them will even come to your store and buy better equipment and weapons for themselves, increasing their effectiveness in the optional combat sections of the game. You'll probably even end up giving huge discounts to the adventurers you hire the most just so they'll be powerful and keep coming back for more deals. It's this kind of thing that really adds to the game's charm and helps you care about the side characters as you learn more about them.The game is actually very forgiving and failure to meet a payment will send you back to the second day with your inventory, adventurer levels and store reputation intact. This makes something that could have been a very frustrating experience stay fun and oddly relaxing, although it is possible to beat the game in a single run if you feel up for the challenge. Completing the game unlocks the ability to start a new game +, survival mode where you need to pay off increasing amounts of debt each week until it becomes impossible to pay back, or simply carry on where you left off without needing to worry about a deadline each week. Combined with the large amount of items you can discover and create this results in a good replay value, especially for completionists.As for downsides, the game is bad at explaining itself from the first tutorial. Tear will start the game off by telling you to set the prices for around 130%, but this will actually anger most of the customers and will cause less people to come to your store from the very beginning. You're actually better off selling for 106% - 112% until the public start liking you more, causing the shoppers to eventually warm up to buying the later and more expensive objects you can unlock, and raising your combo to speed up leveling. Neither the level combo nor town reputation are mentioned in the tutorials, which is strange considering they're actually very important to succeeding at the game and it can be frustrating until you realize they are both major factors in your progress.The dungeon exploration is also very repetitive after a while, but is necessary in order to unlock more of the side stories and characters to come to your store. Since merchant levels are more important to success than your adventurers' combat levels you'll probably ignore the dungeons after a certain amount of time to play the markets, especially after you unlock items in the market that make the payouts from these sessions seem small in comparison.If you're looking for an original take on the traditional JRPG setting and like the idea of running a store in a fantasy realm then I'd strongly recommend picking Recettear up.

Luckily some shady person-faerie thing comes along and tells you it'll all be okay and that you doesn't have to pay it off all at once.... after all, as a little under-aged girl, you are able to pay off in many different ways hmm?So she sets off to build a nice sign to turn her house into her new company where her clients can come and visit, she even fancied up in front of the windows to allow for window-shoppers to see her wares. As she is ready to earn her own bread working in the only business she will be thought how, she proudly puts her rather undevelopped melon seeds up for everyone to see from the window... and the hopes of catching a good price for them. Time to open her newfound ""item shop!""Japan, I know you guys have been nuked twice and its effects last for generations... and for that... we thank you, for making this into a ""thing.""

												This game has a little bit of everything: management, tycoon, random loot, crafting, and even RPG. I do mean ""a little"", too. The biggest regret of Recettear is that it doesn't achieve greatness in any individual category, but it's a great combination of genres. All the different things you can do keep you from getting bored at any one task, and each benefits the other. When you go adventuring, you earn goods to sell and ingredients to craft with. When you craft an item, you can sell it to your fighters for better stats. You get the idea.I got about 50 hours worth of play out of my first go-through (though to be fair I had it running in the background for some off that), and I may play it once or twice again before retiring it for good. Definitely worth the price on sale, and maybe even at full price.			",1,3,0,2,9,1,6

												Ever since I played RPGs, I always wondered what those little NPCs in the shops do after the hero leaves. I got my answer with Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale. And boy, maybe being the hero is not the best job in the world.The neverending struggle to pay off your debt is quite a challenge in itself as well as the light dungeoning gameplay on the side which you can use the gain items to sell. I have spent quite a fair amount of time with the game and, needless to say, I am very pleased with the experience.I highly recommend everyone try out the demo to get the basic feel of the game, which games nowadays seem to forget to do. Not a game for everyone, but a game for everyone to try.			",174,22,4,16,26,2,21

												The idea of running an item shop for other adventurers and restocking it based on your own exploits in nearby dungeons is a great mix. Though I feel like the dungeon elements lack a bit in comparison to the store simulation elements, it's still a very enjoyable experience. I don't know if I can recommend it at full price, but if it ever goes on sale, you should definitely pick it up and put some time into it.			",336,61,6,34,46,5,63

												This is my first Steam review, and I've chosen to do it about this wonderful little gem: Recettear. I have to admit that when I bought this game, I did it purely on a whim one day when it was on sale, and I really was not expecting much. But this game really ended up surprising me, and in a very good way.You are Recette, a young girl who ends up being forced to repay her fathers debts and are accompanied by Tear, the fairy who was sent to recover the debts payment. Together the two of you open up a store, Recettear, so that you can make enough money to repay what you owe. The gameplay can be roughly divided into two parts: store management and dungeon crawling.Each day in the game is divided into 4 time slots and you can choose what to do for each one: go to town to hit the market to stock up on goods, visit the guild to grab an adventurer for some dungeon crawling or tend to your store. Store management is the main aspect of the game and in my own opinion the most fun. It also has a surprising depth to it. Make sure to buy stock when price is low and sell items when their value is higher. Choose what to put up for sale. Barter with you customers and fulfill their special orders. Change the look of your store to suit it to certain customers preferences.There are several adventurers you will meet and that you can take with you to do some dungeon crawling. There are several dungeons with multiple levels and bosses in the game, and exploring them will get you several items you can sell at your store or use in recipes to create better items. Exploring the dungeons also serves to advance the story which, without spoiling anything major, actually continues far beyond when you have finally managed to pay your fathers debts.The game has a really interesting story and likable characters. Cute is really the best way to describe the way the game looks. A special mention must be given to the games english translation which is really well done. Once your debt is paid for the first time, some new game modes are unlocked, and the game has a considerable replayability value if your goal is to get all items in the game (doing so will require starting a new game once for each adventurers loyalty item). It should be noted that it is possible to start a new game and carry over all the money, items and store upgrades from your other saves. This is helpful when only trying to get each adventurers loyalty item since you do not have to worry about making enough money to pay off the debt in the early phase of the game.There are two things I feel I should mention though: in my experience, dungeon crawling can be very tiresome and repetitive which is why I feel this is the least interesting aspect of the game. This is especially problematic if you want to get all items, which requires doing A LOT of grinding. The shop management aspect can become something you can do almost mechanically once you've upgraded the shop to the max, unlocked all possible items in the market and have gotten used to each customers characteristics when bartering. In my opinion this doesn't take any of the fun away from this aspect though.Finally, to end this review. If you do not like anything with a cute/anime aesthetic, or if you are looking for an action packed game do not buy this. To everyone else looking for a nice little way of occupying your time, I can only fully recommend it.			",115,21,1,22,5,0,6

												This game is absolutely amazing. I Loved every bit of it, in fact I crave more. I have only two complaints and one question. My first compliant is the difficulty. The first and second payment is fairly easy to get, but you start to get big jumps in payments and as a new player the jumps were too much for me to handle. Good news about this though is that the game wlil start you over on the second day and you get to keep all your items and level (you start over with 1,000 pix though). And while this makes you more expirenced the next time around your more likely to win after that, I much rather if they had put the increased time to extend the game. Instead of hte game taking place in just one month why not three? Let the first six payments be easy to pay so you have time to dungeon crawl and explore. I wanted to explore the world more and I wanted to get more content out of the game. Which leads me to the second complaint, it was too short. It wasn't so short that I wouldn't reccommend the game, it's just the game is so good it leaves you wanting more. After beating the game you get endless mode, which allows you to keep going through the game for as long as you want, which allows you see additionial content. You also get survival mode, which is a mode where payments keep increasing until your overwhelmed, I liked how it was introduced at the end of the game too. The one extra mode you get is new game plus, which allows you to keep all your levels and items but still get to start over. The only other thing I can think of that might turn someone away from the game is the launcher, it's more like a visual gameboy advance launcher. I don't entirely understand why that is, but it didn't bother me. Over all this game left me craving more and wishing they would have had put more content into it. But the content that is there is without a doubt good enough and enough there for me to recommend this game. It is an awesome game that I would reccommend to pretty much anyone, except someone who absolutely hates management games.			",178,11,0,24,17,0,17

												This cute little bartering game, with optional extras, is a cute time passer. So your dad is out to save the world, cool right? WRONG! Maybe it would be cool, ya know, if his broke♥♥♥♥♥didn't get himself killed by a dragon trying to pay off a loan shark. Anyways, this leaves you alone with the choice of having everything you know and own reposessed, or working for a slave-driving fairy in an item shop she puts together in your house so you're not forced to live in a card board box. No really, if you don't pay back her increasing payment deadlines, you will end up in a cardboard box, enjoy the building pressure.Recettear in a nut shell is like I said before a bartering RPG. You constantly sell items hopeing to have enough to pay back your next deadline. The value of items constantly changes as time goes by and the story is fun with a 'special' kind of humor. I enjoyed it, but it's not for everyone. You work for the merchant guild, but there is an adventurers guild. The adventurers in said guild can give you a chance to go into short dungeons as a chance to gain more items at a 100% profit margine. You can customize your shop a little and there's other little neat optional things to do aswell, but you can discover those yourself.My entire main story experiance took like 9 hours, I had to get the swing of things at first, but after I caught some momentum it was a breeze keeping up with every deadline amount including the last one before the deadline is a problem. I really only entered the dungeon twice, maybe 3 times. Just long enough to beat 2 bosses, which were both easy. I mostly just sold items at a great profit margine using increased priced items and did more then fine speeding right on through the game. Definatly worth the $10 I spent!

It's actually not that easy, you probably won't be able to keep up with ""Rent"" for the shop on your first go, but its a lot of fun if you're into anime-style games.

												I bought this awhile back based on the storm of positive buzz surrounding it and my own passionate love of the free market in its many forms. What I found was not only a most excellent simulator of that strange and wonderous machine known as the marketplace, but also cleverly interwoven simulations of the murder-and-riches-filled hole in the ground and the confusing morass that is society. Recettear is a game for our era. It explores all the great questions of our era through the saga of that iconic hero of the West, the starving entrepreneur. It touches upon such themes as love, loss, homelessness and hunger while also seeking to transcend them through good and honest capitalism. Yet most importantly, it touches upon the most wonderous power of free exchange, namely that two people can each better their lives through the simple modicum of trade. My inner poet wept, my inner economist exulted and my whole self basked in the divine joy of commercial success.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely addicted to this game. I always liked the idea of running a shop, let alone an item shop on an rpg. With the ability to go dungeon crawling and collecting an aray of items to later sell in your shop, customizing the shop to your design aesthetic, and even haggling with your customers for your ideal price. To add on top of that, it has a nice unique story, sadly the main story doesn't go on for as long as one would be expecting though. But aside from that, after completion you can continue the game as before, but without the deadlines. Doing the secondary part of the story, gaining more characters and learning about their origins and the like. I highly recommend this game, worth every penny!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not a terrible game, but certainly has ""doujin"" taste to it, despite it's look and presentation.This game is a mixture of dungeoun crawler and monopoly sim together. Is this fun? It sure is. As the game was released (the first copy, not steam release) you do have to accept the fact that this game is aged. The graphic is near PS1, or early PS2 titles. Music is nice and cheerful. Story is charming, despite its actual story isn't. I think the character is helping out a lot. Recette, the protagonist, needs to pay her runnaway-father's debt of his house, otherwise she will be homeless.The sim itself is well made- you have certain amount of time in each day (works like turn basis) and you have few options to get yourself a money; buy/sell from other store, hire a client for dungeon crawling, or open your shop. Your merchant level increase by selling item in FAIR prices, and as it goes higher, you can sell things differently- such as custom order, or purchase vending machine, etc. Each customer will have different preference. So, you likely don't sell long sword to a little girl well, she would likely want to get food or books. Time also affect what kind of customer you'll bring in.The dungeoun crawling is very straight forward, but the dungeon is randomly generated. You can use an item you find in dungeon, or save it to sell them later.Unfortunately, the game has 1 massive issue for me- the sheer difficulty. Almost to the point of unnecessary. Each week you have a set of debt that you need to pay back. The debpt increases by each week, however, it increases in such a rapid pace- first week is 10,000 second week is 30,000... so on. This is caused by the fact that you only have 5 weeks to finish the payment. In order to finish game fast, you have to have pure luck, as the entire game is randomly generated. The random event occurs from 2nd week (such as gold booming or bad reputation towards all of sword) and I truly mean randomly generated- even if you save/load, you will get random event. The meeting with important character (playable) is also randomly generated. All of the treasures in dungeon is randomly generated. To cover this issue, the Recettear allows you to carryout your items once you hit ""game over"". Your money will reset to 1000 while all of your items remains the same. I understand that forcing you to cycle the game was their only plan to make this game feel less short then already is. THe problem? Well, once you got gameover, you will be sent back to day2. You can repeat this over and over until you beat the game. It gets repetitive, I also felt less encouraged to go back to day 2 from day 30. This game is impressive ""doujin"" game, as this entire project was done by single person. Still, $20 price tag can seriously compete with other titles. The game itself is good, however, it may not fit for everyone. It's worth giving a try.If I had to give a score it would be 6.5/10.Another nice note: this game is old enough to play with my crappy 8inch tablet. Nice.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a lot of fun!I went into this game expecting an average game due to the look on the cover, but I got something that actually surprised me in how fun it was. To give a brief summary of the gameplay, you are a shopkeeper selling villagers and adventureres items in order to pay back debts. So basically it is the other side of the gameplay in most RPG games which makes it entertaining. The game is rather easy to understand and get a hold of and is realitvely short once you understand it. Paying off the debt isn't actually that big of a challenge, but its fun to work to that. There is also an ARPG mode where you can explore dungeons and get items back to sell. Although the game is pretty fun, it starts to get repetitive near the end. However, due to the shortness of the game, unless you continue on in endless or survival, it is the perfect amount to keep you interested. Overall, fun game to play especially if you like the feeling of making profit (like me. I always go play the role of merchant in games I play and try to horde and maximize profit haha).Rating: 8.6/10Recommend: under $5			",1009,366,27,101,102,10,123

												Recettear is probably one of the most adorable games I have ever played. You know: Every usual RPG has that nice item shop owner that sells you your swords, potions, health-items (preferably food) and the likes? Well, here, this nice store owner is YOU. Yes, you. It even bears a small adventure mode where you are able to travel to dungeons and fight monsters with the help of said adventurers. This game is a whole unique experience and I really regret to have bought this game while it was 75% off.For people who like small, pretty games which look like they are made with lots of love and dedication to a nice gaming experience, this game is an absolute must have!

												Despite the fact I was initially skeptical of this game due to its appearance, Recettear has to be one of the most addicting games I've played. Recettear tells the story of Recette, a young girl whose dad disappeared leaving behind a massive debt for her to deal with. In order to pay the debt back and save her home from being claimed by the bank, she converts it into her own shop to earn the money. The game combines two main gameplay elements: operating your shop, and dungeon diving to find items to sell or use to craft something even more valuable. Running the shop is very fun, surprisingly so even, and personally I found the dungeons to be fun, at times fairly challenging, and a great to mix things up from time to time. The characters of Recettear are also loveable, with some very charming and quirky personalities, which make for some seriously funny moments. Overall a great game, and definitely worth the price (especially if you buy it on sale)! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*WARNING* **SPOILERS AHEAD** *JUST IN CASE YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU READ ON AND FIND OUT SOMETHING YOU WISH YOU COULD HAVE EXPERIENCED AND LEARNED ABOUT IN THE GAME BEFORE READING THIS* It's a review, of course there's spoilers. =PThis game was suggested to me when I said I would love a game where I can just run the shop, go off to get the things to sell all on my own, and have no worries... well in this game you have huge worries! Your dad is a low-life who left you with his loan having to pay it off with large sums of Pix (game currency) otherwise you're homeless. This snarky Fairy (Tear) bosses you around and you have to pay her so much money at the end of each week (if you don't have the money at the end of the week, ""Game Over""). You have to go out which means your shop will have to be closed for a period of time, going to town to buy/delve further into the story takes up some time but going dungeon diving takes up a lot of time and the number of things you can carry are small... Don't Die (kind of die).Once you beat the game... beat the game? You don't beat the game, you still have to make money to keep food on the table and logs in the fireplace, you keep your shop running and you progress through the story on Endless Mode, heck you can go through it again on New Game+. You most likely won't get all the Adventures your first time through (did you think you were fighting, you're way too dainty for that). Just a note, if you notice you're not going to make the loan payment by the end of the week get all the stuff you know will sell and go dungeon diving like crazy, you'll keep those things when the game pretends you were just dreaming you did all that. You'll also keep your Merchant levels and 'basically' everything else except your money. You're able to change the look, size, and layout of your store, plus vending machine so you can sell more items during the day. I absolutely love this game, I wish I could play more and hopefully soon I will have a chance to get the rest of the adventurers. It's rather short if you play it hardcore like I did, it feels like I played a lot but the number of hours I played doesn't match up to the number of days that sped through my mind (talking game time, not real). At first, I was surprised by the amount of Pix I needed each week but I managed to get the game clear after the second go through. The game is cute and sometimes Recette can be annoying when she repeats the same phrases or a customer says things that is rude to her then she's all upset with herself but it was the customer who was in the wrong, 'Sell something to you for below it's base price? Woman, you don't risk your life for me, get out of my store!' I do believe Tear will tell you this also, if one of your adventurers come to buy an upgrade sell it cheaper than you would to someone else. You can't just give them gear, you can buy gear and put it on them while in the dungeon but they have to come to the store and purchase it themselves to own, giving it to them to wear while in the dungeon swaps what they currently have on for the new gear which takes up space in your bags.So go now, build your item shop for the townsfolk and adventurers, be the person they turn to to get everything they need, send people into battle to fight for your items, and for goodness sake don't forget to save!

												Recettear really surprised me, it came out quite a while ago seemingly from nowhere and it didn't get much attention. The game has very anime stylized aesthetics that will, In my mind somewhat unfairly, turn some people off to it right away, and the graphics remind me of the latest 2D Final Fantasy games. The game breaks down to you becoming a shopkeeper unwillingly and needing to buy/find/sell/and haggle in order to pay the bills and stop the bank from taking your family's house. The game feels to me like animal crossing in a way, as you can customize your store/item layout often placing things in the window to draw the attention of the people on the street, that and the fact that you start out having to repay a massive debt. The game has a very interesting dungeon system where you can hire adventurers that you take control of to go into these dungeons and fight monsters/bosses in order to obtain rare items for your store, the dungeons play out like the original Legend of Zelda game with that kind of fighting, and a  randomized dungeon each time you enter, making it less tedious if you fail the boss fights and or fail to escape. The game plays solid and starts out quite easy but almost immediately ramps up the difficulty making you have to be more cautious with haggling and be more efficient with your time if you want to keep playing. The game is fun and has very few drawbacks other than the rather sharp learning curve after your first few payments (and the dumb little girl who always tries to haggle you down below your bottom line), but even that doesn't detract from it too much as you keep your stock when you fail so you can start over with a leg up next time. My experience with this game was rather positive and it is VERY addicting, just like the games it seems to take inspiration from. If you can get it for a good price it's definitely worth your time.

												I bought this game two weeks ago and have already put 80 hours into it (Thanks, unemployment!). The game is cute as hell and the fighting plays like a mix of Illusion of Gaia and Star Ocean. The store mechanic is actually interesting, where I find stuff and can't wait to sell it so I can get money to buy stuff which I then, in turn, can't wait to use in the dungeons. Excellent balance and great at keeping things fresh. Once the main story is over, the game becomes something of a grindfest, but if you play the Disgaea series, this will be nothing new to you.

												It's not a terrible game, but certainly has ""doujin"" taste to it, despite it's look and presentation.This game is a mixture of dungeoun crawler and monopoly sim together. Is this fun? It sure is. As the game was released (the first copy, not steam release) you do have to accept the fact that this game is aged. The graphic is near PS1, or early PS2 titles. Music is nice and cheerful. Story is charming, despite its actual story isn't. I think the character is helping out a lot. Recette, the protagonist, needs to pay her runnaway-father's debt of his house, otherwise she will be homeless.The sim itself is well made- you have certain amount of time in each day (works like turn basis) and you have few options to get yourself a money; buy/sell from other store, hire a client for dungeon crawling, or open your shop. Your merchant level increase by selling item in FAIR prices, and as it goes higher, you can sell things differently- such as custom order, or purchase vending machine, etc. Each customer will have different preference. So, you likely don't sell long sword to a little girl well, she would likely want to get food or books. Time also affect what kind of customer you'll bring in.The dungeoun crawling is very straight forward, but the dungeon is randomly generated. You can use an item you find in dungeon, or save it to sell them later.Unfortunately, the game has 1 massive issue for me- the sheer difficulty. Almost to the point of unnecessary. Each week you have a set of debt that you need to pay back. The debpt increases by each week, however, it increases in such a rapid pace- first week is 10,000 second week is 30,000... so on. This is caused by the fact that you only have 5 weeks to finish the payment. In order to finish game fast, you have to have pure luck, as the entire game is randomly generated. The random event occurs from 2nd week (such as gold booming or bad reputation towards all of sword) and I truly mean randomly generated- even if you save/load, you will get random event. The meeting with important character (playable) is also randomly generated. All of the treasures in dungeon is randomly generated. To cover this issue, the Recettear allows you to carryout your items once you hit ""game over"". Your money will reset to 1000 while all of your items remains the same. I understand that forcing you to cycle the game was their only plan to make this game feel less short then already is. THe problem? Well, once you got gameover, you will be sent back to day2. You can repeat this over and over until you beat the game. It gets repetitive, I also felt less encouraged to go back to day 2 from day 30. This game is impressive ""doujin"" game, as this entire project was done by single person. Still, $20 price tag can seriously compete with other titles. The game itself is good, however, it may not fit for everyone. It's worth giving a try.If I had to give a score it would be 6.5/10.Another nice note: this game is old enough to play with my crappy 8inch tablet. Nice.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I daresay that Recettear is one of my all-time favorite games. Having played well over fifty hours of the game at this point, I feel the need to update my review (which was already positive).In Recettear, you play as a young girl named Recette, whose father went missing while out adventuring and left behind a mountain of debt. When a faerie named Tear comes to collect on that debt, she suggests that Recette convert part of her home into a shop in order to come up with the money or risk losing the house outright. That's where the game begins.There's so much more to Recettear than buying low, selling high and scouring dungeons for loot to sell at 100% profit. The game *does* revolve around buying/selling and dungeon-crawling, but these two different aspects of the game complement one another in several meaningful ways.Dungeon-crawling will definitely net you plenty of items, but they're usually not very valuable. However, you can find ingredients that you can, in turn, fuse together at the guild to create more valuable items. Also, you'll meet new adventurers in dungeons, and they'll eventually become regular customers at your shop.Buying from and selling to the aforementioned adventurers in your shop allows you to build relationships with them while also allowing them to gradually spend more money at your shop. They'll purchase equipment from you for use in dungeons, as well, freeing up space in their inventories that you'd probably otherwise use when lending them equipment.There's more to managing your store than just buying and selling items, though. You can change the carpets, counters, flooring and walls of your store to attract different customers. You can expand the size of your store to allow you to stock more items. You can put different items in your display windows to attract different customers. You can take advantage of local fads in order to sell certain types of items in large numbers while also attracting more customers.Even more interesting, in addition to buying and selling based on regular market fluctuations, you'll find that you can influence pricing to some extent by outright ""crashing"" the value of some items by selling too many of them. While this may initially sound like a bad thing, you'll have a while to purchase said item(s) at ridiculously low costs while waiting for the demand on them to bounce back. Really nice touch.While Recettear has enough to offer in terms of depth to warrant a purchase, I daresay that the game's charm is what makes it something really special. Recette's kindness and naivety makes her a really fun character, and Tear acts as an excellent foil to her in terms of personality. The various adventurers and townspeople interact with Recette and Tear throughout the game, and their individual personalities do a lot to better flesh out Recette and Tear. I can't say enough about this game's charm. The entire experience is just so great.Before I close this review, I'd like to make a recommendation to new players (or existing players who have issues with certain customers, namely the little girl who breaks your damn combos): Use a guide that outright tells you which percentages to use when buying/selling. The game does make the mistake of giving you some rotten advice at the start, and following this advice will prevent customers from leveling up and having access to higher budgets.If you're concerned about a guide spoiling the game for you, then don't be. The percentages are a very small part of the game. It's still very challenging, as you'll still often find yourself having to take chances by spending 90-95% of your money when you're just a few thousand pix away from making your weekly payment goal in order to come back and blow past your goal, giving you an incredible sense of satisfaction. You still have to play the market intelligently to win.Anyway, I can't recommend this game enough. It's easily one of the best games on Steam, and I daresay that it features some of the most charming characters in video game history.			",776,201,40,102,66,3,125

												It's an interesting take on the usual RPG where, instead of adventuring, you're the shop owner.  The game is about a girl name Recette that is living all by herself ever since her father ran away.  She originally created the shop in order to shoulder the large debt that her father had built up over the years.  Tear, the other character the game gets its name from, is a debt collector that helps manage the store so that you can maximize your profits.While this seems like just a boring management game from my description, it actually does have moments where you can go out and fight monsters.  Recette can hire heroes to help her collect items to sell in her store.  The game turns into an action RPG for those moments with gameplay that's not dissimilar to the top-down entries in the Legend of Zelda franchise.This game has colorful characters that populate the city.  While most of them are kind of cliche, it fits with the game's atmosphere.  This is supposed to be an action RPG from the eyes of Recette, the girl who runs the item store.

Product received for free
												I recieved this game as a gift. I had been wanting it for quite some time. I was not disapointed. As a critic of many games I am pretty picky. I have to give this game 4 and a half stars out of 5. I am a fan of simulation games. However most games where you run a shop are so shallow, and empty. What I love about this game is you can go out, and find stuff while defeating monsters. It is one step up from Hometown story because of that. Sure Hometown story you can find things, but they are far, and few between. you also dont fight monsters. I enjoy how customisable the shop is. The story line is so enjoyable. This game has intertained me the whole time. Even if you fail paying off a debt, and have to start at day 2 you keep all your levels, and items on hand. I was so greatful for that. I have not come across many bugs. every now and then the game freezes for a minute. There are few things I would change. However I would like the character to be customisable, and to be able to dress her in differint clothes. maybe as she levels up she gets more options. Hometown story had that option. I understand her name being unchangable. I do not know if you will make any chages since this game is not new. However if you do make a sequal I will look forward to playing it. I will probably purchase it myself. and hopefully give it 5 stars.			",17,12,0,8,25,0,19

												I'm not a huge fan of cutesy anime styled games, but this one grabbed my interest and held it for many hours. The idea is original, it's not overly complicated, and just seemed to keep me engaged looking for the next shiny thing or getting to that next level. It was an easy buy while on sale during the holidays. Definitely worth a look when it shows up in the bargain bin sales on Steam.			",296,91,19,118,52,2,72

												This is a weird hybrid game I purchased due to it's cult following giving it a very high rating.I am glad I took a chance with this unusual XSeed like game.The developers had a playful approach and didn't take the story or characters too seriously which results in a simple but light heartened tale driving the game forward.The game never 'hooked' me but kept me interested due to it's mysteries & progression systems.There are 2 distinct areas of gameplay; combat (minimalistic Zelda) & business management (mostly buying & selling).Most of the systems in this game are well designed & I would like to see more of them with other games.After finishing the game, I was informed that I missed a lot of content (around 30%).I tried replaying a second time a couple years after my first play though & its hard to stay with it (gets highly repetative athough still fun).A sequal is highly desired.In my personal ""Top 10 Hidden Gems"".

												This game was an incredibly pleasant surprise.  I picked it up on sale not expecting much at all and very quickly became addicted.Don't let this game fool you.  On the surface you are a sweet little girl caught in the throws of flash poverty after your deadbeat dad runs off with everything that will put food on the table, may or may not get eaten by a dragon, proceeding to leave you to pay off his enormous debts via an item shop.  In reality, this game is a corruption simulator in which you experience first hand how a little girl can become drunk with capitalism, exploit other small children for their goods then turn around to sell those same goods to the elderly at obsurd prices.  It COULD stop there but it doesnt.  Why be ""we can retire early"" rich when you can be ""I own a back yard pool full of slaves that don't like me."" rich, stop by the local adventurers guild to risk other peoples lives for your gain by sending them into a 1000 floor living dungeon that rearranges as they manage to survive.  Game's cute tho.basic Pros and Cons:Cons: -Really long winded intro with mildly redundant dialogue.  It's skippable but you almost need to suffer through the useless bits because there are not so useless bits that make sure you know what you are doing.-Some what repetative vocal sound effects that are really charming at first but get old.-Almost impossible to do your first run through without getting game overed, even as a veteran player.  The Game over is fake however, causing you to start the game over. You get to keep any items you had though.  This can be abused quite heavily.Pros:-A rediculous amount of content with well thought out features.  Every 20 minutes or so a new feature was revealed and completely delighted me.-Extremely charming graphics including environments, character art, items and dungeons.-Shop sim plus dungeon crawler combined, with tons of gear to find and hoard and tons of unlockable characters with 100's of randomly generated dungeon levels with reasonably easy but creative boss monsters every 5 floors.You will HATE this game if you are a hardcore gamer who is a diablo/call of duty, intense games only kind of person.You will HATE this game if you hate anime art styles and light hearted cheery dialogue that makes you want to vomit sunshine.You will LOVE this game if you are weeaboo as a hello kitty doll on the dashboard of a honda civic at a cosplay convention.You will LOVE this game if you enjoy hoarding loot then selling said loot to strangers at obsurd prices to feul a vicious cycle of dungeon crawling rinse and repeat.You will LOVE this game if you want the addictive side of facebook games without the paywalls.Seriously I put 18 hours into this game in 4 days.nuff said.

												I am actually surprised by this game.When I was gifted it I thought it was some meh kinda game.But when I played it I found out its sorta addicting.The whole concept of the game is to make money to pay off a debt by selling things.You get things by dungeon crawling,buying wholesale from shops, and getting items sold to you by customers who like your shop. There are different heroes that can become your ally that will escort you through dungeons and also become your customers.There are even dungeon boss fights in this game.Its a action dungeon crawler with rpg aspect of increasing your shops reputations,lvling up your escort heroes as they fight for you that you hired,and running a business. If you bored,want something new to play, and this game on sale, give it a whirl you might like it.			",381,74,14,73,45,5,92

												I've beaten this game and it was quite fun. As an Otaku who loves JRPG's, playing this was rather enjoyable. The story was interesting, the music good/appropriate for what it was used for, and the gameplay was enticing for a grinder (read: perfectionist) like me. I still need to beat the secrets, but that will take time. I really enjoyed this game and would recommend it to anyone who loves games of this genre (JRPG effectively imo).			",289,66,17,46,24,0,29

												A shop simulator with dungeon crawling thrown into the mix! So far, the game is too chatty for me, but I'm glad that I can skip events. The only problem is that I'm on my fourth loop and have a tendency to skip every event because I can't be bothered to check if it's new or not. It would be great if the game could remember what I've already seen, but I'm not going to knock any points. So far, I've lived in a carboard box twice. Capitalism, ho! 7/10			",48,16,0,17,5,0,0

												Bought the game two days ago. Already played ~37 hours.This game is the perfect mix of comedy, cuteness, capitalism and crafting. It is incredibbly addicting, especially for those of you who love crafting games like Minecraft and Don't Starve.While I beat the main story by paying off all my debt, there is still hours of playtime ahead of me. I still get to explore the dungeons, befriend adventurers, decorate my shop, rip off customers, and collect every single item on the database - I'm only at 50% now!This game is very fun, it does remind me slightly of a simulation app on a smartphone, but is definitely worth the money, especially when it is on sale.Capitalism, ho!

												I'm not certain how to classify this title. It's a game where you run a shop and you have to gather materials/items in an action-RPG kind of way. It sounds extremely simple, but it actually is extremely DEEP. Plus, there's a time limit in the form of weekly payments. It's pretty hard. But great at the same time ! The characters are 2D, and the world itself is in 3D. It looks charming.I expected something ok, but I got something great in the end.

												I wasn't sure about this game when I bought it. I figured there was a good chance it would end up on my ""wasted money Steam purchases"" basket. Only a few days later, when I bothered to check it out, this game became one hell of a pleasant surprise.Recettear is a weird mix of simulation, hack & slash and role-playing, with the cute japanese kind of graphics and animations that I really love. You play Recette, the cute and naive item-shop seller girl, who's teamed up with Tear, the fairy, who at first seems like the tough business...fairy(?) personality, but already a few hours into the game, I'm getting the feeling she has a totally different agenda than the one she's letting out.As Recette, you need to manage your items shop and make money, so you can pay a debt to Tear's agency (whatever it is), so they wouldn't take your house. In addition to buying and selling routine, you can also hire adventurers and go to dungeons. In return for your payment to the adventurer, you get to keep the items you find in the dungeon, and sell them with nearly 100% profit. All in all, this game is a lot of fun, definitely worth its price, in my humble opinion.			",233,98,1,103,60,0,70

												So.. run a shop, trying to make money.. while also paying debs.. while also adventuring and discovering the underlying storyline.. while also managing your adventurers/playing as them... this is recettear in a nutshell.. did i mention it has good 'energy' and a all around postive feeling with it? I did not expect to like it (not a big fan of simulation games), but here i am, recommending it! Give it a try, this game is simply good and well made.. also it's honest.

												This is a fun little game about running an item shop and rip off your customers.The gameplay is a lot of fun, and when you aren't trying to sell everything in town at the highest price, you can if you so choose go to a dungeons and loot more stuff to sell.The game also has some pretty good replay value with New Game+, Survival Mode, or to simply continue on your save after the game is complete. And if you really want to, you could complete the item encyclopedia.Overall a very fun and interesting game, if you even have the slightest urge to play it I would recommend it.

It has a lot of charm to it, an excellent story and setting, but most importantly it offers a mix of gameplay mechanics that you just don't find anywhere else and succeeds at making it all deep enough to be engaging to play.

												A true gem. It's quirky, cute, and all around fun. The concept is simple: stock your item store to earn money and pay off a loan. However, it quickly becomes much more in depth. You can buy items when the prices drop and sell them for a profit later, or hire an adventurer and head off to the dungeons in search of treasure! If you've ever been a fan of games like Rune Factory, Harvest Moon, Summon Nights or other hand held games like those, you'll probably love this game. There's something about it that becomes truly addictive, trying to stock the store, get cool new items all while trying to earn (and keep) enough to pay off those weekly loan payments! Even more, it has some of the most interesting and entertaining characters, who you really begin to learn more about and see dynamics between them all, in and out of your shop. The game itself has personality, as off the wall phrases like ""Capitalism, ho!"" make their presence known in the game.However, there are some short comings: at my point in the game, it appears as the story is rather short, but I anticipate a lot of ""end game"" styled content (I'll update my review once I know for sure). As well, the combat isn't the most exciting thing, but it is still fun getting to use and level different characters. There isn't a whole lot of exploration feeling in the dungeons, either. They're randomly generated each time on entry as you search for an exit to the floor (however, so far they're pretty small in scale). If you aren't a fan of: JRPGs, cutesish anime characters/story/tone, addictive slightly repetitive mechanics/objectives, reaching unknown goals, grinding loot, selling items, or capitalism, then I wouldn't recommend this game to you.If you are, even with some of the shortcomings, I can definitely say with confidence you'll enjoy it if you give it a chance, it's definitely worth it.

												Good game with a flavor of Harvest Moon in it.  The game isnt deep in the combat sense but for what if offers is a great game.  I would recommend getting this when it is under $10.  The time sink in the game is easily 50+ hours because of the several new game modes that become available after you beat the game the first time.The game works every day you have several turns to do stuff and those are devided in selling items at the shop, buying items around town and visting town, and dungeon crawling for items to sell or use on the your heroes you play as.  Every week you have to pay a debt so you do not get a game over.  After several weeks of paying the debt you win!  And then the game opens up lots of stuff for you to do and keep on farming and grinding.PROS-Great time sink to fix that Harvest Moon guilty pleasure-Boss fights have mechanics and make the game not just a pure hac and slash-One the game is beat you have lots of options to keep playing or just be satisfied with another game down-For what is offered in the game is greatNegatives-Not to crazy on the character development  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is cute and fun game. For me, this game is perfect collection of genres, combining a shop sim, a dungeon crawling action RPG, and visual novel style segments all into one game.The basics of the plot is that you are Recette, a young girl who's adventurer father disappears and leave behind a crippling debt that threatens to take away your home and everything in it. So you along with Tear, the fairy loan officer responsible for you paying the debt back, open an item shop. From there on out you can go out into town to buy stock and meet people, or hire an adventurer to bring items you can sell back from dungeons.The difficulty curve can be intense, with your payments going up exponentially. However, I would consider this to be a medium difficulty game. Neither the shop segments or the dungeons are too difficult, though they still can be hard and tricky.There are 8 adventurers that you can unlock over the course of the game for the dungeon portions and each has a unique combat style and abilities from one another, so there is plenty of variety whether you want to change things up or find a style that suits you best. There are also 6 dungeons, each one harder that the first but providing better drops progressively.The plot is presented in very cute visual novel style segments and is quite light and relaxed despite the goal to pay off an ever increasing debt. I find it fits the medium difficulty game play segments very well. To trigger most of the story segments requires you to leave the shop and waste a chunk of your time, but the characters are all unique, fun and quirky. It's also the only way to unlock some of your potential adventures, so it can be worth your time.All in all, I love this game. It's not to difficult to pick up and has a lot of content available so you can keep playing for hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recettear is a perfect storm of cuteness and capitalism, all wrapped up nicely in Japanese paper.  I know a few people with this game, and wel all play it differently.  I tend to focus solely on my storefront, one person I know spends all his time in dungeons, and yet another has something of a 60/40 mix between the two, leaning towards dungeon play.One of the things that makes Recettear such a great game is that all of these playstyles are completely viable.  The item shop really is yours, and you can do whatever you want with it, provided you make the proper payments on time.  Want to make a dark cabal, where ancient artifacts of mystical Lovecraftian horrors are traded behind closed doors?  Done.  Want to make a homemaker's paradise, with clothes and food and tools as far as the eye can see?  Easy enough to put together.  Or maybe you'd rather outfit adventurers to go expeditioning with you, offering them low prices on advanced gear?  Great idea.Recettear manages to give you more empowerment than most store simulation games, and that's only half of what it is.  Its dungeon-crawling aspect is, to me, a little contrived, and not as well executed as, say, Torchlight, but it certainly gets the job done, and if loot gives you joy, you'll probably find the later dungeons particularly pleasing anyway.And let's not gloss over the art and writing, both of which are some of the cutest available, anywhere, ever.  This is the game that coined the word ""Yepperoni"" which is probably the most important English word I know.  If you're not into cute stuff, however, or you think it's lame or contrived, you really should pass, because this game is cute before it's anything else.To nitpick, my one gripe is that this game does not support any full-screen resolutions in widescreen aspect ratios, but that's essentially to be expected of doujinsoft.  For me, however, the game is nearly perfect in all other regards, so in my eyes it is all but a must-play.			",138,16,5,18,16,1,7

												I'd say the 82% Metascore is pretty spot on. A lot of fun, and sometimes you can just pick it up and sink a couple hours into it without feeling overly committed. Not the absolute best game of all time, but certainly has its charm.I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys light simulation-RPGs in the style of Rune Factory; the dungeons are pretty simplistic but still good cheap fun. I'm also impressed with the localization job; a lot of the Japanese dialogue is almost spot on for the first line of text.Suggestions to draw out the enjoyment factor are:- Go to a dungeon at least twice per game week, and clear out a 5 level stretch. Only playing the shop aspect can get really repetitive without a break, and you're really going to be missing out on a lot of gameplay aspects if you don't do both.- Don't read too many FAQs and guides unless you're stuck; the programming isn't the most sophisticated and it's really easy to find the tricks and exploits that make the game a cakewalk. Try to find the tricks yourself, it's a major part of the fun.- Plug in a PS3/XBOX/PC USB game controller if you have one, it'll make the dungeons more relaxing and fun instead of annoying- Once you get a good idea of how the game works, try to beat the game in a single ""loop"". (Your save games will indicate how many times you continued after a game over or started a new game plus over a previous game.)Have fun, and don't let Euria into your shop!			",102,26,0,27,10,0,15

												Recettear.. I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw this game, but I bought it because it was on sale and seemed moderatly interesting.. How wrong I was. Monderatly? This game is amazing! It's such a refershing change on typical RPG's! Owning your own store is pretty interesting, you have to keep earning an increased amount every week or you're screwed. Seems boring right? But somehow bartering prices for both purchases and sales with your customers is rather exciting (Except when a certain little girl tries shopping). As you progress in levels, new features are added like taking orders for item.For item gathering itself, you have the option to buy items from the Market and Mechants Guild, aswell as items customers are trying to sell. However the best and obviously most fun option, is hiring an adventurer and going out to dungeons to slay monsters, find chests and collecting items to sell in your shop. The combat system is EXTREMELY basic, you have your movement keys, an attack button and a special attack button.. Thats it, but somehow the combat still feels great and rewarding. While you start out with a single adventurer, you eventually lock others of a different class, each with their own moves and differences. Whats cooler is these aren't just random characters you fight with, each one of them has their own personality. You see them at the town center, pub, church or even shopping inside your store. And these adventurers aren't the only ones with personalitys! There are quite a few characters in the game, and while not all of them have names, you can see a general personality and gain familiarity with them. The random man will typically buy goods for this much, while the little girl won't do it for more than this. You can see aspects of their daily lives in town, and with the familiarity you can actually get feelings towards people shopping, good or bad! You'll know this person likes to haggle, these people are cheap or these people will accept higher prices.This is a great twist, and while the idea of it might not sound great, it is. It brings a fresh and great idea with excellent exacution, with an art style that never goes bad! Even $20 is a great price for a game!			",195,49,3,52,16,2,18

												There's already a slew of other reviews telling you this is a good game. They probably either focus a lot or not enough about the sum of all parts. I'm going to only explain why I personally think this game turns from good into great.Dungeon crawling is considered awful and/or boring for most people I know. They like shooters or some sports games. A few actually like RPGs. And Recettear is definitely a good RPG with a fair amount of simplistic dungeon crawling. It's also interesting how its simplicity aids the game's concept, because if you're anything like me you'll actually like more the character's shop management than going into dungeons to sell the crap out of what a monster unwittingly thought was fun to be lugging around for no reason.In other words, I think the whole shop management deal is what makes Recettear a good game. If I were to judge it solely on the dungeon crawler aspect I'd tell you that I've played many considerably better dungeon crawlers. Heck, I'd even tell you that Rogue and a great part of it's infinite spawn of clones and wannabes is a better game on dungeon crawling alone. But the shop management, from what goods you'll display on that particular day, the kind of display furniture you're using, and even the little feeling of having sold the junk that some monster considered valuable enough to carry for astronomical values to the masses of curious customers... is only 14.99 away from you.Let me sweeten the deal here. Carpe Fulgur, the publisher, is one of those that normally has its games featured on discounts on Steam. It's not uncommon to drop around 60% of the price from time to time. And you can't say that the cute-as-kittens-and-fun-as-(games I suppose?) protagonist and its struggles don't capture your heart to the point where you will want to help her get the funds for the next loan she NEEDS to pay, and then see the story evolve gradually with the other characters she gets involved with.Also, you get to see the witty translation of whatever the original game had in its original language of (I assume) Japanese into ""Capitalism, HO!"", Recette's happy money-making battlecry, among other instant classics. There's plenty of humour to read in the dialogues, and sometimes you'll think that you're also paying for a comic book with all of the grins, smiles and even laughter that you'll find yourself performing. Do you still think 14,99 is too much?There's also a demo for the unbelieving masses to try. That's, of course, the safe approach. Try that demo and you'll see you'll want to buy the full game. If you're worried about the investment, wait for the sales, often Midweek on Steam, or maybe even the big summer or winter sales. You can thank yourself for the investment later.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An item shop economy simulator combined with a Zelda-style top-down action. Trying to balance your daily schedule, interacting with townsfolk and trying to accommodate customers' whims is interesting at first.However, once you learn the simple hidden rules that govern the customers, you'll be swimming in cash and will blaze through the story in no time. That leaves the action, which really isn't that interesting unless you like mindless grinding.But if you prefer the action, you probably would like Chantelise better; It's made by the same studio and uses the same engine.

												The only knock on this game is that the difficulty progresses as a misleadingly steep pace.That said, the game does handle that well enough inside of itself- you can take what you learned (and earned)- into future attempts.The characters are cute, the gameplay, while a little rough around the edges is perfectly playable and most importantly fun.  You can't ignore the shop aspect, which I think some might find as a negative, but that's the sell of the game, not the dungeons- you play as the shop keep, not the dungeon crawler, after all.All in all, this might be my favorite game on Steam.  It does everything it sets out to do well, which is something that we can't objectively say about most games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A cute anime style game. The often times hillarious dialog helps create a fondness for the characters. It's a bit repetitve, but it's still fun and addicting. It combines elements of time management with slightly rogue-like dungeons. The story mode is short but after you beat it you get access to new game modes:   game+ option, an endless mode to pick up where you left off which will unlock new dungeons and characters, and survival mode to see how long you can keep up with ever increasing monetary demands.I did buy the game on sale and am very very happy with my purchase. With more than 80 hours gameplay, I think it would have been worth the full price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is soo much fun!!(However before you do buy it check it out on YouTube and look at the reviews to see if this is something you might be interested in and to see if you even like the game play.

 The Oliver Review  The Story The story is a main part of this game. It allows the player to fully immerse themselves in the events of the game. Recettear does a phenomenal job at this task. I found the story incredibly enjoyable. I felt the emotions alongside the characters. The principle may seem basic, but if you really connect to the characters, this will be an experience you will treasure for al of your gaming life. The Gameplay The gameplay is amazing on its own. The active task of setting up a shop and selling your items is an invigorating feeling. Starting from the cheaper items, and steadily working your way up to the more expensive assortment of goods. It gives you a feeling of accomplishment that you have a hard time getting out of most other games. With the increasing difficulty of the game, it has both a challenging and a relaxed atmosphere. The other aspect is the Dungeons. You send out a hero you get from interacting with them either around town, or in your shop. In these dungeons, the more expensive variety of loot lies deep in them. The gameplay in these areas is a bit faster paced, but overall the game tends to be patient and relaxed.  The Personality The game is very relaxed. It does take it slow throughout the whole experience. The games failure  mechanic is that you start from the beginning, only you still have your levels and items. The game has a feeling of accomplishment with everything in it. Whether it be gaining a level, or selling that expensive item. This game makes you work for it, but still guides you along the path enough so you don't feel lost. The Rating In The Oliver Rating system, this game has the Oliver Rating of 4.7/5 This game has my recommendation to  Play and Replay  ",50,4,0,12,10,1,4

												TLDR version: Doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel and can get repetitive but for any fans of JRPGs or dungeon crawlers, this little gem does more than enough to justify the modest asking price (Pssst this game goes on sale often)Story and Characters: You play as Recette, a cheerful naive and only somewhat annoying little girl whos carefree life gets shattered when her father disappears and she's left to pay his debts to a fairy named Tear. Your goal is to open the store her father left in order to pay off weekly payments to Tear or lose your home. It's not exactly on the level of the Count of Monte Cristo but for a cutesy game like this it's all the motivation you'll need.The characters are pretty simple anime cliche, but most are charming in their own right. Tear makes a great straight man to Recette's bubble-headed obliviousness. Charme the thief is a likeable rogue and kind of like a big sister to our lead. That being said a number of characters are very one note and that note is typically ""rude and nasty for no particular reason"". Still, you have the option to skip any dialog and if your anything like me your finger will fly to that escape key any time you see that irritating rich girl.Graphics: The visuals are decent, they do their job expressing the world but they aren't very inspired. Customizing your store is the most visually impressive part of the game. Expect to see a lot of brown and gray dungeons copy pasted almost to the point of frustration. Closeups during dialog convey a great sense of personality but the actual models only look OK. Animation is nice and smooth and the frame rate is pleasingly consistent throughout which is all that really matters in a budget title like this.Audio: Voice acting is all in Japanese and it's cute, if a bit unnecessary with dialog being mostly text. The music isn't really worth noting. It's mostly cute and bouncy MIDI tunes that loop over and over. By far the most awful thing about the game is the ear-bleeding harmonica track that plays when walking around your store. It didn't take long for me to mute the music, and you likely will too.Gameplay: This dungeon crawling ARPG has just enough twists to the classic formula to really make it addictive. Your time will be split between selling items in your store and running down to the dungeon hoping to find loot to sell at said store. It's easy to assume the selling part would be the weakest but it's amazing how nail-biting selling stuff can be when your next payment is due tomorrow and your still 5000 short. Do you jack up your prices and risk a customer walking out on you? Will anybody buy that really expensive item you absolutely need to sell to make your payment? How much is too much for a chocolate bar? This game manages to make such a mundane idea quite exciting.The dungeon crawling is also quite fun if a little basic. You start with just one swordsman to dungeon dive with but you later unlock a quick thief, a glass cannon mage, etc. They all have different items to equip, different abilites, and different special attacks so there's enough variety to keep it fresh.  Enemies are generic looking but each one has different attacks and movement patterns, such as knights being able to protect themselves with shields or the winged eyeballs shooting lasers at you. The only real issue I have with the controls is the momentum characters gain while moving seems a bit too much. I found myself walking straight into enemies I meant to avoid or having a hard time wheeling myself around to hit their weak spots before they moved.What really stands out is the way RPG conventions are subverted. This might be the only RPG I've ever played where my characters level didn't matter to me. After all, the game measures your progression almost completely with money, so while filling your merchant EXP bar grants new perks to make the money pile up, the combat EXP isn't nearly as important. Sure tougher dungeons usually have better loot but the only reason I was happy I leveled was for the HP refill so I didn't have to use any of the healing items I found. I didn't really know or care what level my hero was as long as I could carry out a huge bag of loot.All in all, Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is a fun, cute and simple ARPG well worth your time and money. It's not for everyone and it's not exactly the kind of game that will leave you glued to the edge of your seat but it has novel gameplay and lots of charm sure to appeal to the RPG crowd looking for something different. And hey, if you enjoy story mode and you can play challenge mode and fulfill your fantasy of fighting your ever-growing debt until the massive payments force you into bankruptcy! Sorry, too real?

You buy, sell and trade your goods, from armor and weapons to food, almost like you were in a RPG. Oh what, you run out of money to buy items? Well then, time to send an unlucky adventurer into the dungeons to get new stock. Run 'em through a dungeon, slaughtering various monsters, harvest them for goods, and possibly have your poor little adventurer get overwhelmed.  Capitalism, ho!			",387,37,1,87,36,5,97

												I picked this up in a bundle on steam a couple of years ago. While this game wasn't the reason I purchased the bundle, I ended up spending more time on it than I did any other game in it. The game has a wonderfully cheeky sense of humor as you are thrust into a viciously capitalistic society. Be careful, this game gets pretty hard pretty quickly, but after losing there is a sort of ""new game plus"" where you get to retain all of the stuff you had previously, which makes it easier. It's easy enough to beat on your second loop through the game, but trying to beat it without ever getting a game over is much more of a challenge.There's also a whole top-down action-adventure game embedded within the capitalism simulator, which is pretty fun. It's not as good as other games of its type, but for a part of an otherwise solid game, it does its job well.			",226,82,1,34,17,4,35

												Sure, the game starts off as your typical Japanese cutesy thing. But soon enough, you realise things. For one, customers are not your friends. You won't win any prizes for selling at cost price. You go higher... a hundred and five... hundred and ten... hundred and fifteen... High, but not high enough to make them suspicious.You'll learn how they act, what they'll spend, and go in for the kill.Adventurers will be your tools. Cavediving may seem like an extra, but it's the only way of finding some of the most profitable treasures. You don't wanna buy from a wholesale seller or such - after all, that means less profit. You'll give them some equipment, maybe some food, and then hope they come back alive. Perhaps they will. After all, you play them. But if they die, you can only take a few things with you back up. Maybe you'll sell something to them, later, when they come browsing. At just under 150% of it's base price.Underneath that cute exterior is a game about making money.			",235,29,3,28,4,0,15

												Unlike other  typical jRPG our hero (in this case heroine) is not warrior, nor a mage, nor an archer, but a simple merchant. Recette (Thats her name) isn't going to save a world, she just need to repay debt taken by her father. The idea is simple. In order to achive that, she (with a help of loan shark Tear) opens a item shop.Now the fun part begins.Main key is to sit in your shop and sell items (just like merchants in other jrpgs). But where will u get them? You can stack yourself at merchant guild or hire an adventurer As the game progress, we need to deal with: getting ordered items on time, watching over market prices and we cannot forget about stacking up our shop, haggleing + we have to repay Tear exact amount that our father borrowed b4 he left home. Getting good schedule and having luck on market makes this game really entertaining. All of this makes this game a nice alternative for typical jRPGs.			",683,215,15,106,59,6,108

												Recettear is a really neat game. It makes fun of and subverts a bunch of tropes while providing a unique gameplay experience. Definitely a must buy for fans of RPGS or games like Animal Crossing. The only cons (that I've seen so far) include the low res graphics, lack of fullscreen (it's locked to something under 1920x1080) and the lack of Steam Trading Cards. There's a bunch of other reviews that go more indepth on this, so I'm just leaving this out there even if it's quite poorly written.			",64,25,1,5,8,0,7

												If you lIke Zelda dungeon style adventures then you might like this. Play the role of a loli item shop keeper and keep your store shelves stocked with all the phat loot and item drops from dungeons. Hire different body guards to do the grunt work for you while you rake in the CASH$$$. Also make sure you make enough money to pay the rent for the store and remember to buy low and sell high for maximum profits!until that little girl comes in... not having enough money/WAH the price is too high!Dang nab it! it already -20% under the wholesale price! she will♥♥♥♥♥♥you!oh yeah.. its a good game			",608,163,19,57,37,9,58

												TLDR version: Doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel and can get repetitive but for any fans of JRPGs or dungeon crawlers, this little gem does more than enough to justify the modest asking price (Pssst this game goes on sale often)Story and Characters: You play as Recette, a cheerful naive and only somewhat annoying little girl whos carefree life gets shattered when her father disappears and she's left to pay his debts to a fairy named Tear. Your goal is to open the store her father left in order to pay off weekly payments to Tear or lose your home. It's not exactly on the level of the Count of Monte Cristo but for a cutesy game like this it's all the motivation you'll need.The characters are pretty simple anime cliche, but most are charming in their own right. Tear makes a great straight man to Recette's bubble-headed obliviousness. Charme the thief is a likeable rogue and kind of like a big sister to our lead. That being said a number of characters are very one note and that note is typically ""rude and nasty for no particular reason"". Still, you have the option to skip any dialog and if your anything like me your finger will fly to that escape key any time you see that irritating rich girl.Graphics: The visuals are decent, they do their job expressing the world but they aren't very inspired. Customizing your store is the most visually impressive part of the game. Expect to see a lot of brown and gray dungeons copy pasted almost to the point of frustration. Closeups during dialog convey a great sense of personality but the actual models only look OK. Animation is nice and smooth and the frame rate is pleasingly consistent throughout which is all that really matters in a budget title like this.Audio: Voice acting is all in Japanese and it's cute, if a bit unnecessary with dialog being mostly text. The music isn't really worth noting. It's mostly cute and bouncy MIDI tunes that loop over and over. By far the most awful thing about the game is the ear-bleeding harmonica track that plays when walking around your store. It didn't take long for me to mute the music, and you likely will too.Gameplay: This dungeon crawling ARPG has just enough twists to the classic formula to really make it addictive. Your time will be split between selling items in your store and running down to the dungeon hoping to find loot to sell at said store. It's easy to assume the selling part would be the weakest but it's amazing how nail-biting selling stuff can be when your next payment is due tomorrow and your still 5000 short. Do you jack up your prices and risk a customer walking out on you? Will anybody buy that really expensive item you absolutely need to sell to make your payment? How much is too much for a chocolate bar? This game manages to make such a mundane idea quite exciting.The dungeon crawling is also quite fun if a little basic. You start with just one swordsman to dungeon dive with but you later unlock a quick thief, a glass cannon mage, etc. They all have different items to equip, different abilites, and different special attacks so there's enough variety to keep it fresh.  Enemies are generic looking but each one has different attacks and movement patterns, such as knights being able to protect themselves with shields or the winged eyeballs shooting lasers at you. The only real issue I have with the controls is the momentum characters gain while moving seems a bit too much. I found myself walking straight into enemies I meant to avoid or having a hard time wheeling myself around to hit their weak spots before they moved.What really stands out is the way RPG conventions are subverted. This might be the only RPG I've ever played where my characters level didn't matter to me. After all, the game measures your progression almost completely with money, so while filling your merchant EXP bar grants new perks to make the money pile up, the combat EXP isn't nearly as important. Sure tougher dungeons usually have better loot but the only reason I was happy I leveled was for the HP refill so I didn't have to use any of the healing items I found. I didn't really know or care what level my hero was as long as I could carry out a huge bag of loot.All in all, Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is a fun, cute and simple ARPG well worth your time and money. It's not for everyone and it's not exactly the kind of game that will leave you glued to the edge of your seat but it has novel gameplay and lots of charm sure to appeal to the RPG crowd looking for something different. And hey, if you enjoy story mode and you can play challenge mode and fulfill your fantasy of fighting your ever-growing debt until the massive payments force you into bankruptcy! Sorry, too real?

												On the surface, it's just a cutesy indie Japanese item shop simulator, but what surprised me was the amount of depth and polish that went into the game's RPG and dungeon-crawling aspects.  The gameplay is very open-ended -- you're free to spend all your time playing with the economic side of things, or (if you're like me) you can focus on leveling up your various adventurers and slashing/blowing up/punching/shooting all sorts of baddies and neglect your shop entirely.  The story is pretty cheesy, but the interactions between characters are always entertaining.			",181,46,2,29,8,2,32

												I got this in a bundle recently and didn't really expect much from it. It's actually a really fun game that is done very well. The graphics aren't amazing, but they're definitely acceptable, and the game has a lot of humor and good design. It's kind of like a mix between Animal Crossing, Torchlight/Diablo, and that Lemonade Stand game you might have played in elementary school. Anyways, it's an interesting blend of genres to me, and the game has a lot of personality. I've found myself playing it for hours a day the last few days. I'm not sure I'd strongly recommend it at the suggested $20 price point, but if you can find it on sale, pick it up. Also, you might want to check out the demo. You might find yourself pulled in by its charm like I have.Also, disregard the time played on here. I played this game mostly in offline mode, and I guess Steam doesn't calculate that playing time. I've played it for at least a dozen hours or so.			",106,73,4,15,14,3,34

												A JRPG with overall generic characters and a plot that has generic daddy left me so i must do grown up things since hes ♥♥♥♥ed me over majorly even though im 10ish year old girl. Now the amazing thing is after playing this game for two hours i realized something, i was having fun. My cold cynical heart actually had a pulse when i made this realization that i was playing a game and enjoying it throughly. The games mixture of simple combat and simple store mechanics entised me to play on. Though the combat is lacking to simply push button 1 to light attack and button 2 to special attack it had a nice retro top down zelda feel to it. Not saying its perfect since the basic attack randomly crits enemys (should have a pattern or be user determined when activated -_-) but overall fun. Then theres the other core aspect of the game where you are running a store, not the most exciting thing in the world but lemonade tycoon feel. Sure you can sell stuff safely at 120% of the original price but trying to sqeeuze out that extra 1-2% out of your souless buyers feels good. Not a great game but id say a nice game to kill the time or have as babies ""My first JRPG"".			",749,301,8,117,61,4,93

												I'd say the 82% Metascore is pretty spot on. A lot of fun, and sometimes you can just pick it up and sink a couple hours into it without feeling overly committed. Not the absolute best game of all time, but certainly has its charm.I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys light simulation-RPGs in the style of Rune Factory; the dungeons are pretty simplistic but still good cheap fun. I'm also impressed with the localization job; a lot of the Japanese dialogue is almost spot on for the first line of text.Suggestions to draw out the enjoyment factor are:- Go to a dungeon at least twice per game week, and clear out a 5 level stretch. Only playing the shop aspect can get really repetitive without a break, and you're really going to be missing out on a lot of gameplay aspects if you don't do both.- Don't read too many FAQs and guides unless you're stuck; the programming isn't the most sophisticated and it's really easy to find the tricks and exploits that make the game a cakewalk. Try to find the tricks yourself, it's a major part of the fun.- Plug in a PS3/XBOX/PC USB game controller if you have one, it'll make the dungeons more relaxing and fun instead of annoying- Once you get a good idea of how the game works, try to beat the game in a single ""loop"". (Your save games will indicate how many times you continued after a game over or started a new game plus over a previous game.)Have fun, and don't let Euria into your shop!			",102,26,0,27,10,0,15

												Recettear.. I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw this game, but I bought it because it was on sale and seemed moderatly interesting.. How wrong I was. Monderatly? This game is amazing! It's such a refershing change on typical RPG's! Owning your own store is pretty interesting, you have to keep earning an increased amount every week or you're screwed. Seems boring right? But somehow bartering prices for both purchases and sales with your customers is rather exciting (Except when a certain little girl tries shopping). As you progress in levels, new features are added like taking orders for item.For item gathering itself, you have the option to buy items from the Market and Mechants Guild, aswell as items customers are trying to sell. However the best and obviously most fun option, is hiring an adventurer and going out to dungeons to slay monsters, find chests and collecting items to sell in your shop. The combat system is EXTREMELY basic, you have your movement keys, an attack button and a special attack button.. Thats it, but somehow the combat still feels great and rewarding. While you start out with a single adventurer, you eventually lock others of a different class, each with their own moves and differences. Whats cooler is these aren't just random characters you fight with, each one of them has their own personality. You see them at the town center, pub, church or even shopping inside your store. And these adventurers aren't the only ones with personalitys! There are quite a few characters in the game, and while not all of them have names, you can see a general personality and gain familiarity with them. The random man will typically buy goods for this much, while the little girl won't do it for more than this. You can see aspects of their daily lives in town, and with the familiarity you can actually get feelings towards people shopping, good or bad! You'll know this person likes to haggle, these people are cheap or these people will accept higher prices.This is a great twist, and while the idea of it might not sound great, it is. It brings a fresh and great idea with excellent exacution, with an art style that never goes bad! Even $20 is a great price for a game!			",195,49,3,52,16,2,18

												Be the RPG shop keeper!  No, really.  It's more fun than it sounds.  This actually a really cute game with extremelly witty writing.  It's a ton of fun that alternates between dungeon crawler and running the shop to sell what you managed to drag out of the dungeon.  Personally I find the shop part the most fun, where you display items, negotiating with customers, filling orders, it's a great way to lose an awful lot of hours.			",95,22,0,32,15,1,23

												Capitalism, Ho! Poor girl was left with a massive debt to pay off by herself after her father ran away on an adventure. The loan-shark fairy instead of leaving her as a hobo taking the house as collateral offers her to open up an item shop and work to pay off the debt.Great comedy and also cute lolis. Who knew being the npc at the item shop was so much fun?			",84,12,3,21,7,0,13

												A friend asked me, ""HOW IS THIS GAME SO FUN?"" I replied, ""It is kind of impressive how fun it is being an NPC, isn't it?"" And it is. You can't really summarize this game; it's got too many great things going for it, and attempts to do so generally result in disbelief that a game like that can be as entertaining as claimed.The game's about running an item shop. Initially you have to pay off your debt but once that's done you enter ""Endless Mode"" and can enjoy being a merchant (and also running through dungeons to get loot!) to your heart's content. Don't be disheartened by failure; even if you fail to pay off your debt, you'll still get a second chance.Good luck getting 100% completion; the post-endgame content is ridiculously beefy, and filling out your item encyclopedia requires at least six or seven playthroughs. And even when you've got that sorted out, you STILL have Endless Mode to challenge yourself with.Also it's an indie title, if you like that sort of thing.			",901,326,38,153,101,11,193

												Different is the name of the game with this quirky little RPG/Economy game, Recttear.  Somewhat difficult to explain, Recttear must be experienced to be fully understood. You own a store and hire characters to go down into the dungeon to fetch you treasure to sell. The game is split into those two basic parts; selling the goods at the store, and hunting in the darkened dungeon to find lost treasures. This two part approach worked for me as I found myself playing to get my store awesome and my heroes to be ultra-awesome. Recttear is a bit dated and the story is basically devoid, but the game is very fun and highly addictive. You’ll find yourself mumbling just one more level often as you tack on the hours in this enjoyable game.			",161,50,3,47,35,3,71

												I love this game. The art style is cute and the game mechanics are simple. The game is a little out of the box for an RPG. It is both a sim game as well as a dungeon crawling game instead of just the latter. You are an adorable (yet annoying and too cheerfully trusting girl) that gets left with her dad's massive debt. She is guided by her fairy (the very serious loanshark) to open up an item shop to help repay it. Now the game is simple to understand. You have the day broken up into four parts. You decide what you want to do for the day whether it be shopping for items to stock, adventuring with a hero for loot, or stocking you store and opening it to the public. Ultimately it's all about the money. Or pix I should say. One part of the gameplay is the shop. You end up haggling with customers to get the best price and stocking it to attract the most customers. The second form of gameplay is adventuring with the hero. This is where the ""little out of the box"" ends. This is your typical RPG where you go around killing monsters picking up loot and equipping or using items. Definitely appreciate this portion of the game because when I get bored of selling things to people (or running low on items AND being bored) I get to change the scenery in a sense. It's really a great game with just enough to keep you going.			",72,41,2,22,12,0,17

												Recettear takes an interesting concept (running an rpg-world item shop) and makes an entertaining game out of it. Charming is a good way to describe the game itself - the characters are adorable and endearing, the gameplay is like a neat mini-game, and the overall atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing. Recettear struggles to really excel in any area and the gameplay becomes repetitive, but it never loses that sense of charm and is a fun game to play once and then re-install every once in a while for a bit of relaxing capitalism.If you aren't fan of any jrpg's or just don't find the concept entertaining you won't miss much by skipping this game, but if you have any fond memories of jrpg's this is a great game to pick up for some casual fun.

												The game is fun and offers some stratagy based money management as well as requiring a bit of luck.In standard new game there are only 2 dungeons, one is basically a tutorial dungeon with not a lot to offer the other is a 3 part dungeon with a 4th area allowing you to fight just the bosses over and over again.Early in the game dungeon crawling is a must to gain pix, however later on, for me it was after just the 2nd week, it no longer seems really helpful.Often times townspeople will come in selling an item and then before the time segment is even over will buy it right back. One of the best ways to make money is buying for 30% and reselling for 130%.One of the best items to stock up I found was weapons, in later weeks they get boosts in value and can be sold for as much as 300% base. For me the last 3 days all weapons were increased in value, not sure if it was luck or game mechanics, but in the last 3 days alone I amassed over 300k pix.The game does have NG+ as well as a survival mode, but for the most part there doesn't really seem to be a whole lot of replay value after you intitally beat it.I bought it on sale for 9.99, not 100% I got my moneys worth, but it was definitely a fun game. I have a total of around 7 hours in the game including offline time, and that's about the amount of time it took me to beat it with having to start over once. I'd recommend buying it, but definitely on sale for 9.99 or less simply because of how short the game is, and how little replay value it offers in my opinion.			",114,26,1,13,10,2,25

												Recettear is very much a delightful game that will keep you entertained for roughly 10 hours depending on how you play (for one play through). The game revolves around running an item shop, and the challenges that brings. It also has adventure opportunities where you can play in some very basic Legend of Zelda-like game play (better example would be Neutopia on the TurboGraphics 16) from the original NES days, although with better graphics, in order to acquire rare and cool items for sale. There is a ton of content it seems for this game, but most of it you will likely not use during the main course of the game. The reason being that taking advantage of such usually requires risk, and since you have to meet monetary goals within a certain amount of time in the main story, you may choose to go a safer route. Nevertheless, this game offers quite the charming gameplay despite it being repetative at times. I highly recommend this game if you can manage to get it for $10 or less. If not, then it really depends on how many hours of gameplay you expect at minimum to get per dollar you spend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recettear - if I had to sum it up in a couple of words, I would describe it as a concept that should fail, but doesn't. The gameplay is repetitive, the dungeon crawling requires excessive amounts of grinding to gather materials, and the light-novel/anime style is probably a turn off to some.In practice though, Recettear is an unexpected hit, and a real hidden gem. Recette herself is adorable and everything she does just makes players want to love her more. The concept is fresh and unusual: run your very own item shop, pay off the loan-shark fairy! Play smart, watch for special deals, buy low and sell high to try to maximize your profit! Balance between the general approval of your customers and your profit margins to maximize revenue!Not only is the concept of running one's own item shop interesting on its own right, but the game can be unexpectedly challenging. Many players fail to pay off the debt and have to use the game's ""mulligan"" system to complete it (or mulligan by save-scumming) because they got too greedy seeing a deadline approaching, or because they failed to account for a potential drop in an item's value.Earlier I mentioned that the dungeoneering is pretty bad, and that's true to an extent: there aren't many dungeons, the loot is sporadic and it can take lots of materials to make just one item, and the combat is perhaps too simplistic. Yet there are a slew of characters available, each with their own quirks, and exploring the dungeons can help reward a player with new characters, thereby increasing the amount of interactions.Speaking of interactions, these characters interact very frequently. The writing is light-hearted, and conversations do not feel like they drag on for any absurd length of time (they can all be skipped as well). Yet at the same time, there are little mysteries about the world that make players want to know more about the world and the people in it. The characters, all in all, are a huge part of what gives Recettear its charm.Sure, there are a lot of fridge logic moments - areas where a player just wants to say ""hey, that shouldn't happen because..."" but for the most part, none of these obstruct the game's flow.Overall, Recettear is a charming little adventure. It's not the most adrenaline pumping adventure, but one can't help but admire how well put together and cute the game is. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for something light-hearted yet difficult enough to warrant paying attention to.So go - with a little luck, hard work, and the spirit of capitalism, how hard can it be to exploit your friends and pay back the loan-shark fairy?

												Recettear is a perfect storm of cuteness and capitalism, all wrapped up nicely in Japanese paper.  I know a few people with this game, and wel all play it differently.  I tend to focus solely on my storefront, one person I know spends all his time in dungeons, and yet another has something of a 60/40 mix between the two, leaning towards dungeon play.One of the things that makes Recettear such a great game is that all of these playstyles are completely viable.  The item shop really is yours, and you can do whatever you want with it, provided you make the proper payments on time.  Want to make a dark cabal, where ancient artifacts of mystical Lovecraftian horrors are traded behind closed doors?  Done.  Want to make a homemaker's paradise, with clothes and food and tools as far as the eye can see?  Easy enough to put together.  Or maybe you'd rather outfit adventurers to go expeditioning with you, offering them low prices on advanced gear?  Great idea.Recettear manages to give you more empowerment than most store simulation games, and that's only half of what it is.  Its dungeon-crawling aspect is, to me, a little contrived, and not as well executed as, say, Torchlight, but it certainly gets the job done, and if loot gives you joy, you'll probably find the later dungeons particularly pleasing anyway.And let's not gloss over the art and writing, both of which are some of the cutest available, anywhere, ever.  This is the game that coined the word ""Yepperoni"" which is probably the most important English word I know.  If you're not into cute stuff, however, or you think it's lame or contrived, you really should pass, because this game is cute before it's anything else.To nitpick, my one gripe is that this game does not support any full-screen resolutions in widescreen aspect ratios, but that's essentially to be expected of doujinsoft.  For me, however, the game is nearly perfect in all other regards, so in my eyes it is all but a must-play.			",138,16,5,18,16,1,7

												How to haggle like a pro.Usually, the hero of a video game is the representation of what society views as 'strong, courageous and tough'. This is why male heroes make up such a collectively large proporition of protagonists in video games and all mediums of entertainment; books, movies, lolcat memes (not the norm) are all forms of entertainment that attribute widely to the popular - and I emphasize popular- social stigma of society. Examples are here:Fifty Shades of Grey: Super hot stuffWhite men can't jump: Self explanatoryLocat memes: Desire to anthropomorphize ourselves into kittens.Now let's focus on Recettear again.Let's say 'hypothetically' that Recettear is 'different' from the norm. Instead of a strong male lead, you now have a female lead who starts off relatively inept (Not an opinion against females, just what the character starts off as). Her only benefits being that she doesn't need to eat, or atleast from what we can see, and that she can follow a schedule better than any student or adult in the known world. Also, she's an anime girl: the truest and strongest form of feminist pro propagandanism. So what gives?How are we supposed to connect with this game if there isn't anything remarkably 'interesting' to connect to?Well, that's the essential difference in video games; it doesn't need to because video games aren't all words or film.Here's why:Recettear is absolutely blossoming in charm from its art style (animesque) to the gameplay (finances 101). It's a mix mash of japanese tropes/culture,dungeon crawling and finances. Though, I wouldn't go so far as call it an RPG because it's remarkably hard to connect with the main character, but it serves well in its main drive of gameplay; the flesh of the gameplay is the retrieving and selling of products with a hint of dungeonesque elements, specifically you need to get sellable materials from the dungeon to sell. And boy, you want to sell, sell and sell because debts in game come in fast. In fact, never has procrastination on debt lead to such dire consequences where a little a girl gets evicted from her home to the doghouse, though if that's your thing...However, in the end, the frantic nature of gameplay makes each decision a calculated decision to maximize profits from retrieving and selling. Thus, you will want to haggle everyone despite your best conciousness; a little old lady, how nice! Sell the bagel at 500% mark up. It's a deal she can't refuse, literally! (Starving old lady)It's a game that will teach you how exploitative you can be and you know what? That's the best form of video game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Go into dungeons and find various items to sell in your shop to generic animus. Challenging, addicting and clever design for just about every portion of the game, with great replay value and nice sprites and music. Players will have to restart the game multiple times, but everything you do is carried over and the main story is short enough for it to not become tedious or even frustrating. Great game!

												Most unexpected fun you can ever have out of a shop-sim. Recettear is about management, of both time and resources, and it's good at that. It also has an overview-grid action RPG-mechanic that isn't as interesting and at times gets pretty tedious, but it's still head and shoulders above average. The real draw here is the store. Not only is the shopkeeping gameplay plenty addictive for its beautiful aesthetics and atmosphere, but it's also very understanding about difficulty. Every time you happen to fail your quest to save your store from bankruptcy, you get to keep your experience points from the previous go and the next attempt will be a whole lot easier afterwards. You simply cannot fail if you just keep failing long enough, so experts will complete the game in one go, while beginners will slowly learn by getting stronger from failure. A very balanced system for all kinds.Plenty of replayability if you know what's good for you. Capitalism, ho!			",995,293,40,129,86,10,147

												This game is so addictive. It starts out like so many shop syle games and then you end up running dungeons to collect equipment and ingredients to sell in your shop. You can also combine some items to make stronger weapons and armor. All the while you have a fariry collection agent waiting for you to make some cash so you can pay off your father's debt, which adds a timmer aspect to the game. There is so much going on and many different ways to play, I like the variety of game play available in this game. Selling/buying, money management, dungeon crawling and interaction with NPCs. The only thing some people may not like is that the audio speech is in Japanese and it is subtitled in English. I did not find this a deterant to my enjoyment.Capitalism-ho!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun game, however gets repetitive quickly.Character dialog and interaction is quite interesting, as well as the concept of running your own item shop in an RPG world. Ease of breaking the system, however, quickly leads to more gold than you know what to do with. Progression also feels dull and slow. Good for a day's worth of gameplay, more if you can really get into the gameplay. I was unable to get past the extremely dull mid game (actually the part after you ""win"") to see if the final dungeons are any more interesting.			",145,59,4,66,46,1,43

												A surprisingly addictive game!  This Japanese Indie (doujin) game has been translated very well and with loving detail.  The voices are still in Japanese (left unsubbed, but their vocals basically match the dialogue text anyway), but it doesn't take away from enjoying the game at all.  The item shop mechanics are simple but engaging, with challenges such as a change in trends and item value during certain times.  The dungeon crawler mechanics are also simple, with a top-down view of your character as you explore and defeat monsters.  There is also a way to fuse items in order to sell things that aren't regularly offered in stores.  Graphics aren't glamorous but acceptable, which is great for my laptop (not optimized for gaming)!The game is, overall, fairly simple and not very complicated.  I think it's perfect for it's price and quality.  There is even a replay value to it for all the completionists out there.  That's more than I can say about some full-priced games in the market!

												A lovely doujin game, part strategy, part tycoon, part dungeon crawler. You play as Recette Lemongrass, a clueless young girl who is given 4 weeks to pay off a loan her father took and disappeared with. You take over his shop where you can buy and sell various items to earn money. You can buy and resell items from the marketplace, or from people or you can go and do dungeons to get items without having to pay for them.  The idea of the game is to earn a profit while keeping your customers happy so that they will return for repeat business. The game gradually introduces gameplay mechanics until you realize that there is a fairly deep game hiding behind the cute exterior presentation. Don't be put off by the Japanese style, the Anime look or the fact that it's made in Flash. This is the reason we play games... to discover new and wonderful experiences that can be had through this medium. I thought it was worth full price, but it's definitely worth getting in a sale.

												Sure, the game starts off as your typical Japanese cutesy thing. But soon enough, you realise things. For one, customers are not your friends. You won't win any prizes for selling at cost price. You go higher... a hundred and five... hundred and ten... hundred and fifteen... High, but not high enough to make them suspicious.You'll learn how they act, what they'll spend, and go in for the kill.Adventurers will be your tools. Cavediving may seem like an extra, but it's the only way of finding some of the most profitable treasures. You don't wanna buy from a wholesale seller or such - after all, that means less profit. You'll give them some equipment, maybe some food, and then hope they come back alive. Perhaps they will. After all, you play them. But if they die, you can only take a few things with you back up. Maybe you'll sell something to them, later, when they come browsing. At just under 150% of it's base price.Underneath that cute exterior is a game about making money.			",235,29,3,28,4,0,15

												I'd say the 82% Metascore is pretty spot on. A lot of fun, and sometimes you can just pick it up and sink a couple hours into it without feeling overly committed. Not the absolute best game of all time, but certainly has its charm.I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys light simulation-RPGs in the style of Rune Factory; the dungeons are pretty simplistic but still good cheap fun. I'm also impressed with the localization job; a lot of the Japanese dialogue is almost spot on for the first line of text.Suggestions to draw out the enjoyment factor are:- Go to a dungeon at least twice per game week, and clear out a 5 level stretch. Only playing the shop aspect can get really repetitive without a break, and you're really going to be missing out on a lot of gameplay aspects if you don't do both.- Don't read too many FAQs and guides unless you're stuck; the programming isn't the most sophisticated and it's really easy to find the tricks and exploits that make the game a cakewalk. Try to find the tricks yourself, it's a major part of the fun.- Plug in a PS3/XBOX/PC USB game controller if you have one, it'll make the dungeons more relaxing and fun instead of annoying- Once you get a good idea of how the game works, try to beat the game in a single ""loop"". (Your save games will indicate how many times you continued after a game over or started a new game plus over a previous game.)Have fun, and don't let Euria into your shop!			",102,26,0,27,10,0,15

You can't really summarize this game; it's got too many great things going for it, and attempts to do so generally result in disbelief that a game like that can be as entertaining as claimed.The game's about running an item shop. Initially you have to pay off your debt but once that's done you enter ""Endless Mode"" and can enjoy being a merchant (and also running through dungeons to get loot!) to your heart's content. Don't be disheartened by failure; even if you fail to pay off your debt, you'll still get a second chance.Good luck getting 100% completion; the post-endgame content is ridiculously beefy, and filling out your item encyclopedia requires at least six or seven playthroughs. And even when you've got that sorted out, you STILL have Endless Mode to challenge yourself with.Also it's an indie title, if you like that sort of thing.			",901,326,38,153,101,11,193

												Recettear is fun, charming, and an original take on the JRPG genre. It combines simulation elements with the RPG genre. In the game, you run an item shop in an attempt to pay off Recette's father's debt with the help of the fairy Tear, who also works for the company collecting the debt. In the game you will meet many adventurers, whom you can hire to go with you into dungeons to look for loot to sell in your shop. Micro-management is a big factor in this game, as you need to make sure to have enough money at the end of the week to pay off your debt. Each day is set into four segments, and each time you open the store or leave the shop costs a segment, while going into a dungeon will cost three. If you don't have enough money when your debt is due, then you will need to start at the beginning but with character progress getting carried over. Overall, this is a great game that JRPG fans should definitely not pass up.			",137,29,0,19,5,0,11

												The game is fun and offers some stratagy based money management as well as requiring a bit of luck.In standard new game there are only 2 dungeons, one is basically a tutorial dungeon with not a lot to offer the other is a 3 part dungeon with a 4th area allowing you to fight just the bosses over and over again.Early in the game dungeon crawling is a must to gain pix, however later on, for me it was after just the 2nd week, it no longer seems really helpful.Often times townspeople will come in selling an item and then before the time segment is even over will buy it right back. One of the best ways to make money is buying for 30% and reselling for 130%.One of the best items to stock up I found was weapons, in later weeks they get boosts in value and can be sold for as much as 300% base. For me the last 3 days all weapons were increased in value, not sure if it was luck or game mechanics, but in the last 3 days alone I amassed over 300k pix.The game does have NG+ as well as a survival mode, but for the most part there doesn't really seem to be a whole lot of replay value after you intitally beat it.I bought it on sale for 9.99, not 100% I got my moneys worth, but it was definitely a fun game. I have a total of around 7 hours in the game including offline time, and that's about the amount of time it took me to beat it with having to start over once. I'd recommend buying it, but definitely on sale for 9.99 or less simply because of how short the game is, and how little replay value it offers in my opinion.			",114,26,1,13,10,2,25

(i.e. just for fun, play through and make yourself finish every dungeon on your first run-through without stopping or failing, although you will experience loot anguish.)  The alternate modes that are available are also fun to begin with.This is - alternately run an item shop and go adventuring, and as a result, do various collecting of all the story, all the things, all the money, all the characters, and various vanquishing of all the monsters, traps, and dungeons.Take the above, add the Cute descriptor, add the Fun descriptor, and add a whole bunch of interesting internal mechanics and you get my lots of hours.Anyway, this is one of my favorite games, so this has been my feeble attempt at a review.

												It's such a casual, yet deep dungeon runner with loveable characters and easy-to-play controls. Although it is lacking in story materials, the main fun just comes from the running of your own item store. Every hirable adventurer has their own unique playstyle ranging from warrior, thief, archer, lancer, mage. The adventurers also have their quirks and characteristics that make you want to play as them. If you can't pay your debt in time, you start again from day one, but your adventurers still have their items and stats (but you have to find them again,) and the stores retain the items that they sold you from your previous progression through the game.Some bosses and enemies come back from Chantelise, but it's not really a bad thing as the game is not very hard until you get to the later dungeons (then it gets pretty hardcore.)One of the most enjoyable RPG's i have ever played			",135,32,2,17,7,1,17

												A fun game where you run an item shop and can also explore dungeons, by hiring adventurers, looking for items. You play as Recette who has to make money to pay off her father's debt in a few weekly payments with the cost going up as time winds on. She is accompanied by Tear, a fairy hired by the finance company to collect on the debt. The interplay between the two is usually amusing and entertaining.It's a type of game you don't see very often and is surprisingly well done. The script is well written and often funny. It's a cute and quirky game. Capitalism, ho!			",338,96,12,91,53,3,109

												I'm not a big fan of anime or the clichés tied to it, but Recettear does, on the surface, rather look like a game made to appease the clique of rabid otaku. This served as a deterrant for me, but it's only skin-deep: the try-hard cutesy voice acting is minimal and can be disabled, the story doesn't involve an overly emotional hero with amnesia, and there is no harem of scantily-clad children. That's the usual suspects taken care of.Recettear places you in the shoes of a girl named Recette, in a fairly typical JRPG setting. It turns out that Recette's father — who is now probably dead, which is beautifully glossed over — accrued a significant debt, and she's to pay it off by turning her home into an item shop. Your primary goal is making money rather than story or dungeon progression, which is quite a twist from the norm. The story doesn't try to do too much, and gets out of your way pretty quickly.Items can be acquired at the local wholesalers or in dungeons. Yep, dungeons: you can hire an adventurer, kit them out with your own gear, and take them dungeon crawling. They even have their own levelling system and skills, though the combat system is fairly basic and uninteresting. Then there's crafting, in which you discover new items by combining others.But you own an item shop, so you should be selling items. This process involves judging your customers' budgets, haggling, buying from customers, keeping up with item trends, taking pre-orders and appropriately stocking your shop. Speaking of the shop, it's customisable through a range of carpets, counters and wallpaper. Your shop can even be expanded and the furniture can be moved around.There's quite a lot to Recettear, but you're not thrown in at the deep end: everything is revealed at what I can only call a perfect pace. Just as I was getting used to one mechanic, a new one popped up. Once the main game is completed — that is, once you've paid back the debt —  New Game+, Survival and Endless modes are unlocked, with plenty more items left to discover and levels to gain. To gauge just how much content there is here, I completed the main game with only 33% of items discovered and a merchant level of 19 (of 50).All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and will probably be playing a little Endless mode, in which there is no looming debt to repay, for some time.

												Different is the name of the game with this quirky little RPG/Economy game, Recttear.  Somewhat difficult to explain, Recttear must be experienced to be fully understood. You own a store and hire characters to go down into the dungeon to fetch you treasure to sell. The game is split into those two basic parts; selling the goods at the store, and hunting in the darkened dungeon to find lost treasures. This two part approach worked for me as I found myself playing to get my store awesome and my heroes to be ultra-awesome. Recttear is a bit dated and the story is basically devoid, but the game is very fun and highly addictive. You’ll find yourself mumbling just one more level often as you tack on the hours in this enjoyable game.			",161,50,3,47,35,3,71

												When I purchased this game, I was expecting just another generic FPS. However, when I threw it into my 360 I was instead greeted by one of the most innovative experiences in the genre to date. The single player campaign mode is in itself gripping and emotional. I really felt attached to all of the characters and the soundtrack is positively moving. The gameplay is unique, but at the same time familiar and smooth. The multiplayer missions are also a wonderful gaming experience: challenging you to work well with your teammates as well as strategically attack and defend for yourself. Overall, it's obvious that Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is the best Call of Duty experience (and perhaps the best FPS experience) in gaming history.			",99,3,0,9,1,0,2

The game revolves around a cheerful young girl named Recette who after having her father squander the family fortune to fund a dungeon adventure she is left with only one option. She has to turn her house into an item shop and get her fathers debt under control! I highly recommend this game. It has a unique sense of humor features original and fun game play.

												Simple game of buy low / sell high, with a little dungeon crawling for entertainment. I enjoyed it, but low replayability once you clear it.'New game +' has exactly the same difficulty level as the original (same debt and deadline), so it's actually easier to clear. What it gives you is your expensive items unlocked so you can easily earn the total debt in 1 week. What to do with the extra time? Go wander around town looking for events, more characters and dungeons.Achievement chasers who want to complete the item encyclopedia may appreciate this, not so much for those looking for a challenge.

												Got this game on sale for $4.99. Worth it? Completly.This game is an anime game, which typically pushes most of the ""gamer"" catagory away, but do not run. This game is fantastic. I was a bit uneasy purchasing an anime game, as I am not a big fan of cute anime stuff, but i'm glad I went for it. You take on the role of a girl (Recette of Recettear) and your goal is to payback a loan that your adventurer father left after he dissapeared. The character that runs with you the whole game is a fairy, yes, fairy named ""Tear"". The two combined makes the name of the game/shop. Tear gets you started and teaches you how to run a shop in the game, and you buy items, sell items, and complete orders at your store to make money. You can also take command of many different warriors to take on dungeons head on. Dungeons will allow you to score some low-priced, loot that you can sell in your store, completly for free. Market prices vary in the game depending on fictional situations. I.E. Candy shortage in the town over, makes the price of candy double for a short time. They can also go down with the situations. Having these price variations makes you keep lots of stock of certain items, buy when they're low, sell when they're high, etc. Instead of just buying an item and selling it, you always want lots of variations.Another aspect of the game, which I personally find excellent is that your warriors will come into your store, and purchase goods. When they do so, the goods they purchase will be equipped on them for their next battles. It's always good to hold off on selling certain items to the townspeople and waiting for your warrior to come in to buy it.After you pay off your final loan, you see some anime cutscene of ""I love you, Don't leave fairy loanshark girl"" and you can continue on playing until you pull your hair out from hearing ""do you have _____"" Which you just sold out of.All in all, This game honestly, is one of my top 10 games on steam. The fact a $4.99 tiny indie game can hold such honor over many $59.99 AAA titles, is a huge award. Buy this, even at full price. If you love RPG's, and ever wanted to own a shop in one,(Like me in Oblivion/Skyrim) it's a must.			",365,77,18,59,81,5,54

												A story where a girl forced by loan shark to paid her father's loan (so sad~)and I still wonder how much her father's loan o.oCurrently when this review created: Scammed by little girl because don't know is she the one who sell item to me or she is going to buy my item and ended up I sell my item on half of base price lolSince she is still little and it was only Candy so it's okay (she is also cute) Now  7/1/2015 :Finally the money reached 7m (so fun.. how come from 1k turn into 7m in 90 days lol), and Still playing to reach final ending in gameLet me make it short, This game is totally FUN. Also you can feel how to run a ""Item Shop"" in game. The concept is cool and the implementation is great. Pros :- Cute Anime Style Game- Great Gameplay- Worthy story- Nice opening (although they not put the trailer/opening in store page, but you can find it in this game folder or when u idle in game main menu)- Lots of playable char - Fair PriceCons : - No cards- No achievements- Possible become grinding game (not recommended for someone that hate grind)One of the best Indie Anime Related that I ever played.

												Let the argument of if games are art end now for this game proves once and for all that they are. A striking satire that holds a mirror up to modern western society. It's light tone contrasting briliantly with the soul crushing reality of the current financial crysis and the burdens of debt, as well as the soulless exploitative nature of modern financial institutions. The gameplay and plot brilliantly combine to cast a new light on the plight of the small business owner.			",242,47,3,45,20,3,44

												When I purchased this game, I was expecting just another generic FPS. However, when I threw it into my 360 I was instead greeted by one of the most innovative experiences in the genre to date. The single player campaign mode is in itself gripping and emotional. I really felt attached to all of the characters and the soundtrack is positively moving. The gameplay is unique, but at the same time familiar and smooth. The multiplayer missions are also a wonderful gaming experience: challenging you to work well with your teammates as well as strategically attack and defend for yourself. Overall, it's obvious that Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is the best Call of Duty experience (and perhaps the best FPS experience) in gaming history.			",99,3,0,9,1,0,2

												Got this one off the Christmas sale. Worth the money for sure, more than that. It reminds me of the old school times, back when games looked like ""poo"" but the gameplay was so overtaking that it didn't matter. The whole shop mechanic is good fun, the dungeon crawling is okay, and rewarding. The whole game is pretty damn cute, if you like anime, it's also for you.			",84,12,0,13,6,0,8

												Micromanagement with dungeon-crawling elements? I couldn't be more happy. The game's sprites were a turn-off at first because it seemed too cutesy for my tastes. I admit I ""previewed"" it beforehand to laugh at it. But found myself immersed in the odd vocabulary interjected by the main character of the game. The time management pressure and an approaching deadline for a loan shark, gives the game an interesitng flavor.Like heartlessly overcharging hats to the elderly, and buying back ugly statues for 30% of the price?

												This deceptively simple game can be gruesomely difficult if you're not sure what you're doing. There's a lot of trial and error and a bit of luck, but once you figure out the flow of things, it's easy to get hooked into it if you like quirky RPGs. Keyboard/mouse setup is weird, so I advise using a gamepad of some sort if you have one.			",112,13,1,26,3,0,26

												This game is more than just get, sell, buy, sell... It's more of an RPG.The trading part of the game is just the ultimate goal of the adventure.You see, to trade things and earn money, you need to befriend adventurers, so you'll have to activate events and then level them up. Once you've befriended an adventurer you get his/her card, once you have their card, you can start the loop over, and still have them available!Then it get's a bit complicated; the more you level them up, the more they will cost. Except the adventurer you start out with, he'll cost you either a set amount, which gets higher the more you level him up, or however much money you have on you. So you'll have to step up the game to be able to get to more area's if you want to actually earn anything.Add to that a coming disaster, when an evil magician starts to stir up some trouble, meanwhile, you're still in large debt. You'll have to defeat this evil magician and pay off your debt, if not, you'll have to start over.But starting over isn't such a bad thing, you'll be doing it lots. If you lose, don't worry! It was all just a bad dream... Although all the stuff you got in that dream is still in your inventory. Except all that sweet, sweet money.This game is also very much a visual novel, that means lots of reading. I like that, and if you like it, I recommend you check out ""Steins;Gate"", which you can buy on JList! But don't worry, it has a skip function, in case you don't like reading. What kind of visual novel is it? Slice of life and comedy.Recettear is one of my favorite games on Steam, highly recommended.			",91,16,4,13,6,0,2

												edit: gonna re-write this after i play it againNow this is a pretty neat game. I, unfortunately, never got too into it but I did like how it was done.The story is okay and works for the game. You play a young girl that runs a shop and you go around collecting things to sell in it. You get to decorate the shop too.There's a little town to explore with some different stores and there's also dungeons to venture into with bosses and whatnot. So the game does have combat and a handful of different characters to use when doing it. The visuals were pretty good - though I don't like the 2d sprites used in the 3d environment. A lot of games like this do that and I've never liked it. The music worked well with the game.It was pretty fun bargaining with people and selling items I collected. The dungeons were basic, but fun enough to go through as well.If you think the game sounds fun then pick it up and you'll probably like it.			",131,23,9,11,7,2,11

												Fun, fun, and fun.This has a nice little small business Sim attached to it is a old school dungeon crawler system. I enjoyed everythinggameplay 9/10mix between a sim of running your shop and a dungeon crawlersoundtrack 7/10sound effects can become irritating over time, but not immediently so. But both the music and sound effects are enjoyable and fit well to the game.Story 8/10 Without too high expectations this is very enjoyable. A girl is left to fend for herself after a fairy shows up saying your missing deadbeat dad has left all his debt to you. The story progresses as you pay off this debt and find new heros to fight for you as you enter dungeons looking for sweet loot.Animation 9/10I honestly don't know what else I could want animation wise. It's all cute. Not epic cut scenes or anything, but visual novel and cute dungeon craw animation.Controls */*I prefer the use of a controller for the dungeon part of the game, but works fine with keyboard and mouse. It's well done for either way, but i think just comes down to personal preference.This game is truely one of my favorite purchases on steam.			",73,22,1,24,7,0,13

												A story where a girl forced by loan shark to paid her father's loan (so sad~)and I still wonder how much her father's loan o.oCurrently when this review created: Scammed by little girl because don't know is she the one who sell item to me or she is going to buy my item and ended up I sell my item on half of base price lolSince she is still little and it was only Candy so it's okay (she is also cute) Now  7/1/2015 :Finally the money reached 7m (so fun.. how come from 1k turn into 7m in 90 days lol), and Still playing to reach final ending in gameLet me make it short, This game is totally FUN. Also you can feel how to run a ""Item Shop"" in game. The concept is cool and the implementation is great. Pros :- Cute Anime Style Game- Great Gameplay- Worthy story- Nice opening (although they not put the trailer/opening in store page, but you can find it in this game folder or when u idle in game main menu)- Lots of playable char - Fair PriceCons : - No cards- No achievements- Possible become grinding game (not recommended for someone that hate grind)One of the best Indie Anime Related that I ever played. ()^ ^()10/10Obviously worth to get and play it especially when discounted.			",211,57,6,25,17,6,17

												Got this game on sale for $4.99. Worth it? Completly.This game is an anime game, which typically pushes most of the ""gamer"" catagory away, but do not run. This game is fantastic. I was a bit uneasy purchasing an anime game, as I am not a big fan of cute anime stuff, but i'm glad I went for it. You take on the role of a girl (Recette of Recettear) and your goal is to payback a loan that your adventurer father left after he dissapeared. The character that runs with you the whole game is a fairy, yes, fairy named ""Tear"". The two combined makes the name of the game/shop. Tear gets you started and teaches you how to run a shop in the game, and you buy items, sell items, and complete orders at your store to make money. You can also take command of many different warriors to take on dungeons head on. Dungeons will allow you to score some low-priced, loot that you can sell in your store, completly for free. Market prices vary in the game depending on fictional situations. I.E. Candy shortage in the town over, makes the price of candy double for a short time. They can also go down with the situations. Having these price variations makes you keep lots of stock of certain items, buy when they're low, sell when they're high, etc. Instead of just buying an item and selling it, you always want lots of variations.Another aspect of the game, which I personally find excellent is that your warriors will come into your store, and purchase goods. When they do so, the goods they purchase will be equipped on them for their next battles. It's always good to hold off on selling certain items to the townspeople and waiting for your warrior to come in to buy it.After you pay off your final loan, you see some anime cutscene of ""I love you, Don't leave fairy loanshark girl"" and you can continue on playing until you pull your hair out from hearing ""do you have _____"" Which you just sold out of.All in all, This game honestly, is one of my top 10 games on steam. The fact a $4.99 tiny indie game can hold such honor over many $59.99 AAA titles, is a huge award. Buy this, even at full price. If you love RPG's, and ever wanted to own a shop in one,(Like me in Oblivion/Skyrim) it's a must.			",365,77,18,59,81,5,54

Recommendation:If you're not that much into story or not at all into JRPGs, this is probably not for you, but otherwise, it feels so different, original and funny, that i can definetly recommend it.About the game:This game is awesomely weird and weirdly awesome. The sounds are nothing special (after some time i turned them down and let my music play in the background) and visuals may have been average at the time of its making (2007) and are now definetly outdated, but they're nice and serve the atmosphere of the game well enough. But that atmosphere is just funny in so many ways - i love it!It's also pretty neat, that you can play the game in multiple ways - you can just use the trade mechanics to go through most of the game, or you can spend a lot of time in dungeons if you want to. Though mixing it up is probably best for both the player and the game. And if you're a completionist you need both parts and a good amount of time, as after one regular playthrough and over 20 hours of playtime, i'm not even at 50%. It's also your choice how much you want to follow the background stories, though i'd say that they make up a lot of the charme of it all. Sometimes it feels like there are some very unpolished edges, but then again, often that just seems to fit into the game's quirkyness.About the experience:""Dear diary,a few months ago dad left to get cig... eh, to become a hero and he hasn't come back ever since. So, until a few weeks ago, i was living on my own, i managed to get by, but it was a bit lonely. So, i was surprised, when some day a fairy named Tear knocked at the door and told me about dad's debts and some contract, that i would have to pay them and that i could do that by opening and manageing an item shop. I didn't quite get it, but i was happy that Tear said that she'd help me and that i had something to do now.Since then i've learned a lot about running a shop. We even met a broke adventurer who couldn't afford the entrance exam for the adventurer's guild, so we started to sponsor him in exchange for the loot found in the dungeons. I've also met a lot of other people and apparently even got a rival now.Sometimes things can get hard, when the economy just isn't working in my favor, or people aren't satisfied with my shopkeeping, or monsters seem to act erratic and beat up adventurers in the dungeons. And when i have troubles getting the money for the debt payments, i get nightmares about being evicted. But i guess that's just how live works, sometimes it's random, like a couple of fish flying in your face. So i just stick to my motto, ""capitalism ho"" and move on.But usually life is good around here. People make a lot of funny jokes and references and even though i'm not sure if i get all of them, it's always something to laugh about. Plus, language seems to be weird sometimes - for example, i'm pretty sure that Tear is actually saying ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; in french a lot.So, i'll contintue to become the best merchant and most successfull sponsor around.- 'Recette Lemongrass', now proud owner of the item shop 'Recettear'.""

												Your father has left you all alone and you inherited his shop. You're twelve with no business experience but still this is generally awesome. WAIT there's more! You also recieved an unmentionable ammount of debt! You have a friend who is a fairy, this place is racist against fairies, just saying no equal opportunities so they work through a company that helps them find work as bill collectors who will repossess your house and the shop your father left you. rude.You start out buying from other places and selling it in your shop at rediculously jacked up prices. The little girl wont buy anything ever, I hate her face she calls me dumb when I want a measly 5% mark up on an Item. I'm a twelve year old in debt here!It's ok I'm pretty sure the old man is a pedophile, he buys my stuff at a 40% mark up if not then I drop it to 35% and he praises how good a deal it is. I mean seriously when's the last time you paid 550pix for a crappy wood bow someone probably made in 5 minutes? Also he only buys weapons I think he's a part of a secret plot to overthrow our goverment. Damn commies.You're kind of an airhead and have terrible low self esteem, I am pretty sure you contiplate suicide everytime someone doesn't buy your goods...overpriced goods.No one likes Beef Bowls....You find friends who you take into dungeons to kill things, this is lucritive for business but you're kind of rude hidding in a super safe bubble while they die for you. Then you sell them gear but they are greedy and want discounts so I am ok with letting them use crappy gear.Some chick keeps sending her husband to buy armor. I'm not sure what they are into but i'm pretty sure I want that DVD. All in all this game is awesome, I like it. You should too. I'm sure it'll be on sale during summer so don't spend twenty dollars. That's just smart planning.Also you're pretty and people like you for who you are, except me I don't know you, but I'm sure my statement is correct.			",65,13,0,26,3,0,5

												This game is... strange, in a good way.It's all about running an item shop and crawling through dungeons for items to sell, or ingrediants to make better items. The start is a bit slow and the combat could be better, but it picks up quickly as the days go by. The story of the game is all about you being the daughter of an infamous adventurer who left a massive debt in his name, and you're the only one who can clear it. With the help of the business fairy, Tear, you'll work through a month to pay off the debt... or you'll have to sell your house!Good things about this game:+Good music+Unique theme+Various items to find and a unique system for equipping your adventurer with items+Various characters to run through the dungeon with+Dialog is interesting, if not a little childish due to the age of the main character+Beating the game, or failing to do so, will allow you to 'restart' with all your items and 'Merchent Level' in tact. This lets you get up in money much faster than you would do so at the start, but you don't keep any of your money or your progress through events.+Decent end-game content that makes it worth while to try and get what you need+Haggling is a pretty neat concept, though it takes practice to get it down right.+Characters are interesting and have their own unique style, in dungeons and just in general. Bad things about this game:-Combat could definitely be better, with hit-scan and certain abilities. Some characters are just notably better than others.-Events are picky. You have to know when you need to go to places in town to get certain chat boxes, which can affect how you get items, characters, or unlock a new location. This causes you to lose a 'block' of time, too, and not all events do anything.-One girl will come in and sell you something and refuse to buy anything. She'll always refuse to sell at 100% of the item's price, too. 200% is the minimum for her, and there's no way to get rid of her after she appears. You can refuse to buy it, but this messes up your combo and makes you level up slower. -Getting the 'true card' for characters takes too long. True cards let you use your adventurer without having to find them in the story, which can be helpful for clearing dungeons again. But getting the True Card requires you to beat the game and use that adventurer the most. (More than any other adventurer, that is, for that month.)  To get another one, you have to play the game /again/ and use a different adventurer. -There's little 'stats' to the game that you can see, at least in my experience. There /are/ stats, but you can't really see them except when your adventurer is buying an item that is better than what they have. You can't even see how much people like you to adjust your prices.Despite the lengthy part of the 'bad stuff', I really just offered more explanation as to what and why it was bad. This game is still amazing to play, especially if you like dungeon crawlers. The 'bad' things are just my opinion, anyways, and the good things weren't as descriptive because I don't want to spoil anything!			",134,16,0,25,11,2,13

												Truly a sleeper hit.  When I purchased this game I was expecting a fairly cutesy shop simulator and not much beyond that and boy howdy although I was right on that there is so much more to this.  The big part of this game that steals the show comes from the dialogue and the great translation.  It feels similar to Earthbound in that there's some quirk to it that just makes you grin, although I'd argue this does it better.  Despite having the shiny atmosphere the game is also quite challenging with the debts you must pay for the Item Shop and you will have to push yourself to ensure your income makes it in time.  In addition to managing items, selling high, and buying low you also have a side story that comes in the form of dungeon crawling which is again something I did not expect.  The dungeon crawling I'd argue is just average truth be told, cause while it does have the standard looting, random drops, and boss battles the later dungeons get enourmous and it makes navigation a royal pain since the floors are randomized and you can have as many as thirty rooms on a single floor.  TL;DRA surprisingly engaging game with a great script, average dungeon crawling, and a good level of challenge.  Pick it up when you get the chance!			",25,2,0,4,2,0,4

												edit: gonna re-write this after i play it againNow this is a pretty neat game. I, unfortunately, never got too into it but I did like how it was done.The story is okay and works for the game. You play a young girl that runs a shop and you go around collecting things to sell in it. You get to decorate the shop too.There's a little town to explore with some different stores and there's also dungeons to venture into with bosses and whatnot. So the game does have combat and a handful of different characters to use when doing it. The visuals were pretty good - though I don't like the 2d sprites used in the 3d environment. A lot of games like this do that and I've never liked it. The music worked well with the game.It was pretty fun bargaining with people and selling items I collected. The dungeons were basic, but fun enough to go through as well.If you think the game sounds fun then pick it up and you'll probably like it.			",131,23,9,11,7,2,11

Recommendation:If you're not that much into story or not at all into JRPGs, this is probably not for you, but otherwise, it feels so different, original and funny, that i can definetly recommend it.About the game:This game is awesomely weird and weirdly awesome. The sounds are nothing special (after some time i turned them down and let my music play in the background) and visuals may have been average at the time of its making (2007) and are now definetly outdated, but they're nice and serve the atmosphere of the game well enough. But that atmosphere is just funny in so many ways - i love it!It's also pretty neat, that you can play the game in multiple ways - you can just use the trade mechanics to go through most of the game, or you can spend a lot of time in dungeons if you want to. Though mixing it up is probably best for both the player and the game. And if you're a completionist you need both parts and a good amount of time, as after one regular playthrough and over 20 hours of playtime, i'm not even at 50%. It's also your choice how much you want to follow the background stories, though i'd say that they make up a lot of the charme of it all. Sometimes it feels like there are some very unpolished edges, but then again, often that just seems to fit into the game's quirkyness.About the experience:""Dear diary,a few months ago dad left to get cig... eh, to become a hero and he hasn't come back ever since. So, until a few weeks ago, i was living on my own, i managed to get by, but it was a bit lonely. So, i was surprised, when some day a fairy named Tear knocked at the door and told me about dad's debts and some contract, that i would have to pay them and that i could do that by opening and manageing an item shop. I didn't quite get it, but i was happy that Tear said that she'd help me and that i had something to do now.Since then i've learned a lot about running a shop. We even met a broke adventurer who couldn't afford the entrance exam for the adventurer's guild, so we started to sponsor him in exchange for the loot found in the dungeons. I've also met a lot of other people and apparently even got a rival now.Sometimes things can get hard, when the economy just isn't working in my favor, or people aren't satisfied with my shopkeeping, or monsters seem to act erratic and beat up adventurers in the dungeons. And when i have troubles getting the money for the debt payments, i get nightmares about being evicted. But i guess that's just how live works, sometimes it's random, like a couple of fish flying in your face. So i just stick to my motto, ""capitalism ho"" and move on.But usually life is good around here. People make a lot of funny jokes and references and even though i'm not sure if i get all of them, it's always something to laugh about. Plus, language seems to be weird sometimes - for example, i'm pretty sure that Tear is actually saying ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; in french a lot.So, i'll contintue to become the best merchant and most successfull sponsor around.- 'Recette Lemongrass', now proud owner of the item shop 'Recettear'.""

												Your father has left you all alone and you inherited his shop. You're twelve with no business experience but still this is generally awesome. WAIT there's more! You also recieved an unmentionable ammount of debt! You have a friend who is a fairy, this place is racist against fairies, just saying no equal opportunities so they work through a company that helps them find work as bill collectors who will repossess your house and the shop your father left you. rude.You start out buying from other places and selling it in your shop at rediculously jacked up prices. The little girl wont buy anything ever, I hate her face she calls me dumb when I want a measly 5% mark up on an Item. I'm a twelve year old in debt here!It's ok I'm pretty sure the old man is a pedophile, he buys my stuff at a 40% mark up if not then I drop it to 35% and he praises how good a deal it is. I mean seriously when's the last time you paid 550pix for a crappy wood bow someone probably made in 5 minutes? Also he only buys weapons I think he's a part of a secret plot to overthrow our goverment. Damn commies.You're kind of an airhead and have terrible low self esteem, I am pretty sure you contiplate suicide everytime someone doesn't buy your goods...overpriced goods.No one likes Beef Bowls....You find friends who you take into dungeons to kill things, this is lucritive for business but you're kind of rude hidding in a super safe bubble while they die for you. Then you sell them gear but they are greedy and want discounts so I am ok with letting them use crappy gear.Some chick keeps sending her husband to buy armor. I'm not sure what they are into but i'm pretty sure I want that DVD. All in all this game is awesome, I like it. You should too. I'm sure it'll be on sale during summer so don't spend twenty dollars. That's just smart planning.Also you're pretty and people like you for who you are, except me I don't know you, but I'm sure my statement is correct.			",65,13,0,26,3,0,5

												Got this game on sale for $4.99. Worth it? Completly.This game is an anime game, which typically pushes most of the ""gamer"" catagory away, but do not run. This game is fantastic. I was a bit uneasy purchasing an anime game, as I am not a big fan of cute anime stuff, but i'm glad I went for it. You take on the role of a girl (Recette of Recettear) and your goal is to payback a loan that your adventurer father left after he dissapeared. The character that runs with you the whole game is a fairy, yes, fairy named ""Tear"". The two combined makes the name of the game/shop. Tear gets you started and teaches you how to run a shop in the game, and you buy items, sell items, and complete orders at your store to make money. You can also take command of many different warriors to take on dungeons head on. Dungeons will allow you to score some low-priced, loot that you can sell in your store, completly for free. Market prices vary in the game depending on fictional situations. I.E. Candy shortage in the town over, makes the price of candy double for a short time. They can also go down with the situations. Having these price variations makes you keep lots of stock of certain items, buy when they're low, sell when they're high, etc. Instead of just buying an item and selling it, you always want lots of variations.Another aspect of the game, which I personally find excellent is that your warriors will come into your store, and purchase goods. When they do so, the goods they purchase will be equipped on them for their next battles. It's always good to hold off on selling certain items to the townspeople and waiting for your warrior to come in to buy it.After you pay off your final loan, you see some anime cutscene of ""I love you, Don't leave fairy loanshark girl"" and you can continue on playing until you pull your hair out from hearing ""do you have _____"" Which you just sold out of.All in all, This game honestly, is one of my top 10 games on steam. The fact a $4.99 tiny indie game can hold such honor over many $59.99 AAA titles, is a huge award. Buy this, even at full price. If you love RPG's, and ever wanted to own a shop in one,(Like me in Oblivion/Skyrim) it's a must.			",365,77,18,59,81,5,54

												This game is... strange, in a good way.It's all about running an item shop and crawling through dungeons for items to sell, or ingrediants to make better items. The start is a bit slow and the combat could be better, but it picks up quickly as the days go by. The story of the game is all about you being the daughter of an infamous adventurer who left a massive debt in his name, and you're the only one who can clear it. With the help of the business fairy, Tear, you'll work through a month to pay off the debt... or you'll have to sell your house!Good things about this game:+Good music+Unique theme+Various items to find and a unique system for equipping your adventurer with items+Various characters to run through the dungeon with+Dialog is interesting, if not a little childish due to the age of the main character+Beating the game, or failing to do so, will allow you to 'restart' with all your items and 'Merchent Level' in tact. This lets you get up in money much faster than you would do so at the start, but you don't keep any of your money or your progress through events.+Decent end-game content that makes it worth while to try and get what you need+Haggling is a pretty neat concept, though it takes practice to get it down right.+Characters are interesting and have their own unique style, in dungeons and just in general. Bad things about this game:-Combat could definitely be better, with hit-scan and certain abilities. Some characters are just notably better than others.-Events are picky. You have to know when you need to go to places in town to get certain chat boxes, which can affect how you get items, characters, or unlock a new location. This causes you to lose a 'block' of time, too, and not all events do anything.-One girl will come in and sell you something and refuse to buy anything. She'll always refuse to sell at 100% of the item's price, too. 200% is the minimum for her, and there's no way to get rid of her after she appears. You can refuse to buy it, but this messes up your combo and makes you level up slower. -Getting the 'true card' for characters takes too long. True cards let you use your adventurer without having to find them in the story, which can be helpful for clearing dungeons again. But getting the True Card requires you to beat the game and use that adventurer the most. (More than any other adventurer, that is, for that month.)  To get another one, you have to play the game /again/ and use a different adventurer. -There's little 'stats' to the game that you can see, at least in my experience. There /are/ stats, but you can't really see them except when your adventurer is buying an item that is better than what they have. You can't even see how much people like you to adjust your prices.Despite the lengthy part of the 'bad stuff', I really just offered more explanation as to what and why it was bad. This game is still amazing to play, especially if you like dungeon crawlers. The 'bad' things are just my opinion, anyways, and the good things weren't as descriptive because I don't want to spoil anything!			",134,16,0,25,11,2,13

												Great game that is both challenging and creative to master! The characters, music, and story really stands out for a game which is about opening an item shop. There is a little grinding involved and the game can be a little unforgiving, but for those that can look beyond those aspects, players will find a gem of a game hidden in this little shop that may make you cry recettears of happiness.

STORY & GAMEPLAYDue to her father's debt, Recette open an item store to pay the debt. A large amount of debt -_-. She runs the store with help/guidance from her fairy debt-collector 'companion', Tear. Every some period of time (about weekly) Recette must pay certain amount of money (called 'pix' in this game) to Tear. If she unable to pay, Tear will take her house as payment for the debt. Funny story, a fairy debt-collector 'companion' assist errr, more precisely, force a little girl to pay her father's debt..... ._.Although the story sounds funny, the gameplay is a little bit... hard. If you unable to collect certain amount of pix at the payment date (which getting bigger & bigger amount of pix at the next week), you'll lose your house and live in a cardbox. But..., don't worry about that... ;)Well, even with that cruel debt, the game itself is interesting to play. There are three ways to get item stock to sell on your store:1. Buy items from market & guild2. Explore dungeons to get some items there3. Fusion (combine various items to get new items)To explore dungeons, you can't go there alone. You must hire an adventurer. As more days passed & events happen, more adventurers will be unlocked. You can equip the adventurer with items you have in your inventory. If you succeed defeating monsters & bosses on the dungeons, you can bring all items you've collected. But if you failed, you can bring only few items. The dungeon is randomized so it'll never be the same when you go there again. Nice feature.You can do fusion at the guild. The variety & rank of items you can fusion is depend on your merchant level. The higher your level the more items, of course. The merchant level also affects what kind of items you can find on market & guild, and items dropped from the monsters on dungeons. Also, how much you can decorate your item store is depend on it too.

I won't say much about graphics. It's good enough. Good variety of background, so much variety of items, colorful. Nice graphics.MUSICThe soundtracks is good enough.

												Recettear on the surface appears to be a a boring shop-owning simulator. and at its core, thats what it is. You run a store, but it goes so much furthur than that. Recettear ends up becoming this charming adventure that you wouldn't have expected. Running your store, questing for items, pricing, its an expirience no other game can give. Plus, it reeks of Japan, with japanese voice acting,  creatures that I couldn't explain if I tried, and flying fish, this game manages to create one of the most random and humorous atmospheres at the same time. Overall, I would reccomend this game to, anyone really. It really is an ace of all trades. Its unexpectedly charming, and well worth the buy.CAPITALISM HO!			",49,7,1,6,4,0,3

												I really enjoy how this is a mixture of genres.  Not only do you manage your shop but you can equip adventurers with your merchandise, as well as sell to them, and go dungeon crawling to increase your shops inventory.  Picking up ingredients to craft specialty items as well as a good storyline are also plusses for ths game.  Great game :)			",32,23,0,9,7,0,4

												This was one of the first games I bought on Steam, and I stand by my decision to buy it after all these years. It is a game that puts an unique spin on the RPG item shop staple, by forcing you to take a crash course in profit-making, stock management, and haggling. Hell, calling this Baby's First Management wouldn't be far off if the game wasn't so unforgivable on those that don't cater to their clients (Then again, it's not like starting from the beginning was a brutal punishment when you keep your things, but still).Fans of dungeon crawling, on the other hand, won't be dissapointed as the adventuring feels very well done, and, more importantly, each of your mercenary pals not only plays differently, they really feel differently, right down to movement and battle mechanics. This might not seem strange in a game tailored around the theme, but in a game focused on store management this comes as a pleasant surprise.Also, the ammount of content in this game is absurd: The story itself isn't exactly long, and as you struggle against the loan deadlines you may come to loathe the moment when no other shoppers try to buy something it may feel short, but trying to get all the true adventurer cards, trying to fill out your in-game glossary, and really, just trying to get the true end itself will feel like you're playing one of those JRPGs that have no end in sight after a hundred hours.If the economics, the dungeon crawling and the collecting still haven't sold you into it, maybe you'll give it a shot for the sheer hillarity and referencing in this game. And remember, the demo is there to help you make a more informed decision than what the shopkeeper tells you, so give it a shot before buying. Finally, it's not like you can't haggle the price down, if you decide to buy it eventually, after all, that's what steam sales are for. Capitalism, ho!			",210,57,1,40,18,1,25

												Very fun!I feel this needs to be elaborated more, as I have finally cleared the main game and off to the post-game content. It took me a very long while to finish this as I had failed the last payment on my first time, and after finding out it sets you back on day 2, I got demotivated (that's not entirely true though, apparently you keep your end-game items when you reset so you get that extra boost on your next try, but I did not know that back then), but after giving it another go I was able to finish it with money to spare.This game... Is AMAZING... this is something that costs like 10 bucks, I bought for something like 3 and I've already accumulated 44 hours and I intend to play even more for the post-game. The graphics are cute, the voice acting is great though it is not fully voiced, the dungeons are simple but interesting, though it is my complaint that they are too lengthy, depending on the character you choose it will take about 2 hours or something to clear unless you are rushing it (but then you miss out on phat lewt, who would want to miss out on phat lewt?). I guess if there was an end-game tier item that automatically revealed the map when you took it could cut out on some of that time as you'd only move to the treasure chests? I did not check if there actually is an item like that, though.I'd say the dungeons make up about 3/4 of the time you'd spend on the game (mainly due to how lengthy they are), and for the last fourth you'll be selling stuff in the shop, though it may be a bit awkward at start, you eventually get used to it. There are many numbers and percentages involved that you can only find out through experimentation or visiting the wiki, I'd say it's worth skimming over them or else you'll screw yourself over on your first run. Also, I'd say thank god that the text for when you buy or sell has a different color, because the speech before it sometimes sound a bit ambiguous.I really hope I can find other gems like this one in the future. Thank you based Comiket, thank you based EGS, and thank you based Carpe Fulgur!Capitalism, ho!			",196,8,8,19,2,0,4

												So let me get this straight.I am a little girl. My father is an adventurer with massive debt, who is probably dead. The banks, who my father owes a lot of money to, have come to collect from me. They know I don't have any money, but they allow me to open a shop to pay them with the stores revenue. But:-Despite that fact that my father might have died adventuring, I send adventurers to collect money for me from dungeons.-If I miss one payment to the bank they foreclose upon my store and throw me onto the streets, knowing I would never be able to pay them back.-I am a fan of capitalism, despite being one bounced check away from dying in the streets.9/10 would storyline again.

STORY & GAMEPLAYDue to her father's debt, Recette open an item store to pay the debt. A large amount of debt -_-. She runs the store with help/guidance from her fairy debt-collector 'companion', Tear. Every some period of time (about weekly) Recette must pay certain amount of money (called 'pix' in this game) to Tear. If she unable to pay, Tear will take her house as payment for the debt. Funny story, a fairy debt-collector 'companion' assist errr, more precisely, force a little girl to pay her father's debt..... ._.Although the story sounds funny, the gameplay is a little bit... hard. If you unable to collect certain amount of pix at the payment date (which getting bigger & bigger amount of pix at the next week), you'll lose your house and live in a cardbox. But..., don't worry about that... ;)Well, even with that cruel debt, the game itself is interesting to play. There are three ways to get item stock to sell on your store:1. Buy items from market & guild2. Explore dungeons to get some items there3. Fusion (combine various items to get new items)To explore dungeons, you can't go there alone. You must hire an adventurer. As more days passed & events happen, more adventurers will be unlocked. You can equip the adventurer with items you have in your inventory. If you succeed defeating monsters & bosses on the dungeons, you can bring all items you've collected. But if you failed, you can bring only few items. The dungeon is randomized so it'll never be the same when you go there again. Nice feature.You can do fusion at the guild. The variety & rank of items you can fusion is depend on your merchant level. The higher your level the more items, of course. The merchant level also affects what kind of items you can find on market & guild, and items dropped from the monsters on dungeons. Also, how much you can decorate your item store is depend on it too. It's also affect your haggle/bargain skill when you open your store and start selling items to your customers :)Capitalism, ho!GRAPHICSWell, obviously, Japanese style anime characters. I won't say much about graphics. It's good enough. Good variety of background, so much variety of items, colorful. Nice graphics.MUSICThe soundtracks is good enough. The character voice is in Japanese.

												Interesting game. The actually gameplay is pretty repetetive but it has some funny dialogue and can be challenging. The funnest part is probably finding and gearing up the people in the town that can explore roguelike dungeons. It creates a nice purpose to leveling up your shop and crafting high end items. Its a bit short but unique and worth a play. I'd recommend only to buy it on sale if you are interested.			",19,2,0,16,4,0,3

												You are an anime. You have a fairy godmother who is actually more of a fairy revenuer. Your goal is to run an item shop in someone else's RPG and fleece other animes of their hard-earned cash in order to pay off your deadbeat father's debt to society, otherwise you'll have to live in a cardboard box. All the while even MORE animes are trying to muscle in on your business, and you've gotta find some animes stupid enough to wade through dungeons and get you more goods to sell.

												Summary: Great game with a few rough patches... Well worth the purchase.Good: This game's combat, while pretty easy to wrap your head around, is surprisingly gratifying as your heroes level up. The abilities feel really fun, and dungeon exploring does a good job of being tense and challenging throughout the game. Combining a store style sim with an action combat mechanic is by no means a new idea, but it's executed very well here. The store management system is fun and very in depth. I had a great time tweaking my store's aesthetics and placement, choosing where each item goes based on how that will affect my sales. If you like store management games, action rpgs, or both, you're going to find something to love here.Bad: In all honesty, I was unimpressed by the game's story. While some of the characters were interesting, the main plot and a lot of the side plots were kind of dull, and I found myself wading through text trying to get to the next part of the game. A good story draws you in, not forces you to skip it. Also, you have regular bills to pay each week, and the last one is suddenly, terrifyingly large. Ugly: I only have one complaint large enough to be called ""Ugly"": To craft the really good items to sell in your store, you need material items, some of which are seemingly impossible to find. Any game that requires me to hunt down a wiki to complete is probably doing something wrong. Complaints aside, this game was impressively fun and engaging. Definitely check it out.

Everyone should know, however, that you will more than likely fail at least once and probably several times before you succeed.  I got this on sale, which is the best time to purchase since the regular price is a bit high,  and it was well worth the money spent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its been a long time since I last played this game. Anyone else who has played it knows why. It's so fun but sadly out of date for todays indie experimental phase. What I can't stress enough is that its a short 20hour game if you blast through the story. It has a great system with out of place graphics but interesting none the less. If you havent picked it up try it out but if you arnt into a mix of two generes dont get it. I'd rate it at a good 7/10 just because its a little dated and the voice acting is a little bad not to mention the piles of meaningless dialog.			",163,38,0,30,30,0,9

												Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is a cute anime themed game about a young girl who starts an item shop business in a small village. That's the official story. What Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is actually about is a young girl abandoned by her father at a young age who is quickly conned by a 'well wishing fairy' who loans her an extraordinary amount of money to allow her to start a tiny business and extorts her with exorbiant amounts of interest. Taking this deal with the devil, she begins earnestly to start this tiny business. She begins bright eyed and innocent, only selling items at a fair price and buying items from others for a fair price. However, due to the huge repayments that she is required to pay back, she eventually is driven to profiteering over other people's suffering by charging exorbiant amounts of pix (gold) for simple items during times of famine or desperation. In her greed she starts to hire young adventurers to raid dangerous dungeons and taking everything they find. Often putting their lives in dire danger over a few trinkets. By the end of the game she has turned from what was a young girl trying to keep her small business afloat to a fraudulent conwoman, taking advantage of the unfortunate townfolk who happened to wander in and revelling in their misfortune. Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is an artistic masterwork detailing the temptations of financial immorality. Truly a wonderful game.			",181,32,2,24,21,0,21

												As someone who vaguely enjoys a good japanese-style rpg every now and then, I can safely say that Recettear: AIST is a stunningly well done game. The music is semi-retro SNES / early PS1 (in the best way possible i mean), the dungenons are fun and satisfying, and overall the game has a great personality. The japanese-only sfx dialog is a little irritating at times but it can be forgiven, especially with the great presentation and fun factor. TL;DR Highly recommended, very unique RPG that puts a nice twist on a basic dungeon crawler.			",53,7,4,6,10,4,8

												Okay. If you're curious to find out what kind of game this is, It is a game about capitalism, and running your own little items shop as the title of the game implies. It has a decent combat system, a likeable protagonist, and very nice guidelines to learn how to play most effectively. Although the music does get VERY aggravating at times in my opinion. All in all, I have had an absolute blast with this game. Pros: 1. Good shop customization         2. Decent characters and storyline         3. Rewarding combat system, addicting gameplay that keeps you occupied for hours.Cons: 1. Wonky movement with the arrow keys when you're fighting in a dungeon. (It's tolerable)          2. Repetitive music and voices. (I had to turn those off within the first hour of gameplay)          3. THE BLONDE ♥♥♥♥♥ AND HER FAIRY THAT TRIES TO BUY♥♥♥♥♥♥FOR 3% OVER THE BASE PRICE, AND KIDS WHO COME INTO YOUR SHOP WITH THEIR LUNCH MONEY AND PICK OUT A 7,000 PIX SWORD AND WON'T PAY UP!Other than that. Great game. I rate 9/10 :) ",103,5,1,21,3,0,2

												Recettear is a game you should get if you are looking for a nice break from the major titles currently drowning the market on all platforms from the handheld to the consoles. Its cute, sincere, well put together and designed in a way where all the mechanics work together to create a stronger experience. Its not a stand out in anything, but it does all of the right things well enough to make it stand head and shoulders above many other games. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a modern classic, but its definitely a good game that I do recommend that people play.

												The tutorials are hand-holding, the challenge level is punishing, and some of the characters are a little annoying (if adorable), but /Recettear/ is absolutely worth a shot, especially if you don't think you'll like it. The game looks like a JRPG, but it doesn't have the hand-holding character of FF13, or even of FF6; it's more like a roguelike with a graphics budget than it is like anything else. (Be warned, you can't win the game with shopkeeping alone. Nor with dungeon crawling alone -- I think you need to go for item creation as soon as the game starts hinting that it might be a good idea...)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first glance, Recettear may seem like some generic Japanese game, and the reason for this is that it doesn't do much to present itself as anything else; however, the game is one of the more unique titles I've seen among the massive amount of choices in the Steam library.  Recettear is a mix between a Commerce game, an Action RPG, and a Visual Novel.  If you don't like one of the three, don't take part in it, that's what makes the game so interesting.  If you simply want to experience the semi-complex sales and marketting system, by all means.  If you just want to kill everything and earn money that way, that's fine too.  Maybe you want to just delve into alchemy and fusion; by all means.  Or maybe you just want to engage yourself with the deceptively unique characters that the game has to offer, you can do that (though it'd be rather difficult on its own).  This is the type of game that will definitely take a bite out of your life, and whether you are into Japanese games or not is irrelevant.  Recettear is a game that is what you make it, and let's you play the way you want to play, and it is certainly worth a play.			",547,149,11,104,49,6,90

												A really interesting and fun game. Kind of like a reverse dungeon game. Instead of going through dungeons being the primary focus, you run a store where adventurers will purchase supplies before going on their own dungeon adventure. You are, however, able to go into dungeons to find new items for your store, but the meat of the game takes place inside the shop, trying to sell items to customers. You want to make as much money off someone as possible, without making them feel like they're getting ripped off. Lots of fun.			",2187,999,80,289,295,24,367

												An interesting mix of a dungeon crawler and a captialism simulator, it's one of those games that hooked me early on and wouldn't let me go. I blame it for falling behind on videos: which should indicate its quality. Attempting to make as much money by using the resources you find in dungeons and to sell them back feels like a unique experience, and while it's a bit of a challenge to keep things going for each level, it rewards you in the cute anime style that this game is known for. It's worth picking up through and through.Some indepth footage here:

Big companies have a lot to learn from this game, and it's definitely worth picking up, especially when it goes on sale again (as it's bound to do). ",217,85,1,85,16,1,29

Running this item shop is a lot more fun and rewarding than grinding for experience on Final Fantasy XIII: Corridors and Cutscenes. Don't be fooled by the Item Shop subtitle, there is still combat and dungeons, with some really unique bossfights. Has a new game+ option, and even if you get a game over, you can restart on day 1 with the majority of your progress retained. Buy this right now.			",345,73,4,51,16,2,47

												I quite enjoyed this game. It's not as good as Kamidori Alchemy Meister, but who can compete with that right?The game is light themed, but at the same time dead serious. It's really easy to lose because you need to pay off your fathers debt and if you fail to pay the debt monthly (or was it weekly?) you lose your house and it's game over for you.This game is basically a collection of minigames, the focus of the game is shop management where you showcase your most valuable ""shiny"" items to lure people into the store and try to haggle it up to the highest possible price before selling it. But the worst thing that could happen to you is if you don't sell the item, that is you make it too expensive and the customer just leaves, so with that you need to learn what kinds of people are likely to pay more, and who are likely to pay less (for example, kids generally aren't very rich)Another minigame is ""item gathering"" which is basically just a 3D dungeon crawling minigame where you get to pick a character to play as and then dash through a dungeon crawling level. This again is not very easy and although there is no permadeath in this system, the death penalty is high. (Failure to gather valuable items and defeat bosses to earn these items, as well as exp can often lead to the game over screen)The game is a perfect mix of fun and hard with just the right amount of cuteness too.

												This game startled me. It just didn't seem like it'd be that much fun... I thought it'd be maybe kind of relaxing to run a shop, and that'd be the end of it.I was sorely mistaken.This game is just plain, downright fun. Frankly, I'm not entirely sure what's so enjoyable about it. The leveling system, the shop system, the integration of dungeon crawling and the item shop, the ability to switch back and forth according to one's mood - it just allows for a very relaxing experience, with just the right amount of emotional pressure, to make you want to really do your best.I've had this game for a couple of years now, and I keep coming back to it, every now and again. It's just... well, fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simple at first glance, the game actually has a lot to offer. 100% completion requires a lot of exploration/dungeon-crawling and the game provides excellent replay value in the form of True Cards (a means to unlock a character permanently before their triggered event). It is a must have for those who support fine indie titles that bring back the player to a conventional rpg with a slight capitalist twist!			",1696,736,69,252,221,20,307

												Have you wondered what it would be like to run a shop as an anime girl in a Japanese RPG? If so, then Recettear: An Item Shop’s Tale is what you’ve so desired. And it IS an indie game, which again shows that, as usual, the AAA games industry can’t be counted on to touch the part of us which wants to play as a pretty little girl.One of this game’s taglines is “Capitalism, ho!” Recette, the protagonist and girl, says it with a big smile, and her eyes closed. Or maybe that’s how I remember her. With her open, maroon vest, green tie, belt buckle, and those two, large, red beads, maintaining strands of her caramel-colored hair in a tail beside her head. Plus that mortified facial expression of hers, whenever she hears opinions disparaging her business. She is so young.The game, though. There’s more to it than those tan sleeves, over arms which she keeps parallel to her sides, with her palms wide open, giving the appearance of an angel. There is, indeed, more to the game. For example: does she live alone? Sort of. She lives with a fairy. Her mother seems to have passed away. And as for her dad, he seems to have abandoned her, and with lots of debt. You must be the godlike father she evidently never had. You must take possession of her body and ensure she pays off her dad’s debt so as to avoid being dispossessed of everything except, perhaps, her clothes.Alas, that form of losing leads to one of the game’s weak points. For if you do lose (if you can’t pay your in-game debtors), you start from the “beginning,” with many of the advantages you’ve accrued in your defunct playthrough. This has you suffer what was already an uninspired dungeon crawler even more, as you’re sort of playing it all over again. It is by this and other means that you get to see little Recette running around, pit pat pit pat. By these you get to see her buy valuable items at low prices and sell them at high prices. You get to watch her go to sleep and awake, and reveal her innermost thoughts to her fairy friend. And it is all well-written, well-drawn, and….			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recettear is quite possibly my favorite game on Steam.Concept: Your father ran away and left you in massive debt.  The collection agency sends out a fairy to get someone to pay up and that just happens to be you.  What are you going to do?  Open up an item shop in the middle of RPG-ville.Yeah, that's right.  Other suckers are out there killing for loot but you're chilling back in town playing the markets and raking in the dosh.  Buy your products from the guild or from the street merchants and turn right around to sell it to the townsfolk and the adventuring crowds.  Expand your store, learn the folks, and fleece them for every red cent they've ever made.Not exciting enough for you?  Want some action or maybe some rare items to sell?  Press those adventurers into servitude and hit up the dungeons for fresh wares.  Press on, gather everything, and keep it for yourself while the so-called heroes risk their lives for your profits.  Capitalism, ho!			",453,177,6,84,45,3,66

												I feel that this game had a great bit of fun in it. I already played into it and was kinda like well I got to plan and thankfully there are guides now. However I do find that this game has it's moments. It's pretty much reminding me of a similiar process I've seen in Harvest Moon, Rune Factory, and more. However in this one you control the price and let's be honest, this game makes you think and even if it's a bit rough at first, you get the hang of it. I found it rather enjoyablea 8-10 out of mine. Feels like one of those games I'd played way before I came to steam.			",279,83,1,60,22,0,18

												This game starts out easy - run a shop, right?  And do a little dungeon delving on the side.And then things get serious!I waited a couple years for the sale price to be ""reasonable enough"" to buy it, but I think it's (at least) worth the 50% they normally put it on sale for!  It reminded me quite a bit of FF7, though maybe that's just because it's an anime JRPG.EDIT: The game is kind of a grind if you want to unlock the last two dungeons.  To do that, you need to play New Game+ 6 times!  That's actually not horrible (with breaks), since each adventurer is distinctly different from the others.  But then I couldn't make it to the end of the last dungeon - I think because of gear.  Getting the rarer ingredients for Fusion is such a grind that I stopped playing.			",313,154,1,56,59,3,88

												The sort of game you didn't know you needed. Who knew running the item shop could be more interesting than being the JRPG protagonist? Well-balanced game elements, in a fairly addicting little package. Kuwai japanese voices, but that could probably be assumed from the screenshots posted in the store. Not especially difficult, if you keep your eye on the market, but lots of aftergame content and challenge modes to give it replayability. Pretty standard action-rpg outside the shop, but a polished generic RPG is what you'd expect from a game that's really trying to hijack rather than be one. Slightly oddball charicterization keeps you in the right frame of mind. A bit niche, but nails it.Capitalism, ho! (Frankly, that line is ""Show me your moves!!!""-level quotable.)			",9,1,0,14,2,0,8

												Recettear`s an rpg-manager game made with low budget but nailing what its doing!Recettears game consists of two ""phases"" the phase you buy/sell items you`ve previously  bought/sold or looted from the dungeons while trying to get the set amount of debt paid every month.The first playtrough is full of awsomeness. The after games suffer of repeating especially on the selling phase. But big kudos from the ""new game+"" which always makes regaming more interesting.If you`re into japanese style rpg or like games which mix managering/rpg this game is more than worth your time.

												Never before have I played a game that I can describe as beautiful in such an eclectic sense. The town looks absolutely stunning on the PC. The story is rich and provoking, keeping you guessing and revising your theories as you play. The final scenes will haunt you, driving you (or at least many) to the forums to absorb and discuss thoughts on the plot possibilities. The music is captivating and enthralling, with all of its drama. With extra orchestral stabs to accent details such as how you finish an enemy, the experience really feels complete and integrated. The gameplay is familiar for fans of the previous Carpe Fulgur games, with new innovations to spice things up. Zipping around the town and dealing out devastating blows is both effective and immensely satisfying. No game is perfect, as no form of entertainment/art is immune to subjectivity but this game comes so close that it deserves a 10/10 for being worth every single coin spent on it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An interesting mix of a shopkeeping simulation in a fantasy world with the added feature of being able to hire adventurers to go down into dungeons and restock your shop with newer and better items instead of buying them.Essentially you have three parts of the game - in your shop you can move items around, or swap them with your inventory to ensure your best and most profitable items are on the shelves (you generally can't sell items not on display so choose carefully), and then wait to see who comes in the shop and see if they want anything you have on offer. If they do you will get to haggle with them to try and eek out that extra profit if you think you can, conversely they will try and haggle down the price.In town you can meet all sorts of people - other merchants you can buy items from (haggling again, but in the opposite direction), the guild where you can craft items or also buy more stock, or the tavern and elsewhere where you can meet adventurers sometimes.Finally there is the action RPG dungeon crawler where you can persuade adventurers you have met to risk their lives getting you more stock for your shop, this is probably the weakest part of the game as the controls aren't great, the monster variation is quite small, although there are a few reasonably well done boss fights to open up new dungeons.Overall a great game and well worth playing, just don't expect too much from the dungeon crawling side of things, that is more of a chore than anything else. The story is fun and endearing, and it is interesting to be on the other side of things in an RPG for once.			",989,483,27,201,151,12,338

The dungeon crawling is nice, but you can technically make a better profit just by buying and selling goods.But where's the fun in that? Go into the dungeons my friends, even fail to pay off the debt once or twice, and you will see that this game oozes its own unique charm.Since it's a 'love it or hate it' kinda charm, try the demo.

The after games suffer of repeating especially on the selling phase. But big kudos from the ""new game+"" which always makes regaming more interesting.If you`re into japanese style rpg or like games which mix managering/rpg this game is more than worth your time.

												GLANCE RECOMMENDATION: 89% YES / 11% NOGOODIncredibly interesting spin of gameplay. You constantly buy/sell items out of your item shop, then fund adventurers to go dungeon diving for you (all of which you control). I haven't played a game so intriguing for quite some time.The characters are very likeable and varied enough to adadpt to many styles of combat for dungeon exploration.The selling/buying mechanic is deep and as rewarding as you are daring. It feels great to get a high sell combo.The dialogue is fun without being jarring, which is hard for a lot of translated games. They knocked it out of the park with this one.NEUTRALI'm not incredibly fond of losing almost everything if I die, which is easy if you're playing low defense heroes, but you get use to the hitboxes of monsters so fast this shouldn't be too much of an issue the first time around.It's understated how hard you need to work for sell chains or dungeon dive as far as possible your first time around. There's a good chance your first playthrough for the first month will result in a box ending.SUMMARYThis was the biggest surprise of the year for me back when I played it. An unusually fun game, interesting concept, great dialogue, tight gameplay, and an absolute mass of content for the price. I highly recommend this title for people wanting to see what owning an item shop and haggling gameplay feels like.			",424,113,5,67,31,2,46

												2 parts business simulator, 1 part dungeon crawler - if that idea appeals to you I cannot recommend this game hard enough. You take on the role of the Item Shop owner in an RPG based world and supply the adventurers and regular townies with much needed supplies of every nature.But it's not just about stocking your shop - because of course no one's going to pay sticker price for your♥♥♥♥♥♥ damn adventurers and their haggling. Warning: You may want to drown the Little Girl for never having any money ever.The smart store owner stock piles items when they're cheap and sells them when they go up in value, and if there are ingredients you just can't buy from your suppliers, well then it's time to hire a sell-sword (whom you equip and level up yourself) and kill some monsters in a nearby dungeon, complete with multiple randomized levels and some fun bossfights.Adorable art style, great gameplay, so simple and yet so much fun, easy to sink a ton of hours into. Happy gaming.			",145,76,0,45,22,1,21

												For the first 15 minutes, Recettear is a slog with it's sacchrine sweet animu story, music and characters.  The talking (and by talking, I mean reading) carries on forever as the stern midrif bearing librarian looking fairy lectures you on the ins and outs of being a child laborer/shop owner.  Then you finally get done with the lectures, you open your shop, you maybe go explore a dungeon for some items, and the next thing you now an hour has passed. It's a steep price entry, all that slow reading to kick things off, but once you get to the meat of Recettear, it's kind of charming.  The dungeon exploring (which you technically odn't even have to do) is not too shabby, set in real time instead of your typical turn based combat that japanese RPGs' tend to use.  Once you load up on items, you had back to your shop, put them up for sale, make a little money.  The haggling system seems kind of pointless, but you know...whateveer.  It's still enjoyable.  Not something I'd power through in marathon sessions, but if you can get past the tooth ache that the oh-so-cute setup gives you, it's an allright game.			",364,56,12,63,30,5,42

Haggling with customers is surprisingly intense, since you have to balance the need to squeeze as much profit from them as possible to afford the next loan payment against the risk of them breaking your combo (robbing you of experience points for store improvements) by walking away from an insulting high offer.You can also go Zelda-style dungeon crawling as the adventurers whom you're selling all the equipment to, but that's a dangerously low-profit waste of time during the story mode.

												Not quite a RPG but still close enough and more importantly: great fun! What if instead of being the hero, you were the item shopkeeper, selling to and buying from adventurers?There's quite a bit more to it too, brought about progressively: negotiating prices, taking orders, managing stock, dungeoning with adventurers to get loot, changing your shop's atmosphere to attract different customers, finding new adventurers and learning about them and their backstories... It's a very cute game although prepare to see the dark side of capitalism if you fail to make your loan repayments in time ;)The demo is quite comprehensive and I heartily recommend giving it a try to see if you'd like the game.

												Recettear has a great amount of gameplay for its worth. Story is fairly unbelievable. A little girls father who has disappeared leaves his daughter with a huge crippling debt. She's only 10 (I am guessing?) how is she suppose to repay his debt? Why the fairy Tear tells her to make a store so she can pay it back. The lil loli Recette gets help and turns her house into a store. While the story was fairly unbelievable and lacking there isn't much to do but if you do the RPG dungeon part more stories unfold and builds up more character for Recette and Tear and the Adventurers. Characters in the game have a huge impact. Everyone is unique and different and the events that happen make them rememberable enough. The more you unlock the more events that will happen interacting with all the characters all together. It gives incentive to do the dungeon part of the game to unlock more of these characters with their corky bits and pieces. There are two different types of gameplay here. Running the Store and the Dungeon Crawling. Running your store was great but a challenge. Everyone has a different budget and you have to learn that by personality and age. The little girl is well in fact a little girl so she doesn't have much money. Louie is poor but the more adventuring you do with him the more money he gets and if you sell to him cheap he starts to get a bigger and better budget. It's so crazy and complex that each character in the game has specific things and goals and all this other crap that it's difficult to explain! Combat was simplistic but each Adventurer has their pros and cons and a different playstyle required. Not much to talk about here but it kinda reminded me of Final Fantasy without the turn base thing. Long story short, scamming off little girls or spent your life living in a cardboard box. Whats your choice?			",32,2,0,6,2,0,3

												Racketeer - The game where you rip off small children and the elderly for fame and fortune! Capitalism ho!Seriously, you play a shopkeeper of a stereotypical RPG, catering to both the regular townsfolk, as well as the occasional adventurer.Oddly enough, the game actually has surprisingly good writing, with a unique and interesting assortment of eccentric characters set to a rather ridiculous plotline which works not just in spite of, but specifically because of how silly it is.A lot of various addictive qualities show up in Recettear, such as RPG-style leveling of your character/shop, an economy where you purchase materials and have to buy low/sell high, as well as witty and charming dialogue.You'll find a modest variety of characters enter your store; a small girl, an elderly man, a housewife and a generic common man for the regular townsfolk, each with their own personal buying habits. Toss in the more unique characters such as your brattish rival with a cynical faery of her own, a runaway princess-turned drunken assassin, a cyborg who is kind of new to the concept of ""money"", and a down-on-his-luck wannabe adventurer, to name a few, and you'll find yourself entertained for quite long periods at a time interacting with them.Haggling is an artform, and you get significantly rewarded for giving an offer that will be accepted on the first try rather than just going back and forth until someone either gives in or they meet in the middle. As such, there's actually some pretty shrewd tactics to manage when trying to haggle with customers, and learning their personal traits and spending habits can be quite beneficial.As a whole, it's a fairly unique game. There have been others vaguely similar to it before, where you buy low and sell high... but none which have have nearly as much polish and just sheer charm to the personalities you interact with in Recettear.Final Verdict:It's really quite enjoyable for what it is. If you like shopping, or even just anything similar to facebook or flash games, you'll probably adore Recettear. It's value for retaining a player's interest can be a bit less than ideal, however, as there is an ""end"" to the game. There are some nice options for increasing replay value, but you'll probably only find yourself doing one or two playthroughs every few years. It's a nice game to come back to once in awhile, but not on a consistent basis.Overall Score: About 80%. It's really probably the best game of it's kind out there, and the writing is great! The content duration's a bit short, though, and considering the game type... you might want to wait for it to go on sale; $20 is a little bit much. $15 is reasonable, and $10's a good, ideal price for it.

												You've got a loan to pay, but you're just a girl who's Dad has gone off adventuring... No worries, as an item shop, you'll be able to sell stuff to repay your loan! One problem though... Isn't that really boring? And you can't just sell apples 24/7... (Well, you COULD).When you're bored, or you want super rare items, what other way to pass the time than going into a dungeon! Slay monsters with dedicated Adventurers, outsmart traps and find the really expensive treasure!You decide the price the customer should pay, but if it's too high, they'll leave in a bad mood; too low and you're not making any profit (but you'll win a place in your customer's heart).Was the main story too easy? How about an endless mode where your loan just increases every week? How long will you be able to hold out?In my opinion, it's definitely worth the price.			",55,10,0,18,15,2,6

												 Well, Recettear is a pretty good game, among them independent ""doujin"" games!

												You've got a loan to pay, but you're just a girl who's Dad has gone off adventuring... No worries, as an item shop, you'll be able to sell stuff to repay your loan! One problem though... Isn't that really boring? And you can't just sell apples 24/7... (Well, you COULD).When you're bored, or you want super rare items, what other way to pass the time than going into a dungeon! Slay monsters with dedicated Adventurers, outsmart traps and find the really expensive treasure!You decide the price the customer should pay, but if it's too high, they'll leave in a bad mood; too low and you're not making any profit (but you'll win a place in your customer's heart).Was the main story too easy? How about an endless mode where your loan just increases every week? How long will you be able to hold out?In my opinion, it's definitely worth the price.			",55,10,0,18,15,2,6

												Panic set in as the deadline to pay my bill was approaching, I bought ten healing rings in a desperate bid to raise money by overpricing second hand goods. Suddenly, the market crashed, my healing rings were worthless. I barely paid my bill, but it was a phyrric victory, for the next bill was more than twice the last due to interest.Thankfully, it was all a horrible nightmare, and I awoke to live it all again, trapped in an endless cycle of capitalist exploitation.

												Well.... Where do I start. When I got this game I didn't expect much at all. But I have to say this game is AMAZING. I have played through the first 2 hours and I am enjoying this game immensely so take this as a first impressions review!Story:I won't go into to much detail in the story because I don't like spoiling anything in most games. Mainly you are the daughter of an adventurer and have to run a store to pay off your fathers debts who has disappeared. I swear they make it more immersive in the actual game.Graphics:I thought this game was going to be some very crap anime bulls**** dating sim and I am very happy it isn't. The graphics (from the point of view of someone who has never seen anime in his life) are good. I like the style and the cutesey mood and style of this game can from what I have heard be deciveing... (I really don't know though I am only 2 hours in.)Gameplay: This game is a type of RPG game that has a different take on it. Instead of being an adenturer and killing monsters, you own a store to sell things to people and adventurers, later on in the game you gain the ability to hire an adventurer to go into a dungeon and fight monsters to get loot for you. (The cool thing is you get to play as the person you hire giving the game variety and letting you kill monsters) More things might be unlocked later and I can't wait!All in all this game is a refreshing breath to the RPG genre and allows you to take it from a different perspective. I recommend you pick up this game even in full price. I will update my review (If I remember to) When I finish the game! ",182,18,3,17,21,4,15

												This game too me a while to really master as I'm certainly not the best with my savings. However, what really helps is that when you are unable to pay a debt and have to start over, you get to keep your merchant level, adventures keep their levels, you keep the upgrades to the shop AND you get to keep all the items you didn't manage to sell, giving you the ability to bounceback much more!Not to mention the fusion ability is really helpful to gain some really expensive and unique items to sell to more effectively pay off that bill.The characters are a lot of fun with many interesting stories too going on around the place with many different and interesting mechanics going on too.  This is  alittle hidden gem that requires a lot more attention and I really love it! Capitalism, Ho!			",799,421,8,178,93,6,144

												So what is this game?  You run a shop to sell items.  You also go exploring and fighting in Dungeons to level up heros and find items to sell and craft with.  The game is a bit grindy, but the story was interesting enough, and even after one play-thru, I feel like I have yet to see half of the game.  Playing this feels like playing good old JRPG games, y'know, when they were fun and plentiful.I really did enjoy the humor in the game, and felt they translated it very well.  Recettear has a bit of a learning curve... but some good replayability to it also, from what I am seeing.  Twenty three hours in and finished Loop 3 as my first time win.  Would have won on Loop 2 but ended up being about 30k short...Anyways, the game is repetitive at times, but it always keeps you moving, so doesn't feel too bad.  The story in the game progresses in a linear mode, but seems you get additional story based on certain events/actions.  Reminds me a lot of older RPG's such as Chrono Trigger, where you may not see everything in one or two play-thru's and you need to search for those unlockables.Looking forward to continuing play and finding everything I missed.

												Good heaven's this is a great game! I beat it in 2 sittings because my 1st sitting went until 4AM and I realized that was no time to be awake! I love this game probably in my Top 10 games ever! great music, amazing writing, and the gameplay is phenominal! even the tutorial is nicly paced giving me some time to learn my new skill instead of piling on a ton of learning and wishing me Bon Boyage! only real complaint is that the game is too short... 2 sittings beat the main story but there's extra modes to overcome! also the dungeon crawling is a bit of a let down, don't get me wrong I love grabbing Louie and grabbing gear, but everyone but your 1st hero is abysmil, and only like 2 of the 6 dungeons are unlocked with in the space of the game, but the dungeon combat is fun and the bosses are challenging you have to use wit to defeat them...Tip: Buy high sell higher most items cost about 70% of their price and you can sell them for 130%... when an item becomes rare it goes for like 100% at market but in your store you can sell it for 275%-300%Great game I'm very liberal when I rate games but easy 10/10			",25,7,0,8,7,0,10

												Do you like capitalism? N-No...? O-Oh right...this is the internet...umm...Right. Do you like pedophilia? Yes? Good. Because there's a little girl with duct tape over her nipples and vag in this game. That's honestly really ♥♥♥♥ed up, I don't think you can change her clothes either. It becomes meaningless if you RP with a friend while playing, and using stupid♥♥♥♥♥voices, like from tankmen, but the loli♥♥♥♥♥♥will probably bother you like it bothered me.Aside from that, this♥♥♥♥♥♥is pretty cute and straight forward.

												 Well, Recettear is a pretty good game, among them independent ""doujin"" games! In fact, it's really something with a unique twist to the dungeon crawler genre; YOU RUN AN ITEM SHOP TO GET OUT OF DEBT! The main character is a little girl named ""Recette"", and her father had left her to go on adventures, but little did that idiotic father know that her LITTLE GIRL GOT IN DEBT! And now she has a fairy companion, Tear, to help her get items, on her adventures, where she goes to gain items! (Kinda interesting, huh?) I reccomend this game, for one reason; the sense of humor in it is ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS! I give this game a 4/5 rating, saying that this game is very unusual, but having to make an order is so frustrating, so I suggest doing it, when you can.			",64,17,0,13,2,0,9

												This is a simulation of a dystopian society where child exploitation happen.Your main character is a loli who apparently forced to enter a dark dungeon spanning from 5 floor down to 100 Floor or more to pay for your parents debt by a haughty debt collector fairy.The debt are hidden from you so you do not know the amount of the debt nor you know how many of the debt is real or a scam.Every week the fairy will force you to pay a sum of money or you will be kicked out of your only home left by your parents, and do not hope for government assistance because there is none.As a loli, you need make money and now as a player you will guide the loli how to make money effectively via capitalism.You will need to cheat and lie to customer to sell your item so you can have a roof.10/10 recommended for social studies ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing little game, what it attempts to do (be a shop-sim) it does brilliantly and with simplicity.The game slowly introduces you to the mechanics rather than dump all of it on top of you, which works wonderfully with the way the story is told.Biggest draw back is it won't last a great length of time, and replayability gets a bit repetitive.7 / 10			",160,101,2,51,17,1,11

												I had loads of fun with this game! Getting the hang of the mercantile and combat mechanics was a nifty, goofy ride, and the characters and dialogue are adorable. By the end of the main story, however, I found that the store aspect of the game becomes rather trivial (buy everything under the sun, sell for moderate profit at the first opportunity, rinse, repeat). I also found it too difficult to finish the side quests necessary to recruit some characters before the end of the limited time frame. Still, I happily recommend it with thumbs up!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Don't miss it if its on sale!Capitalism, Ho! It's a business management game coupled with dungeon crawling and boss fights. Challenge gets increased with time and dungeon maps are mostly randomed. You will get to the cute but funny storyline and be able to collect adventurers to hire as mercenaries through the game. This game has so many little complications and features packed in one. You are able to pimp your adventurers with gears of your choice. You are able to sell items at 200% their price. (The satisfaction!) You are able to go dungeon crawling to collect items to sell. (Hohoho, 100% profit!) You are able to fight bosses and get KO-ed (If you are noob). You are able to switch up the wallpapers and flooring of your shop to change its atmosphere.Cute characters involved. At some point, they will sound ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ though. (Makes it lighthearted~)Each villager who comes to your shop to buy items have their own individual budget that you need to note. Kinda makes the game more realistic if you ask me. You can't expect to sell a little girl a super highly priced item. All in all a pretty worthwhile game.			",59,49,1,13,7,1,10

												Great and addictive RPG reminiscent of old school classics. If I had to compare it to anything, I would call it the Rune Factory (Harvest Moon with Dungeon RPG elements) of entrepreneurship. Anyone who enjoys a mix of playing through dungeons with a number of different heroes, each with their own specialty of skills as they level and weapons they use, and taking charge of a store to barter the prices of items you sell with customers should feel right at home with this amazing game.

												Bro, it's a game where you run the item shop in a JRPG, and you get a nice little dungeon side game. You run around a multi-floor dungeon, battling enemies with Zelda ALttP-Style controls, opening chests for loot, and selling everything you get from the dungeons in your shop. Customers get quite annoying and the tutorials are extremely lengthy, but it's nothing you can't tolerate.The gameplay might not be everyone's cup of tea, so you might want to try this game out via some- other, more swashbuckling means- before you buy it.NOTEPIRATINGISBADBUYGAMESYOULIKEOKAY			",91,6,0,8,2,1,0

												Sure, you can go into dungeons, beat up some monsters and steal all their loot, but it's much more interesting to play the item shop owner who's supplying those brave adventurers.Mechanically it's an OK game.  The dungeon crawling portion is serviceable, but pretty much any dungeon crawler would be better.  The economics/shop aspect is interesting, and it claims depth through the customization options, but I had no trouble finishing the game largely ignoring anything beyond the basics.  It's a good way to kill some time without thinking to hard, but if you're looking for a complex game you'll find better options out there.			",426,255,9,53,29,6,59

												I had loads of fun with this game! Getting the hang of the mercantile and combat mechanics was a nifty, goofy ride, and the characters and dialogue are adorable. By the end of the main story, however, I found that the store aspect of the game becomes rather trivial (buy everything under the sun, sell for moderate profit at the first opportunity, rinse, repeat). I also found it too difficult to finish the side quests necessary to recruit some characters before the end of the limited time frame. Still, I happily recommend it with thumbs up!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great and addictive RPG reminiscent of old school classics. If I had to compare it to anything, I would call it the Rune Factory (Harvest Moon with Dungeon RPG elements) of entrepreneurship. Anyone who enjoys a mix of playing through dungeons with a number of different heroes, each with their own specialty of skills as they level and weapons they use, and taking charge of a store to barter the prices of items you sell with customers should feel right at home with this amazing game. (I put about 20+ hours into it in under 2 days!)			",240,50,3,36,8,5,33

 Don't miss it if its on sale!Capitalism, Ho! It's a business management game coupled with dungeon crawling and boss fights. Challenge gets increased with time and dungeon maps are mostly randomed. You will get to the cute but funny storyline and be able to collect adventurers to hire as mercenaries through the game. This game has so many little complications and features packed in one. You are able to pimp your adventurers with gears of your choice. You are able to sell items at 200% their price. (The satisfaction!) You are able to go dungeon crawling to collect items to sell. (Hohoho, 100% profit!) You are able to fight bosses and get KO-ed (If you are noob). You are able to switch up the wallpapers and flooring of your shop to change its atmosphere.Cute characters involved. At some point, they will sound ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ though. (Makes it lighthearted~)Each villager who comes to your shop to buy items have their own individual budget that you need to note. Kinda makes the game more realistic if you ask me. You can't expect to sell a little girl a super highly priced item. All in all a pretty worthwhile game.			",59,49,1,13,7,1,10

												Truly unique and excellent gaming experience.Recettear places you in charge of an item shop where you supply adventurers and other random NPC's. The shop management elements (from pricing to inventory to layout) are well thought out. But in addition to that there is the adventure. You can explore various dungeons along to find out a long forgotten secret as well as have fun with the various adventurers you have been equipping.The dungeon gameplay is simple action-RPG fare, but again very well balanced and a lot of fun. It is also one of the main sources of rarer commodities that you will be selling in your store.What might seem like a quick bit of casual fun will end up being a day long obsession. This game is highly addictive. :)			",819,362,29,169,76,7,147

												The game consists of fighting and earning treasures, then selling them in a store. It's half sim half dungeon crawler, it works  well together and it's fairly simple to get into.You don't need to put a huge amount into the game to have fun with it, but there's dozens of hours of gameplay to enjoy in a playthrough. The hardest part is making sure you manage your money well enough to pay your debts, or you get closed down.The game business world is just as harsh as the real life one :(			",100,15,0,46,3,0,21

												Recettear is an item shop management game that includes dungeon crawling, item fusions, and hero item management.  The ability to haggle with customers and handle their special requests (""I want a weapon!"") keeps things interesting but the UI, menus, and controls can be a hassle.  The anime style and irritating sound effects do get on my nerves, but I did have fun playing this game in short bursts.  I wish it was more open-ended, but you have strict repayment deadlines that you must keep or else you fail.  Not perfect, not terrible, fun, but not THAT fun.  Recommended if on sale.PROS+ You get to run your own item shop!+ Gathering items to sell and equip via dungeon crawling is fun+ Haggling with customers and handling special requests adds flavor+ Leveling up heroes and upgrading shop keeps things interesting+ Lots of items to collect, fuse, sell, and equip+ Storyline might be interesting to some (I thought it was silly)CONS- Japanese/Anime style may irritate some (girly giggles and constant whining come to mind)- Dungeon diving is very basic and combat is relatively shallow- Permanently equipping your heroes is a chore (they have to randomly buy item in store)- Lots of pointless dialogue including tons of EH's, UM's, OH's, !!!!'s, etc.- Relatively linear due to repayment deadlines and ongoing storyline- Clunky controls and confusing UI make it seem like a simple RPG Maker game			",66,27,0,28,30,0,16

Interior design elements, similar to animal crossing, and proper space management are the keys to your financial success on your way to pay off crippling debt! Hire friends/mercenaries to go into dungeons for you to gain stock and learn of their secrets...hah not really there's nothing that angsty in this game.Give it a go! Capitalism ho!

												I'm not sure what the appeal for this game is. I was looking forward to it so much after hearing all the hype and came away from it very dissatisfied with two half-baked systems that failed to engage me. The shopkeeping is fairly basic aside from a (simple but very fun, thought it was one of the best parts of the game) random price raising/decreasing. The combat is laughably simple. In addition, if you fail to meet your debt, you have to repeat the entire game. While normally I like the idea of devestating failstates in a game (really enjoying XCOM, for instance), I didn't really want to sludge through another bunch of hours of this crap. In addition, it feels like the game was designed for the player to fail once- unless you can beat the game on your first try, the only benefit that doing well on your first runthrough is that you end up wasting more time playing this game. The second try is almost trivial since you keep you entire inventory after the first failure.			",88,15,3,12,20,1,46

												I can't recommend this game, and I'm sad about that.The cast of characters is quirky and fun (after all, ""Capitalism, Ho!"" isn't a meme for no reason).  But that's all there is - after the second week or so, I began to realize that the mechanics lack depth and the dungeons are repetitive.  Here's the long bit:I have many tiny nitpicks, but the one that is the easiest to point out is that in a haggling game, you would expect ... well ... haggling.  But there are no counter-offers - not even clever dialogue hints as to what price they're willing to pay (that I was able to figure out, anyway).  Instead, they tell you exactly how to beat the game in the tutorial - 125% for selling, 50% for buying (plus or minus 5%).  High price items will be 3x the base cost.  Low price items are roughly 1/2 the base cost.  The Little Girl can't afford anything.  Knock 10% off for heroes.And it never varies - if a haggling game makes me want to just put price tags out since there's no actual haggling involved, then its done its job poorly.

												The best game I have ever played in twenty years of computer gaming, bar none (and I have played a LOT of games). Eight years on I can still recall how profoundly that game gripped me, and I am not an overly emotional person. You will care about the characters, you will be moved, you will make choices that tell you more about yourself. It sounds trite, I know, but it really is that good.

												The best game I have ever played in twenty years of computer gaming, bar none (and I have played a LOT of games). Eight years on I can still recall how profoundly that game gripped me, and I am not an overly emotional person. You will care about the characters, you will be moved, you will make choices that tell you more about yourself. It sounds trite, I know, but it really is that good.

												I'd recommend this game to teenagers and under. I think that adults would get bored of this game within a few hours.You play a girl who has to pay off her father's bank loan, by working in a store ( buy low, sell high ) and dungeon crawling for items, to sell in the store. The retail aspect is as uninteresting as working in a real life, retail store. The dungeon crawling is a basic hack 'n slash and reminded me of Zelda ( without the puzzles ) this aspect is fairly fun.I paid $5 for this on sale, which is OK. I'd rather have paid $2.50 for it though. Definitely not worth any higher than $5.			",150,37,1,25,12,0,43

												To call this game a pale shadow of Kamidori Alchemy Meister would be an insult to Kamidori Alchemy Meister's shadow.  While slightly entertaining to those who enjoy this type of game, it is deeply lacking in almost every aspect.  I would only recommend this to someone who is really interested after watching the trailers. Even then I would still say get Kamidori instead if you don't mind the sex scenes and know how to get the translation working on your computer.  Surprisingly bland gameplay.  Every aspect of the game I've seen is easily learnable with little to trip an intelligent player up.  I've played three dungeons, and beat the normal game in a single loop with about a million pix at the end.  I actually had to force myself to finish the game.  It was enjoyable for awhile, but the monotonous gameplay wares on you incredibly fast.  The dungeons are challenging, but not in an interesting way.  I am loathed right now to go and do more dungeons because it was so monotonous.  The dungeon bosses and enemies are all incredibly simple and each have a single trick involved in beating them which is almost immediately understandable as soon as you start playing.  They each have like two attacks which are stupidly easy to dodge.  The basic monsters aren't much better, they either throw projectiles, pop up in weird places, or monotonously jump in random directions.  The later dungeons did start to get challenging, but only because of the monster spam.  Item selling is probably the only area that this game excels over Kamidori in.  In Kamidori, you'd create items and just leave them in the shop to sell by themselves, in this game you actually haggle with customers to sell them items.  Theres a large array of gameplay mechanics behind it as well.  It does get old fast though.  In short, it's fun for a couple hours, then you just wanna be done with it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Conceptually very interesting, i won't deny they did a good job at making a management game revolving around JRPG characters in a JRPG world. Traditional to JRPG the story is going to be the most interesting part fo the game, unfortunately i'm downvoting because i found the game grindy and boring. I was constantly checking the marketplace only to be bored with zero encounters. The writing is silly cheesy fun, but can take forever and get on the nerves. The dungeons were painfully boring, dunno why they tried to shove an RPG into a perfectly good management game. Especially since the management itself isn't amazing, i feel like the game had a lot of interesting ways to innovate and explore. Instead EasyGameStation innovated a tiny bit, then all the dev power was put into the long dungeons enemies and loot art. I didn't come to reccettear wanting to play the dungeon crawly RPG elements, but i can tell that's where all the effort went, and it's the most boring part of the game. Though managing the shop is interesting and complicated I'd like a shop management sim with more refined features.			",190,54,2,26,18,0,22

												Crazily overhyped game that *should* only appeal to kids and ultra casual gamers. May be good way to teach kids how capitalism works. There is really no challenge in this game. The story is simple. The mechanics are bland. The gameplay is super repetative. I was recommended to play this game after loving Stardew Valley. What a difference. They don't even offer a video resolution above 1280x1080. How this game has 97% positive reviews is beyond me. It's the first game I ever got a refund on.			",390,91,23,35,36,2,58

This game makes my top 100.  You basically own a store and need to sell things to pay bills.  You go into dungeons and get mats for crafting and items to sell.  6/10 (no game is perfect).

												There's nothing blatantly wrong with this game. I bought it because I like simulators and I like RPGs. This seemed like a great mix of the two. I found myself rather bored with the characters but I wasn't expecting a deep plot to begin with. While in the shop and selling items to customers, the same generated no-named characters come up and ask to buy certain items. I was hoping the customers would be people you may know from in town and grow a relationship with over time.I also wished you could customize your shop but it stays exactly the same, along with your characters' dress. There just wasn't enough compelling content to keep playing.Try the demo before buying it.			",12,9,0,3,1,0,0

												A sweet little game on the facade, but pretty much unplayable without a spreadsheet open. By the time I had finished the game, I completely gave up on the RPG aspects and I had the numbers on the spreadsheet memorised. I also had a notebook open listing all the orders and the days on which to stock up items in my shop ... Essentially I was running an actual business. There's a few things to love and I genuinely enjoyed my experience, but when it comes right down to it, it's just not very fun for most people. Maybe if the spreadsheet was in-game and there wasn't a random NPC that breaks all your combos and you had more incentive to do the (surprisingly well-made) dungeon crawling, it'd be a great game, but as it stands now, it's just for the type to optimise numbers and people who love CAPITALISM (HO)!

												When i first tried the demo for this game i thought to myself i can really get into this so i picked it up during a sale happy with my purchase. However after putting in a few hours with this game there is a fundamental issue with the mechanics that ruin this game for me and force me to not recommend it.Now although its fun setting up your shop and adventuring in the dungeon for items to sell the game neglects to mention a major mechanic in the game that can actually make the game unplayable at times. The tutorial simply tells you that what you wanna do is buy items from people at 50% and sell for 130%. Fair enough and pretty straight forward. After a while however i started to notice that 130% was out of the question and even 120% would drive customers away. I would lower and lower the prices and still drive customers away at 90% and even 80% of the base cost. BUT THE TUTORIAL TOLD ME 130% WAS THE MAGIC NUMBER! I took to the internet to see what i was missing and what i discovered was the game fails to mention there are two invisible stats that drastically effect gameplay. Customer loyalty level and customer budget. Customers would come in trying to buy items they didnt even have the budget for no matter what price i set them at and then would leave mad which lowered their loyalty and budget even more. By week three the game was unplayable. Now i could probably easily start over fresh with new found information about how the budget and loyalty stats work but do i really wanna have to take notes while i play. keeping track of invisible stats the game never mentioned to me to make sure i didnt try to sell items my customers will never even be able to afford. Invisible stats ruine this game for me.			",84,63,1,48,29,4,59

												This game could be fun if the engine wasn't designed in a so unacceptably bad way.Every day I started this, the controls randomized themselves. One day O was my accept-button, one day it was square and one day it was triangle. (Using standard PS4 controller with DS4Windows which works flawlessly in all other games).Using the configuration tool that comes with the game does not help at all (it mixes up your controls even more and you end up accepting by pushing left etc). The max resolution is 1280x960. That may have been good in the year 2000, but it's 2016 now and this game really looks bad at 3440x1440. If you run it windowed you have to use third party software like ShiftWindow to force this thing into borderless mode. It won't take over your window-resolution but stay at 1280x960.There are many options in the config tool that let you downgrade the graphics to i386-niveau but nothing that actually lets you improve it. I think my graphics cards didn't even wake up from desktop mode while displaying this thing at it's max FPS of 60.All in all this game, albeit being a PC only release, feels like a super bad console port with Consolitis so strong, I'm surprised it doesn't infect my other games. Apart from the technical amagheddon that this thing (I'm not calling this game) represents, it can actually be fun. I will not go into those details as it's simply not worth playing for a PC gamer. I can write mods for Skyrim and fiddle with NWN 2 configs for days but I simply don't see why I should endure the unwillingness of devs to create a remotely playable game on the main game platform: the PC.1/10 - not even playable.

												The object of the game is to acquire a certain amount of money by the end of the game's month in order to pay your rent. What an exciting concept for a game!Money is earned through one of two ways, either going into a dungeon and killing things to get money and things to sell or by playing the shop-keeping minigame.  You buy supplies from other vendors and than try to sell them to random villagers.  This consists of sitting around and waiting for a customer to come into your shop and than haggling. Haggling for 20-30% higher seems to be the best so you just do this all day.   It's as braindead as it sounds.    It's as braindead as it sounds and the only real challenge is to avoid falling asleep.   Sit at the counter wait for an npc to walk up to you, set the haggle amount to the same value you always use and press the confirm key, repeat until credits roll. The good news is it's pretty much impossible to lose doing this so your boredem ends quickly. There's only about 5 different looking shoppers that come in and each only has about 2-3 lines, being stuck in the same room with the same npcs is nausiating.  I should mention that this is the core of the game.  The dungeon crawling stuff is better buy actually getting to it is hidden behind annoying crap where you need to talk to some random npc after doing some obscure task on a certain day in order to even unlock the ability to go into them.  There are several characters to play as in these sections and they all require a different find the npc puzzle to get. In addition each dungeon must be unlocked by yet more tedioum.  The dungeons themself are short, offering nothing interesting, with boring enemy design and gets repative really fast. The quality of the dungeons and combat is comparable to freeware flash games. Since the object isn't to clear the dungeon but to grind everything feels unrewarding and tedious.  You'll probably want to do this rather than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shopkeep mini game but gives less money for a higher risk and requires you to spend half the game talking to npcs to unlock dungeons. This isn't a serious game and has no bussiness charging $20 or even $2 for what is essentially a flash game.  The only people that like this are♥♥♥♥♥♥eating weebus that have no standards and will play anything with an underage anime girl.			",114,11,1,10,0,0,1

												Gomenasai, my name is Ken-Sama.I’m a 27 year old American Otaku (Anime fan for you gaijins). I draw Anime and Manga on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior Japanese games. (Disgaea, Final Fantasy, Persona series)I train with my Katana every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my sword license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.I speak Japanese fluently, both Kanji and the Osaka dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Japanese history and their bushido code, which I follow 100%When I get my Japanese visa, I am moving to Tokyo to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Studio Ghibli or a game designer!I own several kimonos, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to Japan, so I can fit in easier. I bow to my elders and seniors and speak Japanese as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.﻿			",181,30,0,25,11,3,22

												Dungeon crawler plus shopkeeperYou own a shop and must make enough income to pay the rent. You can buy items and sell them for more or you can search for items in a dungeon. When you open your shop for the day you have to barter the right price for the type of person.I completed the dungeons in a couple of hours then the game got boring.Great ideas but lacks game length.

												For starters, I do not think this is a bad game, but it is definately frustrating. If you are not a patient player, you will hate this game. First thing I should point out is that you will be micro managing every single transaction, if I knew that I would never have bought the game.A lot is lost in translation from japanese to english. There is no instruction on which keys to press, you have to figure that out on your own. I have learned that button 1 is ""z"" and button 2 is ""x"", I have not been able to determine button 3. The entire game revovles around item value, but does not let you organize items by value. On top of the lacking features is a convoluted tutorial on gameplay and mechanics that is 90% useless banter trying to be cute and entertaining.The dungeon runs are repetitive, and you'll find yourself spending more time back tracking to areas you have cleared to kill a single enemy that has respawned, just to get halfway back to see that it has popped up again on the minimap(then repeat 4 times).Then there are the transactions, which are also repetitive. Shortly into the game they will throw in people trying to sell you items, which would be fine, if you knew they trying to sell it. I can't tell you how much money I've lost buying items that I thought I was selling.Bottom line, although I mildly enjoy this game, I just cannot recommend it.			",79,8,0,7,6,0,7

												""You called it selfish and cruel that men should trade value for value - you have now established an unselfish society where they trade extortion for extortion. Your system is a legal civil war, where men gang up on one another and struggle for possession of the law, which they use as a club over rivals, till another gang wrests it from their clutch and clubs them with it in their turn, all of them clamoring protestations of service to an unnamed public's unspecified good. You had said that you saw no difference between economic power and political power, between the power of money and the power of guns - no difference between reward and punishment, between purchase and plunder, between pleasure and fear, between life and death. You are learning the difference now."" - John Galt			",1056,412,51,127,132,12,182

												I had really been looking forward to this game... but after completing it, I'm sorry to say that I cannot recommend Recettear. You expect there to be more when really the game is pretty shallow.The Ragnarok Online-ish graphics got me hooked at the start and I liked the no-nonsense dungeon crawling and the shop aspect.. but there's just not enough here to keep you engaged. Or if there is, the game is not organized in such a way that you can enjoy it without a guide.First of all, the dungeon crawling gets really repetitive. Fighting doesn't require you to be clever, because you're OP all of the time. After you unlock your fourth and final skill on a character.. you switch to a new one because they just get stale.Worse, dungeon crawling is actually detrimental to your progress, because you rarely find items worth the hassle, but you lose 2 units of ingame time that you could have spent selling stuff in your shop.The shop system's got a tutorial that makes you haggle with your customers, although suggesting a price they'll like is the only way to get combo bonuses for selling, which are more useful than the extra buck from high sales prices.I also found it very, very difficult to survive the debt cycle (someone in the comments even asked ""So did anyone survive the first round?""). When you can't pay back your debt on time, it's not a complete gameover, but you start again from the beginning, only you keep the items you have in stock and your merchant level (that gives you access to more stuff on the market + other stuff that helps). The second time around is too easy. I finished the last ingame week doing nothing but killing time and still had 1 million pix when I payed off the final debt of 500k. This should be more balanced.The crafting system is a nice addition, but suffers from a lack of menu integration. You literally have to write stuff down you want to hunt for in the dungeons. Would have been much nicer to be able to pull up a menu and see ""Aha. I need 2 more pieces of X to make Y."" That's why I ended up using it just to make stuff I had randomly collected the ingredients for. It's very inconvenient.Sure, I could have played it smarter and looked into a guide to make lots more money by crafting. But honestly? When hunting for the items isn't fun.. why would anyone bother?All in all, I don't really want to drop a huge pile of dung on this game. It has its enjoyable aspects, but as it is, I just don't think it'll be fun for you. That's why I'm not recommending it. If you like, you can play the demo. But don't expect much more than the content you see there.			",122,34,1,16,5,1,7

												Schmooley Benjamin Kippelfinkelburg ben Shekelstein was not a proper Jew, and could not fulfill the role of his ancestors in serving as a source of legal credit for French nobles and royals seeking to fund their personal ventures via circumvention of Church authority.Amassing significant debts on his (loaned) property after the subprime mortgage bubble bursted in 1599, and lacking even basic skills in the trade of counting shekels, he set out to make his fortune, only to die somewhere in the mountains offscreen, leaving his only daughter, Recette-Anne Frank Shekel Israel Lemongrass ben Shekelstein, to inherit responsibility for virtually all of his debts. The rabbi of the city's quarter, Isaac Schlomo Goldstein Shekelburg ben Levi Abraham Cohen, on behalf of the Goyim and with the help of the cult of Satan and the blood of seven gentile children, then invokes the Kabbalistic Sephirot to summon a Jew fairy, of whom is promptly dispatched to Recette, both to collect the outstanding debts according to a strict timetable, and to teach her the art of counting shekels, stowing gold bricks under the floorboards (and in the walls), acquiring the role of an extremely convenient scapegoat, and shortchanging customers like a proper Le Happy Venetian Merchant. Loli Jew Recette learns to contradict basic merchant guild regulations in 17th-century France, engages in the unholy act of ritual blood libel during Passover, exploits her incompetent Swiss mercenaries by paying them to risk their lives picking up valuable consumer goods in the dangerous wilds (and then reselling said items to those same people at a profit), and invents the free market and 9/11 in the process. You'll have hours of fun wondering where in your house you hid all those millions of shekels (called ""pix"" in the English translation) prior to the game's start, as well as by selling candy to the goyim girls and that one Irish elf for the equivalent of a small fortune. If you can't make your payments on time, however, the rabbi will charge you a pound of your own flesh per shekel as collateral, effectively making your life forfeit if you fail to live up to proper Mosaic community standards of personal and fiscal responsibility within the quarter.9/10 shekels plus one pound of flesh/10.

												I picked up this game at some point in the past based on what I saw of it.  But when I launched it, I was in for a big surprise.  The game comes up as a window, with no option to be fullscreen.  It very handily (and I mean that sarcastically) offers 3 oldschool menu options, and a nice title screen.  Only there's no way to tell what the keybinds are, and you're going to need them because the ♥♥♥♥ing mouse doesn't work.Under Display (Menu option V?), I'm offered some meager choices that let me increase the display size by percentages.  Yeah, that helps, just increase everything in 50% increments.  Who needs display resolution when you've got this?  The ""Help"" option very helpfully told me what version this game is.  I don't know about you, but when I think about needing help with a game, I secretly just want to know what version it is.As far as the rest of the game goes, I'm not sure. With the controls being the utter ♥♥♥♥♥how that they are, I'm not going to waste more of my time.Maybe it's better with a controller.Steam is asking me if I recommend this game.  Since I don't see a ""♥♥♥♥ NO"" option, I'm just going to choose no.			",280,42,0,57,33,0,51

												NO SPOILERSI don't understand how this game got such overwhelming positive reviews. The game mechanics are horrible, trash infact. The game developers had a great idea or concept for a item shop game but the systems and implementations are utter garbage. The story made me genuinely laugh out loud at times, but I would have rather watched the story unfold like an anime tv show then play this game, in fact I ended up going to youtube just to see how it ends. Without going into details, the story is your usual young-teen-hero-anime show story with some fourth-wall breaking stuff about video games. However, the story is not good enough for me to want to continue to play the game just for it. The mechanics are so clunky, repetitive, and downright head scratching it makes me wonder why I bothered to put in 12 hours. I think I did only because of the overwhelming positive numbers making believe that this must be one of the best games ever...however it is far from even being an average title and I do not recommend this game at all.

												This game is a cute, clever idea. That's it. Everything else about it is, well, to put it gently, not good. I get the feeling it would play better on a moblie gaming device like a PS Vita or 3DS, but as a PC game it flops. Yes, I can re-map the controls, but the menu system just doesn't work with any configuration on the keyboard. Or at least any I've tried. I just... can't play the game to get a better feel for it. I lasted 84 minutes, but a lot of that was spent in the tutorial and in cutscenes. Actual gameplay time I got through was about 30 minutes. And then I just had to stop. It it a point in it's favor that it's not an expensive bad game, but that still doesn't completely absolve it of it's faults. It would've been okay if it was at least funny-bad, but no. This game if frustratingly bad.			",14,1,0,8,4,0,0

												I like the idea, i like the atmosphere.But the way the... campaign is done is just no fun.Ignore all orders.They will just take up time and when the items are less worth at the day the order is to be sold (wich happens randomly) you are tough out of luck and have lost money AND time you could have served another customer wich means you have lost the possibillity for two sales all in all. Never buy from the guild. Get ready to grind, grind, grind, grind, GRIIIIND your local dungeons. You can hire several heroes to find items in those dungeons. Except you never use anyone else but the hero you started with because by the time you meet others that hero is level 28 and up because of all the grinding.Only put out your most expensive wares. You can't really... ""roleplay"" if you will, a balanced shopkeep who wants to serve all kinds of customers. If you don't put out and sell your most expensive♥♥♥♥♥♥you are ♥♥♥♥ed and can start all over. On top of that you need luck, luck to get the right items, luck to guess the prize right and the right adjustments wich can just be all ove the place when dealing with customers.  The crafting system is also rather useless because of these elements of luck. I am 12 hours or something in and not once have i had any of the necessary items in the neceessary amount to craft a new item. It also would probablybe a waste of time and ressources because you CAN NOT AFFORD to play around with any of these two.You need to put out♥♥♥♥♥♥(wares) and get in money.After you have lost once you will realise that you need to keep the pressure going. The pacing just leaves no room for any elements that would be fun. And this is why i stopped, because i realized five days before the 200.00 bucks payment that i am not going to make it unless i grind the boring dungeons like a madman and ignore all the fun bits.This is what ultiumately kills the fun in having your own Fantasy RPG Item Shop. No one wants the grind from the joblife in his free time.			",272,75,3,37,14,1,18

												I normally really like shopkeeper games but this is not much more than a visual novel. Adventuring is a repetitive hack-n-slash, though I enjoyed the bosses. Selling things is also repetitive: you haggle the price up a bit and that's all there is to it. Those are the only gameplay elements. The rest is going to locations in town to trigger dialogue with NPCs. There's no managing costs, hiring workers, or anything else you'd expect from running an item store.			",174,43,0,47,24,0,33

Posted: January 9, 2015
												Before I start, I actually have about 6+ extra hours on it already, having played this game previously on my girlfriend's computer, so my current time on time spent playing this game isn't exactly accurate. I have to say I love this game personally. It's cute, fun, and addictive. It's probably my favorite that I have in my steam library right now. That being said, this is one of those situations where I wish steam had a ""meh"" button instead of simply recommending or not recommending a game. So here's the way the game works. (only game mechanics, no story-spoilers) The item shop gameplay is pretty simple. Buy low, sell high, try to make enough to pay off your debt each week. You're restricted on the amount of actions you can do each day. This whole part of the game plays like one of those in-browser flash games. That isn't exactly a bad thing as a whole. The art style is pleasing to look at enough to keep you playing and the game still feels rewarding when you actually figure out how it works. As the game adds more and more to the way the game works, it becomes much more interesting and challenging to play.There's a kind of dungeon-crawling mode in which you can use to find new items to sell, and I'm betting this is where players really spend 80% of their time. Some commenters say it's too easy, but I disagree. It took me five failed attempts to escape from the first, easiest set of dungeons. You can only escape on certain floors, if you 'die' you can only bring one of your treasures back with you, and the monsters that spawn are very annoying. All of this creates incredibly difficult combat for such a pleasant game. Honestly I love that as well. The maps, simple enemies, and very simple combat system remind me of a top-down version of Dark Cloud. The dungeons are painful to get through, but it's  also nice to see a game that occassioanally throws sand in your eyes, instead of easing up. It's something I'd expect from a 10-20 year old combat game, rather than a modern seemingly-casual capitalism sim. It's still fair and I can't bring myself to blame the game for my failures in the dungeons. Now for the negatives. Once again, the combat is very basic, your enemies are very basic, and well even the shop management is simpler than it could've been. I think that do it well, but it does leave you wanting a bit more. A huge issue I have with this game is the translation company, and I originally intended to avoid buying this game for myself at all. First, the translations are just awful at some points. Maybe I'm just too aware of linguistic issues to overlook it, but there are *so many* moments where the word choices just scream ""look at my creative translation, isn't it cool?"", when many other translations would've fit better. The point of the translation is to draw attention away from the language use, to forget that the material even came from another language in the first place so you can focus on the story, but when they use obscure words like ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; or made-up words like ""yayifications"", you're no longer experiencing the story of Recette but having it told to you through an amateur translator. It's really difficult not to get immediately pulled out of the immersion in the story. There's at least one positive aspect of the translations, in that however distracting their translations may be, at least it does fit the characters' personalities. Still, such a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥job makes you struggle to maintain your investment in what's happening in the story.The second issue is that Carpe Fulgur (the company that translated this into English) has a reputation of changing parts of the story in the translation. The idea of a localization is to best adapt the game to the target region, but the changes they make seem to concern things that have no real legal or social ramifications in the first place. The fact that these changes are unstated makes me lack trust in a faithful, in-tact representation of the game's story and dialogue. This is why I was content to avoid giving them any of my money. I only bought it myself for two reasons. 1: It was on sale.2: I'm learning Japanese so I might as well practice using this game on my own computer. I don't really plan to run it in the English version at all.To sum it all up+addictive, fun+challenging yet simple and fair-shoddy translations work-questionable business practices of the distributor, thus untrusting that the game was localized as intended.If it sounds like fun, more power to you. But the negatives, at least in principle, are enough for me to warrant a downvote. At least until Steam adds a ""meh"" button.			",18,7,0,2,4,0,0

												The game is fine but beware: Carpe Fulgur, the translation team behind this game, has been known to make unnecessary changes and edits to the games they translate much like Commie Subs or 4kidz used to do. They do this because the game conflicts with their sensibilities or their particular world view so I would not recommend you support these devs as they censor the games and stray from the source material especially when dialog or scenarios conflict with their extreme-progressive ideologies.Just something to consider about the quality of the English version’s writing that is important and I didn’t see mentioned before.

												Based on good reviews in PC Gamer, I bought Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale on sale and gave it a go. Although I am charmed by the idea of an RPG from the perspective of the shopkeepers in town, I find this game to be a poor experience. Managing your shop is awkward and tedious. Walking about town to get stuff for your shop is tedious and artificially slow. Bartering with your shop customers is a repetitive exercise. Adventuring in the dungeon to get stuff for your shop features laughable, simplistic gameplay mechanics.And the cutscenes... oh the cutscenes. They go on forever, padded with juvenile humor. You can't mash the button fast enough to get through them. I really wanted, and expected, to like Recettear more than I do, but I'm just not feeling it. I suggest finding a gameplay video before purchasing Recettear.			",168,52,2,18,21,2,22

												The game does present itself correctly...you run an item shop.I suppose when I saw the game and some of the features it looked like it had Action-RPG elements that seemed more fulfilling than I thought it would be, so after playing for a while the game took a disappointing turn quickly.You play a very rudimentary High/Low bartering game that gets choresome and repetitive quickly, and occasionally delve into a ""dungeon"" for a few floors taking control of a hired mercenary with a primitive top-down action system...whose game you'd rather be playing if it weren't for uninspired dungeon floors, poor collision hit boxes and the slow grind for random item drops as you look for each floor's exit.There's very little sense of direct advancement, and a desperate disconnect between the gameplay modes with a very shallow playspace in each that leaves you feeling like you are stuck between a watered down simulation game and a watered down secret of mana with no will, motivation or desire to continue in each.The art, however, is fantastic and deserves to be commended...though the story acts that draw out the monotony between segments and the horrid anime whinings leave much to be desired and drag the game to a slogging crawl filled with ear-piercing howls.I do not reccomend this game, it suggests a broader, grander experience than it eventually delivers which tricked me...don't let it do the same to you.

Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale is probably the cutest worst game there is. Ill-conceived better covers it: you play half the game as a top-down dungeon crawler and the other half as manager to the eponymous item shop, with neither halves being properly implemented in the first place. I get the feeling that the developers, EasyGameStation, had very ambitious ideas for the concept of ""Item Merchant Game"" except that they've botched everything until what they made barely resembles a game anymore! I'll explain...You are Recette, spunky little girl entrepreneur required by the faerie bond collection agency to raise enough money to repay her father's exorbitant adventuring debt. For this task you have your house located smack dab in the middle of RPG City, which you've converted into an Item Shop for the convenience of all. Sell items to the roaming adventurers, make a profit, repay your debt; simple enough, right? It all goes to pot with the whole bargaining system and the complete lack of player feedback other than win/fail.Before that, an egregious crime in game development: having the tutorial LIE to you. When faerie sidekick Tear tells you that selling at around 121% of base price is a conservative strategy, she is flat out LYING to you. This is far above what many villagers can afford and will not increase important customer loyalty. This is especially villainous considering there is no other way than trial-and-error to determine a customer's comfort range.The process of selling and bargaining for optimal profits and customer loyalty is stupid and punishes experimentation. Any experimentation in bargaining reduces important customer loyalty which reduces the overall money pool they're willing to invest in your products. Worse, it's all so incredibly MOOT!!! When you buy goods from the guild merchant, he sells it to you marked down from base price. Therefore if you sell those goods at base price, you make a (small) profit. Base price is a perfectly good baseline for most customers and you can repay your debts out of this practice! Otherwise, use a strategy guide to know optimal salesmanship builds as there's no rhyme or reason to the whole process!Dungeon crawling is the second half of the game and although mostly innocuous, doesn't introduce any elements anyone would deem ""fun"". You hire an adventurer from the pool of friends you've made and go down randomly generated levels, looking out for monsters and treasures until you discover the exit. Inventory space (bag space) becomes the most annoying aspect as you're stretched between saving space for treasures at the expense of bringing food, rings and adventuring gear. Because the adventurers don't bring their own gear with them; no, that would be too simple! You have to sell them the stuff from your store, except you have no control over what they ask for and you can't ""suggest"" goods either. Egregious crime in gaming #2!All that said, the Main Story is fun enough. You have likeable characters, humorous dialogue... You really can't fault the English publishing company Carpe Fulgur for anything. It's New Game + that becomes a pain because the challenge comes from grinding for rare items (in multiples, for completion of the Fusion Recipes) and the fact that the dungeons are just longer with cheaper boss fights. Oh, did I mention that you can't save inside of a dungeon? There's really nothing to gain from the New Game + experience except an increase in frustration and maybe two characters. I put a point in saying maybe because if you do unlock the final character, you've already defeated all the monsters and bosses the game has to throw at you. That's bad pacing right there.The main problem with Recettear is that the item shop game, billed as its selling point, just doesn't work. It fails from lack of options for the player, lack of interface telling the player what he's doing right and wrong and arbitrary levels of contentment amongst the customers. It's not hard, far from it! It's that there's no gaming elements related to the experience. Recettear might as well be a visual novel with a dungeon crawler tacked on to it. It's cute and endearing but it fails at being a game to begin with. And I'm the idiot who gifted this product to so many of my friends. Just enormous waves of regret all around, don't be like me and get suckered in by a cute exterior...PS: I really wished that there were more ""Adventurer"" customers and less normal looking villagers, so you could really make this game about an ITEM SHOP SET IN AN RPG WORLD. As it is, you're really more of a goods store selling general products and knickknacks.			",62,3,0,4,1,2,13

												Receattear has you play as a young chick fending for herself with a massive debt to pay off.And no, she doesn't pay it off that way. She runs a local store!This game is super fun and *incredibly* addictive. When I started playing this, when I was off work ill, I played it non-stop, and actually dreamed about it for a bit. It gets into your brain.The mechanics, however, are quite repeatative, and the process of acquiring items for your store is very tedious. The story, though, is charming and enjoyable (if you like JRPG sorts of games, you will appreciate it).My main criticism is that after 10 hours of play, I failed the game at the last hurdle, after being asked to complete *an impossible challenge* (I think it is anyway). The only way I can deduce to complete the game is to play it *twice*, and fail the first time. You prepare tonnes of items in the first play, really good stuff, and sell large the second run through.This, to me, is incredibly annoying game design, and is the reason I have not completed, as I refuse to put myself through another playthrough. For this reason, I'd avoid it, but if you can put up with that, then go ahead!Nilesy			",313,139,3,47,47,5,46

												Incredibly boring. The store feature is fun, but repetitive. Going on an ""adventure"" is AWFUL. It's the same thing over and over again... Mash button to kill mob.  Go to next floor. Mash button.   Seriously, the fighting is terrible. And, if you're any good at money/over pricing items... you can buy top tier items easily, and crush any mob you meet. Would not recommend.

												I've logged 7 hours only and that's enought for me. At a price of about €4 I'm okay with that. The game is heavy on the repetitive, fun dialogue, simple mechanics and grinding in the dungeon. How many blue blobbs do I have to kill to get further? The game has more style than depth to its mechanics. I'm sure I could have stayed and learnt more of the game, although I'm satisfied as it is.			",22,7,0,11,3,0,5

												Cute, funny, lovable, endearing, right up until you realise they basically stopped making the game at one point and released it before they could really expand on the ideas of running an item shop. They wont release the code for people to mod the game, and do their job for them. If you play it, expect to be disappointed when the road suddenly stops, and you're in the middle of a desert.

												Kawaii but shallow. It has a nice premise but doesn't go the distance to make it really work. You run an item shop on typical jRPG world, managing cost, stock and all. Unfortunately the best way to acquire itens is to support adventurers on their quest which is a contrived way they justified you having to play as them on a poorly constructed aRPG mini-game that'll amount to 30% to 50% of your gameplay. Had they focused on the storekeeping, worked on new mechanics and more customization for your shop than I'd give this a postive recommendation. Also your mileage might vary on the ultra cute japanese thing.			",463,237,16,78,53,5,84

												It starts out fun but is ultimately empty and shallow. The dungeon crawling is very rudimentary and tedious, while the shop-owning ... While it is an interesting gimmick, to be the OWNER of an RPG shop for once, it quickly wears out its welcome once you realise that you are repeating the same automatic actions OVER and OVER again with gradually more expensive items. A cosmetic difference that fails to mask the shortage of truly interesting stuff the game has to offer.			",155,62,4,18,32,3,40

												The story and art of the game is decent, but the game's underlying repetitive and counter-intuitive mechanics are ultimately unsatisfying. You might expect that in running an item shop your goal might be to buy low and sell high. However, this is only a minor element. The item shop gameplay is about learning the X % amount above the item price each customer will pay. This is in order to get a continuous ""combo"" of sales. Try too hard to make a profit on one item by forgetting that the “Girl” customer magic number is 115% of the sale price and you are punished - the combo is broken. ""Capitalism Ho!"" – Definitely not. These factors are compounded by the fact that if one does not quickly embrace the combo style of play (all about remembering X % amount for each customer) it’s likely you will have to repeat the game to complete it. The real kicker is you may not realise that you have to begin again until you have played through several futile and dull days. Ultimately, the playing experience was unsatisfying and unrewarding.

												Recettear is a game that should be fun. You run an item shop, you quest for new items, and sell those items to people. Along the way you make friends and a pile of money. Simple enough to grasp, or so I thought. This game is so needlessly filled with dialog that it takes away from the fun. I'm all for a tutorial or a few helpful hints, but after 40 minutes of playing I hadn't even opened my shop for the first day yet. All I was doing was reading dialog AND not good dialog. It's not like there is a story line that will keep you on the edge of you seat. You are a young and very ditzy girl who is partnered up with a loanshark fairy. The fairy tells you everything you need to know to run a shop. She tells you, then you repeat it back to her and make a ditzy joke to go along with it, then she reiterates, and you make another ditzy joke. This goes on for far too long. The cyclical dialoge continues to ruin the game throughout. EXAMPLE: Fairy: ""To get out of item select, press the B button.""  Girl: ""But I don't have a B button. Does that mean I'll never get out of item select? tehehehehehehe.""  Fairy: ""No, you will be fine, just remember to get out of item select, press the B button.""  Girl: ""OKAY! But if I find a B button I think I wouldn't know what to do. tehehehehehe. But you're the boss I guess. tehehehehehehe.""Once you get through the 40 or 60 minutes of dialoge you get to actually play the game. This game is about questing for stuff. You play as another person, not the ditzy girl, and go to dungeons for loot. Then the girl you're playing takes all the stuff the other person you were playing worked so hard to get and puts it in her shop to sell for profit. Combat is a slight choir as you and monsters can move 360 degrees, but you can only attack in Up/Down/Left/Right direction. This means to attack something you have to line up to it, then move to attack, and then attack. It feels like it's been ripped straight off a Nintendo 64 title, and makes the combat more choir-ful than fun. All that being said, if you skip every bit of dialoge, and don't mind old-school controls, there is a little bit of fun to be had here. However, I in good conscious can not recommend this game to any of my friends.			",386,137,2,93,46,4,74

												This game can be fun. I was addicted for quite some time; however, the point of the game is to repay a debt your father left you with. Each payment period is 5 days, and at the end of the 5th day, payment is due. The amount you owe increases after every period, which is why I would NOT recommend this game. The increase is ridiculous; it is incredibly difficult to meet the quota, and you WILL GET A GAME OVER many times.  I normally enjoy these games, but the quota ruined it for me.

												Very disappointing. There's no read voice work or animations for cut scene, instead a “visual novel” ascetic is used. But, the thing that breaks this game is that failing a dungeon looses you all (but one) the items you found in the dungeon, the entry fee, plus 2 sections of time. Given that the dungeon fighting mechanic isn't that fun to begin with, it makes this game excruciating. Sorry, EasyGameStation, I am not going to run this same dungeon again, it's not fun.

												You can't save mid-dungeon, and it's very unforgiving. If you're looking to play the game how you want, maybe buy and sell, you can't. You have to dungeon crawl. Every day. The combat is fun, but the range on the adventurer's weapons isn't what you think it is, and the enemies are larger than their sprites appear to be. The first adventurer you get is very slow, too. Time your swings well. If you die you lose all the items you collected and even brought with you, save one.Running the shop would be fun, but customers have a set price range in mind (it differes depending on their sprites) and if you get it right on or close to what they want you get a bonus. If you get it wrong they're likely to walk out and you only get so many sales a day.Don't even think about selling expensive items early on either. No one will be able to afford them. They'll just get angry with you and waste a customer spot.I'm sure the game gets fun further on, but I haven't been able to earn enough money to make the first week. Nor have I beaten the first boss. Not for lack of trying, I've restarted four times.It seems like a casual game. It's not.Oh, and use a gamepad. Keyboard controls are awful.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't buy this game. If it is offered for free, ignore it. It’s a meaningless dungeon crawler with annoying characters, a setting that fails to impress, and broken controls.PREMISES AND PROMISESBeing a fan and veteran of RPG-style games, I got excited when I read about this game. Instead of playing a hero, collecting loot and experience, you are a shop owner said hero would encounter on his travels! Very original.You play Recette , a girl who is left with the family shop after her dad suddenly leaves. He leaves a heavy debt too, and if not paid off, Recette will lose the shop and probably end up under a bridge in a box. She gets help from a fairy named Tear, who wants to see the debt being paid off because it is her company’s money. She is basically this game’s tutorial/faq.So, how does this all play out? Read on…TIME FLIES WHEN YOU'RE HAVING FUN… AND ALSO, WHEN YOU'RE NOTThe shop you run can sell weapons, equipment, potions, and sometimes more esoteric stuff. It attracts villagers and heroes both, and keeping them happy is the goal. Well, not the ultimate goal, but if your customers aren’t happy, they’re not likely to return and buy more.You can make your store more attractive by decorating, and can eventually make your own items when you get certain recipes.Before you can sell items, you need to buy them yourself from other shops, or you can join a hero on his/her travels in a dungeon and keep the loot that he/she finds (for a price). Then you have to place the item(s) in your shop, open your shop, and wait for customers to come by.There is a reason why I listed all these actions separately: everything you do in this game takes up time. As you have a limited amount each day, you need to know in advance what you want to do that day.This time limit forces the player to focus only on the goal of getting enough money to close the current chapter (with more money needed every following chapter). You don’t have time to take it easy: every part of the day must eventually lead to an increase of your cashflow.Unfortunately, this creates rather frustrating situations. For example, you want some good-selling items, as the deadline for the current chapter is coming up, but cannot buy them from a dealer (not in stock, or too expensive). So you venture into a dungeon, slay enemies, and hope for good drops.If you’re unlucky, you will only get bad or cheap items. So, you lost time for that day with little or no advantage. Now you need to get lucky in the store while selling the items and hope to haggle in such a way that you gain at least enough money to cover the costs for visiting the dungeon.This counts more towards having a customer wanting a specific item: he places an order, and you need to get it before he returns. Guess what happens if the item simply won’t drop, or can’t be found somewhere else!You cannot do anything about this “luck” factor, or plan ahead or around it. This gets increasingly annoying throughout the game, as you start to feel the game is deliberately taunting you. Speaking of annoyances…WHERE IS THE MUTE BUTTON? OR RATHER, ANY BUTTON THAT WORKSRecette is an non-assertive girl, has no confidence in her abilities and doubts herself every time something bad happens. This translates to annoying remarks, especially during haggling. For example, a customer comes in and wants to sell you an item you don’t want. The only way to not buy the item is to bid a very low price, have the customer disagree, and leave. Recette will always say something along the lines of “I have no talent” or “Can I really do this?”.It undermines the action and result of the player’s choice, and I got increasingly agitated with it.When dungeneering (not a word, get with it), Recette cannot stop asking the hero if he’s all right after he gets hit. Every single time. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Why is this necessary? Why does she need to ask?And boy, are you going to hear it often. The controls in the dungeon feel stiff, and despite seeing your hero hit an enemy, more often than not you will miss the creature, and get hit by it instead. Some enemies have such erratic patterns that it is almost impossible to predict their actions. Some enemies shoot fireballs that track the hero wherever he is, and will almost always result in a hit. Enough hits, and the hero gets incapacitated, you lose the items you collected so far, and you lose the time without getting anything in return.CONCLUSION: A BROKEN PROMISE, NO CASH RETURNSRecettear is a broken promise, like finding a shiny, round object on the beach the size of a high value coin, but discover it to be a worthless bottlecap.Too bad Steam won’t take it back, and now it just sits in my game-list, uninstalled, a constant reminder that an original story combined with a favorite game genre doesn’t automatically make for a good game.Gameplay 4/10The original setting fails because of its poor execution.

												Don't buy this game. If it is offered for free, ignore it. It’s a meaningless dungeon crawler with annoying characters, a setting that fails to impress, and broken controls.PREMISES AND PROMISESBeing a fan and veteran of RPG-style games, I got excited when I read about this game. Instead of playing a hero, collecting loot and experience, you are a shop owner said hero would encounter on his travels! Very original.You play Recette , a girl who is left with the family shop after her dad suddenly leaves. He leaves a heavy debt too, and if not paid off, Recette will lose the shop and probably end up under a bridge in a box. She gets help from a fairy named Tear, who wants to see the debt being paid off because it is her company’s money. She is basically this game’s tutorial/faq.So, how does this all play out? Read on…TIME FLIES WHEN YOU'RE HAVING FUN… AND ALSO, WHEN YOU'RE NOTThe shop you run can sell weapons, equipment, potions, and sometimes more esoteric stuff. It attracts villagers and heroes both, and keeping them happy is the goal. Well, not the ultimate goal, but if your customers aren’t happy, they’re not likely to return and buy more.You can make your store more attractive by decorating, and can eventually make your own items when you get certain recipes.Before you can sell items, you need to buy them yourself from other shops, or you can join a hero on his/her travels in a dungeon and keep the loot that he/she finds (for a price). Then you have to place the item(s) in your shop, open your shop, and wait for customers to come by.There is a reason why I listed all these actions separately: everything you do in this game takes up time. As you have a limited amount each day, you need to know in advance what you want to do that day.This time limit forces the player to focus only on the goal of getting enough money to close the current chapter (with more money needed every following chapter). You don’t have time to take it easy: every part of the day must eventually lead to an increase of your cashflow.Unfortunately, this creates rather frustrating situations. For example, you want some good-selling items, as the deadline for the current chapter is coming up, but cannot buy them from a dealer (not in stock, or too expensive). So you venture into a dungeon, slay enemies, and hope for good drops.If you’re unlucky, you will only get bad or cheap items. So, you lost time for that day with little or no advantage. Now you need to get lucky in the store while selling the items and hope to haggle in such a way that you gain at least enough money to cover the costs for visiting the dungeon.This counts more towards having a customer wanting a specific item: he places an order, and you need to get it before he returns. Guess what happens if the item simply won’t drop, or can’t be found somewhere else!You cannot do anything about this “luck” factor, or plan ahead or around it. This gets increasingly annoying throughout the game, as you start to feel the game is deliberately taunting you. Speaking of annoyances…WHERE IS THE MUTE BUTTON? OR RATHER, ANY BUTTON THAT WORKSRecette is an non-assertive girl, has no confidence in her abilities and doubts herself every time something bad happens. This translates to annoying remarks, especially during haggling. For example, a customer comes in and wants to sell you an item you don’t want. The only way to not buy the item is to bid a very low price, have the customer disagree, and leave. Recette will always say something along the lines of “I have no talent” or “Can I really do this?”.It undermines the action and result of the player’s choice, and I got increasingly agitated with it.When dungeneering (not a word, get with it), Recette cannot stop asking the hero if he’s all right after he gets hit. Every single time. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Why is this necessary? Why does she need to ask?And boy, are you going to hear it often. The controls in the dungeon feel stiff, and despite seeing your hero hit an enemy, more often than not you will miss the creature, and get hit by it instead. Some enemies have such erratic patterns that it is almost impossible to predict their actions. Some enemies shoot fireballs that track the hero wherever he is, and will almost always result in a hit. Enough hits, and the hero gets incapacitated, you lose the items you collected so far, and you lose the time without getting anything in return.CONCLUSION: A BROKEN PROMISE, NO CASH RETURNSRecettear is a broken promise, like finding a shiny, round object on the beach the size of a high value coin, but discover it to be a worthless bottlecap.Too bad Steam won’t take it back, and now it just sits in my game-list, uninstalled, a constant reminder that an original story combined with a favorite game genre doesn’t automatically make for a good game.Gameplay 4/10The original setting fails because of its poor execution. There is no depth to the gameplay, as the player is forced into actions by the game, instead of controlling the game himself by his own actions.Graphics 8/10A nice manga-look. Colorful, and easy on the eyes.Sound 1/10Boring and repetitive, and you want to shut off the voices after a few minutes in.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first Recettar is an amazing game that seems like a lot of fun to play!The idea is very unique and it could definitely be a huge time killer.Unfortunately the game is rather buggy and crashes quite consistently... Twice I have had to reset my computer from this game... even though my PC can run all other games just fine, this one seems to have issues.If it didn't crash I would love this game... but currently cannot reccomend it.

												I like the alternative take on RPGs, where you're cast in the role of the shop owner. The thing is, this is still an RPG at the end of the day as you have to dungeon crawl to get the best loot to sell at your shop.The nail in the coffin, though, is that there's no way to lose. If you fail to make your weekly repayment, you get sent back to day 1 with all your stock, the adventurers' levels and equipment, and dungeons unlocked. It seems exceptionally difficult to actually win the game in one go. I guess you could just manually start again. The game seems designed for it to require several ""loops"" through the system to beat it, though, which is kind of bulldust. I want a challenge I can fail at, not a grind that I'll eventually get through no matter what.The thing is, it appears that the way to win is just grind, grind, grind in the dungeons to get the rare ingredients you need to craft high quality goods, because they're pretty much the only thing that'll make you enough money to make your repayments.  There's probably no game mechanic that sucks worse than grind, and it does suck a lot of the fun out of this game. Worse, the drops are random.I'm not much of a fan of RPGs to begin with, but at least you control the adventurer rather than issue them instructions, so it's your skill rather than their skill points that matter. You still need to equip them, but it makes sense that equipment is front and centre in a game about selling loot.In the end, it's a fairly bland RPG with a cool trade mechanic that gets totally upstaged by the dungeon crawling.I find the saccharine anime characters grating, but if that's your thing you'll probably like this.

												Only two games come to mind when I think of ""Boy, I regret spending even just 5€ on this♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;, which are the horrible port of Saint's Row II for PC and Recettear.It might start off adorable, but you'll find out that it's ultimately a very shallow piece of software that gets insanely repetitive very fast.The dungeon crawling is also subpar and uninspired.I can't see anybody but people that ""enjoy"" stultifying grinding in MMOs playing this for more than a few hours.This seems acceptable for a 1€/$ tablet game, but it's absolutely inexcusable for such a, relatively, pricey PC game.

												I really liked this game it made sense and was having fun playing it.Then day 11 happened and the game threw out any resemblance of fair mechanics.First off the buying and selling system is broken.No matter my reputation at selling things dirt cheap people still come in expecting me to sell something less then regular price.It makes absolutely no sense that on day 10 I had no problem selling things for 130% mark up no problemo then the next day I have to beg someone to buy something for 103%Not only that the highs and lows is useless because no matter how much it says something is in demand no one will come in and buy the supposedly in demand item.Then when you do manage to get the person they refuse to buy your product for anything less then 100%I'm sorry old man I cannot sell you something for less the I paid for it because debts.I had precious metals decrease in price so I went and bought every metal item I could.The next day apparently there was a boom in metal items.I did nothing but run the store and for all 4 selling periods all people did was request hats. Not HELMETS, hats.Then when it wasn't hats they were trying to buy my yams for way less then what I bought them for.Its complete madness.Not only that but sometimes you screw up and need to restart the game and play a new playthrough.While I hope you like tutorials because prepare to be stuck with Tear holding your hand.

												Very repetitive game with hidden mechanics that will screw you if you don't look them up. Selling everything at 107% for instance. Not what the game tells you to do, but definitely what you should do. The dungeons are repetive and for the most part boring, with simple combat and next to no customization. The story is childish at best. Do not buy this game for more than 5 dollars.			",177,33,2,48,3,0,10

												I bought this hoping for a pure, market, game....Stardew Valley but replace the farming with being a store owner.Instead I got a game with Gameboy Advanced controls (and look). A looming debt that has no reason to be there, and actually can scare off a good amount of players. Graphics so bad (mainly the monsters) that it makes Temple Run look like Batman: Arkham Knight. (Some could like this) A trial and error system that cannot be avoided. And the story follows like a bad anime or a kids book, again, why there's a story, I have no idea!But due to the fact that it's a small dev team like every other ""Mosty Postive"" indie game, people don't want to give it a bad review cause ""it's the best they could do!""No, they could've made a better game, with possibly LESS resources.Remove the story, fix up the dungeon to look good (make the monsters 2D), remove the debt.Personally, I don't like it.BUT, if you are a person who likes the cutsey story/characters, and don't mind a trial and error system, then go ahead I guess, not sure what you'll like, but try it. Just, get it cheap.			",260,28,3,28,33,3,21

												Its sorta like a shop simulation game in its own league. You get items from dungean raids and sell them in your shop to pay off the condemtion of your own house to your fairy ""companion"" who of which is extremely bossy and naggy. However if u have a weak heart i wouldnt recomend looseing and yes you can lose, just dont meet the required amount of gold on ur bill and you will lose and dear god the loseing ending always breaks my heart. Its also realy easy to lose in the game too because its a time based system and you have to do stuff at a certain time or you will screw up the whole game. Its literaly a hassle to do stuff in it too like making the time to go to a dungean...""OH WAIT its already night time now i cant put up shop now THANKS GAME!"" but the game in itself is great for me sence i love simulations and anime combined so i would recomend for the average otaku.

												Omg, this game is so addicting and fun. Sure, the music may sound and feel a little corny or too anime at first, but it will grow on you after a few hours of gameplay. The item shop theme is incredibly catchy and you'll find yourself having it stuck in your head for hours too. Despite the game's cute appeal and animish appearance, it's not an easy game at all. It gets ridiculous after meeting a few financial goals pretty early into the game. Don't let it's cute looks fool you into thinking it's an easy game, because it's not....at all.			",5,3,0,3,6,0,2

												I'll be simple here.This game is a store simulator with a simple (but engaging) dungeon mini game.The dungeon part does NOT have to be played but it will make the game last longer and you'll end up having more fun!And items... Free items! You unlock character as the story progresses. These you can use to venture into dungeons and level up, get new equipment for etc etc. But mainly they come buy their equipment in your store so try not to rip them off or they won't buy!It's not the most easy game though it's pretty basic. You have to pay debt ever week and it goes up and up and up for 5 weeks. So it's not a surprise if you'd have to start over a few times. HOWEVER, you get to keep your current items and levels for your adventurers which should make it easier to actually beat the game. Make sure that you continue from your current save file and do not start a new game from the menu or it's back to the very start.The story is nice and cute, nothing too special but enjoyable. So are the characters, I can't say I liked them all equally as much but you won't pay TOO much attention to them while you're selling stuff anyway. There is a small craft part to the game aswell. Don't overlook that as it comes in handy when you pick up low value items... Which... become more valuable as you craft them into something nice obviously!In the end, this game took me about 20hours to complete at a slow pace with alot of dungeon runs (some of which have failed), 3 restarts at an early level and while reading all text. There is also an endless mode, survival mode and new game + to extend the fun of the game should you be into that. ",409,158,6,69,50,6,73

												Have you ever wondered what it's like to own a shop in an RPG world? Recettear will let you fulfill that wonder.When you first see this title, you immediately think ""some japanese anime thing"". Well, I do have to say you're right.Despite the appearance, Recettear is a great dungeon crawler as well as economy based game. Characters are voiced by japanese VA's, but can be muted. OST is a little generic, but doesn't take away from the game. Characters are witty, and the MC is adorable. Overall, if you love some RPG elements, and dungeon crawling experiences, you surely must pick up this game!!			",184,49,1,37,16,1,33

												Do you enjoy the quirky characters in JRPGs like Disgaea?  Do you like dungeon crawlers?  Do you get a rush out of hoarding money in RPGs?  If you answered yes to one or more of these, this game is worth a try.Developed in Japan by EasyGameStation and localized by Carpe Fulgur, in this RPG you take control from an unlikely main perspective - that of an item shop owner.  Experience what it feels like to be on the other side of the counter, as you haggle prices to sell everyday items in an effort to turn a profit.  Your goal: to repay the debts left by your father, a careless adventurer who wandered off and got himself killed (naturally).However, ""buy low, sell dear"" isn't the only thing to do.  There is an entire dungeon-crawling sub-game within Recettear, in which you can hire an adventurer to guide through various dungeons, gaining experience and picking up loot along the way.The mechanics overall are simple, but fun, and potentially addicting.

												Charming and cute (and extremely addictive) shop managing sim. While lacking major replayability, I thoroughly enjoyed playing through and beating this game.   Addictive fun and cute dialogue, make it a nice time waster with alot of character.  There is a tacked on RPG/Dungeon-crawler element though that seems poorly done and out of place.  I enjoyed the game more when I almost completely ignored this second mode.			",187,35,1,43,38,0,29

												Recettear is a great game both in artwork and in content. It can appeal to a lot of people due to the way you can acheive the objective in the game; paying off the debt of your father, by running an item shop.Recettear incorporates dungeon-crawling in a game where you ordinarily wouldn't see something like that, but it only serves to enhance the game, rather than drag it down. The spoils of your dungeon-going can be put on sale, thus bringing you closer to your goal.While sitting in your shop selling things to people might get boring after a while, the repetativeness is interrupted by new people appearing and new events happening. Overall, it's a wonderful game. Even the music is great! I would definitely recommend it.			",30,11,0,15,12,0,1

												One the most fun games I've seen in quite a while,a game that explore a rarely touched aspect of RPGs and do so very well.PROS:* well-designed trading system with a lot of depth to it.* a simple yet fun combat system that doesn't overshadow the main focus of the game.* very good writing, made me genuinely laugh more than a couple of times.* the goals system is pressuring but not actually too hard, and very different than the dangers depicted in other games.CONS:* ranged attacks only fire in four directions, wouldn't hurt in a turn based system, but that is not the case here.* while the goals are manageable and generally a good feature, it leaves little room for the experimentation I feel needed with such a unique game system.* lack of camera control in dungeons, not too bad but sometimes items/enemies get behind some of the scenery and its kind of annoying.in short, not perfect but tons of fun and highly recommended.

												Don't be fooled by its' cute and fragile appearance: Recettear An Item Shops Tale is a great old school game developed by an Indy Japanese company and subtitled (not dubbed), this means you get cute voice overs between conversations; which there are plenty of. There are many dungeons with many more floors and a bountiful amount of treasures and weapons to sell to your customers. In a single word I can describe this game: Fun. If that doesn't fish you in, try the extensive demo which gives you the first 7 days of the game. The story is actually fresh but the main concept of this game is hunting through dungeons and selling items. It is an RPG and a simulation at it's core. Don't take my word for it, try the demo, see if it's your type of game, and get taking those orders!			",179,21,5,29,6,0,11

												I absolutely adore this game. Cute anime girl ends up opening a shop to pay off her dads debt (no way am i gonna be able to do it first time around so much pix). Selling things and dungeon crawling to get more items cheap.  Cute and fun and i personally find it plays better with a controller. Lots of fun and hope you never meet the girl in the plaza who tries to sell things to you for like 800% of the base price and doesnt buy anything. Love the game though there was a moment where i was in a boss fight and my controller suddenly stopped working and the controller itself worked fine so i dont know what happened but it worked fine again after restarting the game so no big deal.

												Silly me.I felt that item shops in games were tedious and suited the purpose of step-leveling players. It often gave the illusion that such purchases weren't compulsory and that success depended not on your inventory but on you, the hero. As machines of hand-holding patronization I utilized them like a good wank and moved on, not fulfilled but satisfied that a purpose was served. They were a function, not a feature, of video games reality.I've played MMO's for a few years. I always hated the Auction Houses, the Trading Plazas and the player economies in general. Because of my disdain for the enterprise of digital enterprise, I would undercut constantly. Nubs would praise their providence at my rock bottom prices while gougers and manipulators would curse the minor chore of buying and flipping it for a higher price while sometimes haranguing me for being self destructive. ~~My eyes are open and I repent!~~Now, as the proprietor of an item shop I feel the pressures that my disregarded digital counterparts felt. Why the heck do you want a hat every GD day grandpa? What is with all these innappropriate books you reading little girl?  Aw nuts! Price on daggers just dropped? I just plotted my upgrades and don't have inventory space to do this flipping right now! It helps to think of them all as players on some tedious quest out there, in some awful task based world where they simply trudge through a series of completionist mediocrities that amount to a few clicks echoing in a tiny corner of the vast space which has become my mercantile empire! These beasts of burden, these movers of product whose true purpose is to fill my storage room with oddities and my pockets with power! My precious little clients with their oh so similar faces and quaint but repetitive stories. If I had a dollar for every bumpkin whose family wanted them to pick up a piece of candy for dinner....wait...I do sorta. Never underestimate a housewife?

												If you've ever played an RPG, chances are you've visited the ubiquitous Item Shop. There's one in every town, city, and sometimes dungeon. And rather than play a dungeon-diving hero, you play, well, the shop keeper. Who's rather cute and adorable, if a bit naiive and too prone to puns and tropes. And speaking of tropes and puns, the entire game itself is a pun on RPGs in general. The game isn't fully-voiced, but is voiced enough that it shouldn't matter. What Recettear really comes down to it is this: If you love accumulating wealth and stuff in video games almost more than the game itself, then this game is for you.Just don't die in the dungeon, you really can't take it with you.

												Not a new game, but brings a fresh new play to RPGs if you haven't been playing this type of game.  It still of course, has action RPG elemnts where you can hack your way through dungeons, but the main game mechanic that this game is focused on is maintaining an item shop where you can sell your spoils to adventurers!  Where you used to play as an adventurer in RPGs, and constantly visiting a shop or two every chance you get--now you get to BE those shops! The main goal is ot earn a certain amount of income each week to pay of debt that the main character's father had left, paying it incrementally.  The amount to pay eac hweek increases as time goes on.  You collect goods to sell by buying from your customers (after level 2), buying from other shops, or going through dungeons and grabbing any loot you can get.  After you get goods to sell, then you can arrange them in your shop!  If yu can earn more money, you can even  customize your shop to fit your needs.If you love RPGs and management style games, then you should totally check this out!  DOWNLOAD THE DEMO NOW, DO IT!

They let you continue with your items and shop levels (without your cash) but if you are not a ♥♥♥♥♥ you will delete that save file and start over for realsies!			",53,11,0,27,6,0,8

												A dungeon crawler through and through with the added element of cold, hard, capitalism.  You take up the role of a young girl named Recet.  Her father has gone off to become a hero and leaves her to live on her own.  One day a fairy named Tear shows up and announces that unless the loand on the house gets paid the bank is going to repossess it and Recet will be kicked out onto the street.Tear comes up with the idea of having Recet open an item show and thus Recettear is born.  The game is centered around paying down the debt in installments that get bigger each month.  It is quite easy to miss a payment and have to ""loop"" into another attempt.  When you loop you keep everything you currently have (pix, items, state of the shop) but you start over from day 1 and your adventures are set to level 1 and you have to reattain them.After completing the game there is also an endless mode where you can continue playing the game and unlock new dungeons.If you are a fan of JRPGs this game should be an instant buy for you.  Even if you are not I highly reccomend it.  9/10 stars.			",701,169,5,143,118,7,150

												As an economist and nerd, I knew I was going to pick up this game eventually.  Not many people consider what goes on in the lives of RPG store-owners, and this game attempts to address that.  The story is entertaining enough, and for those who don't like business management as much as I, adventurers can be hired to go on dungeon crawls.The game has a few flaws, though.  First, the loan payments go from challenging to excessive too fast, and then stop way too early.  After that, the entire reason to earn money goes out the window (aside from some optional modes).  Second, while the dungeon crawls are fun, and can be rewarding, they take so much in-game time that you're almost always better off just running your store, and going to the guild or market when your stock is low.Still, you'll likely enjoy the game if you have even a bit of interest in business, so it's worth purchasing during a sale.

												This game was converted to english and is a very nice game.  It has a lot of charm and a unique sence of humor in it.  You are the owner of an item store which sells items to customers you might see if you were playing an rpg from the normal point of view of the hero.Should you buy this?  I'd say yes but I recommend checking gaming footage of both the shopping gameplay and the questing gameplay.  It might get a touch repetitive but I enjoyed all the time I spend playing it.

												The gameplay is split between playing the market and a variation of dungeon crawling. While the dungeon crawling is not very difficult and mildly rewarding, it cannot be stressed just how incredibly satisfying it is to be a successful shop owner. The story plays out like a Japanese Dating Sim, with all the standard Japanese drama and humor, and if that is to your taste, then prepare to be surprised.An intruiging, challenging, and entirely fun way to both learn about and enjoy the free market.

Besides, purchasing the game supports independent game localization/development. You like supporting worthy causes, don't you? Just say you do and let's move on.			",163,58,1,41,25,4,38

Well, wonder no more as you take the helm of a fancy-pantsy item shop and sell everything from apples to swords. But wait, that's not all. Don't wanna pay for your merch? Well, just head off to a dungeon and get some stuff for free! Just watch out, those dungeons don't hold only McGuffins...Overall an excellent and somehow challenging adventure as you fight monsters and sell items.

												Recettear is a must! If you separate the management part and the dungeon parts there's not much new to it. But, together it makes a really fun, refreshing and addicting game. The progress you make is rewarding, The tutorial is skippable (something a lots of game could use but don't), the animations are great. The mixt of 2D and 3D can be a bit weird though but you get use to it pretty quickly. I love that they kept the japanese voices it adds to the experience of the game. Recette the main character is adorable even when you know there's an evil capitalist hidden behing that cute face. The gameplay is smooth and intuitive. The dungeons are a bit repetitive, but they're still fun and they complete the management part amazingly well.The big weekness of the game for me is the adventurers you unlock and pick to do the dungeons. I almost pick the same adventurer (Louis) every time wich makes the other adventurers pretty much useless to me. I switch from time to time but there's some adventurer I don't have fun playing like this guy who's a melee fighter and TRIES to punch his way through dungeons wich really doesn't work for me when you can just use the guy with the sword who got a way better range.Apart from that, it's a great game. Tons of hours of gameplay, cute japanese characters, overall fun and rewarding, if you're not convinced yet just try the demo!			",161,79,0,28,24,2,9

It basically rules.The one mechanic they really should tell you up front, though, is that making a successful sale means that that customer will come back with more money next time so you need to build up customer loyalty before making the big sales. I mean, it has a plausible explanation and everything, they just don't explain that it's happening!			",115,21,1,20,2,0,14

												A game about a cute anime-style girl left to pay off her father's debt to a loan shark by running an item shop. Half the game is a dungeon RPG, where you gather your inventory by contracting adventurers. This part gets a little tedious, as attacking and defending doesn't feel very good with this game,  and enemies don't seem very inspired. You want to maximize your time spent in the dungeon segments on training your adventurer, and then come home with good loot, which you can only carry so much of, for your shop. The other half of the game involves running the item shop- selling stuff, haggling with customers, leveling your merchant skills, and praying the little girls go away. Capitalism, ho.

												A superb blend of dungeon crawling and store management. Fun and funny idioms and adventures for all ages. Check it out, and you won't be disappointed with it. Imagine Disgaea mixed with a shop owner mini simulation game, and you have Recettear. A highly rated game that nobody has ever heard of, it was made by an indie Japanese company, and I hope more indie games like this one come. Sadly, no advertisements for it, so it didn't sell very much in America.			",154,29,1,36,27,3,33

												Cute, addictive and wonderful Capitalism. There is so much about this game that makes it wonderful. From the dialogue to catchy tunes all the way to it's bartering system. This game will suck you in and keep you dungeon crawling just to make a few more pix.You play as Recette Lemongrass. A cute little anime girl who runs an item shop! One day her father decides to become a hero and head out on an adventure. Little does she know she will receive a visit from Tear, a small fairy that arrives to collect on a massive debt her father left her! As you might have noticed the name of the game is Recettear, which is also the name of the shop, a combination of Recette and Tear to show their partnership to pay off her debt.There is two parts to Recettear, running the shop and dungeon crawling with a hired adventurer. Running the shop is rather simple. First, you need to stock your shop with goods. You can either purchase items when they are on huge discount from other shops in town or hire an adventurer to find loot in the various dungeons. Different customers will come in and each one has a different amount of funds as you will learn over time. This will help you in your selling and haggling once you realise this!Never go over the 130% markup unless the item has a massive price boost from low supply in town.As each week begins, you will have a certain amount of pix (money) you need to make in order to pay back your father's debt. Each week it will increase, which is the challenge, and failing to have the amount for Tear will result in End Game. The plus side is you start over with the pix you had when you failed! (also unlocked dungeons)As for the dungeons themselves there is an Adventurer's Guild in town where you can recruit someone to venture into dungeons to gain loot. These tend to fall into the warrior / thief / mage class set and require certain items or events to happen before they will be unlocked. Soulblazer (Super Nintendo) comes to mind when I think of the dungeons and combat. It's very straight forward and never terribly difficult to get to the end of. Keep in mind you can only stock twenty items per trip!All in all, it's a cute little game that can be highly addictive. It's got amusing dialogue and loveable characters. It can easily be picked up incredibly cheap during any Steam Sale. Do yourself a favour and pick up this little gem!			",318,86,0,44,21,3,50

But by virtue of simple charm, pleasantly paced story, and suitably relaxing music, this game just ate 15 hours of my life, and i'm not complaining.it's nothing profound, but is extraordinarily hard in the later stages unless you keep an effective balance.

You run your father's item shop that serves the townspeople and various adventurers, and if you fail to pay off your father's debts, you lose the shop and end up on the street. Lots of ways to earn money, whether strategically buying items low and selling them high or recruiting adventurers to go dungeon diving for loot (these segments are playable, and aren't terribly deep but they're kind of fun).

												What a surprise, I've read decent reviews about this game in the past. Playing the game itself turned out to be a much better experience for me. The dialogues in the game are very lighthearted and expected of JRPGs, and it works for this special blend of RPG. The gameplay mechanics of upkeeping your storefront, and dungeoneering are simple and effective, and fun! It is repetitive work, but also methodical and makes you want to try to figure out the best play style in earning as much cash as possible within the shortest amount of time. That's how I look at the endgame, get all items and earn as fast as possible. 8/10!			",72,25,0,14,27,0,14

												Experience what it would be like to be a shopkeeper! If you were also a little girl. And if you had a fairy helping you. And if you had to start your store under crushing debt. It has a small learning curve that leads to playing for hours just selling items in your store. If you get bored of that, go out and adventure in a ranomly created dungeon. You can beat the game without doing anything but selling, but dungeon items are almost pure profit. I'd say most of the game actually starts after you beat the main game and enter endless mode. That's not to say that the race against the clock to pay off your debt in the main game isn't fun. Bottom line: this game is awesome to no end.Capitalism ho!			",132,28,0,25,15,0,12

												Recettear is a really well made game. It is very fun to play, you have the option of running the shop, dungeon crawling, or visitng the town to buy things throughout the game. Do not underestimate it though, as it becomes fairly challenging, and very easy to get a game over the first time around if you slip up. It has very cute visuals, as well as humor to accompany the main story along the way, and it has content that can be unlocked after beating the game for replay value. I heavily recommend this game.

The game mechanics make me feel like I HAVE to make sure to not just fool around, although you still can to some degree... All in all, I'd highly recommend this game if you want to burn time on an addictive game :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game gets a little too predictable after becoming very good at bargaining, buying and selling. The levels involving combat also becomes repetitive later. However, the game offers something that others don't and it doesn't actually get boring until many hours of play. I'd say it's a good game to train children to become business owners. Essentially it's all about earning money and how to get there.			",173,36,3,19,2,0,4

												dungeons get repetitive but still lots of fun, but you can choose to profit more from buying and reselling if you wish. idk why people dont talk about this game more often. making your store bigger, choosing between vending machines and tables later on... gearing up the characters you unlock.. changing store aura to attract different customers. replayibility is better then most games though again, it gets repetitive with minimal goals after the initial play through other then to get richer and unlock character cards/finish out store expansions. bit grindy if you want it to be.p.s. try to beat it on loop 1 ;) that makes for a good challenge.  first review for steam achievement list thing!

												If you've ever played the now-defunct Facebook game Neopets: Treasure Keepers, this is the same kind of principle, without the Facebookness. This is good, because the adventure parts are actually engaging and require some degree of skill [and no Skinner Box ponying up of money for cheats in a pinch]. This is bad, because there's no automation of the selling items. I would recommend trying the demo to see if it's your cup of tea, especially if you get frustrated with games that switch gameplay on you in this fashion.			",56,43,1,5,2,0,11

												I was rather pleasantly surprised by this title.  I'm not typically a big casual game player, but this one etched its way into my heart.  It's a simple game, really, you buy high, sell low, occasionally dip into dungeons to get itmes, and do your best to make loan payments in the story line.  There's nothing terribly memorable about the characters, but the gameplay is pleasant, and it's simple to just jump in and get things done, then move on in your day.  I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a nice casual game with a few RPG elements and a little action.			",195,24,0,38,5,0,11

												GOOD: -nice idea to mix a shop with dungeoning.-nice playable characters with good characterization.BAD: -The ideas about the shop management are enjoyable but soon after a couple of hours we already have seen almost everything about that content and we already know most of the % for the child, the old guy, the man, the woman and the guild guy...-Dungeons too damn repetitive...this is something expected when are involved randomized dungeons, but they could have add few more traps or ""events"".-They could have added a combat more enjoyable...after a while it gets boring to use just attack or skill 1,2,3.-Story too linear and to know all of it you have to beat an extra dungeon with 100 lvls that it is just too boring.-The last extra dungeon is quite useless and there is not real motivation to finish it-They could have added more content to give motivation to the player to play it after finishing it.PRICE: Worth 5/7.5 euroRECCOMEND:I do not reccomend to buy this game if you want to do only the shop management since it gets easily boring, while i do reccomend it at those who like to farm endlessy dungeons with little changes and with attack + skill.

												Okay, here comes a recommendation. You should get this game. It does have its simplistic side, but it also has a degree of difficulty that you have not seen before. The dungeons are randomly generated, but that doesn't stop them from being fun and engaging, and personally I still go through them quite often. This game takes you on a joyride, and you're going to be screaming for more, every second you're on it. There are ups, there are downs, but in the end, when the main story is over, I guarantee you will be playing this game for weeks, possibly months after. Get. This. Game. For Carps sake.

												Tt has simple, but cute and well made graphics.  The music isn't anything outstanding, but it is easy on the ears and does not make your ears bleed after playing for hours on end(and you WILL play for hours on end).  The gameplay in dungeons is simple and fun.  Easy to learn, but in the more difficult dungeons it can be slightly difficult to master.But of course the game itself revolves around your item shop.  Buy low, sell high, put dungeon drops out for the correct price.  But you also have to work around your customers, and make sure that they like you.Capitalism ho mother ♥♥♥♥er!

												It's an RPG that stresses earning money and shop mechanics more than exploring it's world and characters. You are supposed to earn enough money to pay off increasingly larger amounts of debt, but this only encourages grinding at your store. You can leave the store with a hero character and explore a dungeon to gather treasure. This mode plays like an Zelda on the SNES, top down action combat, but unlike Zelda is straight up combat with only three special abilities per character. When your doing nothing but it for 5-10 dungeon floors against the same old slimes, pumpkins, bats, and what the ♥♥♥♥ ever it gets boring and tedious fast.  Also with a limited space of what you can take back to sell I found I had to be constantly managing my inventory, but that crap is with all RPGs. There is also a crafting system for more valuable items, which means more dungeon grinding for ingredients. But under the fixed time constraint to earn money, it's very possible to ignore. Only the first 10%-20% of content is introduced by the game, the rest you have to♥♥♥♥♥♥around to find/ start the unlocking events. Upon finishing paying off the debt, I had only unlocked 2 dungeons and 2 heroes, out of like 8 dungeons and 9 heroes. According to the wiki and realizing the amount of grinding to unlock it all I realized my patience with the game had worn out. TL;DR : Beating the game by grinding the first 10%-20% of content isn't fun now is it?			",264,52,5,16,12,0,20

												Recettear is a great old school hack-n-slash game. It plays like Secret of Mana, but with many more characters. The Shop is where you can sell items you either bought, or gathered from your adventures for profit. You can barter prices and your shop can level up. There are tons of missions to complete. If you want a long adventure game that's cheap, this is a great choice.Rating: 8/10			",705,218,37,97,95,9,131

You can raise money two ways, adventuring (which is oddly challenging and easy at the same time) or playing the ""stock market"" in the game (buy low sell hi). Either way, it is a very fun game.

												This game is much better than I thought it would be. You play as Recette, a young girl left to pay off her fathers debt. You have to open up a shop so the loansharks don't take your house. While owning the shop is important you must also hire an adventurer (who you can also control) to go out and find treasures in dungeons and defeat challenging bosses. All the treasures you manage to loot during adventure can be sold at your shop. After buying/selling items and bartering, each week you must reach a set amount of money otherwise it's GAME OVER! Definately a worthwhile purchase especially if you have a low budget but want to try out a new game. The graphics are simplistic, the music is fitting and the characters are relatable, all the little features make this game great!			",333,49,8,46,14,4,29

												   Very fun RPG where you take the roll of an item shop keeper.  While sitting around hawking broadswords all day may not sound very fun, the shopkeeping element is oddly engauging and surprisingly deep - with different customers having behavior quirks and fluctuating budgets, mechanics that reward a concientious approach to pricing (the most someone will pay for an item is not always the best price to sell it for), and different ways to sell items including advance orders and vending machines.  If you ever get bored of the daily work grind, however, you can always hire an adventurer and spend the day exploring a dungeon for exp and loot (which you can, of course, sell in your store for 100% profit)     Lots of postgame content (there will be entire dungeons and playable adventurers you wont even see on your frist playthrough). Worth $20, but a definate pickup on its frequent 50% off sales.  Play the demo.  9/10 ",197,37,0,44,9,1,50

												Recettear is a game that represents a solid concept executed at a barely adequate level.  Amassing items and wealth is gratifying, but the game seemingly goes out of its way to keep you from feeling like a true weeler-and-dealer;  your character's plaintative whine whenever you walk away from a deal (even if it was a guaranteed money loser) is grating and goes against business sense.  The top-down action stages are minimalist and, while a diversion from the usual process of running your shop, grow tiresome rapidly.  To cap it off, the game is so aggressively ~uugu kawii Anime~ that it's hard to concentrate on being a retailer.That being said, why would I recommend this game?  Succinctly, because it's a solid idea that begs for greater resources and a more elaborate execution.  How much you will enjoy it depends upon how strongly you feel the urge to become your very own pawn star.			",86,26,2,7,5,0,8

												I recommend this game 8.5/10 worth the price, worth the time: I would like to talk about dungeon crawling, selling items, story and endgame content:1) Dungeon crawling is fun at first but becomes repetitive to farm for item crafting even though there is a mode called boss rush that makes it easier to farm. Becomes tedious. 2) Selling items is the most fun buying things at a low and selling high. However, it's likely that you want to get xp from selling the item in one go without 'haggling' the price as shopkeeper - this is limiting factor for maximising profits and deters you from 'haggling' the price as it offers little reward other than few % of money. Haggling is optional but causes a bit of disadvantage in exploring the games content as through leveling you unlock more features but haggling will take significantly longer to get xp. 3) The story is pretty cute and diverse, there's events that happen right until the end of the game. 4) endgame content are survival mode, new game+, exploring events and filling the excyclopedia. However, I didn't play past the main story because the gameplay got repetitive after losing twice, however if you didn't get bored then why not? It could be better but is good as it is. Thus 8.5/10.			",125,20,2,31,14,0,11

												A much as I've looked, I havn't been able to find another game of its kind. I've heard it compared to rune factory--where dungeon crawling and business are the dual-focuses, running a store and farming are very different in terms of gameplay.  Not only is this game the only one of its kind, it's WEIRDLY addicting. The dungeon crawling is decent, the graphics are okay-ish, and and the gameplay is simple, but the combination of all three make this game compelling if for nothing else than it's uniqueness. If you see this game on sale, buy it.Capitalism, ho!			",60,19,1,11,7,0,22

												This game is a very good managment game. You play as an in-debt girl who collects and sell items for your item shop. The shop and character management are near perfect. The story has that light comedy feel to it that you get when you watch certain anime, however I didn't actually beat this game so I don't know if that changes later. If I had a complaint about it, it would be that the dungeon crawling part is kinda basic, but other than that I totally recommend it.			",135,41,3,23,14,3,11

												If you've ever played an RPG you're familiar with the concept of an item shop: a convient place for players to pick up gear and anything else they'll need in the game, with ever-increasing prices from the shop owner that keep you grinding away for cash to buy things with. In this game, instead of being the adventuer, you're the shop owner. I bought this game becuase it looked cute and might kill some time in the afternoons. Instead I got a very challenging RPG experience and some of the most fun I've ever had learning economics and trying to find the balance between running my store and dungeon crawling. If you're a fan of RPGs or JRPGs this game is well worth the price for all the enjoyment I've gotten out of it.			",42,43,0,12,8,0,1

												When I first played this game it was with mouse and keyboard.  Big mistake.  Now that I have a controller the game is much more fun. The game premise is simple: buy low, sell high, pay off weekly debt.  There is a simplistic top down dungeon crawler in here too, but it's surprisingly not necessary to finish the game.  You can easily ""win"" by buying items from other vendors, or even customers, on sale and then marking them up when the prices rebound.  There is a bit of store ""management"" as far as expansion and decoration, but I couldn't tell if it made any sort of difference.  This is definitely ""sim-light"", but it's charm and simplicity make for a casual and relatively relaxing experience.  Recommended if on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the kind of game you would consider buying during a decent sale but probably not willing to do a lot of research, so I'm looking to keep the review very concise for those people. This is a great game. That being said, it is a very niche game. It satisfies a gaming itch I´ve had for years. If you enjoy management games and RPGs, this game is a very well executed mix of the two. The game is charming and addicting, albeit a bit shallow. I enjoy the game's simplicity at first because it allows me to enjoy the most basic pleasures of management and shopkeeping, but my interest began to wane near the end of the game. The combat is basic and unnecessary, but entertaining enough. The story takes roughly 10 hours and is quite satisfying. The game has close to no replayability even with ""New Game Plus"" because the management system is very basic. It's a good thing the game is a story based and not a SIM, because it won't hold your attention any longer than it intends to. It's a great 10 hour experience. Worth 5-10 dollars.

												One of the unique games out there. It combines a little trade simulation and some top down action combat in one game with a little bit of Text-Adventure. You run a little item shop. To sell items you venture into dungeons. You then decide which items you sell and which you eventually wear yourself. Whether you sell crafting items or use them to craft new items. You set a price for an item yourself and can haggle with your customers. And you can even take errands from your costumers. You can invest your hard earned money to improve your item shop or save it up for the ultimate goal which is to pay off the debt your dad made.I love this game because i like the idea of managing an item shop. It makes a lot of fun to decide thinghs like which item i should put on the front window (to attract people which pass by) and which on the shelf. To see them come into my shop and watch them look around and make me hope they have interest in the items i previously found in a dungeon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game where you manage a small item shop.You can buy the items for stock prices or find them in dungeons.This game has a nice balance between selling,buying stuff and crawling through dungeons on search for loot.If you beat the campaign you have some fun post content as well.I recommend this game for people that like to sell stuff and switch off with some dungeon looting.a fun game, easy to pick up and play for 10-30 mins.

												RPG style with turn-based battles, a fairly good storyline, funny characters, and having to Buy/Sell at your item shop within a timeframe in order to win the game.  After you hit objectives and win, you still can play for hours longer gettings all playable characters.  A very good rounded game.  Fun for anyone!			",56,39,0,65,37,1,36

												Recettear is a great game both in artwork and in content. It can appeal to a lot of people due to the way you can acheive the objective in the game; paying off the debt of your father, by running an item shop.Recettear incorporates dungeon-crawling in a game where you ordinarily wouldn't see something like that, but it only serves to enhance the game, rather than drag it down. The spoils of your dungeon-going can be put on sale, thus bringing you closer to your goal.While sitting in your shop selling things to people might get boring after a while, the repetativeness is interrupted by new people appearing and new events happening. Overall, it's a wonderful game. Even the music is great! I would definitely recommend it.			",30,11,0,15,12,0,1

												Silly me.I felt that item shops in games were tedious and suited the purpose of step-leveling players. It often gave the illusion that such purchases weren't compulsory and that success depended not on your inventory but on you, the hero. As machines of hand-holding patronization I utilized them like a good wank and moved on, not fulfilled but satisfied that a purpose was served. They were a function, not a feature, of video games reality.I've played MMO's for a few years. I always hated the Auction Houses, the Trading Plazas and the player economies in general. Because of my disdain for the enterprise of digital enterprise, I would undercut constantly. Nubs would praise their providence at my rock bottom prices while gougers and manipulators would curse the minor chore of buying and flipping it for a higher price while sometimes haranguing me for being self destructive. ~~My eyes are open and I repent!~~Now, as the proprietor of an item shop I feel the pressures that my disregarded digital counterparts felt. Why the heck do you want a hat every GD day grandpa? What is with all these innappropriate books you reading little girl?  Aw nuts! Price on daggers just dropped? I just plotted my upgrades and don't have inventory space to do this flipping right now! It helps to think of them all as players on some tedious quest out there, in some awful task based world where they simply trudge through a series of completionist mediocrities that amount to a few clicks echoing in a tiny corner of the vast space which has become my mercantile empire! These beasts of burden, these movers of product whose true purpose is to fill my storage room with oddities and my pockets with power! My precious little clients with their oh so similar faces and quaint but repetitive stories. If I had a dollar for every bumpkin whose family wanted them to pick up a piece of candy for dinner....wait...I do sorta. Never underestimate a housewife? HAaahahahahahahahahaaaa!10/10 would experience cathartic megalomania again			",155,47,0,83,4,0,9

												Cute, addictive and wonderful Capitalism. There is so much about this game that makes it wonderful. From the dialogue to catchy tunes all the way to it's bartering system. This game will suck you in and keep you dungeon crawling just to make a few more pix.You play as Recette Lemongrass. A cute little anime girl who runs an item shop! One day her father decides to become a hero and head out on an adventure. Little does she know she will receive a visit from Tear, a small fairy that arrives to collect on a massive debt her father left her! As you might have noticed the name of the game is Recettear, which is also the name of the shop, a combination of Recette and Tear to show their partnership to pay off her debt.There is two parts to Recettear, running the shop and dungeon crawling with a hired adventurer. Running the shop is rather simple. First, you need to stock your shop with goods. You can either purchase items when they are on huge discount from other shops in town or hire an adventurer to find loot in the various dungeons. Different customers will come in and each one has a different amount of funds as you will learn over time. This will help you in your selling and haggling once you realise this!Never go over the 130% markup unless the item has a massive price boost from low supply in town.As each week begins, you will have a certain amount of pix (money) you need to make in order to pay back your father's debt. Each week it will increase, which is the challenge, and failing to have the amount for Tear will result in End Game. The plus side is you start over with the pix you had when you failed! (also unlocked dungeons)As for the dungeons themselves there is an Adventurer's Guild in town where you can recruit someone to venture into dungeons to gain loot. These tend to fall into the warrior / thief / mage class set and require certain items or events to happen before they will be unlocked. Soulblazer (Super Nintendo) comes to mind when I think of the dungeons and combat. It's very straight forward and never terribly difficult to get to the end of. Keep in mind you can only stock twenty items per trip!All in all, it's a cute little game that can be highly addictive. It's got amusing dialogue and loveable characters. It can easily be picked up incredibly cheap during any Steam Sale. Do yourself a favour and pick up this little gem!			",318,86,0,44,21,3,50

												Overall this title is a enjoyable game. Although it wasn't $20 origionally. I would pick it up maybe for 10? But the gameplay itself is quite challenging fun and overall great. Yes there is a lot of repetition but the gameplay itself once mastered, should provide enough substance to beat the game within 20-40 hrs. Depending at how smart you are and luck of the draw sort of things. I had to restart over a few times before I figured out that you restart with your items. Once you own your shop you can get everything then the game becomes more or less a sandbox.Theres' still the dungeons, I almost have beatten the game. The game needs a sequel or a spinoff or something as it's not dull to buy sell buy sell. Once you understand the more complex economics (such as deflation.) You will make bank. I once made 8x an item. It'll become really fun. Some customers have lots of cash typically older crowds, but young girls won't have as much with some variables.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Think of Rune Factory: Harvest Moon with farming, fighting, leveling up, selling stuff for money, and rinse repeat. Its just like that, except you take the role of girl who owns an item shop. Recrette, the main character is moe and the fighting is fun and fresh.			",666,140,21,121,59,8,104

												It's time for the noon rush and the price of candy has shot up 20%, the children will be coming in soon and you've just restocked your shop nventory from another succesful day of treasure hunting in the dungeons. Unlike in other RPGs where you're the hero who goes off adventuring and selling the sutff you find to shops, you're now the shopkeeper known as Recette, whose father has fled the country and left behind a giant debt that must be paid back in payments each week otherwise Recette will be kicked to the streets as her home is sold off.The bulk of Recettear involves studying the customers and the times they like to enter your store in order to stock the items they want to buy. As you become more succesful, your store expands, the quality of items and their prices increases and you start unlocking new adventurers to fight monsters.Recettear is a nice diversion but don't expect a deep engaging business magement simulator like Roller Coaster Tycoon, or Tropico.
