												Mount and Blade is a wonderful game, however there is no point in purchasing this game - not long after this original release, Mount and Blade: Warband came out. It's largely the same game, using the same map and same general mechanics, but with the inclusion of multiplayer and achievements, as well as some general questline/mechanic improvements - it's basically the same game, but more. There's effectively no advantages this original game has over Warband, so it's not really worth purchasing. The one exception to this rule is that there were some mods created for it which did not get ported to Warband, so take a look at those via a Google search to see if one of them might be up your alley.If you're trying to complete your library or support the developer/publisher? By all means. But if you're looking for the game to purchase, pick up Mount and Blade: Warband, instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There isn't much point in buying or playing this game anymore as Mount & Blade: Warband is almost the same game but with more polish, some changes/improvements, AND multiplayer. The only reason you should buy or play this version of the game is for the mods that were built for this and not Warband. The most notable being Star Wars: Conquest, which is a total conversion mod for the game that takes the core gameplay elements and replaces the story, setting, characters, mythos, universe, etc with faithful Star Wars content. That mod is what would make me recommend this to people. If you're a fan of Star Wars you NEED to play Star Wars: Conquest, and the only way to do so is with this base game.

												I found M&B's mechanics take some geting used, especially combat. Once you develop an understanding of what's going on and what to do, the game really starts to open up. It doesn't help that you start off all alone with a low-level character with no one else in your party. That's the challenge though! Tournaments are a good way to learn the fighting mechanics. Level up by fighting small parties of bandits (a horse makes things loads easier) and recruit villagers to your party, who will also level up. Launch sieges against castles or defend your castles against sieges. Eventually, you get a lordship and maybe even kingship, but I haven't gotten that far yet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am actually a little bit relieved that I had the M&B series on CD first, before playing on steam, or I would most likely have over 500-1000 hours spread across the 3 games. I absolutely love this series!Warband is easily the best of the 3 available, with superior mod support, however, the orignal M&B is still very good. If you are able to choose, definitely go with Warhand, which is basically a more fleshed-out version of the original game. While playing the original, I did notice that some of my favorite mods did not get ported over to Warband, so make sure you check out the mod community for M&B to see if anything there interests you.Much of the aesthetics, controls, and gameplay mirror Warband, so here is my review. There usually is only a few dollars difference between M&B and Warband whenever they both go on sale, so be sure to pick up Warband if possible (or both, if you like collecting).Despite the more superior Warband being available, this is still a great game, and you should try it out if you are interested in sampling the series.Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews ",250,88,0,51,38,2,49

												Take over castles, kill thousands of men, manage your own army, relations with lords/kings/cities/towns/factions, pillage and burn (looting, my favorite), and a huge map with 5 different factions that you choose to join. You can either be a jerk and chase down peasants and slaughter them, or you can drive bandits out of small towns or stop the enemy lord from pillaging the neighboring town. Be involved in battles for cities or castles with hundreds, maybe even thousands if u want to (i have). Now you have to start off right because i have 1 good character and 3 other bad ones. so dont fool around and get captured by bandits or a mean lord. When you get to my level (which is probably real bad compared to some hardcore mount and blade fan out there), you can battle bandits all by yourself, and just bow them down as they come at you. its a great game with neverending places to capture and people to kill (there's a limit of places, but the people just keep comin! how many babies have to be born with the fact i have killed 35k people)! Worth the money too, trust me, I am a stickler for buying games for any kind of money. This better persuade you to get this, or i will have to send my army of 650 men at you ( would be more troops but they are quite expensive, and i start losing money fast if i go for any more. 112k monies. i do love my money.)

												I dropped a lot of hours into this game, despite its flaws. But don't buy this, buy M&B Warband. It's exactly the same, but with better mechanics, animations, combat, and more options. There's nothing in M&B that isn't also in M&B Warband, and the improvements are huge. That said, this game is fantastic and I enjoyed every minute of the 300 hours I spent playing it. I would give it a 9 for 10 (there are flaws in it, after all). Its my favorite game out there, with the very notable exception of Warband. So don't buy this game. But definitely buy Warband.

												Do not buy this game - but not for the reason you think!Mount & Blade is a fantastic game, and I've invested many hours in it. The problem lies in it's ""Sequel"". You see, Mount and Blade: Warband is less a sequel, and more just Mount & Blade 1 with more features. Up until a few weeks ago, they were the same price too.There is literally no reason to ever buy Mount & Blade 1, when you should just buy Warband. Just go buy Warband.What's worse, when I bought Mount & Blade, I was given a guarantee that I'd receive free updates for the game forever. They got out of this by abusing a loophole and creating a ""Sequel"" game.In short - M&B is insanely fun. But if you want it, go buy Warband instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're reading this review, I'm going to assume you're one of two people.1. Someone who has never played a Mount & Blade title before2. Someone who has played Warband, and is wondering if this game is worth gettingIf you've just now found the game on steam and haven't played Warband, I'd recommend buying Warband instead. It's a bit more expensive, but all in all it's a more polished game with some nice new mechanics that doesn't exist in this game.If you've played Warband alot, and really like it, I recommend buying this game. Sure, the gameplay is a bit worse than Warband, so if you want to play Native, I'd just recommend Warband. So why do I recommend it? Mods. Soooo many mods...So, if it's on sale, I'd recommend you getting it, seeing as how many mods there are here that will never come to Warband. If you haven't played Mount & Blade and don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about mods, just buy Warband.I'll give it a positive, even though it's a bit of both negative and positive depending on who you are.

												I've got to be honest, the first time I played this game I was disappointed.  The combat, both on horseback and on foot, just felt off.  In addition, there is almost no story.  And the graphics are definitely outdated.  So why the positive review?  This is a game that grows on you, but only if you give it time.  The early stages where you have nothing are frustrating, as you can't do much and are easily defeated.  But if you can weather this period, the game opens up as you build up supplies and equipment and soldiers.  In addition, the combat becomes much more intuitive as you spend time with it.  You are soon able to best larger armies due to your skill level, as well as the quality of your equipment and soldiers.  Unfortunately, it's at this point that the game feels a bit broken.  The whole game revolves around several factions that own various towns and are at war with each other, and you generally align yourself with one of these factions.  No matter how well you equip your crew at this point in the game, you almost always encounter insurmountable odds when you face any of the opposing factions in combat.  For example, you might be limited to a party of 60, but will regularly encounter parties of opposing factions that range from 100-200.  Worse yet, even if you're able to best such a large party, it's almost a given that the opposing faction will have another party or two in the area, each with 100+ soldiers.  It never feels like your faction supports you as much as other factions support them.  In addition, conquering all of a faction's towns seems next to impossible as the towns are dispersed over quite a large area on the map.  While you might conquer several towns in one area, it could take you several in-game days to travel to the next area to conquer that faction's remaining towns.  Meanwhile, those initial towns you conquered have been conquered by one of the game's other factions, as you typically spread yourself thin trying to attack so many areas.  Overall, I know that I've pointed out several flaws with this game so far.  That being said, I feel like these issues don't detract from the game so much overall, as addressing them would make the sequel that much better.  I really enjoyed this game, but a sequel that addressed my issues would be worth a lot of money to me.  This game was good, but I look forward to checking out more from this franchise.  I would give this game a 7.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Just play Warband instead since it's literally the same game but with tons of improvements which makes your gameplay more enjoyable (alone the ""speed up time"" function in Warband makes this game obsolete).

												This game has been succeeded by the Mount & Blade: Warband edition. The Warband edition contains all the content of this release, as well as an entire new faction. This version of the game is graphically inferior and should only be played over the Warband edition of the game if a mod is only available for the old Mount & Blade edition.

												This is a refreshing addition to my library, I don't think i've ever played a game that combines world conquering, FF style over world map mechanics, and third person 'chivalry'-esque middle ages battles before. Quite honestly the whole quest system is a bit of a pain to go and talk to the individual lords in the keeps and cities repeatedly, but once you get to a point where you are powerful enough, you can pretty much choose your allegiance and conquer the world. I would give this an 8.5/10 and if that hasn't sold you on this yet, in the past 3 days i've racked up 12 hours of gameplay, and most of the has been in multiple hour sittings. Overall, this is an interesting play, and everyone should at least try it!			",129,68,0,20,50,4,50

												I recently got the older Mount and Blade games on Steam and I have been enjoying playing both of the older games again. While my favorite Mount and blade game is still Warband, its nice to see the roots of the series.Mount and Blade is an RPG, but there is minimal plot, and for the most part its up to you to decide your characters story. Mound and Blade games are very open ended, and have tons of stuff to do. I recommend anyone who likes RPGs try the Mount and Blade games, while there may be some other games like the Mount and Blade games out there, Mount and Blade really did find its niche, and it sure has gotten a lot of fans since then.

												Very cool RPGsimmanagement with a fun combat system.  Very dated graphics (looks like a little lower res Oblivion).  This game reminds me of a choose-your-own-adventure or an old DOS text RPG with a mix of open world and party management and a very unique, great combat style.  It's very fun to play.This is probably the smoothest running game I have ever played.  You go from menu to in-game to overworld in a fraction of a second.  No loading whatsoever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great game by default , and even better considering its mod-ability. The graphics are dated, but that is to be expected of a game released in 2007. However, if you are thinking about buying it, i would recommend you to buy the slightly updated version called ""Mount and Blade Warband"" instead, or even better, buy the collection and get them both + the DLC expansions.Then use them to learn the basics and get ready for the long awaited sequel ""Mount and Blade 2 : Bannerlord"". (don't be fooled by my low playtime, i first got this when it was in beta, then on CD, long before its Steam releas. Same with warband, but then got the collection for the DLC'c and convenience of not needing those CDs anymore)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great medival era experience. Sadly no MP for this one (Get M&B Warband if you want a multiplayer M&B game. I highly recommend buying the complete M&B pack, because you get the original M&B, Warband, w/ Fire & Sword, and Napoleonic Wars DLC for Warband (10/10 best dlc ever).Pros:Great command systemMassive battles!!!Great melee combatEasliy moddableJust about any computer can run itIn-depth archery and throwing weaponsGood variety in weaponsOpen worldVery ReplayableGood trade systemExcellent No QTEs!!! (Other than talking to people)Generally ok AICons:Bad Graphics (Understandable considering the game is old, just saying though)Non-voiced charactersPolearms are super easy to use compared to daggers and swordsOverall, M&B is great. It has few flaws, and the few it suffers from are minor. I recommend buying the Complete Pack to get a better M&B experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before i start my review i enjoyed the game but if your looking for more content and more things to do I would get Mount & Blade warband.. Reason has more things to do, fixed a lot of bugs on mount & blade and a lot more mods. Trust me and go purchase it. Its literally identical than this one..Mount & Blade is a really interesting game. You start off as a nobody and you work your way up, including your army. While you hire people for your army, you must have weapons and food for them. If no food they will leave you.You can do quest by doing small things around town and delievering messages from kings to other kings. You can always siege castles and villages if you want to get supplies.ProsBig battlesAttack villages and castlesNice inventory systemConsbusno multiplayerNot Many mods			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun game! It's an open-world game that allows you to raise armies, fight in tournaments, pillage villages, be a robber and take everything away from whomever you choose, be a lord of a castle and much more! It's really worth it if you buy it during a big sale event where it's like 50-75% off. I bought it for $10 just to realize a few days later that it was then on sale.... But yeah anyway this game is totally recommended by me! Hope this review helped!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mount&Blade and Mount&Blade: Warband are two of my  favourite games of all time, one of the best experinces you will ever have hands down, I would say the same for Mount&Blade: FIre&Sword, but it is just not as appealing due to the time frame, with gunpowder been introduced.But I would highly suggest getting all three, due to there pure enjoyment, Fantastic games, and it's one of those games you can really get into and feel like you have an importiant role to play.The game by itself is utterly amazing, but has a huge adventige due to the talented modders that make equally amazing changes to the game to give you more challangers, and more roles, and quests and much more.The Game-The Modders, they both go hand in hand to give you the most intense and extroadinary vibe you will ever experince.Do not overlook my playtime, for I played this game long before i ever got it on Steam, I would say i have easly put over 100+ hours into this game alone, not counting The other two :).

												The game is.. Good. It does not hold a candle, however, to Warband, except when it comes to mods. Mount and Blade has more, and better mods alongside it, allowing for new experiences you can't get in Warband. If, however, you want true Vanilla gameplay, Warband is your better choice. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been gaming for 30+ years and over that time I've played a lot of games. From my experience, Mount & Blade offers a unique gaming experience. Not quite like anything else I've ever played. There are some similarities to familiar games, such as shades of the Total War series, but stark enough differences that they really cannot be compared. Mount & Blade in my opinion is fairly easy to learn, but does take some skill with action type fighting to be mastered. If you enjoy strategy games with a turn based feel, mixed with real time combat, in a non-linear world; then Mount & Blade may just well be your cup of tea. I was looking for a somewhat decent strategy game that would run on my gutless business laptop and I have to say I was not expecting as good of a game as it turned out to truly be. It's got enough meat in the vanilla campaign to keep most people busy for at least 100 hours I would speculate, though I personally have already invested 200 hours into my first vanilla campaign and can see it dragging out another 100-200 easily. Beyond the vanilla game, there are apparently many mods made for this game as well. Some appear to be quite promising and I will surely be giving at least a few a spin. All in all I would highly recommend this game. I bought it on sale and was skepticle, but having now played it, I would have paid the full price and not felt shorted in any way. Well worth the money imho. + Cheap.+ Very low system requirements - should run well on most machines.+ Time consuming single player campaign (I'm not interested in a game if it can be beaten in less then 48 hours of actual gameplay).+ Easy to learn, yet unique combat system that is both fun and requires skill to master.+ High replayability due to massive amount of community mods available.- AI is not the greatest and can be stomped fight after fight once you learn it's flaws. I'm talking I have decimated a larger opposing army almost by myself. Siege AI is almost worse, you can take any city with 10 men once you have learned their flaws. They don't fare any better trying to take a city from you either. 10 men could hold off thousands if you know what you're doing.OVERALL 9/10 AND I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ANY TRUE STRATEGY FAN.

												It used to be a negative review, for I wasn't seen the need to buy this particular game, when we have Warband. But... it turns out that Warband singleplayer can't be achieved when you're not connected to Internet. So now I see the point to hold this game altogether with Warband. I suggest you to buy the whole bundle, where will be Warband, Napoleonic Wars and Fire'n'Sword.I'm in love with that game, I've bought it triple times. I've spended thousands of hours riding and hacking, over and over. Basic Mount'n'Blade runs even with the very dull PCs, like ones we use in offices, you know - with lame videocard, very short amount of RAM... it all doesn't matter! All you need is some free time (you can't play it during your working time, like some facebook flashgames) and testosterone. Yeah, I repeat - in there you'll be riding your horse and constantly brutally punish whoever gets in your way, in that glorified, one-of-a-kind simulator of medieval mercenary. If you play while connected to the Internet, and have at least a discrete videocard on your PC and 2Gb of RAM - go straight for Warband, which includes this game PLUS gorgeus multiplayer. Plus achievements, trading cards, all of stuff you'd expecting on Steam. But if you suddenly find yourself somewhere in Australia, or just on the farm where you have only outdated laptop from the early 00's... This game is one of the best that you can play out there.Game itself deserves 8.5/10 mark for its uniqueness and impact on the gaming world. Although as a sandbox RPG-like it quickly wears off, as a medieval simulator, it's just keep going. And going. And going. Much like that battery rabbit, or the Civilization game.

												Very good and well done. What it lacks in Graphics it more than makes up for in gameplay. This game truly shows that gameplay is more important, and will bring a game farther than graphics-hopefully- ever will. Warband (the sequel) is better though, since it is essentially just an expanded game with better graphics (not by much though) I would still recommend this game for mods, but if you're only going to play vanilla, than stick to Warband.

												This game is AWESOME!!!!I created a character whose father was a thief. After he disappeared whilst I was a wee lass, some tradesman took me in and taught me stuff. I then went on to poach animals for a profit... (This was all in the character creation process!)(Game starts) I rode my horse off into that direction (me thinks West) and came across 5 Looters. They weren't very nice. I wanted more of a challenge with my first real combat, so I threw all of my throwing knives away! (I actually missed. very hard. damn hard.) I spent the next 25 minutes ( I kid you not) trying to run over the little buggers with my horse. Yay!!!My review, or rather my suggestion: Use a freakin' sword!!! Add to your character at a later time the ability/usage of throwing stuff.... *whew*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I need to be clear up front on this review: the primary purpose for a negative review here, is that this version of the game has been superseded by Mount & Blade: Warband, and this original version exists inside that same updated version (with tweaks that improved it).  There is not a good reason to play this original, potentially bugged game (depending on your operating system also).  There are significant Windows 10 compatibility issues that can crop up, to the point the game is not manageable or save-able unless you're prepared to MOD this game and/or go to great lengths to use ""Compatibility Mode"" workarounds to get it to run smoothly.  I cannot recommend playing this game, but - this game is playable, as the new/improved Mount & Blade: Warband.  And also, that newer version can be played through single-player campaign style, it is not just for the additional multi-player capability.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My First Playthrough:Day 1 - Defeat trainees in close combat at the nearby Training FieldDay 2 - Patiently teach some farmers how to defend themselvesDay 4 - Successfully drive off a bandit attack on the villageDay 5 - Visit other towns and villages to recruit brave soulsDay 7 - Hunt down several bands of Looters for a town GuildDay 8 - Lose many good men in an encounter with Steppe BanditsDay 10 - Safely avoid getting caught in a battle between Swadian and Rhodok armiesDay 11 - Win the tournament of Dhirim despite harsh competitionDay 14 - Barely defeat a well-armed troop of Sea RaidersMount & Blade is a brilliant open world sand-box game that allows players to experience their own unique medieval adventure. Build up your own troop to protect trade caravans, hunt bandits and siege castles. Demonstrate your personal combat skills in tournaments to earn fame and fortune. Raid villages, ambush armies and ransom the leaders of your enemies.Overall, I recommend the game for its well polished free form gameplay, exciting soundtrack and decent graphics. The game has aged well, as reflected in the large number of fan mods available. However, new players may find it better to purchase the Mount & Blade: Warband expansion instead for the updated graphics, additional features and overall improved experience.			",45,14,0,9,3,0,3

												Mount & Blade is still considerably fun for a game so old now. After I went through Bungie's Destiny I came back to this Medieval knight simulator. The base game is pretty fun, but what made this game for me was a mod made by the community. If you have this game I would recommend getting the Star Wars Conquest mod if you've burned yourself out on the base game. I can't speak for everyone, but I personaly got my money's worth of entertainment out of the game. However, you should probably buy M&B with Fire and Sword if you are looking at base gameplay alone, as it is the same price.			",16,0,0,4,3,0,5

												Where to start with this game? Let's just say, Mount and Blade has given me many hours of a great game and tough battles. This game is what every Strategy/RPG hybrid should look up to. Mount and Blade has a lot of replayability, as akin to its descendant Mount and Blade Warband. The gameplay is great, fun and rewarding. Altough the actual combat is rather clunky in terms of animations, the game is very well developed. All the Mount and Blade series needs now is a game that has a multiplayer/co-op overhead map gamemode (Mount and Blade Bannerlord, I'm looking at you.). Mount and Blade is a really good game, I would recommend it to anyone who is skeptical about genre hybrids. 8/10			",337,79,6,44,62,4,80

												Mount & Blade- A medieval game that captures the feeling of being a knight pretty well. It's really awesome, especially since it's a open world game. So far things were going for my adventurer, named S9y The Unbeyond. I had a decent party size, was doing quests. Money in my pocket.... Until then I accidentally joined in a war. Now I know what you're thinking...How does someone accidentally join a war?!Well.... You see I had a quest to stop this war with 2 kingdoms, and the only way was to convince the lords to stop fighting... Which of course, didn't work, because the lords' wanted 7200 denars to stop, or you could persuade one of them, at the sacrifice of our friendship. But I wasn't friends with any of them, so to become one of the lords' friend, I did some quests. This was working... Until I got a quest about meeting a spy. I skimmed over it, and accepted not thinking of what this would do. Then as I soon I pressed it, 3 other kingdoms had declared me a enemy.. Even though I went back and declined the quest. So.. I couldn't stop the war, and the time to complete the quest ran out. So now I'm unintentionally in a war, with 3 other kingdoms.Oops.Other than than that, nothing eventful happened. It was really just a typical afternoon. (At least I'm getting paid to fight in this war.) 8/10 Would accidentally war again.			",9,3,0,3,3,0,0

												Mount & Blade is my new obsession! This game is a sandbox rpg that really gives you the freedom to do what you want. Want to raid villages? Do it. Start wars? Do it. Make money being a merchant? Do it. The graphics aren't much, and the combat feels kind of stiff, but the game manages to really capture your imagination. It's unique blend of freedom, charm, and overall feel, really creates a game that you can sink a ton of time into. Well worth the time, and money. I can't wait for Bannerlords to release! More Mount & Blade goodness on the way.			",26,4,0,8,0,0,3

												This is one of the best games I have ever played.  Im not sure what ""hardcore"" gamers consider as playing a game a lot.  But, I docked about 110 hours of this thing in just a week.  Any tips for future players would be: The swadians screw you over the most, the rhodoks are just plain bad, and the Kerghit take way way longer to fight because all they have is horses and they just run around with their sheilds up.  The battle time from fighting Rhodoks may be well under 3 minutes, but fighting Kerghit, a single battle might last up to twenty minutes.  I timed it.  I dont know if I just have the crappiest luck on the planet, but that was how long the battles lasted.  My least favorite faction is still the swadians though.  They are the most annoying.  Play this game, very very very good game.			",40,3,0,6,4,1,3

												Awesome Medieval strategy with elements of FPS fighting, RPG quests, politics and trade. Immersive open world with ever changing balance. Your actions influence local economy and the world.Battles are FPS-style, but are somewhat optional. Although I recommend using FPS battles, because besieging castles is so cool!PROS:- large world- immersive gameplay- huge replayability potential- variety of quests- trade- cool FPS siege gameplayMEH:- oldish graphicsCONS:- some quests become repetitive- tournaments are fun, unless you get the lance which is impossible to handle- FPS battles become longish especially when your enemy is losing and you need to kill this one last horseman, but can't get him for 5 minutesI hear Warband is better. But if you have this game, it's really good too. And regularly sold in bundles.HUGE RECOMMENDATION, 9/10.			",157,83,9,22,24,1,41

												This game. This motherf*ckin game...i stumbled on this so unexpectedly, and honestly this is probably one of the most fun games ive played this year, despite it being 7-8 years old at this point. My laptop is in no way a gaming laptop, it has a crappy integrated graphics card - that being the case when i downloaded the demo for this i entirely expected it to playback at 5-10fps at BEST, moreso expecting a crash on start up...that was not the case, this game runs beautifully on a weak machine, even at high settings!That was just the icing on the cake though - this game is everything ive been looking for in a medieval type RPG. It has decent graphics, a complex character skill tree, no set story, an open world map, OH and no fricken wizards or stupid magical influences, just good old steel.If youve been looking for an open world medieval rpg with LEGIT combat, this is your game, no turn based combat, just good timing on your part to make a good kill.

												Mount & Blade is a game that wants to be it all and while the lack of polish makes it fail in a lot of places the solid design behind it all makes it succeed in many more.At it's core Mount & Blade is a hack and slash game, and by that I don't mean one button for light swing, one button for power swing. Using either mouse or keyboard you can select a myriad of different attacks and blocks depending on the weapon you're using as you engage in high intensity melee's with hundreds of opponents.You play the game in two modes, the world map and the battle map. The world map is where you walk your hero across the land, recruit soldiers, buy weapons and goods and find bands of enemies to fight. When you go into battle you are transported onto a procedurally generated battle map where you get you fight your enemies with whatever weapons and soldiers are at your disposal. Although both of these modes are plagued with a number of bugs and rather noticeable lack of polish the core of the fighting remains fun and challenging and makes you forgive the flaws you may encounter.Graphically Mount & Blade is nothing too impressive. It's full of rough edges and flat surfaces and you know it's an indie title when you play it. The sound is similarly lacking and not much to talk about.But despite all it's flaws this is just one of those few rare games that manages to live through a low budget, bad tech and broken features through a strong and simple core mechanic. The fighting is excellent and there are enough mods available to remedy many of the problems on the world map. Although this is a title that will never quite feel like it should be classic it still manages to hold a strong place in your memory.Although this is an excellent game that I throughly enjoyed playing it is not one I would recommend you buy these days simply because the Warband standalone expansion is pretty much just an updated version of this.

												Sank over 80 hours into this game in about two weeks (and not because I was doing nothing else). Pros: Combat system is similar to what I'd been dreaming up to maybe make a mod for a Bethesda game, battles are an epic scale for a game (size can be changed in options, mine's set to 100), realistic enough for immersion, not so realistic as to be frustrating (in general), great arena system, good fief management (though I'm still having trouble making my villages more prosperous, which would probably be easier if I gave it some attention instead of constantly charging into battle, but who cares). Cons: no magic (but three types of projectile, mounted combat, etc. make up for it in my opinion), graphics (not a big deal to me, computer isn't great anyway, and it's an old game, so not surprising), no multiplayer option (though sequels have it and npcs are good enough and more likely to respond to commands if you have authority), can't personally become a monarch or promote vassals (though again, sequels), no real tutorial outside of combat (pointers: hire soldiers before traipsing around bandit-infested territory, don't accept quests with targets deep in enemy territory, etc.). All in all, not too surprising that it's already my 4th-most played game on Steam.			",65,5,1,18,11,0,15

												If this game looks good to you, I suggest Mount & Blade: Warband. Warband simply has more features, although this is practically the same game. Warband has a multiplayer, more immersive gameplay and includes the ability to rule your own kingdom; which this lacks. It is simply not a good idea to buy both this and Warband, you will likley be disapointed, unless of course you buy the full collection. So basically my advice is, either buy Warband by itself, or the full collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wonderful open world where you can go where you want and do what you want. You can bring villains to justice(probably one of your first jobs), gain wealth via trade or loose by being robbed. You can join one of the political factions and even marry into nobility. As a consequence you will be given your own fief and can(actually will be expected to) participate in warfare against rivaling factions. Apart from ""regular warfare"" you can hunt down thiefs and bandits and if you don't choose your opponents carefully enough be hunted down by them. :P If you want to you can even compete with others in tournaments.All of this you can get at a really laughable price - I don't know about the prices where you live but it probably costs you less than a package of ... tiny sticks of bad material I am not supposed to mention. :) It's quite old by now but I still like it and have some fond memories of it.Unfortunately it seems to have some issues with more recent Win versions. :(			",25,7,1,15,9,0,19

												Medieval action games are rather hard to find. Now you will say:''But Mr. Recommender, there are tons and tons of Medieval action games! Look at Oblivion and Dark Messiah!'' To wich I reply with: ''No you silly people, these games involve a lot of FANTASY!'' Not that that is a bad thing, but sometimes I just want HUMANS doing HUMAN THINGS. Mount and Blade has such a thing going on, but we still get some fantasy. Mongolian raiders, and Vikings can gleefully fight eachother in this game for example. Combat took a bit of time to get used too for me, but once you get better, create your own personal army and join a faction, oh boy all hell can break lose. Beware tough..getting captured is no fun..oh and don't forget to stock up on food..and being able to pay your soldiers..and not upsetting mighty lords..and behaving knightly. You can do pretty much whatever you want, but beware that angry lords will ACTIVELY HUNT YOU DOWN on sight. All in all a great game and one of my all-time favs.			",148,17,3,11,7,1,34

												This is kind of a dead game once Warband came out. Honestly, just get Warband. It's the same game with improved mechanics. There were some issues with the original that were smoothed out there. Example are the horses during charges.With that being said, if you purchase this game, you will not be disapointed. It has a historic setting with real factions, kings, Jarls, etc. The graphics are not the best. This isn't a call of duty or battlefield, don't expect it to be. Ever want to be a soldier, a lord, or even a king/queen? Here you go. You recruit an army, raise it, level it, and choose what kind of an army it will be. Want an army full of archers or crossbowmen? Go for it. Or, do you have a passion for the pagan at heart? Than command your army of Nord Huskarls in to battle. It's a game of strategy along with you command your character in to battle with your troops. If you've ever played Kessen, this is kind of like it except remove the feel of turn base aspect in a way. Instead of turn base, when you stop in the map, the game pauses. Once in battle though you can choose to just tell your troops what to do or get involved yourself. Choice is yours. For beginners, it may look like dynasty warriors but don't just rush in lol. It's not how that works here, that's not how any of that works. This game is where you go when you graduate Dyanasty Warriors. Pros:- Character Customization- RPG style leveling- Troop customization (troop type, not look)- Troop leveling based on usage- Quests- No real need to do the quests if you don't want- Be a bandit- Be a lord- Be a ruler (harder than it may seem. All fun and games until the world declares war on you)- Trading (you can live your life here as a merchant trader without ever joining a faction)- Trading (you can either do the normal every day trading OR you can be a manhunterish that takes prisoner of bandits or even villagers and sells them to slave traders or ransom brokers. Slave traders don't care who you sell, ransom brokers are similar but give more money).Cons:- Horse mechanics a little screwy but nothing game breaking.- Warband is out (Do yourself a favor, all this is in warband plus more for about the same price)- Graphics. Not a con but considering Viking conquests animations, this one is a bit outdated nowAs a side note that can be considered either a pro or con. It can be difficult to get started. If you like a small challenge, awesome because there will be a learning curve initially. Not a huge one but it's there. Expect to be taken prisoner a few times before you learn your lesson and expect to forget that lesson and do it all over again a few times lol.Mount and Blade: Warband (Mount and Blade, the better version)Mount and Blade: Viking Conquest (Latest expansion. More difficult, larger battles, more mechanics, new factions, Pagan and Christain subfaction mechanic)There are two others as well but they are not like the previous three. Fire and Sword brings you to the polish commonweath during the days of muskets. Napoleonic is a multiplayer and custom battle only expansion during the French Revolution.			",26,1,0,8,4,0,5

												Mount & Blade is a very addictive game. I spent 8 hours straight playing the game, and never got my eye off the screen. However, the losses on the game is very hard to recover from. From one moment, you have a 200 man army. In a blink of an eye, you men are all gone, and you must spend another 5 or 10 hours finding more men. One time that I was playing, I lost a battle, and I could not see my character. The camera was shown onto the water. Overall, this is a very good game, with a lot of problems and glitches.

												A fun and innovative medieval style RPG with an open world aspect that has loads of features. You start off as a lone wolf working for small villages then working your way up to the kingdoms. You can be hired as a hitman or scout around enemy towns and learn of weak spots to engage. You can join any one of the kingdoms but by gaining new friends you also gain new enemies. You engage your enemies in an open battlefield with changing terrain and changing weather conditions so no battle is ever the same. You have an arsenal of weapons, armor, and horse at your disposal so feel free to acquire as much as you want. If you are feeling like making some money easily then you can sign up for tournaments and fight your way to victory. Mount and Blade is an amazing RPG that deserves more recognition. Warband may be fun but you can never beat an original.			",371,58,4,49,2,1,15

												Personally I like this better than Warband. Trying to do a directional attack in Warband is really stiff now, I'd try to do a right directional attack and for some reason it'd think I want to do a stab. This version is a lot easier to attack in, and I'd rather play this one even if it means I'm missing out on the multiplayer (nothing special really imo) and other great features of the Warband campaign. Very good game for medieval warfare, no magic, just real medieval life.			",245,25,4,44,17,1,15

The game really reaches its peak about 20/30 hours in, when your character is strong enough - and your army large enough - to take on each realm's king and his massive personal guard. The only real issue is that there's too much sandbox: your goal is to ""make a name for yourself."" Which would be fine and dandy if you were allowed to become a king and unite the country; however, you're specifically forbidden from doing this. You're told flat-out at the beginning of the game that you can't become king. Kind of obnoxious. Also, you can't kill empires, as noblemen live forever and will swarm cities until they can re-establish their clan. So one you reach that point where a normal RPG would reward you with huge tracts of land, you instead export your character and start all over again, but this time with insanely high skills that let you fight just about anything and really screw with the early-game dynamic. Almost makes up for that whole not-being-a-king thing.			",53,21,1,16,24,1,36

												If you like huge, expansive games that combine the strategy and patience elements of an RTS  and the skill of a third person medieval combat game, you will love Mount & Blade. Starting out as a lone mercenary and slowly gaining your army  by completing quests, killing/capturing enemy patrols, etc you eventually can conquer the entire map under your flag. This game takes A LOT of patience, but is incredibly fun and the replay value is incredibly high.			",259,52,5,35,38,3,55

												I have spent many hours playing this shining treasure of a game over the last 4 years or so, and it has been one of the single greatest games I have ever played. The first time I played it, I thought to myself that I would never get anywhere in this mass-scale, fast-paced simulator of medieval combat. However, I now have eliminated the entire faction of my arch-enemy, The Kingodm of Swadia, and have full control over what used to be their lands. The Swadian king and his trusted vassels now rot in my vast dungeons like the pigs they are. And any who I have failed to capture, have been murdered by my most trusted allies, the Vaegir.All in all, this is one of the best games known to mankind, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone. 8/8 It's Gr8 M8			",139,12,3,16,12,0,29

												I was reading thru some reviews on a newer version of this game and ran into multiple people saying things like they cant believe they didnt know this game existed.  This stoked my interests.  I went to this games review page and found the same sort of thing being said about it.  I like to try the first game of a series before i try any of the newer one's.  I figure the only reason there is a second or thrid game in a series is because the first one rocked.  Plus its usally a cheaper way to get a taste of what a game series is all about.The game is fantastic and i also cant believe i didnt know of this game until now.  If i ever finish this one ill most certainly be trying the rest of the series.  Maybe not the newest one with guns, i can get that in 100 different flavors already.			",69,12,0,21,34,1,47

												It has quite a rough unpolished feel with low tech simplistic interface but the gameplay will consume hours and hours of your time.I love how this game creates emergent non-linear stories.So goes the tale of the Bacon Hero, a clueless adventurer who on the very first day of his journey, was captured by bandits and taken to far away lands before escaping. There, he befriended a local nobleman, negotiated for peace between waring kingdoms, herded cattle, protected the honour of a noblewoman and raided the many maruaders that littered the country side. Eventually, this adventurer, from hopeless beginnings, rose to become tournament champion and Lord Vassal of a great nation. This is just the beginning however, for the road ahead will be paved with many more battles, each either bringing bountiful victories or devastating defeats.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mount & Blade. What an epic game! Yes, it's graphics are horrid, and yes, there are a few small bugs left in there, but wow, I'm currently clocked in at 63 hours, and I know that I've at least a few more days to go until I'm satisfied with this game, and even then, I'll probably make a new character just to follow another king.This game is amazing, terrific, wonderful, and much more! Combine the combat of Chivalry and the overworld trading business with the flash game ""Caravaneer"", and this is a lot better yet. After you get through the slow tutorial, it's a challenging, yet EXTREMELY rewarding climb from nothing to king, one that 63 hours in, I have yet to achieve. The feeling of training peasants to fight bandits, then watching them go at it right afterward is epic and makes you feel like you've made a significant difference to their lives. The first army you take on and defeat leaves you gasping for breath, sweat on your forhead, and prideful of your newfound superiority. Now we get to move on to the big guns: Taking fortresses and fortefied cities! And that's a LOT more fun than it sounds!There is one big problem that has to be addressed, and that is the games difficulty. I had no problem with difficulty because I had all the options set to easiest (so that I feel like a boss), but I'm on ""22% difficulty"". If you are someone who can't stand playing on Easy, then this might be a bit rough for you and your armies.I cannot reccomend this game enough, ecspecially to those who love build-your-army type games! Once you have a feel for all the weaponry (small changes make big differences), and what race of soldier can accomplish what, you can progress rather well, and this game has been nothing but fun all the way!But it! It's super cheap, buy it!			",52,14,0,10,12,1,13

												Mount & Blade. What an epic game! Yes, it's graphics are horrid, and yes, there are a few small bugs left in there, but wow, I'm currently clocked in at 63 hours, and I know that I've at least a few more days to go until I'm satisfied with this game, and even then, I'll probably make a new character just to follow another king.This game is amazing, terrific, wonderful, and much more! Combine the combat of Chivalry and the overworld trading business with the flash game ""Caravaneer"", and this is a lot better yet. After you get through the slow tutorial, it's a challenging, yet EXTREMELY rewarding climb from nothing to king, one that 63 hours in, I have yet to achieve. The feeling of training peasants to fight bandits, then watching them go at it right afterward is epic and makes you feel like you've made a significant difference to their lives. The first army you take on and defeat leaves you gasping for breath, sweat on your forhead, and prideful of your newfound superiority. Now we get to move on to the big guns: Taking fortresses and fortefied cities! And that's a LOT more fun than it sounds!There is one big problem that has to be addressed, and that is the games difficulty. I had no problem with difficulty because I had all the options set to easiest (so that I feel like a boss), but I'm on ""22% difficulty"". If you are someone who can't stand playing on Easy, then this might be a bit rough for you and your armies.I cannot reccomend this game enough, ecspecially to those who love build-your-army type games! Once you have a feel for all the weaponry (small changes make big differences), and what race of soldier can accomplish what, you can progress rather well, and this game has been nothing but fun all the way!But it! It's super cheap, buy it!			",52,14,0,10,12,1,13

												Overall: so much fun! You get a great combination of action in the medieval combat, strategy in the larger scale battles, and role-playing game classics such as choosing alliances and missions, leveling up, and suiting up.With that said, the role-playing aspect couldn't be considered truly complete on its own. Your personal relationships with lords, for instance, does indeed evolve somewhat and have an impact on the options available to you, but the relationship mechanisms in place are a little shallow. This part of the game sort of comes across as a roleplaying sandbox and only a stick to dig with. Combat and looting also suffer some issues, but overall the combat system is pretty satisfying (though you'll see what I'm talking about when you're trying to pick up weapons in the tournaments). A variety of fairly viable combat styles are available to your character, though you'll usually have to adapt to the context of the battle. Speaking of the battle contexts, you're offered a number of different scenarios, from open battles on the field to raiding throne rooms to laying siege to cities or castles. You can thus get a nice taste sword and shield battle atop a wall as well hit-and-run with mounted archery in the field. These styles and contexts also flow nicely out of the nature of your army and their background, with the Khergit, Swadians, Rhodoks, Vaegirs, and Nords differing significantly in their typical strategies. For many people that enjoy these games, the tactics surrounding match ups between these factions is the heart of what makes the game unique.Anyway, overall awesome. I look forward to trying the Warband expansion where some things will be fixed and some content will be added.			",57,8,0,9,8,0,17

												While the human models can stray into Uncanny Valley, the rest of the game looks rather good. The combat system is great, with momentum mattering; as an example, if you charge someone with a horse and slice them as you pass by, you'll do more damage. It also makes it feel like an accomplishment when you storm over the castle walls and claim what is rightfully yours. Diplomacy also plays a large part in the game, but you never feel forced to do one thing or another, because this game is completely sandbox. Give it a shot!			",126,44,5,21,15,2,14

												Definitely one of the best games I've ever played. M&B has nearly all what a good game needs for me. Interesting story, tactics in battles (not much), fighting, besieging castles, exploring the world and meet the different peoples and finally rule your own kingdom which is as difficult as in the beginning when you have just started the game. M&B Warband got new graphics, M&B Bannerlord will be equal to his predecessors but with better graphics, game mechancs, modding improvements, ...			",256,26,15,34,36,2,55

												Sometimes good aspects of a game set such an high standard of game fun that it can not be brought down by any negative aspects. ""Mount and blade"" is such a game in my opinion. So I wanted to evaluate X reasons ""mound and blade"" is a good and fun game in spite of many downsides. And I came up with 5 reasons which are as follows.But firstly lets quickly sum up the downsides of the game which are as follows: very low variety in different quests, no over the top skill tree or leveling system, bad (too much texture based) graphics, lifeless surroundings, shallow economy, no in-story character development.-The fact that there is no story at all benefits the game in a great deal and makes mount and blade an unique project. As the game gives the player total freedom. Or put in other words this freedom gives the player endless possibilities, endless time to achieve your personal goals ore level your character and troops into the wanted team, endless opportunities, endless ways of doing the same thing.-Huge vacuum for players own imagination gives the player the opportunity to create his own story. Because as the player plays the game presented in its rather dull graphic and with no quest- or story-forced job to do the players mind wanders of and creates its own things to do, its own goals to achieve, its own realm, its own disputes between companions, kings, marshals, soldiers, its own wars, its own loves and friendships and therefore it creates the perfect game for each individual player.-The battle and combat system is like tailor made for the game as it hast the right demand of needed skill but is not as of-putting to newcomers as many other games.-The huge amount of mods created by a very active community helps the game allot because with the scenario change created by new mods the passion for the game is inflamed again.-Connected with the total freedom and the great variety of mods the replayeable factor of the game is (nearly to) high.http://architectonreview.blogspot.com.tr/2017/04/5-reasons-mount-and-blade-is-good-and.html ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hey guys, I am bringing you antoher review for a game that I have in my Steam Library. AHHHH! Mount and Blade, we had some great memories, murdering people, raiding villages, and just plain out cursing others out. Well, I remeber this game when it was just a little subreddit when it wasnt good, but then it grew in a huge, massive game which then made the production of good games like Mount and Blade: Warband. Hey, you know what else grows and is really huge elephants. Elephants are very essential to life in this game. AWW... who am I kidding, there are no elephants, but i wish there were. Anyway, the updates for this game are dead and there wont be any. You know what else needs updates...Deez Nu- No, just no, I hate that meme. JK, it da best.Do you know what other memes are there...JOHN CENA...

												It's a bit difficult to get the hang of this game in the beginning, but as you continue on you'll find yourself enjoying this game a lot and playing it for hours straight. Making an army to fight other lords that are your enemy or just in your way gets you in huge battles that are the most interesting and enjoyable part of this game. Riding on the back of your horse and shooting your bow is just so much fun to do. Charging into an enemy and to swing your sword into his body to see a nice number of damage pop up gives you just a good feeling of an accomplishment, because it's pretty hard to do. It might get a bit boring after playing it for a while since it's a bit repetitive, but I can easyally say that this is one of my favourite medieval themed game that I've played so far.

												I like this one better than the other two. The multiplayer added is minorly related to the actual game.Riding around being a Mongol lord and tearing sheets up. Fun game, definite time sink, good job paradox.			",77,12,0,25,13,2,24

												I bought this because I love medieval games, and playing Skyrim was quite hard to top. However, this game was everything I wanted. You go from city to city, gathering troops and fighting intense battles. It has tight combat, money is harder to obtain, providing a challenge, and its so open ended. This is without a doubt one of the greatest games ive ever bought. And I got it on sale for only 3 dollars!!!! This game is everything a medeival fanatic like myself needs.

												Start off as a no-name, medieval warrior and, through determination and valor, make yourself into a powerful noble.  It may be basic in its execution of certain role-playing elements, but the level of freedom that Mount and Blade allows is exceptional.  Besides the raiding,  questing, and politicking you can do, you even get to simultaneously command and participate in battles.  There's nothing quite like ordering your infantry to engage an enemy force while you lead a cavalry charge against their flank, or gathering your warriors to your side to rush forth from a siege tower to assault your enemy's ramparts.If you've ever wondered what it's like to be a feudal lord, this is your game.

												I had a village. I loved my village. Enemy invade and took over my village, so I took over half of the enemy's kingdom and now I rule it. Raided the enemy's villages, and have a large party that the enemy is scared of me.  15/10 would buy again.Aside from that, I like the AI and battling is also really fun. You can learn skills that can improve your battle and attacks. There's a lot of things you can do, such as raiding villages, taking over castles, participate in tournaments, take part in battles (from small battles against bandits/looters, to massive battles against kings of other factions with several hundred people) etc.However it's very similar to M&B: Warband with some changes and features.Graphics aren't super high quality, but the overall game play is really fun, and it doesn't require a super beefy computer to play.Edit (Nov/23/2016):To this day, I still enjoy this game. However I recommend Warband over this. This is a more simple version of Warband. Warband has a lot more features, workshop support, etc. #SteamAwards2016			",172,14,7,26,12,0,22

												The entire mount and blade series has been worth every penny I have spent on it and more. You can not as for much more for what your paying for. Not only is it a RTS, It's also a thirds person (shooter/Slasher). From mounted archery and sword play to castle raiding. From being Emperor, to a peasant if your into in depth game play this game is worth the Bills.Pros-indepth story and character developement-character relationship building with lords, kings and queens around you.-merchant, caravaning, army building or just tournament champion.-Relationship building with towns and cities.Cons-Will absorb your free time.-A little dated, that being said it's counter parts have better graphics.Worth every penny, steam deal or full price. Warband is better, aswell as the sequal after but it's worth playing through first.			",274,6,2,28,5,1,31

												Have I not yet written a review on this? That is because every time I go into steam I thought of nothing else but playing this game. Hole- ee - sheeat. This game...is...ridiculously AMAZING!! This is a mideval combat simulator sandbox real-time-strategy-esque rpg adventure. Why is it not famous? Because its made by indie devs (very successful ones at that) This comes with the advantage of having extremely down to earth devs, who have made this game as gamers. Have you ever wanted to live in mideval times? Here ya go. There are 5 kingdoms, each who contest for ultimate domination. Neither can maintain peace or decide on total war. There are kingdoms, such as the Nords, based on the Vikings....or the Kerghit Khans, based on Genghis Khan or Attila the Hun...or Vaegers, based on Russians. Many more. It's one helluvan amazing game, as you create a character (totally awesome character creater, and can edit at any time), and are thrown in the middle of it all.

You know your men died for you. They took the arrow so that you may not. That makes victory all the more bittersweet.

The game has excellent replayability, chose to join any faction or if you would prefer exterminate all who come across your path. Mount and Blade also has a few great mods on Desura.com.

												PLEASE READ THIS (or scroll to the end for a VERY helpful link):I had NO IDEA there was something more addictive than Heroin.I am speechless... My whole life I have searched for a game such as this one. I recently returned to a life of intense gaming and it was easy to find. I got all of the M&B games in a package and I can't wait to try the other ones, I hear they're even MUCH better. HOW CAN IT GET BETTER THAN THIS?! I know that M&B fans will back me on this: I HAVE NEVER FELT SO MUCH PART OF A GAME BEFORE. I am speechless, this is like being in a knight's movie. This is EVERYTHING you will ever dream of when it comes to a realistic, respectful, professional and just an awesome awesome game. I know my review is not professional but I can't stay here and write this stuff while I can have another minute of M&B. SO much to do in this game. From what I understood so far, if you could do it as a knight in real life, you can do it in the game. This is the Ultimate Knight's Game! It's like a Medival Arma when it comes to the versatility of the game. Just frickin get it and you will not regret it. I made a poor merchant pay a toll to pass a road... He could have finished me in a minute but he didn't want any trouble! It was so realistic, something that would probably also happen in real life. The game is so no cheesy, so well thought out, GET IT GET IT GET IT!Click this link to learn about the best build: http://mountandblade.wikia.com/wiki/Character_creation15/10!

												I like how you can do whatever you like, you can become a vassal, or mercenary. You can build huge army, and conquer whole Calradia. Battle mechanics are great, and I even don't mind lack of graphic details, or lack of interaction between player, and things like doors, and chests. What I don't like (and what completely spoiled a game after 29h played) is no ending.  You can conquer whole land as vassal, or rebel, but there's no point.			",10,0,1,3,2,0,1

												It doesn't get much sandboxier than this. Mount & Blade puts you in the role of an adventurer in a land torn apart by wars, both civil and regular. Build your band of mercenaries, perform errands for kings, train the villagers to defend themselves, and shoot your bow from horseback (good luck with that last one).Mount & Blade is like Elder Scrolls on crack. Much less structured storyline, much bigger sandbox. This is what I imagine a Game of Thrones game would be like.The political systems are really cool, but combat has a pretty steep learning curve. Play the tutorial, then play through the training missions in-game. And srsly, if you can shoot a bow from horseback with any accuracy, my hat's off to ya. I think it might actually be easier in real life. Never ridden a horse, but I've shot a bow, and that's a lot harder in this game than it is in my backyard.Sword and board is a lot like Oblivion or Skyrim, but more... I dunno. Just better. You have finer control.A-. This is one of those games that I keep meaning to go back to, but then realize that I'd have to start all over from scratch because I don't remember how to play.

												Life is short if you're not on a horse: the game.Holy cow is this game addictive!  The very first thing I noticed was that the graphics are a bit dated; there are sprites and menus that could use some work, and some of the animations have some glitches here and there.  It just doesn't have the polish and motion capture sparkle of modern games and I thought that would translate into me hating it.  But, the actual game play is addictive and exhilerating.Start off with the fact that this game is a sandbox.  You are not the chosen one, the world does not revolve around your actions, your story is exactly what you make it and nothing more.  This means you travel where you want, do what you want and you weather the consequences.  I got the feeling that I was a very small cog in a very big machine and for once I felt like a game gave me a sense of perspective.The strategic map offers it's own set of challenges as forces of varying strength roam the world looking for fights.  You have to pick your battles, and keep your eyes open for opportunities.  Then when you get on the battlefield, it is all hard charging and bloodshed and life just being awful for footsoldiers.  Honestly, I've gotten to the point where the biggest threat to me is a cramp in my axe arm, and I feel a little bad for those poor schmucks on the other side of the map.  The action could use some tinkering, but I've been having so much fun playing it, I can't say that it is really broken.I bought this game on sale and got my money's worth.  It's worth more than that.  I've had a lot of fun!			",52,12,0,12,13,0,20

												I have spent the last month of my gaming history pretty much exclusively playing this, and every moment of it was a blast! The game blends RPG elements with Empire building and real-time combat in a convincing and realistic medieval world (extremely rare in the genre!). Unlike most games M&B doesn't even try to hide the darker aspects of the middle ages but embraces them: women don't have anything to say, the aristocracy reigns supreme and slavery is everywhere. Human life is cheap, and you are a foreigner who has yet to make a name for him/her self when you start your adventure in the fictonal land of Calradia.You will find no elves, trolls or magic spells in this game. You will find a grim world modelled after Europe and parts of the middle east and Asia in the Dark Ages. The adventruring/empire management interface is clunky, but the battles are truly brutal. Especially castle sieges are good fun. Expect to see your character covered in arrows and gore at the end of the battle!			",34,4,0,17,20,0,41

												Best combat on horse or foot that I've played so far. Realistic combat mechanics, both on foot and mounted; the game's strong point is a simulation of combat on horseback.Visually impressive even though this game is already a few years old. The environment rendering like the dynamic lighting of day and night cycles and occasional weather effects like fog or rain are convincing. Graphic details are very much customizable.Game is very flexible and non-linear; you are free to do as you please; stay neutral or pick sides, hunt bandits or do quests, in any order and at your own pace. Issue tactical commands during 1st person battle or strategic commands on the world map. Strategic commands are only available after joining a faction and after being elected as the marshal.Use your marshal appointment to mobilize a huge battalion and engage on a war path OR NOT. NPC AI in battle and pathfinding is adequate. If the lords are not mobilized, they will most likely patrol or do their own thing; they may also occasionally attempt to besige a castle but they will not coordinate with other lords unless you're not the marshal but just one of the house lords, in which case, another marshall will coordinate the army. So if you don't want the game to end so soon, don't coordinate a castle siege.Though character class is non-existent, role-playing elements are quite extensive. Distribute attributes & skill points to your preferred style of play. Weapon proficiency increases through usage. Neither magic nor alchemy is needed here; the setting of this game is medieval fiction rather than mythological fantasy but it has enough interesting elements, depth of gameplay & replayability to draw you back and try something new.Ahh, before I end this lengthy justification of a recommendation, I do have a few gripes about M&B, albeit minor ones. One is that morale of the party gradually goes down over time; the bigger the party the faster it declines and morale only gets a major boost after a major battle is won, this makes it virtually imperative to look for trouble to keep the troops happy even though they are always paid on time and adequately supplied with a variety of food types. If the troops do not get their fix of adrenaline they may eventually desert your party. Luckily bandits roam about all the time, you just have to be fast enough to nail them. As you might have guessed by now, the other thing is that troop maintenance is high, so you got to constantly fight in tournaments, look for quests, sell loot, sell prisoners to the slave market, or collect taxes but by far the most lucrative way of earning money is placing bets in the tournaments, looting enemy villages or extorting from enemy caravans. No rest for the weary.Despite its aggravating tendencies, this game does integrates aspects of role-play, strategy, action and simulation equally well in a neat polished package and this kind of inclusive gameplay I have not seen nor played before, hence my recommendation.

												Here's the deal with Mount & Blade. When it was released it was epic. Seriously one of the best RPGs you could find. Simple enough to grasp the concepts quickly and yet with enough depth to surprise you after even 30 hours played. Everyon who played it, loved it. Then Taleworld released M&B Warband. And everyone felt a little cheated. Reason being it revealed that the original M&B was essentially a Beta. Warband had all the little things that M&B was missing. Starting your own nation, getting married for political purposes, even a health meter for your horse.Then came Fire and Sword. Bleh.Warband is the game I would recomend, especially if your going un-modded or just small mods.  But my real recomendation is that you buy M&B and then get the LOTR mod overhaul. This is the best mod ever. Complete Lord of The Rings overhaul. the guys who made this spent 4 years on it. Incredible. Well worth the $10 bucks you'd spend on this game.			",48,13,0,8,5,0,0

												This BASIS of this game is good but believe me when I tell you there is a whole crap ton on which this game could be improved. The ONLY reason I play this game is because of it's concepts and stuff you can do. The combat and graphics can only be described with one word: Choppy. I have a harder time killing peasant farmer than I do Sea Raiders...And then there's the fact that there is no in between when it come to high level fights and low level fights. You either take on the extemely powerful lords that take everything you own and leave you in the dust or fight the low level Sea Raiders or other enemies that you only rarely get to fight because they're too busy running away from you in terror. There is nothing in between those. My main diagnosis is that the developers are extremly talented people with great imagination that somewhere along the line of this game just gave up.

												This Medievil sandbox game is fun, enjoying and relaxing to play. The comabt is simplistic but also fun. The choices in this game are many from making your own empire to helping an already existing faction take over or just hop around each faction being a mercenary. The gameplay is easy to understand and fun and the added need of strategy in some battles makes the game that much more fun. However, the graphics as well as customization are to be desired as character customization is quite rough and very few options exists for facial hair, hair color, hair styles, and overall facial features. The graphics are there but look rough and edgy making the game hard to really appreciate it's true beauty. This game also boast an impressive skill set allowing for you to spec into many different weapons as well as skills and attributes. This game gets an overall of 8/10 with the graphics and customization spoiling it's potential.			",7,4,0,8,3,0,3

												I really like this game. Leading armies into battle and tearing people up is extremely satisfying. Warband is supposedly better than this in every way. I really want to play it but it bluescreens my computer for whatever reason and it corrupts steam so I have to reinstall all my games. This happened twice. I think it's my computer's fault though. So for sure get Mount and Blade Warband.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This Medievil sandbox game is fun, enjoying and relaxing to play. The comabt is simplistic but also fun. The choices in this game are many from making your own empire to helping an already existing faction take over or just hop around each faction being a mercenary. The gameplay is easy to understand and fun and the added need of strategy in some battles makes the game that much more fun. However, the graphics as well as customization are to be desired as character customization is quite rough and very few options exists for facial hair, hair color, hair styles, and overall facial features. The graphics are there but look rough and edgy making the game hard to really appreciate it's true beauty. This game also boast an impressive skill set allowing for you to spec into many different weapons as well as skills and attributes. This game gets an overall of 8/10 with the graphics and customization spoiling it's potential.			",7,4,0,8,3,0,3

												Let me put it to you this way, what can't you do in this game and I bet it is in the minor leagues versus on what you can do in this game. You can help any nation any town out, take them over, own slaves to do your bidding or turn them into your workers or men at arms to fight along side you. The things that take place in this game and all the stuff you can do is redonkulouse. One of my favorite sims of all time, you need to get this so you can understand what I mean. You can over throw entire kingdoms, make back ally treaties to over throw the king or any province, you can turn provinces against each other. This game is just to amazing not to get.

												Fantastic game. Still worth playing today due to the mods made for it; my personal favourite being The Last Days of the Third Age (Lord of the Rings mod). If you love medieval war and enjoy the challenge of starting out from a nobody and rising to become a mighty warlord leading your own army on the battlefield deciding the fate of the lands, then you ought to pick this up.

If you don't like playing as a thief, make a new character and become a lord. Explore the different combinations you can use and see what playstyle suits you. A variety of weapons, from bows and crossbows to heavy greatswords. From small humble horses to big demonic war horses, the choice is yours in this one of a kind sandbox game from the creative minds of Taleworlds!			",348,61,15,26,35,5,47

Starting with the negatives, after a while it does become a little repetative but with a few fun mods including StarWars conquest and so on, it can become like another experience again. My favorite points include:-Great combat mechancis -A decent AI-Nice choice of weapons and armour-Good mapOverall I'm really enjoying the game and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good strategy/combat/medieval game.

It's SUPER immersive if you can look past the old character graphics.Pros:- Immersive- Beautiful Enviroment graphics for it's age- Mounted Combat- Challenging and strategic battles and missions- Literally can choose whatever you want to beCons:- Not so appealing Character Graphics- No voice acting, it's old so it's expected, just be prepared to read a lot.- Many options to start out but very offer the advantage you need to get ahead- Late game Bandits a bit too OP, always had issues with them and it would take almost an hour to get my huge army back.- Archery feels too difficult, a problem that seems to exist throughout most of the series.It takes several gameplays and a good first blind run to really understand what to do, but when you figure it out it's quite fun and you can get pretty far. A lot of strategy is requires especially in later parts of the game. Choose your nation, abandon your nation. Be a bandit, be a merchant, be a warlord. Be whoever you want to bloody be! Give this a shot if you don't think you can afford the other games I recommended above. If all else fails, wait til the sales come, it's so worth it.			",26,9,0,16,14,0,9

												Mount & Blade is a fantastic action-strategy-RPG with the best horseback-based fighting engine I have ever experienced.  Battles can grow very large with 32+ infantry and horse based units racing around in a chaotic bloody mess... with you experiencing the action from an ""over the shoulder"" perspective.  Strategy elements are managed via a large regional map from which you move your army from place to place accepting quests or following your own agenda.  ""Heroes"" in you army can be levelled up, like you, and you can purchase new gear or just use the loot from your kills.  Some will think the grafx are a bit primitive, but honestly you will not notice after landing a few headshots galloping across the field.  Also the game does not lead you down any particular path... you will need to explore a bit and just try things.  Eventually you won't be able to stop playing.  The best indie-game ever.

Perhaps this recommendation tells you more about me, the author, than about the game? Maybe so. Maybe it tells you that I haven't the slightest shred of what one might call a life. Perhaps it tells you that I've spent more time killing virtual vikings than I have exercising, reading, working, or interacting with other actual human beings. But let me ask you: based on all that, is this possibly a good game?			",132,11,1,9,4,0,15

												At first glance, M&B seems like another bland Medieval Combat game. It was designed by a Turkish Couple and, let's be honest, isn't the prettiest game in this generation. As the age old mantra ""Never Judge a Book By It's Cover"" states, however, Mount and Blade is much more than meets the eye. The game is a full simulation of a land dominated by several kingdoms, each one vyying for domination. In the center of the chaos is you; a lone sellsword whose only advantage is indomitable will and a (possible) noble background. The game allows you to do whatever you please; swear fealty to a king, ascend the ladder of nobility through marriage and political gaming, raise an army and siege castles and strongholds, compete in tournaments for honor and cash, or just spend your days ambushing caravans and living off of the spoils. There's no wrong way to play the game and no matter what method you choose, you'll have fun. The game also boasts a fantastic combat system and several mods. Get it.			",217,37,1,39,9,1,17

												I'll tell the truth, this game at the beginning seemed pointless. And the fact that I had to learn literally everthing in this game by myself, (besides melee fighting) also made me a little frusrated. But as I played it more and more, I realized I was enjoying it, fighting battles that I won and lost, losing men I had in my army, taking prisoners of war and being chased by thier friends. I enjoyed every second of it. However I think you would be better off getting Mount and Blade warband due to the fact that this version does not have multiplayer.			",39,2,0,3,1,0,7

												Of course it's a pretty old game, but that doesn't stop Mount & Blade from being an awesome one. MNB does a unique blend of Total War, Elder Scrolls, with a hint of GTA. Take over the world, and have a lot of fun doing it. After winning a campaign, I found myself going back just to mess around.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I LOVE THIS DAMN GAME but unless you plan on buying the whole collection I really recommend you don't buy this but instead buy WARBAND. It is the same game but with way more content and alot of bug fixes. It is basically a big improvement of this game. They are all amazing but just get warband if you aren't making a collection or something like that. GET THIS DAMN WORK OF ART!(M&B WARBAND)			",243,44,5,57,24,2,43

												Initially the title of this video game confused me.If 'mount' is assumed to be a ver in this title, how does one then 'blade'?What is 'blading'?How do I 'blade' something?These are questions this sorry excuse for a game simply does not answer even after many hours of gameplayWould recommend.

												has a lot of issues not least of which is lack of proper mod support and proper mod tools... so currently modding is very limited and you can only have one 'game' mod running at a given time, with a very good chance of crashing.cannot run more than one mod at a time for the main game/storyline.* clarification on 'game mod:- a addon game mode playable by itself using the game as a engine over the 'native' default game from the launcher.the game has quite a few bugs/glitches/issues, fortunetly most of them are not game breaking and minor... most of the issues are with horse riding as compared to RL.the bugs and glitches can be overlooked for the most part, occasionally the game can crash because of running mods to main game 'native'.however the gameplay is unique and the game is worth getting for 10 bucks or if you catch a sale price.for the most part it runs better than triple A released games (more stable than FO3/FNV/TES games).

												This is an absolutely amazing game. I reccommend it to everyone. 10/10 every time. Even though it is 7 years old, it is a timeless classic and will always be on my list of favourite games. However, there is a better version (I know I am contraditing what I have already said but oh well!) it is called Mount & Blade Warband. It has improved animations, graphics and you can become KING of Calradia instead of some minor lord. Anyway, overall I will say AMAZING, become lord of Swadia (NOT RHODOKOS) and have fun on this game! It kept me busy for days on end....			",100,15,1,17,18,1,15

												So you are some random person with a warband. Sometimes you start with a horse sometimes you don't. You go around gathering a large number of idjiots to fight for you and realize in combat they have no idea what they are doing. You are promptly captured. So you escape. Form another band and attack again. Your men the idiots that they are run around till their spread out and get slaughtered. You are promptly captured again. Then you form a massive army for revenge and promptly run out of food and they desert you. Hey its sid meiers pirates but your running around with a buncha morons who promptly die on first contact with the enemy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've always been a fan of RPGs, and this one is most certainly up on the list. It is a refreshing mix of RPG and Strategy. If a lord's party is coming your way, better run unless you think you can take them!I would highly recommend this game. It is simple and the gameplay is fun. It is also very satisfying to hear that ""SCHING"" when you impale an enemy on a lance.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Picked up this game this past weekend when there was a sale going on, and decided to write a review. Overall this game has potential, but the graphics could do with some upgrades, especially the open range where your just traveling the land. Of the two towns i explored slightly the detail is good, and it really gives a good feel for the mideval period. However, the game crashed on me and i was not happy with that, even though any game will have its bugs. Rating: 7/10Needs some graphical upgrades, dialogue upgrades, and some detail upgrades.

												Everything starts somewhere, right? And with Mount & Blade TaleWorlds truly took a giant leap into the gaming world.Mount & Blade is a excellent Open World Strategy RPG. Why the strange genre? Well, simply put I find it really hard to put it under just one label. It's open world in the way that you can travel anywhere whenever you want. It's a strategy game because you need to utilize your smarts and plan your army according to what enemy you face. Yet it's an RPG because of the levelling system and the different skills and specializations.But to be honest this game is not worth it. If there is anything we should all know by now it is that Mount & Blade: Warband (A sequel of sorts) is exactly like it's predecessor except 100% better. So the reason I do not recommend this game is because I would strongly urge you to buy Warband instead for all the added features and because the map was greatly improved. So don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful game but the sequel does everything this game can do but a hundred times better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As much as I enjoy this game, I've run into problems where it freezes and crashes after around 35 days of in-game time, regardless, I've created three dynasties to suffer this fate:Rockington:  Normal character, jumped in, did my thing, got a decent army and was feared by bandits. Good trader, horse rider, did bow and also sword.Omar Yathrib:  Trying-too-hard-to-be-serious character, tried to amass a large army, constantly lost them to ungodly-sized groups of mountain bandits which are everywhere. Tyrone of Watermelonia:  Not-at-all-serious character. Pillaging warlord. Destroyed villages, amassed armies, murdered the innocent. Used an axe, spear and sword. It's such a fun game because there's so much you can do. This one is much more realistic compared to other medieval games, but I still highly recommend you get Warband. I made the mistake of getting this instead and look where it got me.It's a fun game, but you get the same game, plus a truly epic multiplayer, with M&B:  Warband.			",129,18,4,11,23,1,15

												Look i played it for a while, obviously there is a charm to it. Building your army, gaining your own Lands etc etc but after a while it all starts to feel 'same-ol same-ol' and once that point hits you come to realise that it was more your hope for some deeper substance to the game that was driving you on rather then the game itself. One day i just stopped playing, soon after i deleted it... never looked back			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty much a sandbox RPG, which is not really as great as it sounds.  The quests are completely dull and the entire story amounts to some exposition and the odd feature that your enemies prefer to capture you and take your stuff rather than simply kill you so that you won't take revenge in the future.It's a good experiment in seeing how many fiefs or territory you can acquire, or whether you can outfit your guy in the most expensive armor before he bites the poverty bullet or you get too bored with it.I played with this game for many hours, which is to say, i experimented with it.  The combat is a mildly interesting wargame about conserving troop morale with the power of food, blocking and annoyingly aim-centric swinging that avoids combos and feels more like D&D due to how much easier it is to miss the opponent instead of actually hit them or get blocked by them (except when you're on foot), making sure you have enough horses and the right weather and time of day to optimize your travel speed across the map graphic, verbally telling off your follower NPCs for arguing with each other, and a bunch of other stuff that is really only interesting in concept rather than presentation or follow through.The only real merit, is of course, mounted combat against forces on foot, cheesey castle sieges that aren't worth much after the first few (or 10 or so, if you're me), and the concept of the game itself.FINAL SCORE: 55.

												This game is a meme in itself. It's basically an excel sheet with PS1 graphics for artificial medieval riding and fighting gameplay. It takes about 4 hours to set everything up and get started with playing the game. I can only see that someone could enjoy this if he has way too much time at his hands.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not recommending this game not because it isn't a good game, but for another reason.It's a more realistic take on Skyrim. It's a game set in the time of knights, kings and queens. However there is no magic, no dragons, no fantasy elements. It's you, and whatever you decide your goal to be as there's no real way to win. Do you want to become a famous mercenary, or gladiator, do you want to command an army, or be a trader?It's a really unique and well done game, however I will not recommend it because the follow up game, Mount and Blade Warband, is the same as this game, however has many more added features.

												Its strengths are that you can really customise your playstlye and weapon loadouts to your liking.    It allows for you to recruit as you like.    The character also has a very indepth skill system.    There is a SDK available that alows for custom modules to be made for your liking.   Its weakness are the wide spread glithing ranging from invisible walls, horses not being able to move foreward, and weapons not registering.   These glithes are very common, and almost make ranged weapons not worth bothering with,   I also wish I could choose my own custom faction and culture and lords so I can more easily own calaridia.   The quests are very repetitive, and move you in the direction of joining the factions too much.   The weapon balence for ranged weapons are broken in the way that the  ranged weapons are the most glitched aspect of the game, and need more ammunition to be worthwhile later in the game where the bigger battles take place.   The sige gameplay is very slow paced and needs at least 2 breaching points per fortification to be of a respectible pace.Overall, you should just get warband, because warband fixed some problems, and has a new faction, more mods, and some multiplayer capabilities.

												I played this ♥♥♥♥♥ since beta. What started as a medieval combat simulator with a two person family dev team has been expanding quite well over the years with sequels, instead of updatesYou should just go play Warband, though. It's basically a much improved version of this, as opposed to an entirely new sequel. Not that this is too bad, or anything, but you'll probably burn yourself out before you take time on that one.7 / 12			",721,226,15,79,62,10,111

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An awkward, single-player RPG, it has some decent control or satisfying moments. But it's very basic.. a lot of text and stats and such overwhelm you, little to no story, it's just run around and meet new lords and recruit people to your band. Maybe in the future there'll be a more polished version. 3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the worst games i have ever played, i wish i did not waste my £$£ on it.All of the Mount and Blade games are worse then pong with no ball.The animations are rubbish, the sound is very low quality (What there is of it) and the gameplay is so borring and empty it's like those night's where you just can not sleep... it drags on... never getting better and you just want it to end, execpt you can't just get up and end it, you can not get your money back and your time is not only gone but you feal somehow dumber for allowing it to go on for so long hopeing it will get better.So it short, if you want to be bored and waste your money, buy this ""game"".

												This game has blocky unfinished looking graphics. The world map is barely better than old school Final Fantasy Games. The game only allows 150 characters on screen at any time. The average army is much larger by the end of the game. That means that you have to fight as a woundable character that has to lead an army that comes on screen in waves. Every battle looks the same. The castle sieges involve one or two ladders and no seige equipment. The various factions are designed off real world empires and all the weapons are High Middle Ages Chivalric equipment. Some Stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ got all butthurt so I am making sure I explain why this title is past its life. This game was a good start, but the developers get better each game. Mount & Blade Bannerlord is out this year... although they seem to be getting the hots for the weapon and army look of the late Dark Ages and that♥♥♥♥♥♥is getting annoying. Your call. Like any title with Mods available, you can make the game better, but you would be better off buying newer versions if you have a computerr built post 2010.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the only games with a genuinely challenging combat system, including horseback combat and fighting with and against a huge group of enemies (think Lord of the Rings). Much more than a hack and slash, this combines sandbox gameplay while managing your group of warriors. Want to play as a merchant? Sure. How about a mercenary that sells his prisoners of war into slavery? Why not. You can even play as a vassel to a king of a nation and conquer the entire map.Many hours of replayability and custom mods make sure to have you hooked for hours.In short, if you can imagine yourself swinging a sword while on horseback into a huge crowd of baddies, do yourself a favor and pick up Mount & Blade!

												this is a game where you grow to your apex then you get the crap kicked out of you. starting out of just you, you grow to a band of 150 soldiers. as you travel do quests and fight in battle, your Rep increases. when i gets high enough you may join a faction, when you join, you get a village and later as you fight you will get a small fort, and if you get lucky a castle. but to warn you, the more castles you get the harder it is to defend them, seeing that when factions go to war they will have 8 other generals with the king with each having about 100 men each, you have to pay your men so the more men you have and better skilled they are, the more expensive it is, so battles and selling equipment and goods is how you survive, also food is important, In short if you want the most realistic Medevil Feudal game, this is the game for you.

												Dangerously addictive blend of real time tactics and third person hack-em-up with a sprinkling of RPG, sautéed in late 90's graphics.Pesudo european setting for a adventure game that matures into a slogging siege warfare simulator , near the 'end game' it can get repititious , however all this is ameliorated by the satisfaction of capturing and imprisioning enemy lords.There is not much to reccomend about this game any longer as it has been effectivly superceded by its update Warband (which you should actually buy) Mount & Blade , for all its minor faults , is clearly a success in that it spawned a multitude of immitators attempting to improve on a rock solid basis.

												A little strange. I haven't played it a whole bunch but I got the gist. The game has to plot, it's sandbox and fairly open world. It's not a huge world but you can go basically everywhere. The point of the game is to do whatever you want. You create your character and then, poof, you're set free to do whatever. You can choose a faction to be a part of and gradually work your way to the top. You can go free lance and kill everybody. It's an interesting concept but it left a little to be desired.

Headshot!Pros: army management, resource management, negotiation skills, swords and no magicsCons: you can't just conquer things on your own to be an invader king man on your ownPro Tip: Pick a fast-ish, burly horse, and equip a pole-axe. When combat starts, charge right at your opponents without touching the M1 button at all, and guide your pole-axe so that it clips enemies in the head. Congrats, you win all the wars because you do 6000% damage to everything with this tactic!B-I should really get Warband someday			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mount and Blade is like an abusive reationship you can't help but love. From the start of your game, with nothing to your name but a rusted sword and tattered robes, you must carve your own story through the myraid friends and foes of a medival society. Much like the real dark ages, it can be a miserablee pain to get through for the unenlightened. Expect to save early and often, as the game pulls no punches. While this sounds terrible in text, it strangely isn't. If you get over the slow start of killing bandits and raiders with a rusty knife, you will find yourself leading vast armies against other feudal lords. The sword play and archery both feel great, if also prone to learning curves. The simple graphics and open code mean there are many diffrent mods, for many diffrent things. A casual mod search will find you everytthing from game of thrones to star wars, so mount and blade willl never get old for the modding types. My personal favorite mods are thwe aformentioned star wars mod, solid and shade (a mod of necromancy and grimdark),  and warsword, a warhammer based mod which let's you play as a skeleton pirate. Mount and blade is a game I would reccomend most people to try, but would understand if they quit. While it may hurt you sometimes, mount and blade only does it because it likes suffering. If you can return the pain though, I can gurentee hours of play time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing game. No doubt about it, but i have also played warband and it is much better. The map is a bit more different considering they did add a new faction in warband. But overall i would just buy warband. It has exactly what the original game has plus so many more features like making a family, and there are actually kingdom managment options for when you do aquire territory for yourself. So just buy warband, much, much better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A little strange. I haven't played it a whole bunch but I got the gist. The game has to plot, it's sandbox and fairly open world. It's not a huge world but you can go basically everywhere. The point of the game is to do whatever you want. You create your character and then, poof, you're set free to do whatever. You can choose a faction to be a part of and gradually work your way to the top. You can go free lance and kill everybody. It's an interesting concept but it left a little to be desired.

												Mount and blade is the type of game you pick up on a sale not realising what the gameplay is actually like, and then it sucks you in and wastes weeks or months of your time. The newer version is better by itself and does include multiplayer, which can be fun, but isn't too expansive. The origional game though has recieved mods that completely rebuild it to be a totally new game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was easier to get into than I though it would be. It doesn't hold your hand much to be sure, and it's mechanics are obscure, but it's actually a pretty forgiving game. You can't die, and while your (unnamed) troops can die, I've had two total wipeouts in the early game and was able to recover quickly both times. The graphics in the version are fairly primive by todays standards, but they work as well as they need to. The AI could be better, and combat can be a bit clunky, but overall it's a great medievil (but not fantasy) sandbox game where you're free to run around and do things at your own pace.

												I spent almost a hundred hours playing just a single mod and almost more playing the original game the gameplay is fun and innovative you actually feel your power growing as your army gets larger and larger and you ean more and more land and you can go at factions however you want will you join one side of the war or will you start your own faction and become the overlord of the world, rig leaderships and make sure your man becomes the leader. Even if you hate medieval bow and sword games no problems there are some excellant mods that bring in muskets and pistols and even a mod that brings in the universe of star wars with blasters and lightsabers included. One of the game's few downfalls is in the graphics they are quite dated and could be touched up with a better engine however the game itself is amazing and the amount of modding that goes into the game turns it into an amazingly different game.

												I've been playing this game off and on for several years now. It's one of those games you can come back to after leaving for a while and it gets you addicted all over again.Pros: - A diverse range of options for style of play. You can recruit a bunch of men and raid towns for gold, declare loyalty to a faction and work your way up the ranks, or you can level your trading skill and make money running a trade route.- Nice RPG leveling system that gives you a lot of options for your character. Additional characters added to the party can supplement your weaker skills- A good sized map with different types of enemies.- Simple combat system which is easy to learn (though it has its cons, which I will discuss).Cons:- The AI for certain enemies. During tournaments they will routinely run themselves into walls and struggle to get away, leaving them as easy prey (or getting you stuck with them). In battles they typically just free for all as opposed to having any kind of organization.- Very difficult to command your forces and get them to do what you want- Graphics. I don't think it takes away from the game really, but the graphics leave a bit to be desired.Overall, I love this game and highly recommend it. It's a great value for your buck.

												Mount and Blade is like an abusive reationship you can't help but love. From the start of your game, with nothing to your name but a rusted sword and tattered robes, you must carve your own story through the myraid friends and foes of a medival society. Much like the real dark ages, it can be a miserablee pain to get through for the unenlightened. Expect to save early and often, as the game pulls no punches. While this sounds terrible in text, it strangely isn't. If you get over the slow start of killing bandits and raiders with a rusty knife, you will find yourself leading vast armies against other feudal lords. The sword play and archery both feel great, if also prone to learning curves. The simple graphics and open code mean there are many diffrent mods, for many diffrent things. A casual mod search will find you everytthing from game of thrones to star wars, so mount and blade willl never get old for the modding types. My personal favorite mods are thwe aformentioned star wars mod, solid and shade (a mod of necromancy and grimdark),  and warsword, a warhammer based mod which let's you play as a skeleton pirate. Mount and blade is a game I would reccomend most people to try, but would understand if they quit. While it may hurt you sometimes, mount and blade only does it because it likes suffering. If you can return the pain though, I can gurentee hours of play time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When combat starts, charge right at your opponents without touching the M1 button at all, and guide your pole-axe so that it clips enemies in the head.

												Pretty great game. If your into all out cavalry charges and horseback combat, as well as a great game that involves you (the wanderer) who has a chance to become the vassal of a king and take part in huge battles, this game is for you. With a great theme, and decent game play, this game is the perfect blend of action adventure and RPG.			",59,2,0,16,1,0,24

												This game is so much fun. I like it better than warband because the combat is simpler and the whole game is simpler over all. Its fun playing and then having your fortunes suddenly reversed. I was playing with an army of 150 and then all the armies from a single kindom surrounded my city. It was a bitter fight between me and my 200 strong garrison on one side an 1250...needless to say I lost and they destroyed my lands. I allied with their enemy and set about exterminating them from the map in revenge. So much fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mount and Blade is like an abusive reationship you can't help but love. From the start of your game, with nothing to your name but a rusted sword and tattered robes, you must carve your own story through the myraid friends and foes of a medival society. Much like the real dark ages, it can be a miserablee pain to get through for the unenlightened. Expect to save early and often, as the game pulls no punches. While this sounds terrible in text, it strangely isn't. If you get over the slow start of killing bandits and raiders with a rusty knife, you will find yourself leading vast armies against other feudal lords. The sword play and archery both feel great, if also prone to learning curves. The simple graphics and open code mean there are many diffrent mods, for many diffrent things. A casual mod search will find you everytthing from game of thrones to star wars, so mount and blade willl never get old for the modding types. My personal favorite mods are thwe aformentioned star wars mod, solid and shade (a mod of necromancy and grimdark),  and warsword, a warhammer based mod which let's you play as a skeleton pirate. Mount and blade is a game I would reccomend most people to try, but would understand if they quit. While it may hurt you sometimes, mount and blade only does it because it likes suffering. If you can return the pain though, I can gurentee hours of play time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mount&Blade is an open-ended game in the same vein as Darklands or Elite. Theplayer takes the role of the leader of a wandering band of soldiers andwarriors. The player then sets his or her own goals, whether they be of amercantile, heroic, or tyrannical nature. To accomplish these goals, theplayer will engage in dynamic and deep combat using everything from throwingdaggers to military picks to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swords. Basically it is a snad box game that can be very realistic. You can LOSE battles. It is not just a button masher as far as combat goes, there is strategy and skill involved in the fighting. Graphics are ok as of version 1.011. I like that you can do whatever you want. Roam the land killing bandits, solo if oyu like. You can amass a huge force of soldiers. If a kingdom you are friends with is under siege, you cancome to the resque. Or you can take over villages, towns, kindoms castles. You units know what to do and do thier best to carry out your orders.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing this game off and on for several years now. It's one of those games you can come back to after leaving for a while and it gets you addicted all over again.Pros: - A diverse range of options for style of play. You can recruit a bunch of men and raid towns for gold, declare loyalty to a faction and work your way up the ranks, or you can level your trading skill and make money running a trade route.- Nice RPG leveling system that gives you a lot of options for your character. Additional characters added to the party can supplement your weaker skills- A good sized map with different types of enemies.- Simple combat system which is easy to learn (though it has its cons, which I will discuss).Cons:- The AI for certain enemies. During tournaments they will routinely run themselves into walls and struggle to get away, leaving them as easy prey (or getting you stuck with them). In battles they typically just free for all as opposed to having any kind of organization.- Very difficult to command your forces and get them to do what you want- Graphics. I don't think it takes away from the game really, but the graphics leave a bit to be desired.Overall, I love this game and highly recommend it. It's a great value for your buck.

												This game is one of my favorites. There, I'll just start with that. It is partly due to my preferences as a gamer, but it is impossible to deny the care that went into making this game. True Skyrim style freedom, but with a larger scale. The games quests do get a little repeditive, and if you stick with only one weapon type the combat gets pretty samey pretty quick. However, this is when I think it is up to the player to make it interesting. I am currently a one man warlord that goes into every battle alone and kills them all with my longbow. I used to be a high stakes trader that swore no allegences. Before that I was marshal of a kingdom, leading a massive war against our foes. People say the games has no replayability, but it can be pretty cool to find ways to make the game feel new. The combat system makes you feel beast when you successfully fight more than two people. The leveling system always gives you something to shoot for. And the prospect of owning a kingdom always makes you strive for the higher things...Recommended.			",66,7,0,17,10,0,21

And yet it remains SO MUCH FUN even years later.You can make your own hero - male OR female. You choose your starting stats. You can become a slaver, a trader, a warrior, a ruler, a sapper, or a thief. This game was a sandbox before sandbox was a common term. Mount and Blade is a good game and you should play it.

												Good and adicting game with alot of options! you build up an army and destroy kingdoms. Very fun and exciting, but lacks some sort of variation. The graphics are not that good because of the scenery. You can litterely fight 1000 vs 1000 in one big map, with no lag at all(despends on pc ofc). Buy it if you love an big RPG and don't mind lacky graphics! 3/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After living the life of a merchant, I woke up one day and decided to be a full on vigilante. Luckily I was pretty charismatic and plenty of Khagit Horseman were down to follow me in to battle. After a few skirmishes with bandits, I was asked to collect taxes for a Lord whom I wanted favor with - So I taxed the hell out of his city and ran off with the cash. With that money I used my Merchant skills to♥♥♥♥♥♥ pillage and plunder little towns and then sell the illl gotten wares back to the province capitals for a small fortune.My armys upkeep was about $700 weekly by day 15 and I was still handing out raises like a boss. Then it hit... War. I joined with a larger multi-lord army and conquered castle after castle until... Bam. Our meager 700 man fighting force was destroyed by the Nordic armies, numbering just over 800 men.... Everyone faught valiantly but it wasnt enough...  I was captured and held prisoner for days before escaping. Now, with my hidden stash of coins I head back to my home country to raise more armies of steppe horseman... I seek revenge,--> weak graphics but a fun fricking game. 10/10 - im addicted.			",133,17,0,51,17,0,35

												Pretty fun game! You should get the newer version, Mount and blade Warband, it has more mods for it. I recomend the ""tld"" mod for this version though. You control one charicter on the battle feild in a first person slasher way. But you can order other troops around that are in you army or in your allies army if they don't have a nobility figure in the army. The combat can be kind of hard if you arn't riding a horse, it is mostly about getting the timeing right for blocking or attacking from the correct angle. When you are not in a battle you control a party. This party starts with only one member, you. But you can recruit other soldiers and some ""heroes"" to it. As you level up there are 3 sets of stats to put points in. As you upgrade the stats you get acces to more items, bonuses to your speed, party size, the amount of hits you can take and things like that. There are several warring factions with cities and armies on the map and there are bandit parties. You move your party to a army of a settelment to interact with it. You get money from looting defeated enemy armies of partys or doing jobs for people in the towns. There is no set goal in the game but if you become a king of your own nation I guess you can consider that a win. The game is fun from the start but it can be kind of boring if you got a good mod and then have to start from scratch again. Fortunatly you can use cheats to add more money so you don't have to waste all your time on killing bandits just to get to a point in the game where you can take a castle for your self. After you take a castle you have you own faction and get more options of things to do. Like build up your castle or towns and you can put heros in charge of castles you captured. Yeah so pretty much this game is about managing your little army and doing quests on the large map and in the battle map you ride around shooting, stabing or slashing your enemies.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those games that's a bit of a hidden gem. I recently got this game when it was on sale and I've been addicted ever since! This game is just absolutely extraordinary and is worth every penny. This game is so incredibly immersive you can get into it and just play this game for hours on end. There are cheats for this game but I'd strongly suggest playing legitimately. Don't forget to check out the taverns and cities and such. You can find some pretty cool♥♥♥♥♥♥in them. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is by far the best game I have played in my life. It (and the Prophesy of Pendor mod) took a very large chunk of my life from me and I enjoyed every moment of it. Do not see the number of hours on Steam - I played it without Steam for years (I didn't get an account till 3 years back). This game and it's community introduced me to the whole world of mods and other user generated content. I didn't know of the existence of such things till then. It was changing point in my life - hobbies and even helped change my work ethics for the better - why couldn't do better at my work when people put so much care and effort into a game mod/hobby? Do anything and everything - whether good or bad properly is what I learnt and it's helping me till now.So I will give this game my most positive rating! If I can I would give it ""Infinite"" thumbs up but sadly there is no option for it. Buy this game and you will not regret it but be prepared to lose hours and hours of your life.P.S: Couching is still the best :) Killed off who knows how many millions of Nord solo with it :)			",290,74,15,67,81,2,132

												This is one of the greatest make-your-own-game style games ever made. It's rough, it has terrible UI, the graphics suck, and you can get real frustrated real fast. And yet it remains SO MUCH FUN even years later.You can make your own hero - male OR female. You choose your starting stats. You can become a slaver, a trader, a warrior, a ruler, a sapper, or a thief. This game was a sandbox before sandbox was a common term. Mount and Blade is a good game and you should play it.

												This is a great game with a lot of rough edges. I highly recommend you start out with Mount and Blade Warband, which is basically the same game but with more goods, another faction, more gameplay options, and multiplayer. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you already have warband, I still think this game is worth buying. With mods like Star Wars conquest and The Last Days (of the third age) being some of the best mods for it, even though there's still things like them for warband.All in all, you should get this game if your just starting out in the Mount and Blade series or you want to see where it all started.

												This is a must in anybodies game collection, if you are the kind of gamer that like both RTS and realistic simulators, as well as RPG. This combines it all.The setting is mid 13th century Eastern Europe (though I can't find any relation with reality looking at the world map) where you play a character or hero.Said hero doesn't have to do anything, since this is an almost complete free roam style of game. But whatever you do it will have an impact on the world and the other inhabitants of this world, be it peasant or King will either love or hate you for it.You can hire troops and train them, as long as you pay them and feed them. You can take on quests, hire other heroes that eventually can become your Vessals and maintain conquered or earned villages, castles and cities for you.It has an element of politics where you can gain the trust of Vessals that are not your own and gain support from them.Keep a look out for the sequal: Mount & Blade - Warband			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is both an rpg, third person fighting game, and strategy game, with the option for some town management too. I would liken it to a Game of Thrones in the sense that it has many factions that interact with each other in the game world and it's very political, however as the player you can align with any of them or just strike off on your own. It's set in a hard medieval world, with no magic or fantasy elements though that isn't a downside whatsoever. In this game you will forge your own path in a war torn land amidst clashing kingdoms, choose to be a lord, a bandit, a trader, a Robin-Hood like vigilante, or anything in between. Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If your looking for a medieval conquest you should consider Mount & Blade, I've Spent 650+ hours on this game and I have loved most all of it. If you do not care much about modding, and just want the base game you should pick up Mount & Blade Warband, it has more content, new features, and refined base game mechanics. But if your into modding games, then you defiantly want to pick this up, I've played a many mods, this has always been one of my go to games  when I have no idea what to playTo list a few mods (note that many mods moved to warband)WarswordEurope 1200Hegemony1257 AD Middle EuropeSword of DamoclesThe Last Days (of The Third Age of Middle Earth)Star Wars Conquest			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is basically the best game ever created. An open world sandbox set in a medieval world of limitless possibilities with different factions, units, and equipment to define your character. You can be a petty thief, roaming merchant, freedom fighter, or highly honored vassal if your heart so desires. If you aren't satisfied with just that, the game's ease of modding and hundreds of already existing, expertly made mods let you change the setting and play a completely different game on the M&B engine. Star Wars, the wild west, and ancient Greece are just a few examples of mods which completely change the game, and combined with its already huge list of possibilities, give the Mount & Blade almost infinite replayability.Buy this game (and/or its sequel Warband) or you will lie on your death bed only to shed the single tear of regret in an otherwise complete life.

												This is game is terribly addictive. Run enemies through while on horseback with a bow or a melee weapon and issue simple commands to your army to capture castles, loot villages and devastate enemy armies on the battlefield. In combat, you can switch from 3rd Person to First Person and engage in bloody warfare. On the world map, you see each kingdom, its villages, towns and cities and other lords (friend or foe). How you play this game is almost enitrely up to you. If you want to be a loyal vassal to a king, do it. If you want to be a reaving bandit warlord, do it. Whatever, you choose, you will have fun. *****			",248,128,0,43,14,2,58

												The poor man's ""Skyrim,"" lol.  I still recommend it.  There's a certain charm to visiting quaint villages and renowned castles of a Medieval-esque realm, of sniping foes from horseback or charging into a fray with a massive sword of war in hands, and of interacting with the various NPCs strewn about the land.  Fantastic musical score to this game, as well as a fairly balanced morality system implemented, and you'll always hear two sides to any argument.  I'm not sure ""why"" I find the country of Calradia so attractive, with simplistic graphics and an easily abuseable combat system.  But it's frighteningly alluring nonetheless. :-)			",226,10,2,21,11,0,33

If you are not sure if you want to buy this game play the demo first. Thank you for reading!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simple controls and fighting simulations. Not very much of a variety when it comes to quests. But the sheer scope of this game and the replay ability in my books makes up for everything else. Start out on your own and work your way to the top by whatever means you can find at hand, making an army from either villagers or recruits or even prisoners you capture in combat. Nice simple leveling system makes getting a strong chatacter easy and fun. Lastly I just wish it had better graphics....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So glad this game has been as successful as it has been.  i remember paying to gain access to the demo years ago.  Now Warband is an admittedly better game, but still holds very true to the M&B formula of open world.  Don't expect a traditional medieval wargame here, Mount & Blade is to them as ARMA is to Call of Duty.  It's a simulation.  Be prepared to fail and fail often until you get a hang of the mechanics, and them to fail some more.It's also great to see a game that has an actual accurate difference between male and female characters due to the historical (albeit fantasy) setting.  Gaining peerage as a female character was a real achievement, being offered mashalhood was an even bigger one.Even on the easiest settings this game will challenge you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But overall i would just buy warband. It has exactly what the original game has plus so many more features like making a family, and there are actually kingdom managment options for when you do aquire territory for yourself. So just buy warband, much, much better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This Game is just great. I love playing it. I always get a never ending sense of adventure and i always wont some more. But this game does have its dissapointments, like u cant start a kingdom or get married like all the quest in the Mount and blade warband. But i still enjoy playing this game and i cant wait until mount and blade two comes out. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just love this game. Warband is good and all but to me this is way better. I like to be the main hero in the battles. Able to take out most of the enemys myself, makes me feel like I matter in that world. In warband I cant seem to learn the battle mecanics so I just keep geting captured and get my men killed. I think I would recomend to play and get used to warband first, the trip from here to there is a bit large.			",276,52,5,49,51,2,36

												It's like an RTS meets the Elder Scrolls series. Build an army, run around, and either be the commander who stands back from battle or charge into a FPS/Third-Person Shooter with swords. axes, bows, and just about any other medieval weapon you could want. Ride horses, siege castles, and be given your own pieces of the kingdom for proving your worth. The somewhat steep learning curve is well worth the satisfaction of charging the battlefield outnumbered 3:1 and coming out victorious.And for those of you who love modding, it's setup up pretty good for that.

												If you want just one game from the bundle, go for Warband instead, as that's an improved version of this one. BUT!!! The original still holds very well on its own!If you did get the collection, by all means start with this one, for an ""extended tutorial"" before Warband if for nothing else, so you can make mistakes to avoid them later. And to have a fresh more appreciating go at the successor instead of a replay of same game. Some nice mods work for original only, too. You're dropped in an open ended medieval world, there is no story really (mods may help with that), you need to figure out yourself what it is you want to achieve.Do tasks for peasants or lords, or pillage villages and besiege castles. Fight bandits or raid caravans, or travel and trade yourself. Serve a king, care for your fiefdom, or relieve incumbent from throne duty by supporting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Win tournaments, win wars. Get rich and famous. Pimp up your ride and get that lordly armor. And level up, honing skills!			",360,123,16,65,24,3,110

												9/10 - Very Good.Mount & Blade is one of the best games I've played up until now, it does require some time and practice for you to get used with the controls, but once you do get used to them, you'll be able to block most attacks directed at you and counter attack while your enemy is still preparing the next blow, the feeling of mastering those and them going into a battlefield striking down each foe who dare come in your way is amazing.You begin the game as a simple soldier without any fame, and start building up your reputation as you go, hiring others soldiers like archers and spearmen, raiding villages(only if you want to) buying better equipment and learning new tricks as you and your men level up(Yes, M&B is a RPG). Have a big enough fame and the kings  will send you offers, requesting that you become their vassal, keep working for them and you'll see that in no time you'll be the commander of thousands of men, giving them orders on the battlefield and sharing all the loot.I'd recommed Mount & Blade for anyone who loves medieval settings, good gameplay and nice graphics dispite being an old game, I wouldn't recommed the expansion though, one of the things that I didn't like was that hitting something with a sword while mounted became a lot harder as you character may miss the target with the slightest movement of the mouse.

												If your looking for a medieval conquest you should consider Mount & Blade, I've Spent 650+ hours on this game and I have loved most all of it. If you do not care much about modding, and just want the base game you should pick up Mount & Blade Warband, it has more content, new features, and refined base game mechanics. But if your into modding games, then you defiantly want to pick this up, I've played a many mods, this has always been one of my go to games  when I have no idea what to playTo list a few mods (note that many mods moved to warband)WarswordEurope 1200Hegemony1257 AD Middle EuropeSword of DamoclesThe Last Days (of The Third Age of Middle Earth)Star Wars Conquest			",98,23,0,49,23,0,53

												There is something to be said about riding around on a battle field with weapon in hand smacking down pesky archers and unsuspecting foes as they engage you carefully nutured units. This game captures the feel of mediaeval combat in a very accessible framework. This third/first person RPG/melee game has you as a wandering mercenary building up your troops until you can... well I'm not sure yet. I've become a Lord after builing up my favour mission running. I have lots of money due to trading and slaving bandits. Maybe I should crush my Lords enemies? Maybe I should seek another Castle? The game is very open and visceral. Worth while if you are in to hack and slash with a realistic feel.It's just a shame the campaign is not multiplayer.			",192,33,1,39,29,1,47

												The game has design flaws without a doubt, but it's very friendly to low-end machines (haven't tried it with an intel graphics adapter though). The combat is simple and superb real-time action, and there are nice rpg elements to enjoy. The design flaws kick in with the ranged combat and the sheer difficulty of building your party and your character past a certain point. I recommend looking into strategies online for character progression.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It may look a bit dated by now, but the gameplay is still perfect, with one of the best medieval combat simulations I've ever encountered.I've read that Warband improves many of the features of the original, but for what I've seen there is one thing in which the original is superior, and that is the mods.The game's mechanics are surprisingly adaptable to other eras and styles of play, and lots of peoples have put huge efforts in recreating them, so you can find recreations of viking invasions, the napoleonic wars, a western or even the Star Wars universe.I personally enjoyed ""1866"" (western), ""1805 ii"" (napoleonic wars) and ""Rus XIII Ventury"" the most, all of them almost standalone games for themselves.All in all, a very nice game on its own that's been boosted tremendously by a huge load of community content.

												Very good battle system. 1980's Dungeons and Dragons style mostly text based city interface is a bit off-putting, but the battles are this game's bread and butter. You have a lot of options on how to progress but this is no eye candy like Oblivion/Skyrim. This game only beats Elder Scrolls in combat (by a whole lot), falls considerably short in every other way though.			",651,252,32,96,94,4,120

												I got this game a week or so ago. I wanted to try something new. I figured what the heck...it's only 10 bucks. Best 10 bucks I've spent in a long time. The graphics are dated, but so is the game. I'm playing basically as a mercenary. Here's the skinny. Start off in the arena fighting in the cities. You'll get better at using your horse in the tournaments and weapons in the gladiator-style 40-man matches. It's a good way to practice and earn extra money. An important rule of thumb. Losing in the arena will not cost you anything. Losing a battle outside the cities...you're going to lose money and people if you've recruited any. Once you've gotten up some cash to spare upgrade your armor and whatever weapon you choose to use.I started out in the Vaegir Kingdom way up in the snow. Be sure to attack only looters to begin with. Usually they spawn about 5-10 at a time. I beat 10 of them by myself. I even took out 11 Swadian foot soldiers. Loot their stuff until your slots are full then head to the nearest city and sell everything except better gear for yourself. Little by little as I recruited guys from the small towns I moved toward the Kindom of the Nords by the ocean. I started to drive off sea-raiders. Sea-raiders have the most expensive equipment. Wipe out enough of them and after a while your renown get you noticed by one of the lords. You'll get sent a notice asking if you'd like to become a vassal. You swear allegiance to him. He'll give you a fief. ( A town somewhere in the kingdom you run and collect taxes from.) From there keep an eye on your town, help it grow to make more money, keep chasing looters, raiders, etc...doing quests, and defending your kingdom. When things get to the point that raiders aren't poppng up as much you can always raid an enemy town. Carefuil! watch your map so you don't get ambushed. I tried to fight my way out once but I was ounumber by 40 Swadians who took me prisoner. They stole 6,000 in denars and about 19 of my party members. I went from 25 to 6. Plus, it really makes your enemy much more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. You make ALOT of money off of the spices and oils and tools you don't get from a battle. I love it!			",79,10,4,6,2,1,14

												There are cheats in the singleplayer - save file is a .txt file in my documents folder. Don't get me wrong, the game was fun when I wasn't a demigod with enormous lifespan, one punch kill, and ability to run four times faster than the fastest horse.It's fun to capture a castle all by yourself though - or gathering all 15 immortal champions instead of set of 6, then leveling them, equiping with best armors and weapons limitless money can buy and just decide the fate of the world by yourself.

												Mount & Blade was recommended to me by a friend and it's a recommendation I've actually been quite glad for. The game, while not the prettiest thing around, has this kind of charm that I really enjoy. The gameplay is pretty solid and the music is fairly pleasant. The artwork is easily the nicest looking aspect of the game and there are a few pieces I've been considering using as computer backgrounds. If you're only going to grab one of the Mount & Blade series then I'd recommend either Warband or Fire & Sword just because of that little something extra they've got but really you should just buy the set. If it's your kind of thing you can easily sink tons of hours into this series.			",84,40,0,24,14,1,19

												After living the life of a merchant, I woke up one day and decided to be a full on vigilante. Luckily I was pretty charismatic and plenty of Khagit Horseman were down to follow me in to battle. After a few skirmishes with bandits, I was asked to collect taxes for a Lord whom I wanted favor with - So I taxed the hell out of his city and ran off with the cash. With that money I used my Merchant skills to♥♥♥♥♥♥ pillage and plunder little towns and then sell the illl gotten wares back to the province capitals for a small fortune.My armys upkeep was about $700 weekly by day 15 and I was still handing out raises like a boss. Then it hit... War. I joined with a larger multi-lord army and conquered castle after castle until... Bam. Our meager 700 man fighting force was destroyed by the Nordic armies, numbering just over 800 men.... Everyone faught valiantly but it wasnt enough...  I was captured and held prisoner for days before escaping. Now, with my hidden stash of coins I head back to my home country to raise more armies of steppe horseman... I seek revenge,--> weak graphics but a fun fricking game. 10/10 - im addicted.			",133,17,0,51,17,0,35

												It's like an RTS meets the Elder Scrolls series. Build an army, run around, and either be the commander who stands back from battle or charge into a FPS/Third-Person Shooter with swords. axes, bows, and just about any other medieval weapon you could want. Ride horses, siege castles, and be given your own pieces of the kingdom for proving your worth. The somewhat steep learning curve is well worth the satisfaction of charging the battlefield outnumbered 3:1 and coming out victorious.And for those of you who love modding, it's setup up pretty good for that.

Not only can you manage your troops in an enviornment with multiple RPG elements, you also get to lead them into battles and fight the battles! With armies, possibly going into the thousands.  It is interesting to in a way most strategy and RPG games don't dive into and quite addicting.

Hey, why does he get clothes?""""I cannot hit a dummy on a horse for the life of me.""""How the hell... why..."" *sigh*(Creating a character) ""This is some deep background, I must be applying for Top Secret clearance later at the castle.""(Starting the game) ""Um... so... I'm just in the middle of a field somewhere... I assume I frolicked and pranced all the way here from the coast and then suddenly realized I had no idea where I was going. I mean, I still have no idea where I'm going of course.""""Yep. Single room with wooden tables, guard, guard, but no lord. This is the crappiest Castle I've ever seen.""""How do I get out of here? Seriously, I'm at the gate, but there's no option to actually leave.""""Where the f*** is Ab-... Amb-... wherever the bandits supposedly are.""""Hm. I'm not sure how this is going to work... I'm supposed to train the peasants to fight bandits, but a different set of bandits altogether just attacked the village and... yeah: 'Bandits are looting the village.' And the only option I have is 'Leave'...""So if you're recording a fun ""I tried to play this game"" YouTube video, it should be awesome.(Mount and Blade: Warband does a better job at this part of the game. It's easier to start playing, but much less entertaining for listening audiences.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mount & Blade is a really special game! The battles are unique in both commands to your troops, and number of troops! In M&B you can choose your own path, you can choose your faction (kingdom) or if you want to stay independent! when you get tired of the original game, you can download mods, for example; star wars conquest, and a Lord of the Rings mod! this is a great game!

Some of the highlights includes Siege warfare, 5 factions all based on actual civilizations of the Medivel peroid ( these factions are Swadia, Nords, Rhodocks, Vaigers, and Khergits), Custimizable characters, a Host of NPC characters, interesting enviorments, and plenty of foes to fight ( Sea raiders, Looters, Forest Bandits, Deserters just to name a few). In sort, it is a really awsome game.			",10,1,0,1,2,0,16

												This game is great. I've spent countless hours on it (only recently did I add it to Steam). It may look a bit dated by now, but the gameplay is still perfect, with one of the best medieval combat simulations I've ever encountered.I've read that Warband improves many of the features of the original, but for what I've seen there is one thing in which the original is superior, and that is the mods.The game's mechanics are surprisingly adaptable to other eras and styles of play, and lots of peoples have put huge efforts in recreating them, so you can find recreations of viking invasions, the napoleonic wars, a western or even the Star Wars universe.I personally enjoyed ""1866"" (western), ""1805 ii"" (napoleonic wars) and ""Rus XIII Ventury"" the most, all of them almost standalone games for themselves.All in all, a very nice game on its own that's been boosted tremendously by a huge load of community content.

												A fun, immersive and a huge game for you to sink time into. Are you a fan of the combat in games like Chivalry or War of the Roses? Are you a fan of games that let you build up armies, level up a character and team up/fight with NPC's? Then this is a game you will definitely enjoy.Mount and Blade is one of those games that despite it's dated look, never fails to become less enjoyable each time you go back to it. I tried it and was very skeptical, but soon fell in love with it.For it's price point, it's well worth a purchase. I'd also reccommend looking at the 'Warband' Expansion, which is also well worth it.			",97,26,0,35,12,0,20

But the sheer scope of this game and the replay ability in my books makes up for everything else. Start out on your own and work your way to the top by whatever means you can find at hand, making an army from either villagers or recruits or even prisoners you capture in combat. Nice simple leveling system makes getting a strong chatacter easy and fun. Lastly I just wish it had better graphics....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the original Mount and Blade. This game is a sandbox game of doom. I have, on multiple occasions, sat at my computer playing this game for 16 hours (or more) in a single sitting, forgetting even to use the bathroom or eat. It's always a case of ""Alright, I juts captured that castle, I need to get my troops back up to strength, then I can quit. Well, now that I have my troops up to strength, I bet I could take that other castle before I quit. Well, now that I've done that I should get my troops back up before I quit. Well, I did just take those two castles, I should just take this town real quick. Well, I need to get my troops back up to strength now, don't I?"" And so on and so on until it's tomorrow and you have no idea what your life has become. Sword controls are intuitive (unlike the sequels, in which they are broken as hell!), they sandbox is addictive, everything about this game is fun. I wish the out-of-battle interactions were given more depth (which they did, I suppose, in the sequels? I wouldn't know, the in-battle controls are so horrible I've never made it more than two battles in before breaking my keyboard against my monitor and rage-quitting), but the core of the game is here, and that's what matters.

												Ive been playing quite some time.I enjoy the combat a lot, though it could be refined a bit. As far as conquering a part of the world is, this game has been the most enjoyable to me so far. Being able to do a lot of it myself, instead of just managing. Though managing combat is also possible by sending the troops in etc.There are some points of improvement:Make the engine better for combat. When you have an army of 300 vs a group of 10, your army shouldnt even get a single casualty.Make travelling less boring and allow a speed-up of some sort.Other then that I got nothing else to say except that im gonna keep playing this. :) Probably gonna try out one of many mods out there soon.

												I got this game a week or so ago. I wanted to try something new. I figured what the heck...it's only 10 bucks. Best 10 bucks I've spent in a long time. The graphics are dated, but so is the game. I'm playing basically as a mercenary. Here's the skinny. Start off in the arena fighting in the cities. You'll get better at using your horse in the tournaments and weapons in the gladiator-style 40-man matches. It's a good way to practice and earn extra money. An important rule of thumb. Losing in the arena will not cost you anything. Losing a battle outside the cities...you're going to lose money and people if you've recruited any. Once you've gotten up some cash to spare upgrade your armor and whatever weapon you choose to use.I started out in the Vaegir Kingdom way up in the snow. Be sure to attack only looters to begin with. Usually they spawn about 5-10 at a time. I beat 10 of them by myself. I even took out 11 Swadian foot soldiers. Loot their stuff until your slots are full then head to the nearest city and sell everything except better gear for yourself. Little by little as I recruited guys from the small towns I moved toward the Kindom of the Nords by the ocean. I started to drive off sea-raiders. Sea-raiders have the most expensive equipment. Wipe out enough of them and after a while your renown get you noticed by one of the lords. You'll get sent a notice asking if you'd like to become a vassal. You swear allegiance to him. He'll give you a fief. ( A town somewhere in the kingdom you run and collect taxes from.) From there keep an eye on your town, help it grow to make more money, keep chasing looters, raiders, etc...doing quests, and defending your kingdom. When things get to the point that raiders aren't poppng up as much you can always raid an enemy town. Carefuil! watch your map so you don't get ambushed. I tried to fight my way out once but I was ounumber by 40 Swadians who took me prisoner. They stole 6,000 in denars and about 19 of my party members. I went from 25 to 6. Plus, it really makes your enemy much more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. You make ALOT of money off of the spices and oils and tools you don't get from a battle. I love it!			",79,10,4,6,2,1,14

												This game was what really got me into pc gaming. I'd spent many hours playing games on console, but nothing like this.  The absolute freedom and learning to be humble in picking my fights and enemies sucked me in to this game.  Sure I wanted to tell the king of Vaegers to ♥♥♥♥ off and that this was my land, but i couldnt,  I had to work to try and obtain even an ounce of what he had.You work for everything you want in this game, and you work hard.  But damn is it satisfying when you get it.  If you are into a uniquely open world style game with 3rd person combat, as well as a small army to amass and multiple kingdoms to work for and eventually overthrow (if you wish) then this is your game series.  It will give you almost every single facet of choice in what you do as long as you put in the time needed to obtain those goals.As of this review the games in this series don't have amazing next gen graphics by any means and the combat animations aren't going to blow your mind in any way.  The honest truth is that the gameplay is so well done that you wont even know/care about either of those things (unless that is all you're looking for).It's hard to put into words how much you can do in this game series and how much you may appreciate it if you give it a run.   But I guarantee if you're looking for the most bang for your buck you'd have to try really hard not to get your moneys worth from any of the mount and blade games, including this one!  :)Please feel free to upvote this if you feel the same way!  I'd love for more people to enjoy these games with us!(Note: this review applies to all of the current Mount and Blade Games, with the latter, especially Warband, being superior.)   ) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought the full package, basically paid for the same games, but still tons of fun. graphics arent the big hitter but are decent enough. game mechanics are great and so far no problems. 8.5/10 wouldnt buy full price but sale price is definatly worth it.			",54,6,0,14,3,0,5

												Its ""O.k"", Deff outdated,clunky an graphically inept BUT what can you expect its a pretty old game.It's a good game to play whilst waiting on your other games to finish downloading/updating.

												Very good game! This game doesn't do anything outrageous or loud. But it does what it does so well. The graphics are not impressive, but not distractingly bad at all! Since there is no end goal to this game, if you like that sort of thing, it will bring you hundreds of hours of gameplay. Yes, hundreds. Whether you enjoy the various types of combat, or the diplomatic side of the game like running a town and making alliances and such, it is very enjoyable! Just play the demo and I'm sure you'll like it!			",186,72,5,12,17,3,22

												You may think that a game from a couple of years ago that hasn't quite aged itself into the classics genre yet would be quite unplayable. You may be wrong. This game accomplishes what so many others fall short of; depth and replayability. it manages to be fun while being simple enough to learn the basics of quickly but complex enough to learn something new each time you play it for 10 hours straight. Seriously addictive. Seriously a good value. Buy it.			",86,6,1,16,7,0,10

												Going to level with you, Its sequel Warband, is better in every way, has continuing mod support, multiplayer and is much more refined..... this Game does however have an excellently made mod called star wars conquest, which while the mod is dead, has a staggering amount of work put into it and is well worth the price of this game aloneIt also has some Warhammer and Lord of the Rings mods, truth be told the M&B series always has brilliant replayability!

												It's like Skyrim, but without dragons. Or with magic. Or with good graphics. It does have giant battles with the ability to lead large groups of AI in sieges on cities or even traveling merchants. While a lot of praise has gone to its sorta sequel Warband, this is still a very fun game that's worth your time.			",108,18,0,13,6,0,22

												Very very fun game. I put ten hours in before I stopped playing the first time. Although Warband is much better, if you can't afford it just buy this instead, you'll still have a very good time on it. The game doesn't really teach you how to play or command your troops or anything like this but its easy enough to pick up after a little playing, aslo the game can be unforgivng if a lord with a giant♥♥♥♥♥army thinks about♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ing you untill you bleed, and the combat is a bit queer but you'll get used to that, I enjoy the game a lot over all and I think it's a good buy.
