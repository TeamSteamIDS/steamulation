												Borderlands 2 is a game for those that enjoy the feeling of finding awesome equipment hidden in a massive pile of other stuff.Sure, you don't NEED to go in-depth with this game.  On the first playthrough you can get by with just picking up gear as you travel along, choosing stuff that looks better than your current gear, and maybe occasionally buying something in the vendor that looks handy.  The deeper you go down the rabbit hole however, the more there is to discover.The story is decent for a First Person Shooter (albeit one with RPG elements), and dialogue is often amusing to a degree.  Handsome Jack, the main antagonist is a cartoon villain with M rated attitudes.  He believes, or at least pretends to believe that he is the good guy, and you are just a ""Filthy Bandit."".Graphically, the game has a lot more variations in design and color scheme than it's predecessor (which was brown, brown, and a bit of color here and there).  Cell shaded graphics with thick, graphic novel like outlines is the style of the game, and does a good job of separating it from the average FPS.Now, on to the gameplay itself!:Action is often fast paced and exciting.  So long as you don't allow yourself to get too far ahead of the enemy levels, you'll find battles where you have to fight hard to win.  The game does a decent job of easing you into the various elements, such as different gun types (Pistol, SMG, Assault/Combat Rifle, Shotgun, Revolver, Rocket Launcher, and Sniper Rifle), the importance of a good shield, grenade mods (alter the way your grenade behaves, including damage bonuses and special effects), Class Mods (Class-specific devices which can boost skills, and have other effects like increasing fire rate with specific weapon types), and lastly Relics (Device which generally boost damage or defence in some way).  Equipment rarity is also made fairly clear.  It goes White, Green, Blue, Purple, Magenta, Orange, Seraph, and Pearlescent.  The final two rarities (Pearlescent and Seraph) are special.  Seraphs require you to have at least one of the season pass DLC to obtain (and you need all 4 of the Season Pass DLC to obtain all the Seraph rarity items), and as to Pearlescent rarity weapons, you need to be in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (Playthrough 3) for them to have a chance of being spawned.  Don't assume that a blue is automatically better than a green rarity item, even at the same level.  Experiment!Playable Characters and Skills:There are 4 included playable characters, and two DLC characters.  Each class has it's ups and downs, and a special game changing skill unique to them.  For example, Salvador (Gunzerker) will dual-wield guns when his action skill is active, meaning TWICE THE FIREPOWER.  Axton (Commando) drops a turret, which damages enemies and draws aggression away from you.  Maya (Siren) locks an enemy's movements for a short time, allowing you to get in free hits.  Zer0 turns invisible for a few seconds and launches a decoy, and his first attack made whilst in this mode does increased damage.  The DLC characters are Gaige (Mechromancer) who launches a flying robot that attacks nearby enemies, and Kreig (Psycho); a schizophrenic musclebound maniac that will whale on everything within reach with increased offensive and defensive capabilities and can even throw his axe at more distant targets.Aside from the action skills unique to the character, there are various other skills that you can put points into, and have an effect on gameplay in some way.  For example, increasing fire rate or damage for a few seconds after a kill is made.  Each character has 3 skill trees, each ending with a final gamechanging skill modifier.  For example, Zer0's Bloodlust (Melee) tree ends with the Many Must Fall perk, which will instantly re-deploy the hologram if he kills the enemy with one melee strike.  As mentioned before, Class Mods unique to a character class will boost certain skills.  It's possible for them to go as high as +6, meaning some skills can be boosted to 11, as the normal limit on points you can put into most skills is 5, though some skills are only 1 (those usually affect the way you play).Plus, there is a gun that shoots swords....EXPLODING swords...In DLC4 (Tiny Tina's Assault on the Dragon Keep).  So yeah, there is that too.I hope you found my review useful, even if it might be a bit messy XD			",671,133,13,93,51,6,80

Borderlands 2 - Excellent Story, Solid Gameplay, Great Characters and one of the very best Coop experiences around.  || 9.5 || Score Comment   Graphics 8 Borderlands 2 has a visual style all its own, it may not initially impress some used to a ""next generation, high definition, ultra realistic landscape"", but it is nevertheless very appealing and detailed. Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora (the world on which the story takes place) are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere. Characters and enemies are detailed and extremely varied in appearance. You can customise your characters appearance with a large selection of outfits and heads which you can collect throughout the game.   Audio 10 No real killer soundtrack here (apart from the the introduction video), just really good atmospheric music throughout. Where this game really shines is the voice acting for characters, enemies, audio logs and even weapons (yes some of them can talk!). The dialogue is often very funny, helping to explain and drive the story, fill in background and really adds the the immersion.   Gameplay 9 A mix of FPS and RPG, Borderlands 2 is a lot of fun to play. So many missions to complete, so many enemies to kill, so much loot to grab. You are given massive area's to explore all over the world of pandora filled with creatures, quests, secrets and homages to lots of popular culture. Controls are responsive, intuitive and the game mechanics (even at higher difficulties) feel fair and well thought through. As you progress through the game you will earn xp and levels which allow you to customise your characters skills giving a large variety of gameplay styles.   Story 9 The story in Borderlands 2 is rich and engaging. The action is character driven, and while the main story is fairly linear, the open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora. It also has one of the most badass, charasmatic and handsome villians of all time...    Replayability 9 So many reasons to replay this game. Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards. There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different. Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore. Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character. These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text).    Multiplayer 10 For me, this game remains simply the best cooperative multiplayer experiences you can have. Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team. Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels. The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication.    Overall 9.5 I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters. So much fun to pick up and play with friends. - I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game. To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more.

												There is something to be said for a game that I just don't get sick of. I have owned this on console and played through TVHM at least 4 times with 4 different characters there. Played all the DLC except Tiny Tina on console, but when the GOTY edition became so cheap on PC I jumped at it and bought all the Headhunter DLCs, and the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack as well. So I can now play through the game THREE times on a character. DarI'm so addicted to this game still, but the funny thing is that I don't even finish it, or even come close to it now. I'm in a mass addiction to boosting my Badass Ranks so I just keep trying to ""prestige"" it instead of moving on and going towards UVHM. xDI feel like I can pick this game up and play it at any time. Do a few things, and then quit playing. Unfortunately, for me anyways, I don't do that. I keep playing for hours, and I let all the other hundreds of games in my library continue to pile up. I play this game EXCLUSIVELY in SINGLE PLAYER. People will tell you that it is much more fun playing with friends, and truly it can be, but don't disregard this game as a single player game. It is insanely addictive, and it actually poses some slight challenges to you to play it solo. Beating Raid Bosses solo is actually a genuine accomplishment, if you can actually do it. They are meant to be beaten witha 4 player team, but you CAN beat many of them solo. The new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM) makes it an even more insane challenge to play solo just for the regular game enemies. Needing to pump them full of slag just so you can actually get ready to start damaging them with any real power. Of course all this is basically a math problem of damage output vs. damage defense. Borderlands 2, simply put, is one of the best games ever made in my opinion. The sheer addictiveness and fun in playing it are jsut off the charts. I recommend this to anyone, even if you think you won't like it. I thought Borderlands 1 looked stupid for years until I bought it for $5 with everything and realized how amzing the concept is and how it was made for OCD gamers. Now they are both 2 of my most played games ever, and I don't see myself stopping BL2 anytime soon. After all I ahven't even used The Psycho yet!Buy the GOTY Edition. It is the best deal by far and has most of the relevant content you will want. Forget about the Season Pass and regular game. GOTY has all that stuff and more. Then buy the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack to get extra level sand a 3rd round. The headhunter DLCs are worth it too for the cheap prices. Only thing not to buy are the stupid skin packs. Unless you like that sort of thing. Wait for it to go 75% off and you can get GOTY, UVH Pack, and allt he Headhunter DLCs for less than $20. BTW...these DLCs are legit and worth buying. This isn't some garbage map pack DLC, or jsut skins. These are high quality and large DLCs on the scale of the FAllout DLCs, and add even more than that in some of tehm. GOTY edition has almost too much content. >_>			",554,280,18,56,35,8,38

												Borderlands 2 has a lot of what made the original great. Its a shooter with role playing elements. Players loot enemies to collect gear that best compliments their play style.If you aren't familiar with BL, the best way to explain this is to take the addicting looting system of Diablo and combine it with the basic elements of an FPS, throwing in some RPG via an inventory and skill tree. That's essentially the mechanics of the game, and it all slams together so well here. You have four basic classes to choose to play from, and each class has three paths to focus on in a skill tree -- this means there's plenty of variation to play. In addition to these basic mechanics, the game is open-world, though it may feel semi-linear as you can only explore on an area-by-area basis (think the opposite of an Elder Scrolls game, where you can walk around the entire map without hitting a loading screen until accessing a dungeon). I have to say, with combining so many of our favorite gaming formulas, this game has so many highlights. Sometimes I felt like I was playing something akin to Skyrim. Other times, the ambiance of a specific area or the design of a specific feature reminded me of BioShock. And sometimes certain things brought me back to my Fallout 3 days. However, I never forgot I was playing a completely new adventure that easily whisked me away for hours in the unique and captivating world of Pandora. Lastly, I can't forget the guns. No joke, there are millions of guns you can find. It is so satisfying to find a ridiculous weapon and destroy enemies for the next three hours with it, only to find another weapon that is even better.One thing many BL veterans mentioned is the lack of a good narrative beyond funny one-liners in the original game. I never played Borderlands 1, but I can tell you that in BL 2 the characters are memorable, the writing is well-thought out and downright hilarious, and the story moves at a great pace with scenes of great emotion and other scenes of great sarcasm. This is all coming from someone who is used to epic stories from Final Fantasy or Mass Effect. Also, be sure to keep your ears peeled while you fight the various enemies. They say and do some hilarious things themselves. But seriously, the writing is just super clever.In conclusion, this is one heck of a game. I feel that it combines the best of so many game genres into a single FPS while adding in a memorable story that motivates you to find out what happens next. Of course, you'll be laughing your face off the entire way.			",559,95,13,49,23,2,23

												Definitely one of the best ""new"" games I have played. This game is fun to play solo or over the net with friends. The characters are witty, yeah even Claptrap :) Graphics are beautiful... Even after playing this game over 3000 hours; the game gives wow-moments to me. And every time there's something new.... and the vast choice of weapons, shields and other gadgets. So I full-heartedly recommend Borderlands 2. And yes, I will play co-op with you :)			",720,411,12,107,84,5,117

												I had played 1200 hours before I even tried any of the DLC. Now, if that doesn't speak to the incredible level of fun and depth that this game brings, well, I just don't know that anything can. Sometimes I wonder how much better my life would be if I had spent those 1400 hours doing something constructive like studying my trade, helping the poor, or working on my home. But not often. Second best game ever made. Absolutely terrific. Life ruiner. Go for it.			",190,63,3,58,41,1,49

												It's been a few years, so there's not much I can say that was missed/overlooked by other reviews, but I still get someone every once in a while asking ""how is the game now,"" now that the community has dwindled in activity. This is the best way I can describe it:Playing Borderlands 2 is just like going to a Standup Comedy Club.You can go alone, have a couple drinks, you'll enjoy yourself. Some of the jokes will be pretty old, but you'll still enjoy the way they are told by the new comedians. At the end of the show you'll go home and think ""that was great, I'm glad I did that.""On the other hand. If you go with some of your goofy friends you'll probably all be drunk as hell before the headliner even takes the stage. Absolutely everything will be funny as ♥♥♥♥ because that's just how it is when you're drunk with friends. At times you'll be having so much fun being stupid with each other that you might forget there's a guy on-stage trying to keep your attention. After the show you'll drag yourselves home, wondering where the hell that donkey came from, and swear you'll never do it again... until next weekend when you do it again.Special Note: Please see the first 2 comments below explaining high hours.

												Borderlands 2 is an action role playing first person shooter, developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2k Games in September 2012. It is the second game in the Borderlands series and the sequel to the popular 2009 hit Borderlands 1. As with the first game, you are able to complete a campaign with the main story quest and optional side missions as one of the four Vault hunters.  All of the key gameplay features are all present, such as online co-op, randomly generated loot and character building elements such as talent trees are all found in Borderlands 2. There has been a game of the year edition released last year which includes all the DLC apart from one. The gameplay at it's core is the same as Borderlands 1. The focus on randomly generated loot plays a huge part. Each of the characters you have the option to play as have their own specialty, and will bring a feel of originality to each playthrough on either of them.  We also see a new elemental effect in BL2, Slag, this is a substance that increases the damage a target takes if they are covered in it. You will also find Eridium bars as you play the game, these can be used to purchase storage upgrades and increase the amount of ammo you can carry. We also see an element of customizing how your character looks as well, you can unlock different skins, head designs, colour schemes and vehicle paint jobs.  Another major addition to BL2 is the ""Badd@ss rank"" system; points are awarded for completing certain in-game challenges, that in turn award tokens that will allow you to increase your base stats. These stat increases also take effect on all of your other single player characters too.  Also similar to the the original, we also see the return of a New Game Plus mode, in the form of ""True Vault Hunter Mode"", which increases the difficulty, and gives you a higher chance at even better loot drops. You are also able to level up to 50 in this mode too. The graphics in Borderlands 2 are virtually the same as the original, but with just a more enhanced look to them. We see the vibrant colour schemes in each zone come to life. Along with better quality textures too.  The style of graphics in Borderlands has always been a huge drawing point for me as there are hardly any other games which pull this style off as well as this. Your first playthrough Borderlands 2 will have a number of difficult encounters, but these can easily be overpowered by returning to the same bad guy, mission or zone after leveling up one or two more times, or getting a bigger better gun. If you stay on top of all of the side missions as you progress through the story mission, you will stay at the right level so that you won't just hit a brick wall of impossible monsters/enemies. To make matters easier when it comes to deciding how tough a mission will be, each one also has a recommended level - so you can easily see how hard a single mission will be without actually having to test the waters first. A full playthrough on single player of Borderlands 2 took me just under thirty hours. That is a pretty decent amount of content on offer, with the side missions and a decent amount of loot farming involved too. I have put almost 140 hours into Borderlands 2, as I have played various different characters through the story a number of times. This is a game where you can easily spend 300 hours and still be having the same amount of fun. I had zero amount of technical issues throughout BL2; the game is perfectly optimized, will run at 60 fps, and the cloud save feature makes it even better technically. Borderlands 2 is easily in my top 5 favorite games of all time. Just like the original, Borderlands 2 is a perfect game with no flaws in it at all. I cannot recommend this game enough. Most people will already have it since it goes on sale so much, but PLEASE play it. You will NOT be disappointed.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended 5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Borderlands 2 is a overall amazing game, different from many other shooters.It's colorful, looks amazing, and has one of the best shooter multiplayer experiences of all.All the content without DLC alone can be 60+ hours. The DLC adds even more to that. So farI have 250+ hours on the game and I'm not even done with all the modes.My only problem is that it kinda forces you to play with other players, playing multiplayer gives better loot,and makes the game much easier to play. Playing alone will get you killed alot unless your ready to grind a bit for the best weapons. But if your buying this game you'll probably play online anyway, since there's usually always at least one player around where you are in a public game.			",130,14,1,12,6,1,3

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Borderlands 2 Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: FPS; RPG; Cooperative; Lighthearted; Action  My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 30-100 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Multiplayer gamers  REVIEWBorderlands 2 is the sequel to the original installment of the franchise. Like the first one, it is a chef-d'oeuvre of gaming. It boasts a masterful blend of FPS and RPG elements with an elaborate loot system to make for truly delectable gameplay. Complementing the gameplay is the unique and self-identifying art style and graphics, the blithe and cartoonish atmosphere, and the lighthearted narrative and zany NPC characters. All of these factors working in concert generate one hell of a gaming experience that should be able to bring pleasure to nearly any gamer out there.Borderlands 2 plays very much like the first game, except there is just a little bit more of everything. Also, there are numerous small tweaks that go a long way to improve the tiny nuisances of the first installment. It is a direct sequel, but the lighthearted nature of the narrative allows for players to safely not worry about having played the first in order to understand the plot.At the core of Borderlands 2, we find the same exemplary elements found in the first installment of the franchise. The gameplay is designed to offer both the face-paced action of an FPS with the character progression elements and gameworld massiveness of an RPG. There is an XP system that awards level-ups and ability-boosts. There are scores of quests to complete; some ancillary and others pivotal to the core narrative. There is a crazy world to explore, filled with various interesting NPCs. Enemy spawns and combat occur in real-time, right in the midst of everything else that is going on in the gameworld. There is never a dull moment or a lack of something to be working towards.Borderlands 2 also has an elaborate and semi-random loot drop system. In the style made popular by games like Diablo, loot spills out of chests, crates, and enemies to pile up on the floor for you to peruse. Much of it will be junk, but you must always keep an eye out for the rare high quality drops. This is the same style used in the first Borderlands, except it has been amplified to offer a much wider variety of goodies. Due to the nature of the stat-progression of the weapons and the sheer variety, you will find yourself experimenting with many more and various weapons than you would in a standard FPS.With Borderlands 2 comes the return of the self-identifying art style that was made iconic in the first game; except the graphics are more crisp and detailed in this installment. The graphics fit the theme of the game with perfection, as they expertly relay the feeling of zany, cartoonish raucousness that the game is striving to evoke. This atmosphere sets the tone for the burlesquing narrative which never wastes an opportunity to poke fun at the other, more serious games it relates to.  Also returning in Borderlands 2 is the option for a cooperative multiplayer approach to playing the campaign. The multiplayer also borrows from the style made popular by games like Diablo. You are able to play with other people by either allowing them to join your session or by joining theirs. You bring your own characters and earn your own XP and loot, but the game will be progressed up to the point that the host has reached. Playing with friends, or even with random people, can make the experience exponentially more hilarious and fun.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! ",488,241,24,56,32,8,71

												After more than 300h playing this is my short review.Pros- Story rich, the devepment of the story game is brilliant even with the side quests, you will hate and love Handsome Jack.- Jack, he is one of the best main antagonist in gaming history.- Amazing NPC characters like Tina, Claptrap, Mr.Torgue, Roland, etc.- Great playable classes all different to each other and all of them intereting to play in different way.- Loot, it's hard to get some legendaries but it's always fun to open a chest and get something amazing.- Weapons, super fun to learn what this new gun with red text does (one of them shoots explosive swords!)- Eastern eggs, there's one quest that you have to bring a ring from Claptrap Place to one mountain in Eredium Blight and throw it to the lava then 3 birds comes with loot chests lol.- Best community ever, always willing to help and play with you.Cons- Claptrap needs a wife			",32,15,1,0,7,2,4

												There were a lot of things that made Borderlands such a great game when it came out three years ago: the hardscrabble planet, the oddball characters, the hostile creatures, the diverse missions, the abundant loot, the powerful skill trees, and the novelty of all these things combined in a cooperative first-person shooter. In Borderlands 2, the novelty is gone, but all of the other elements are back and better than ever. This sequel doubles down on the successes of the original and shores up its shortcomings, improving the familiar formula and delivering dozens and dozens of hours of immensely entertaining gameplay.THE GOOD:- A ton of great mission writing and dialogue- Enticing loot and experience rewards- Intriguing skill trees- Rich, inviting gameworldTHE BAD:- Spoken messages sometimes interrupt each other- One character ability is not substantially different from the core gunplay8.7/10 for me!

												This is a kinda game that you pick up, play until your balls are busted, drop it for a while and then pick it up again later.It's really fun, with a lot of guns (It is a lot of them. I thought I knew it but I've been told that in vanilla, BL2 had est. 1 mil guns). With a very well made combat and RPG system, this kinda game is something that everyone will gain a laugh out of, especially with friends. However that does not excuse it of the flaws it has. As you start the game, a Russian-ish man by the name of Marcus Kincaid tells you the introduction of the story, saying what happened in the ending of B1 (The original Vault Hunters finding and opening the vault only to find ""tentacles and disappointment"" which is weird since I find tentacles alone disappointing.) However, Hyperion has decided to step into power, by putting a H-formed Space Station over the sun/moon/whatever that thing is, making many of the areas overshadowed, and it also gives the game a ""Big Brother"" feeling with Hyperion watching Pandora.You are one out of 4 (6 with DLC. It's explained that Krieg got involved by riding on the side of the train in the end of ""A Meat Bicycle Made For Two"" but not how Gaige got in the train) Vault Hunters on a train, to find the new vault that Hyperion has discovered. Then they attempt to kill you, but Axton (as the Commando), Maya (as the Siren), Salvador (as the Gunzerker) and Zer0 (as a number Assassin) manages to together, survive and get into the last train cart, only to find a doll of Handsome Jack the antagonist, wired with loadsa bombs, welcoming them to Pandora before their supposed demise.This is where the game begins, with one (or depending on the friends you start with) Vault Hunter waking up in a snowstorm only to have a Steward Bot by the name of CL4-TP (Nicknamed ""Claptrap"" by his deceased non-existent friends) dig their grave. He finds you waking up, and enlists you as his ""Minion"" right from the get-go, and instructs you to get to Sanctuary with him.It may be a cheesy setup, but it's hella less cheesy than what B1 had.The gameplay is pretty much ""Grab the best that you can deal with until you find better guns to make bullets go out of them and into the enemies' heads and/or bodies."" Where you pretty much side quest until you've got guns good enough to face an army without having a Hulk with you (Unless you're playing Psycho where you are the Hulk.) Gearbox are pretty much ""Quantity over Quality"" when it comes to guns. Happiness is a warm gun when it comes to this game. The RPG system isn't like them Call of Duty games (This is a line you expected didn't you) where you can trade items, bid for them or duel for them with other players. One thing that I HATE though is that you only get 45 skill points instead of 50 when max level (Without DLC).The classes available are different from one another, and none of them are your average ""rooty-tooty-point-'n'-shooty-man"" due to their different trees and action skills. The Commando is the guy who likes Tower Defense games and has a turret with him to shoot and distract different enemies. When upgraded, it can cast a shield for your allies, be thrown on ceilings and walls, carry more guns and even rockets, plus having two of them! The Siren is a very much support class, her Phaselock lifts an enemy into the air and surrounds it in a ball of energy, which when upgraded can draw enemies towards it, deal elemental damage to everyone around, make your guns fire faster, and you can even make so that an enemy killed in Phaselock can heal you and your allies. She's also got a skill which lets you heal your allies by shooting them.The Gunslinger is all about compensating for his (presumably small) dong. He can wield two guns instead of one, and when upgraded can make so that you can distract enemies towards you, being able to gunzerk while downed, have a chance of not spending ammo when firing a gun, and... Just in general shoot two guns.The Assassin can turn invisible, and can regenerate health while cloaked, be able to perform backstabs, mark targets which makes them take more damage, throw Kunais with random elemental effects,  or you can make bandits be like ""He's like the wind..."" by getting increased gun and melee damage when moving (per level). There's also a skill called ""B0re"" which makes so that your shots have a chance of penetrating enemies and deal more damage every time it goes through someone... Gross.There are 5 elements in the game, Fire (great against those without a shield), Shock (Great against shields), Corrosive (Incredibly effective towards robots), Explosion (Which is pretty much self-explanotary) and Slag (By ""slagging"" an enemy, they take more damage when attacked by non-slag weapons.) Guns can either have one of these elements, or just have regular bullets which are all-rounders really. There are Pistols, SMGs, Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, Rocket Launchers and grenades. There's also E-Tech weapons. How do they work? Well, to quote Dr. Zed, ""It turns bullets into... Stuff that ain't bullets!"" They're different from bullet/rocket launchers. Normally they have better stats than normal guns but are harder to use. To quote Dr. Zed again, ""E-Tech is friggin' dope.""However the game expects you to do all the side quests, and such can get ahead of you quite a lot of times for people who just wanna beat the story real quick. It also has lots of difficulty spikes throughout the campaign, especially in the New Game Plus (named True Vault Hunter Mode).Despite all of this, it's a really good game, awesome with friends too. I'd say that you all should go and get it when it goes on a sale.			",243,19,0,11,15,3,13

Posted: November 7, 2014
												My favourite thing about this game is it’s captivating story. With a lot of humour, this game pulls off an action shooter with RPG aspects and a storyline you should follow. There are lots of sidequests that will take hours to complete, but the benefits of completing this game are well worth the time. With millions of different guns, a lot of different character skins and a unique experience with all the various classes, this game has hours of fun built straight in.The game will be fun no matter which class you play, but that’s not entirely due to the class. I found that most of the classes really lack something to keep you interested in, and throughout the whole game it feels like more attention was given to certain classes over others. Story-wise, the siren is pretty much the only class that gets any attention and backstory, as an individual with a history and as a class with abilities. All of the classes have a slight amount of backstory that becomes obvious throughout the game, but Siren has significantly more, and even then it’s very little.Beyond that, the entertainment value of playing as certain classes over others was very noticeable to me. I played as all the classes, including the 2 DLC classes, and some of the abilities and skill trees and other class-specific aspects were lacking for a bunch of the classes. Some things that were common for all of the classes were that there are certain skill trees that seem obviously better than other ones and significantly simpler to think about, making them seem more attractive, and all of the classes lack enough in-game backstory to really get a feel for them. With all these classes, it comes down to a matter of opinion, what sort of playstyle you like and other such things, but I’ve found that there are some that are distinctly more enjoyable than others.I think if there were more random Echo Recorders placed around the maps with a bunch of stories about the characters, with more information on them the game could be a lot more interesting. Throughout my playing of the game, I found a couple about Maya (the siren), one about Zer0 (the assassin/ghost) and nothing about any other character. That’s always been something that annoyed me. The stories of the characters may exist somewhere, but if they do, they are probably too hard to find.In terms of story, I loved this game. There was a hint of humour in just about every interaction you had with the other characters, and the story overall was very captivating and kept me playing. I think the end-game was a bit lacking and didn’t completely match up with the story, but it was still interesting and I don’t regret playing this game through at all. The side quests in this game were very extensive, and easily one of my favourite aspects of the game. Some sidequests are very tedious and boring, but others are absolutely a blast, like those given to you by Tiny Tina (pun intended ;) ).The replayability of this game isn’t infinite, it does get boring to play through the same parts over and over again in this game, but that doesn’t mean you can’t play it more than once at all. Replaying the game in True Vault Hunter Mode, a difficulty increase that allows you to replay the game using your already powerful character, can still be quite fun. The difficulty of the game overall becomes harder while maintaining the same story with no new additions aside from more powerful guns.The playstyle in this game is very different from that of most other shooters. In Borderlands, you don’t really need to conserve any ammo and you can run around, jump and do a bunch of other crazy things while still attacking enemies. This makes the game more casual and relaxed, which I found to be pretty enjoyable. You very rarely run out of ammo, with all the excessive boxes with tons of different types of ammunition and the cheap price at which you can buy ammo in shops. That brings me to my next point, which is the excess of money in this game. There is very rarely an opportunity where spending money makes much sense or is beneficial, with ammo being really cheap and not really affecting your money and most of the items in shops being pretty bad compared to the ones you can get outside from drops. I know a lot of people enjoy using the slot machines at Moxxi’s bar, but I never found it that entertaining when it for the most part doesn’t get me anything decent. Pretty much the only point of collecting money is to get the badass ranks.The whole badass system is something I really like in Borderlands. Being able to slightly upgrade your character in about every way imaginable pretty awesome. Slowly, you’ll amass badass ranks by completing these missions, the more difficult missions resulting in more badass ranks, and for every 25 badass ranks you’ll get 1 badass token which can be used to upgrade one of the 5 stats presented. I really like the additional content that this adds to the game.Personally, I far prefer playing this game with other people. I don’t like playing very many games alone, and even if I’m playing a singleplayer game, I like to be talking to other people at the same time. I find it a lot more enjoyable, and the same thing applies to this game. I’ve never played this game without other people simply because every moment allows for a lot more laughing and interaction when you’re doing it with other people. If I had played through this game alone, I might have noticed some interesting bits of humour, but I never would have started laughing hysterically at some glitchy motion or funny joke. The enjoyment is multiplied by a lot when playing this game with other people.Something I noticed is that everyone plays this game differently. Personally, I like to play it patiently, doing all the sidequests, and being sure I’m making the right decisions with my skill points and gun choices. When I play Borderlands, I also like to play for as long of a period as possible. Of course I know nothing is that big of a deal, but I like being patient with this game and spending time on everything because I like feeling that I’m making the right decisions. Some of the people I have played with like to speed through the game and skip any extra content and make the easiest decisions possible. I think it’s important to play with people that have at least a similar mindset to you so that you aren’t being forced to play in a way that you aren’t entirely comfortable with.Warning: Slight spoilers in following paragraph. Reader discretion is advised.The final boss of the game really irked me. There was a whole obsession with how it was summoned using a siren and the key, both of which are very eridium oriented. The final boss used a lot of fiery attacks and swam in the pools of lava that surrounded the boss fight. I think it would have made a lot more sense if they were pools of molten eridium or something, with the boss spewing out eridium, or at least something purple, rather than fire. This game also has some really amazing individual lines. They are scared all throughout the game, but easily my favourite is the line that Scooter says when you meet him in Sanctuary. I’ve probably ruined the rewatching of that line several times when replaying the game with friends, through my inability to repeat the line properly and because I keep on trying.Overall, this game can easily be worth $20 depending on how much you play it and how much you enjoy it. I’d recommend getting it on sale simply because I’ve seen it go on sale reasonably often, for at least 66% off, but the game is also getting older and the Pre-Sequel (another game in this series, taking place between the first and second games) did come out recently. Quite simply, I love the amount of humour in this game, it’s a fun game to sink plenty of time into, and probably one of my top 10 all time games because of how much of a blast I had with it.

												Borderlands is an FPS+RPG game that includes tons of shooting and looting fun.Probably one of my favorite games of all time, I've had so much fun both in singleplayer and with other friends. The game has lots and lots of dlcs for you to enjoy, not to mention all the different guns this game has. It has such a massive variation  , almost every gun spawn with random parts from each manufacturer which makes it even more interesting. The art style is cartoon-ish which i think is absolutely great makes it really cool to play. The game has alot of replay value since they give you already 4 characters with their own uniqe skills to play around with plus the two dlc characters. The game is fairly long and there is still alot of stuff to do if you actualy complete it. The world is completely open and there is alot of exploring to do in the game. I've spent up to many hours getting just one gun that i wanted, but when you finally get the gun you have been farming or hunting for you really feel that you have achieved something. I made alot of friends in the past playing this game, either i joined random games or i found someone through the community, we had tons of fun together and we always kept on playing it every day. The coop has space for up to 4 players which i think is just fine considering the balancing of enemies (The more players you harder the game becomes, the better loot you will get.) That's really all i have to say about this wonderful game, I give it 10/10 probably the best game I've ever played, recommended to the highest.			",685,211,32,69,55,2,77

I mean, it IS a really hard mission which barely tells you what to do. The quest only says: Shoot McShooty in the face...but not in the arm...but not in the leg...but not in the chestFace Mcshooty also screams something about shooting him in the face but even today, professional Borderlands players are STILL trying to figure out what he means by that. The ONLY way to beat this mission is to cheat by messing with the game's code. Otherwise this mission is way too cryptic and impossible to beat.Also great game tho			",114,21,2,14,16,0,9

TL:DR? See CONCLUSIONINTRODUCTION:Borderlands 2 is the sequel to the popular first-person co-op action adventure game Borderlands. Developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K games, it uses the formula which made the first game good and expanded it in astronomical proportions. The game promises larger maps, expanded co-op play, new classes and most importantly, procedurally generated items resulting in an almost infinite weapon & item variation.PLOT (No Spoilers):The story picks up after the events of the first game. Hyperion Corporation headed by Handsome Jack has arrived on Pandora, stolen the Vault Key and is driving the inhabitants to near extinction. The Vault Hunters from the first game (Roland, Lilith, Mordecai, & Brick) has gathered what was left of the Crimson Lance and reorganized them into the Crimson Raiders to stop Handsome Jack. The player takes control of a new set of Vault Hunters in their quest to help the Crimson Raiders stop Hyperion from opening a second Vault and unleashing a sleeping monster within.PROS:+ Cell-shaded textures that works well with the art style of the game+ Great voice acting and characters, most notably, Handsome Jack+  Expanded world which is almost 3 times larger than the first game+ New classes with new skills that are fun to play+ Entering and inviting for Co-op play is simple and easy+ Improved story from the first game with well paced missions+ Re-playability. The fun does not end after the final boss! There are new unlockable modes and expanded  adventure with...+ Quality Story DLC that adds several hours of game time per DLC campaign+ A lot of guns. “87 Bazillion Guns” as claimed by Gearbox+ Improved enemy AI that goes well with...+ Enemy Variety. Fight of bandits, robots, worms, armoured spiders, flying monsters and a whole lot more, each requiring the player to adapt by changing play-styles.+ Substantial amount of unlockable Character customization+ Good use of Physx for the benefit of PC gamersCONS:- Texture pop-in. Mostly noticeable when entering the game or entering a new area- Loot sharing needs to be improved since ninja looting is a concern for most players- In-game voices and messages, even story related ones, can overlap each other. New messages will cancel out any playing messages which is very annoying if your trying to immerse yourself in the story.- No ECHO (in-game voice message) replay like the first game. Once a voice-over message given by an NPC is overlapped, there is no way to listen to it again, aside from starting a new game plus.- Some DLC maps have glitchesCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and with a good blend of first-person shooting action, coupled with the progression and quest system of an RPG and all the fun and excitement of co-op play.WORTH IT?:I RECOMMEND this game to anyone looking for a fun coop experience with their buddies or story oriented gamers who likes an immersive experience. Although the game is well worth it's full price, I would still recommend this to be bought on SALE because of how often this title get discounted and by the sheer amount of DLCs available.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												Cod: Black ops 3: $80.00-generic shooter-worst game community next to fnaf and undertale-expensive dlc-you need a room sized super cpu or some sh*t to run itBorderlands 2 4 Pack: $66.49-4 good games for the price of one crappy game-not a generic shooter-can run on a toaster-actual humour-has more than 3 colours-good campaign-good story-good community-you and your friends can play it-affordable dlc, for example: Cod zombie map: $10.00, just a map, nothing much else. Borderlands 2 expansion: $10.00, new customizations, enemies, weapons, among alot of other thingsIn conclusion, if you want a bland, boring shooter, buy Cod, if you want a Colourful, enjoyable shooter, buy Borderlands 2			",47,5,0,6,6,1,2

												Overall a great and funny RPG shooter game with frantic gameplay, unforgettable characters and tons of content. The art style is very unique and simple, and still looks great especially when you consider the age of this game. The loot system is exceptional, in my opinion, and I've spent hours grinding bosses or continuously clearing out areas to obtain rare items. Each weapon feels different and special because of randomly generated parts/unique characteristics. Playing with friends makes this game extremely fun to play, and if you don't have friends for whatever reason, then you can find an open session online and play with others. Definetely recommended!Personal Rating: 9.5/10			",785,244,24,54,87,7,86

												Don't read this...Buy the game.A solid 10/10 game.The Good, the Bad, and the MordecaiThe Good:-Amazing story. The main story is truly funny and enjoyable.-Replay value: Having different characters with different play styles, Borderlands 2 stands out as one of the best games. -Achievements: You can get all the achievements with some work. None of them are bugged. You can get 100% of the  achievements.-Raid Boss fights: challenging and hard. See my guides on how to beat the Raid bosses under steam community guides. Many people consider Voracidious on op8 solo as hard as any Dark Souls boss-You will find yourself laughing over and over again. Handsome Jack ""Hey buddy it's me Roland lets go out for milkshakes"". Claptrap ""Your ability to walk short distances will be Handsome Jack's downfall.""  Herbert ""this concludes the sound of scarlett sleeping tape 96.""-Co-op: You can play with your friends which makes the good very fun. The people in the community overall are very nice. I would like to thank the community.-Character diversity: You will like this game regardless of your playstyle. Zero is Gearbox's Assasin Creed-Easter eggs: The game has tons and tons of easter eggs. For example, the vault dweller skin is a reference to Fall out.-NPC's: Very funny. Tiny Tina is one of the best NPC's in this game. Marcus very greedy (He reminds of Mr. Krabs from Spongebob). As for Moxxi,.....""You know what to do sugar""The Bad: I wish these things Gearbox would improve- Vermivorous: he spawns so rarely. While good in theory, Vermivorous hardly spawns even with 4 players-While Gearbox improved the legendary drop rates, it is nowhere near as good as Borderlands 1. I hope Borderlands 3 has better drop rates.The Mordecai: This was the joke part.Thank you for reading my comment			",226,170,8,22,33,3,33

												Having watched the first moon landing live on television should let you know approxamately how long I have been on this planet.  Having spent several years and accumulating just under 1,500 hours of play in BL2 I would have to say that I never actually thought (once I got the hang of it) that I was playing a game.  But rather, living an experience that a lot of people will never understand as they have never played this game or any others.  Some how at some time a while back I became a part of the game and actually had the thought that I was actually in the game running and shooting for my very own life.  Several times during game play I had to pause to catch my breathe and shake off the tention and stress of a certain campain.  Other than sex, nothing has quite captivated me as this game has.  Thanks for the journey.			",16,1,0,1,0,0,0

												Bout time I reviewed this game. This review is coming from over 2000 hours of game time (Steam and xbox combined) so i know the ins and outs of nearly every part of the game.To start with, its a great solid game in which will provide plenty of entertainment for you and friends, solo or in a full team of 4. Yes the game is a blast solo, though alot is said about its co-op experience however that doesn't mean it isn't fun for single players, but obviously you can get more (or less in terms of loot) from playing with friends. This game is addicting, you just want more and better loot and to level up, kill the raid to get loot to kill the raid again, run arenas, play slots, chest farm, boss farm, toilet farm... well those aren't that lucrative. The fast paced gameplay and tense combat is great fun and when you get through without dying or going down you get a real sense of achievment, or relief if you did happen to do down or die. A first playthrough is always a blast and that alone is worth its cost, then if you REALLY enjoyed yourself you get to do it at a higher level, with more challenge, but more reward. This game for me is about gameplay, not the story telling, yeah there is a stronger story than BL1 and more narrated side missions it still isn't up there with the likes of halo, GoW or other top, story focused games. So don't go in expecting to have a brilliant campaign story, go in expecting to have fun, and to have a good laugh.There are plenty styles of play that Borderlands supports. Like being the center of attention, taking fire, tank it all and kicking out lots of dps at close range? Gunzerker. Like sitting back and sniping? Zer0, who isn't affraid to go ninja and stab enemies in the back. There is the siren, a support character for that team player. Then there's Axton, well, axton is a tricky one, tough to play at the top levels however early game, he shines with his huge tank, area of effect (the nuclear kind) and crowd control. then there are two bonus to provide lots more hours of fun after you get bored of the other four.Yeah the game has its downs, its buggy, the scaling of certain skills, mechanics such as damage over time and certain types weapons just lose out to level. At top end level the game almost becomes unfair to the player forcing them to use only the best gear in the game, specific builds and so on, but then again, it is the top level. Its easy to break certain parts of missions forcing you to reload your game which can be very fustrating, also the AI has some weird quirks but overall isn't too game breaking.Overall this is a game I would recommend even now just before the pre sequel as this is a game that will never grow old, will allways be fun to pick up and play, yes it has some flaws but to a flawless game is nearly impossible and well this is a game that triggered the looter shooter genre and so it must be good!

												Now I think after my 2500+hours on console and my 300 here, it's about time I said some words on this spectactular game.PROS:-Addictive-Massive amounts of replay value-Billions of guns-Fast fun FPS gameplay with an RPG twist-Loot that rivals Diablo 3-Hordes of bosses-Interesting story-Great voice acting-Fantastic villian-Interesting characters-Cel-shaded graphics that still look great 4 years later-4-player Co op-Level from 1-72 plus up to 8 OP levels-Great classes-A popular playerbase-GUNS!!!-Tons of sidequests-A bunch of hidden easter eggs-AND MUCH, MUCH MORE! CONS:-Gets a bit boring after 3000+ hours-Some classes aren't balanced for OP8 and are unusable-OP8 as a whole is pretty unbalanced-No buy all ammo button-Seraph weapons suck-Pearlecent weapons suck       I can say for a fact that Borderlands 2 is worth spending your hard earned money on. *Sorry if my format is a little stupid, first legit review kek*(edit) Wanted to add in that after the game gets boring, you can do some challenge runs. Some range from pretty easy to nearly impossible. Just google Bl2 Challenge runs and you should be able to find the more popular ones, Oor y'know, come up with your own challenges. This for sure adds a decent amount of hours to your gameplay.			",101,13,0,21,4,0,6

												Borderlands 2 is an awesome game. It has an interesting story, great characters (especially the main villain Handsome Jack and your companion CL4P-TP aka Claptrap the mini robot) and some of the best gameplay I've ever experienced.In a nutshell, you are a vault hunter and you are enlisted by a hyperactive CL4P-TP robot who calls himself Claptrap and refers to you as his minion. He wants you to help him bring down the villain Handsome Jack who is apparently responsible for shutting down the CL4P-TP production line.You can play it single player, but at the same time open your game for up to three others so it becomes a co-op game, and it is at co-op that the game absolutely excels. The creatures on Pandora (where the game takes place) become stronger or weaker depending on how many players there are in a game.As you progress through the story, you level up. Every mission you play, whether main or side mission has a certain preset level that would be nice for you to have making it clear in advance which missions are easier and harder. Expect more higher level missions as you progress. I think this system works very well indeed for this game. I had a ton of fun playing it, the dialogue is fantastic, the voice acting excellent, the diversity of characters and creatures is astoundingly large.If you like FPS, humor, great story, great characters and excellently finetuned gameplay, this game is for you. If you liked Borderlands, you're gonna love Borderlands 2.10/10 will tip Mad Moxxi again			",70,32,4,7,9,0,29

Borderlands 2 Review - Rating: 9.1/10General ImpressionBorderlands 2 is a fantastic game, with many great features, and many hours of gameplay. The graphics and the textures are cartoonish, yet the developers managed to well-design them to look pretty great. The atmosphere is fantastic, there are a ton of maps, all of them are very large, and most of them will offer you a good time of combating enemies and exploring the areas. From the coldest mountains, to the hottest deserts, this game has it all. The audio is nice, the sounds of the guns are much diversified, the cars’ sounds are realistic, and overall they are great. Even the voice acting is pretty good. The music is nice, there are many soundtracks, and all of them will keep you stunned. The gameplay is nice, there are many types of missions, and they differ a lot, which is a good thing. You can kill a lot of diversified enemies, you can explore areas, you can ride your car and do stunts, you can buy from machine vendors whatever you want, and many others. More guns are in this game, different types of cars, more missions, etc. Borderlands 2  brought a lot of improvements on the gameplay part. The story is interesting, you can play with up to 4 different characters (different from the first Borderlands). The DLCs would add even more characters. I won’t spoil what’s happening in it, but 1 thing is sure: if you are going to play with all of them, you would basically spend a 250 hours (if you add the DLC characters too, then maybe even 350-400 hours). I haven’t tried out the DLCs, but from what I saw on YouTube, they are pretty great. I recommend that you buy the GOTY edition of the game. This game also has a CO-OP option, where you can play with up to 3 friends (4 in the game). The user-interface is pretty nice, with additional designs and well-synthetized information. The controls are well-chosen. The engines are alright, I haven’t found any haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. The mechanics are sophisticated and improved from the first Borderlands. Overall, Borderlands 2 is a fantastic game, with many great features, and many hours of gameplay.Positive PointsNice graphics and texturesHuge atmosphere, many mapsNice audio and nice musicAwesome, fun and challenging gameplayMany main and side quests availableGood humorMany guns, types of enemies, types of environments, types of missions, etc.A very well-designed user-interfaceWell-chosen controlsStable enginesSophisticated mechanicsMany Steam achievementsThe “Ultimate Vault Hunter – Level 1/2” upgrade will ensure you even more replay abilityNeutral PointsThe inventory space should be largerNegative PointsThe DLCs are very expensiveSome missions are not very interestingIf you level up too fast, the game becomes pretty easy ",655,158,18,43,61,10,69

												Borderlands 2 has to be one of the most unique games I've played yet. It was the first shooter game I enjoyed playing. The graphics are so interesting, and the storyline kept me wanting to see what happens next. I love the ability to have friends join your game to help you, it makes the game more enjoyable, and it does come in handy. The game has many aspects that make it replayable. I think you should give this game a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Absolutely lovable and replayable game With ~150h on PS3, ~500h on PS4 and now over 350h on PC I think i can say that I played this game quite a while. Yet, the more I play BL2 the more I notice that, if you dissect Borderlands 2 and look at this game piece by piece, it's really not that great, mediocre at best.- The graphics are mediocre which is cleverly covered up by the comic like art style and its   black lining. - The individual places are sometimes ""ok"" or just nearly unnecessary as you just have to pass through and never come back. To be honest, I found myself saying ""I actually dont like this part of the game that much"" far too often- Compared to Borderlands, Borderlands 2's variety of weapons is... lacking. Restrictions of gun combinations appearing ingame give you a lot less options (not that there aren't a lot). - Also, it was very much possible to find Purple Weapons in BL that were far better than Legendary Weapons, as they were often just a gimmick. Now, almost every guns best variant is Legendary, which takes away from the regular weapon drops.- Lacking animationsBut as I said, I played a lot of BL2  - and there is a reason for that. You are not supposed to look at BL2 as it's components, but as a whole. Borderlands 2 is one of the most fun experiences I had when playing Video Games so far. + Very big variety of weapons and a sh*t ton of loot in general+ Humorous Jokes throughout the game that still make me chuckle after playing it the 10th time mixed with lovable characters+ Wonderful Muliplayer with friends+ Raid Bosses that are challenging but fun (well mostly) to do+ Good amount of DLC content+ Great Story and SoundtrackAnd for the final positive point, the option to play the game as you want to play it. I think what brings me back so often, is the possibility to create my own Builds, mess around with my loadouts and just do what I want. Sure there are restrictions or ""best"" loadouts you find online but for me, a big part of Borderlands 2 is experimenting, finding new stuff progressing skillwise.All in all, Borderlands 2 is a great game and one of my favourites for sure! Should YOU buy it? Yeah sure, go for it! This game has A LOT to offer and if you are a fan of RPGs, Shooters, Comedy or Raids its worth checking out. Despite some of its flaws I mentioned before, I totally love this game to this day and will probably still play it multiple times in the future. The GOTY-Edition costs about 16 bucks if I'm correct when on sale, and the rest of the DLCs about 10 bucks when on sale, so why not, you probably wont regret it! :D  9/10 ",53,7,1,6,2,0,1

												The Borderlands series has a brilliant formula of wacky humor, countless guns, and RPG mechanics. Borderlands 2 has crushed its prequel with modified gameplay, gorgeous graphics, hectic music and an interesting story. While the sequel improved in every department, its story took me by surprise. The strong, unique, and diverse personalities you’ll meet through the well-paced story improves the entire experience. Most importantly, this gives life and excitement to the planet of Pandora, which was just a boring hunk of rock in the original game. The “Bazzilion” guns that Gearbox claimed Borderlands 2 will have was no joke, and it’s more than just a few minor tweaks in damage and accuracy. The guns will sometimes have a huge bayonet, a wacky reload animation, a crazy looking scope, and may not even have any recoil. When the critics can only complain about an imperfect user-interface, we can conclude that the gameplay is as addicting as we all hoped it would be. For fans of the original Borderlands, this is a no-brainer, but for those who are skeptical about the unique gaming experience that Borderlands 2 has to offer, it’s time to come to your senses and get in on the fun that you’ve been missing out on.The Good+Lots of great loot+Humorous writing+Awesome world+An actual story this time+Single-player is finally enjoyable+Co-op is still kingThe Bad-Underdeveloped visual customization-A serious lack of being able to approach enemy strongholds stealthily			",204,36,5,20,8,1,15

												Well i have few hours on this game and i can say its a masterpiece.This game has crap tone of loots like: different guns,crap load of customizations,upgrade your ammo capacity, money bank, eridium and i can go on and on....The story in Borderlands 2 is marvelous.The action of character is amazing,main story is fairly linear,also you are in planet called Pandora which is the story of all of the games takes place. It is a barren, desolate world filled with dangerous creatures.Gameplay is a mix of FPS and RPG.There are so many missions to complete include side mission and dlc missions.You are given with massive are to explore all over to Pandora.As you progress through the game you will earn xp and levels which allow you to customise your characters skills giving a large variety of gameplay styles.The level cap is 50 but with dlcs it has cap to 72 but thats not over yet once you reach 72lvl you will gain access for overpowerd weapons and harder enemies and of course better weapons.So many reasons to replay this game. Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels like: normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter. Wich gives you progressively better rewards Cant wait for borderlands 3.P.S: This is better than payday 2			",48,1,1,1,0,0,1

												I found my first ever review to be a travesty to an epic game, so here is my redux :)A combination of first person shooter and role playing game, Borderlands 2 is an addictive mix of genres that will suck away thousands of hours of your time. The cell shading art style is different - but beautiful - and can be removed with a minor tweak in the config files if you want to take it off for a small increase in performance. Removing the cell shading does not detract from the beauty of the game, just changing it slightly.The storyline, voice work, and pace of the game are all fantastic. And I loved the humour and subtle (and some not so subtle) jokes throughout. Not much else can be said about it without giving too much away.I would highly recommend purchasing the Game Of The Year edition and playing through the game as each of the characters to explore the differing fight mechanics that come with them. Go in guns blazing as a Gunzerker, or sneak in as an Assassin; the choice is yours. There are a few more characters and others ways to deal with enemies, and those methods will keep you busy for a long time in this game as you explore the world anew each time.Although many of the side quests are not mandatory, they are recommended to be completed to gain experience to be able to progress through the story missions without having to empty hundreds of rounds of ammo into enemies. If you try to run through the story as fast as possible, you will find yourself coming across enemies many levels above your own, and you will die, a lot.If you like first person shooters, you'll like this game. If you like 4 player co-op with friends, you'll like this game. And if you want a game that provides a lot of content that is good value for money, you'll like this game (GOTY Edition, anyway).

												Dual wield miniguns that fire explosive ammo. Turrets that you can put on the ceiling or walls. Become invisible and shoot a handful of explosive Kunais with different elemental damage types. Phaselock enemies into floating and finish them off. Freaking Face McShooty. This game is awesome, get it.			",113,1,2,5,4,2,4

												""Do not take life too seriously. You will never get out of it alive.""A unique FPS experience and a worthy successor of Borderlands. Compared with its predecessor everything has become a little bit crazier and better.My rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance:- Atmosphere- Characters- Details- Tactical demand- Story- Combat & ControlsBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading:- S-Rank: excellent- A-Rank: very good- B-Rank: solid- C-Rank: satisfactory- D-Rank: inferiorIn case of an S-Rank rating, a game reference will be included in brackets as a token of my respect.Atmosphere: S-Rank(You make me so proud, minion. The way you're carrying on my fight against Handsome Jack. It brings a tear to my eye. A figurative one, of course. The saline content of actual tears would rust my eye quicker than you could say 'tetanus shot’.)Characters: S-Rank(When Claptrap speaks, I feel my brain cells committing suicide one by one.)Details: S-Rank(Did I mention I don’t have a medical license?)Tactical demand: S-Rank(If it took more than one shot, you weren't using a Jakobs!)Story: S-Rank(Hey kiddo. Jack here - President of Hyperion. Lemme explain how things work here: Vault Hunter shows up. Vault Hunter looks for the new Vault. Vault Hunter gets killed. By Me. See the problem here? You're still alive. So, if you could just do me a favor and off yourself that'd be great. Thanks, Pumpkin.)Combat & Controls: S-Rank(CATCH A RIIIIIDE!)To conquer all achievements of Borderlands 2, you will most likely spend more than 120 hours. You have to play the single-player campaign several times, due to challenges like ‘So Much Blood’ and ‘Unseen Predator’. ‘Challenge Accepted’ is a typical grind achievement.‘Friendship Rules’ is the only multiplayer achievement and quite simple to obtain.‘Thresher Thrashed’ will take the most time, because it requires a character around level 52 or higher. The achievements of the four DLCs are straight forward and easy enough to get with a high level character.Achievement difficulty: 7 of 10Common:- Singleplayer [+2]- Multiplayer [+1]Special:- Challenge Accepted [+1]- Thresher Thrashed [+1]- DLCs [+2]Estimated time for 100 % completion: +120 hoursChronology:Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel (PC)First-person shooter game(Science-Fiction) – 2014Borderlands 2 (PC)First-person shooter game(Science-Fiction) – 2012Borderlands (PC)First-person shooter game(Science-Fiction) – 2009			",250,157,6,11,40,3,32
