												If you're reading this review, you probably want to know if this game is worth the money, and time. Assuming you're into rpg's (otherwise i don't see any reason you're here), and want to get your mind blown away, then this game is for you. I can't possibly describe how fantastic Witcher 2 is. While the ""general"" story might not be something outstanding, the way you progress through it, the way you interact with people completely engulfs you into the experience, and you won't even realize when it's already 5 am, and you've been playing for 12 hours at least. This is partly because of the side missions. Unlike other rpg's where they are mediocre at best, and mainly consist of something like ""Get to point B, Talk to someone, Return, ????, PROFIT"", side missions in Witcher 2 are self contained stories, some of them being more enjoyable than the main game itself. And of course if you don't want to do them for whatever reason, you'll miss A LOT. Another thing at which Witcher 2 excels is the combat. While at low difficulty you should be able to complete the game by ""pressing X to win"", other difficulty settings require knowledge, thinking, and tactical aproach. You'll have to create mixtures, craft weapons and armor, find or buy herbs and recipes, just in order to be able to survive. While this might be confusing, and hard, trust me that it's not. It's understandable, it's logical, and requires just a little bit of initial effort. At this point you're probably thinking ""Yeah, cool, i'll go buy it"", and you won't be wrong in any way. BUT, be advised that while this is a great looking game, it isn't particulary well optimised,  and you may find yourself struggling even at minimum settings if your PC isn't powerful enough.  So what is my score for the game? Definitely 10/10. I really do think it's such a good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first I was a bit hesitant to play this game because I don't typically like fantasy RPG themed games.  I do like games that have deep and mature narratives.  I also like games with complex combat mechanics.  I heard that this game was very good at these things, so I decided to give it a try.The story is  very good.  It is also very complex so it is important to pay attention to the dialog.  Player choices definitely have an impact on the game world and many choices are morally ambiguous which tie-in well to the mature theme of the story.  What impressed me the most was how much impact player choice dynamically altered the game world and the direction of the story.  The game has 8 different endings based on the player's decisions.  This is also the only game that I have ever played that completely alters the main quest line depending on these choices.  This means that you will not see every main story quest, characters and locations unless you play the game through multiple times.  Many games that change the world based on choices usually do so using trickery that gives you the ""illusion"" of choice.  The developers of this game actually took the time to create all of the extra story content instead of using tricks and this gives the Witcher 2 a ton of replayability.The combat system in this game is also very deep and challenging.  You will carry a steel sword to take care of humanoid opponents and you will carry a silver sword to deal with monsters.  Knowing when to switch is important to dealing proper damage to your target.  Combat also requires proper preparation so the player will need to know how and when to use magical signs, place traps, drink potions, oil swords and use bombs and other Witcher tricks to get the job done.  Simply wading into the combat only slashing away with a sword will often times get you killed.  Combat can take some time to get used to and is definitely a refreshing departure from simply auto targeting and mashing a single button.Visuals are very impressive and it is very apparent that the developers took a lot of time in creating the environments for the game.  Music is outstanding and the score sets the tone appropriately.One of the few downsides that I can think of is the disparity of the difficulty levels.  Normal difficulty can be daunting with the complex combat mechanics and is a bit harder than the normal difficulty level of similar games.  Easy is a nod to RPG beginners, but is so easy that you can ignore most of the combat mechanics and simply survive every encounter by using only the swords.  The only other downside that I had with the game was related to map design.  I found navigation on some of the maps to be overly complicated and I spent a lot of time simply wandering about trying to find a way to get to certain points on the map.  Other than these two small quibbles I found the game design to be very solid and entertaining.Lots of content in this game.  My playthrough took about 40 hours doing most of the side activities, and I mostly took my time without rushing things.  Additional playthroughs would be required to see the other 7 endings and to play the other story paths leading up to those endings.  You can easily get hundreds of hours out of this game if you wanted to explore all of these options so lots of replay value as I mentioned earlier.I highly recommend this game.  I understand that the Witcher 3 is supposed to expand to a much more open world environment and have even more non-linear story options.  After playing Witcher 2 I am looking forward to playing the upcoming sequel when it comes out.			",230,21,2,26,20,4,45

												First off, know that The Witcher 2 is not a game that will hold your hand. If you're thinking about purchasing this, know that to get the most out of this game you need to be prepared to fully immerse yourself in the experience and pay attention to what is going on. This a game which deals with many adult themes such as politics, racism and sex to deliver a mature and complex game supported by rich lore and stunning visuals. The writing and storytelling is exceptional throughout and the moral ambiguity and choices are second to none. The gameplay, in particular the combat, is an acquired taste but offers a refreshing level of depth and potential for improvisation when compared to games in a similar genre. Sound design and voice acting is also of high quality, with the environments coming to life through impressive visual and audio support and characters each sporting distinct personalities and prejudices.It is also worth mentioning that if you have played the first Witcher game, your choices and gear will be reflected via an imported save in The Witcher 2, however the choices have limited effect and it is not necessary to play the first game to enjoy the second (however you will be at a slight disadvantage in some situations).In my honest opinion the experience as a whole is unparalleled, and The Witcher 2 is easily the most enjoyable and immersive RPG I have played in recent memory. I would also advise reading the books by Andrezej Sapkowski as these offer an interesting insight into the protagonist's past. But back to the game, overall I would highly recommend The Witcher 2 to anyone with at least a passing interest in the RPG genre, it is the definition of a complete gaming package with spectacular production values and a lasting impression.

												Experienced more sex in one of hour of game time than in my entire life!( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/10!Tips:1) If you BUY Witcher 1 or Witcher 2 on steam you can claim a free copy of it on GOG using your steam CD key. The company that owns the Witcher series, CDPR, also owns GOG. Link here: http://www.gog.com/witcher/backupAside from the usual no DRM copy of the game, the GOG version also includes bonus content ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)[i.imgur.com].Please note: You have to BUY it on Steam first.CD key location: Go to your Library, click your game, on the right side click ""CD key""2) There are also numerous mods over at http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/. Including a few for Triss ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). 3) If you dislike the combat style then try the Full Combat Rebalance Mod. It's made by an employee of CDPR who worked on the Witcher series.

												Originally released in 2011, The Witcher 2 flew under the radar for a lot of people and was overshadowed by the ever-popular Skyrim. While not as well known, The Witcher 2 offers a much stronger narrative along with solid gameplay, beautiful graphics, and varied areas.You once again play as the Witcher; Geralt, who finds himself protecting King Foltest of Temaria after an assassination attempt. Ultimately, the second attempt succeeds and Geralt is framed for the murder. After escaping from a Temarian dungeon, Geralt decides to track down the real kingslayer in order to clear his name while trying to piece together his fragmented memory.The game is separated into three chapters each with their own main area along with a handful of side-quests. These areas are structured and paced well, allowing room for exploration without straying too far from the main storyline. The decisions you make along the way directly influence the narrative and can have a dramatic effect on the rest of the game. For example; decisions made in the first chapter can completely change the second, allowing plenty of room for re-playability. The game also features multiple endings, which vary based on your choices.The choices are morally ambiguous; there is no clear right or wrong answer in most cases. It’s more about choosing a side and watching the events unfold. While the first Witcher game focused more on slaying monsters, Geralt is trapped in the middle of political turmoil in this installment. These elements of the story add an additional level of complexity and immersion as the game feels almost similar to a season of Game of Thrones. Playing the first game is by no means necessary to enjoying The Witcher 2 as it provides plenty of backstory as well as a solid and cohesive narrative.The combat is solid as the game will have you balance between swordplay, magic, as well as parrying and dodging. The use of traps can also add an additional level of strategy and planning to most encounters. There is also the inclusion of alchemy, allowing Geralt to drink various potions each with different passive bonuses as well as negative side effects. The potions are generally used on a trial and error basis though, since Geralt isn’t able to use them during combat. The game does provide a reasonable challenge, especially on the harder difficulties, which is refreshing compared to a lot of other titles released these days.Orens, the main currency in the game is rather scarce, placing a large emphasis on crafting. The crafting system is solid and will have you hoarding as many resources as possible in order to create various armor, traps, weapons, and upgrades.CD Projekt Red is a company that really loves their fans. While other developers release paid DLC, CDPR released an Enhanced Edition at no additional cost which added multiple cut-scenes, quests, and additional polish. The soundtrack is fantastic, as it really adds an epic feel to the game. The voice acting for the main characters is top-notch while some of the acting for the additional characters is re-used but that is to be expected considering the overall length of the game.The graphics are absolutely stunning, as the environments are extremely detailed and varied. The character models and armor look great, although the facial animations can be a bit stiff and lifeless at times. You really have to look hard for low-res textures as even the smallest objects are carefully rendered.Overall, The Witcher 2 is a game that should be played by anyone that is a fan of the genre. It features benchmark graphics, a top-shelf narrative, and offers plenty of content along with elements of re-playability.For a much more detailed and thorough review, here’s a video I edited together for my friend Trent:

												For too long I ignored The Witcher 2 in my Steam Library. I heard that the game was great. Tried playing it twice, gave up at the very beginning of the first chapter. That was a huge mistake.The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt trailers were all amazing, and oh boy, the Hype Train was going offtrack. But how the hell was I supposed to play TW3 without even playing TW2?I've played the first one, liked it a lot, even though the game had some strange gameplay techniques.So there I was again, Flotsam. The very beginning of the game. Would I give up this time again? No!I needed to play TW2, to see if I would like it, and only then I would Pre-Order TW3.Played it. Played more. The story just got better. The gameplay is amazing. The graphics, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ they're amazing. And the soundtrack... Oh the soundtrack...And ever since I reinstalled The Witcher 2, all I've played was it. I forgot all the other games I had installed, I needed to complete it.I've followed Roche's Path for the Campaign. Loved all the story. So many moral choices, so many characters. I needed to know more about the world, but more than that, I needed to know more about Geralt's story.Now I can easily say that The Witcher 2 - Assassins of Kings is one of the best RPG I've ever played, and I can't wait to play The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt.If you never played The Witcher. Don't waste any time. Play it! You'll love it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a major improvement from the first title(the first is still a fantastic game, don't get me wrong), The Witcher 2 marks a milestone not only for CD Projekt RED, but a landmark for which other games fall short of.  Too often a game preaches where choices matter and regardless of what you choose the outcome is the same.  This title puts you back in the hands of Geralt of Rivia; however, this time, the consequences of your actions merit even greater twists and deeper turns.  Not only changing the NPC's outlook on you; instead, you may find yourself in a completely different area of the game had you chosen your actions otherwise.  To stack on the improvements, this game features a much smoother combat system and graphical enhancements so beautiful, you will need a new F12 key (screenshot) by the time you finish this story once.  As an avid explorer of games, one play through of this game granted roughly 50 hours of play time on Hard difficulty.  With bigger titles for $60 giving a mere 10 hours of game play, at $20 this instalment is steal already, let alone when it is discounted.  If you enjoyed the first game, or even if you hated the first game and couldn't get over the combat, this should make its way to your library.			",292,84,10,66,34,3,78

												Witcher 2 is my favorite game. It is a solid RPG with a lot of action and a brilliant story. It is very mature in a lot of its themes and situations. This game is based on novels written by a Polish authornamed  Andrzej Sapkowski. You play as Geralt, a Witcher, or a genetically enhanced monster hunter. They have been described as a kind of warrior monk. Geralt drinks special potions that let him far exceed the abilities of normal humans. These potions are needed to battle the various beasts of the realms. Witchers also have a very limited understanding of magical energy called Witcher's Signs. Basically the Signs are spells, like a fireball and a paralysis trap spell and a few others. Geralt is an interesting character because he is not quite human but hes not a monster either. Due to their methods and abilities, however, many in the world see Witchers as freaks and monsters. Which is really what the game's ideology is all about; the greyness in everyone, not the clear cut black and white. Which to me, is a welcome change from the usual: 1) ""hey I'm a good guy I will help you""  2) ""Not my problem Kachinsky"" 3) F*** YOU F*** FACE,"" that many other game are notorious for.  Geralt is often put in positions of just making a choice, not good or evil, just difficult decisions that have a lot of positives and negatives to them. The story is top notch, and eerily real in many of the stuggles of the world. Geralt has a set of skill trees (sword, magic, alchemy) that the player can advance in any way. All into one or spliced between the three. Sword fighting is a core mechanic though, so no matter how you play, Geralt will always have two swords. A silver sword for monsters, and a normal sword for humans. There are a few other weapons too but mostly its swords. Depending on the player preference combat can be a bit like the Batman games, or the Assassins Creed games. In some ways it can be like Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. Weapons and armor play a big part as well and can effect all of the skill trees. Making the game very balanced between gear and character tree choices. Not to the crazy levels of a Diablo game but enough to make for a very quality rpg.Mostly though, Witcher 2 is a lot like skyrim. I do not want to bash on skyrim here, it is also a great game that a lot of people absolutely love. I feel, however, that Witcher is far better than skyrim and think the people that love skyrim should try the Witcher. Both games have the northern lore and feel. Witcher 2 is no where near as large or open as skyrim. Witcher is much more linear but the story and combat and the world just feel so much better in every way to me. The enemies and the different races were better portrayed during the game. When I came to a new town in skyrim I did not get that feeling of truly new. Just another town and another barbarian guy leading it. Witcher was totally different, you get the feeling of racial tensions and social tensions in every part. The powers that be are very different and each very developed and very human. As it plays out you really see how the choices alter the world, instead of it coming down to ""OK I'm a good guy so I will save good guy town."" A lot of games try to get that feeling across of the characters true M.O. and demeanor but fail. Witcher acomplishes this very well. Triple AAA quality. Superb graphics, superb voice acting. I enjoyed every character. There were a few times, of course, where some tones were a bit off but that happens in every game. Overall amazing game. When I learned that this game was made by a small studio in Poland I was shocked.As someone who never read any of the books and did not play the first game, I found that after a second playthrough the story and everyhting started to click and I realised how well done everything really was. The way the game is, one would want to play it at least twice to see both sides of what is going on.It seems as though more than a few people found the game to be really difficult. It can be, but now there are plenty of guides and discussions about it. The game has a kind of reverse curve for the difficulty. It is much harder in the beginning due to a lack of points in the skill tree and low grade weapons and armor. By the end though, Geralt is pretty much on par with jezuz. I like games of this nature, because being really stong at the end makes it feel like you really acomplished something. This game also has subtitles in many languages so I found it made a great gift for steam friends who are not natural to the english language.I would reccommend this game to anyone. Especially anyone who likes Skyrim, Assassin's Creed, Batman, Chivalry, Darksouls, Lord of the Rings or any games like them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Note: With The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition I entered the Witcher universe without playing the first title or knowing anything about the books let alone having read them. So here goes.The first RPG I played where your choices actually DO matter (*cough* Mass Effect *cough*). Yes, I kid you not. Not only does the game split up after Act I depending on who you choose to side with, but the outcome of dialogues in the main quest and even the side quests offer multiple possibilites for the story to unfold. The complexity and ingenuity of the fantasy world this game is set in is comparable to the quality of GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire and can therefore be characterized as a so-called ""low fantasy"" story, as opposed to ""high fantasy"" settings such as The Elder Scrolls (just google the definitions if you don't know anything about them). Personally, I prefer low fantasy due to its focus on individual character development and their story/fate, as well as a ""realistic"" depiction of violence, language and society as a whole, but that's just my preference. So in a nutshell, I liked the story a lot, I think there's a lot of exciting things still to be told. Now let's get to the technical aspects: Dialogue is great, offering many choices for convincing or intimidating and alike. Character customization is solid too (you can actually have your haircut changed to some very weird stuff throughout the game if you so desire), there's lots of item slots, but only two weapons, a fact I can however accept for story reasons. Then again, I always pick the sword in any fantasy RPG so having two different swords throughout the entire game was right down my alley. Since we've arrived at the swords let's talk about the combat shall we. Yeah, I don't like it, why don't I like it you might say? It's basically a combo-based hack'n'slash system with a very console-y feeling (believe me or not, I liked Skyrim combat more, yes really). You just lock onto a target and smash LMB/RMB with the occasional blocking. I think this is simplistic and may be fun to watch, but it's not really immersive (on a side note: the combat is pretty hard and the boss fight require true skill and creativity and especially cunning use of magic abilities, I liked these a lot more). Speaking of immersive, the game looks gorgeous for a 2011 title, mostly good textures and effects. What struck me was the very high depth of field especially in the first act. I guess that's a way to make the lack of quality of distant objects unnoticable. Arguably, the biggest plus is the sound: ambient sound, voice acting and especially soundtrack are downright masterful, I loved it.I can't think of anything else atm so let's jump to the conclusion. The game is great, with lots of replayability due to the many different paths you can go. The world sucks you in right from the start. If you're a fan of the combat then you've got absolutely nothing to fear, if you don't it's still worth it for the experience because mechanics are easy to get used to.Performance notes: The game is Nvidia optimized. With my AMD card(s), it runs a solid 60fps though. Just tweak AA a bit and turn off Cinematic Depth of Field, it makes cutscene-fps drop by half, which is not cool. It supports CFX and probably also SLI. Oh yeah and the game is capped to 120fps, which is nice too.Meaningless score: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Epic game. When i first played this game, I was totally mindblown at how mature the storyline and how beautiful the graphics are. I was and still baffled how almost nobody in Malaysia knows about this game when it first came out. A problem that still persists up till now.This is not a game for the kiddies but I am sure this kind of game is recommended for people to understand gray moral choices that will somewhat help in real life decisions.The drawback:- controls are sometimes clunky (sometimes not being able to hit monsters when the target reticule is not on it, or Geralt performs a heavy attack when in actual you're pressing the light attack button)- crashes frequently when I load a save game (happens when there is a bloat of save games)- Tiring grind to get loads of gold to get and craft the Dark Armour Diagrams and materials. (you can only get Dark Armour in Dark Mode)The Pros:- Great Mature Storyline- Great Graphics for a 2011 game- Decent Moral Choices- Difficult Combat for newcomers but it will grow on you once you get the hang of it! (Pro Tips: DODGE! DODGE! DODGE!)- A developer who has managed to stay independent and still able to developed this great game- No DRM if you register the steam version on GOG.com for a backup copy for free! (the developer's subsidiary company that manages DRM-less games)Buy this game to encourage more independent developers to churn out great games like this.Plus, the sequel The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is coming out in February 2015. You will certainly have a better insight on the story if you played this first. Hey, even better if you buy both the Witcher 1 and Witcher 2!This game is an AAA title (in terms of quality) in my list and one of few many games that i have replayed more than twice.P.S. - Best played with a controller.

												Oh man, this game. I've now played this game 3 times through on Normal/Dark/Insane and am still missing a few sidequests that are only available on certain plot decisions. This game is massive and very well done. Here are some random pros & cons for things that immediately come to mind:PROS+ Gorgeous. This game is gorgeous. Especially if you grab an improved textures mod. (see related con)+ Story-rich. The story is grandiose and tons of fun to be a part of. There are quite a few story-altering decisions you will make throughout the game as well, providing a dynamic and involved experience.(one decision determines a good third of the game that differs completely should you have chosen differently) There were a couple choices where I had to pause the game for like 20 minutes while trying to decide what I wanted to do. Intense stuff. LISTEN TO ALL DIALOGUE, TALK TO EVERYONE. You won't regret it.+ Combat is very dynamic and an absolute blast. You really need to think about the best way to approach certain encounters. Alchemy can alter things drastically for example, so don't skimp on the potions/oils(especially on higher difficulties!). Certain enemies need to be approached certain ways, some are very resistant to sword or magic, some can shield up and block all damage so you need to approach them from another direction or use a specific sign, etc... Very well done and very well thought out by the development team.PROS/CONS(depending on your preferences/playstyle)+/- Game starts out pretty damn difficult during the prologue. You start very weak and then slowly gain strength until all at once, you are suddenly quite over-powered. This could be a pro or con depending on what sort of gaming experience you prefer. There *are* a couple mods that smooth out the combat system and even out your ascension to badassness, although I would highly recommend you not touch any sort of mods til you've completed your first playthrough.+/- Quite a bit of nudity and corny sex scenes. May or may not be your cup of tea.CONS- While the game is gorgeous, it is also quite resource intensive. I had serious issues with my 560m, almost unplayable. My desktop's gtx 780 had no issues. Check out benchmarks for your specific card and make sure you can run it decently.- QTE's(Quicktime Events) are a part of this game and they are lame. There are a couple encounters where if you miss a QTE prompt, you are dead. Playing on insane, this feels cheap and lame. *Luckily*, You can turn these off via Gameplay Options, which I would highly recommend.- Prologue is pretty damn linear. Don't let this turn you off though. It's necessary for the introduction of the story. Make it to chapter 1 and things improve greatly.- A lot of people have reported that the controls feel ""clunky"", especially during the prologue. I was one of these people. But seriously, stick with it. It gets better. Also, graphic settings affect control sensitivity. Higher = better response. I also played the game with a controller, so that could have some impact.Overall conclusion: If you like RPGs, this is a must play. The story is intense and exciting. The gameplay is dynamic and fun. I highly recommend you give it a go. Just make it past the prologue! Also, a few people have asked whether it's necessary to play the first game. My answer is NO. It's not necessary. You would benefit from watching a story recap on YouTube though. ",341,79,3,48,24,1,47

												Easily one of the best PC games released in the latest years. Easily one of the best surprises, too - you will see more passion and talent from those 'noobs' from Poland than you would in most of the AAA studios, combined. The sheer idea to be a rather indie studio and create a game like this, polish it (word origin nudges me weirdly here) and bring it to the extent it is available today, is remarkable and admiring.I have spent countless hours in the summer of 2011 playing and replaying the game. Because you don't get one strict and direct walkthrough; in fact, you can play 2 completely different storylines and make choices that will result in 16 (!) different endings. Mind you, I haven't seen them all (yet), but some craze at some point in the future might make me want to do so.Witcher 2 is an action-adventure RPG - you will see a lot of combat, and the combat mechanics will matter when you face tougher foes. You need a strategy to survive - button mashing won't help you. You can master either of the 3 skill paths - Magic, Alchemy and Swordmanship and use your signs, potions and gear in order to kick every monster and merc's a** in the beautiful world of Witcher 2.Speaking of beauty, as long as you have a powerful enough PC to push the game hard, you can't fail to notice how lovely it is made - the whole world looks like it is living and breathing, with NPCs having their own business throughout the day and sleep at night, lights, shadows and colours that make it all look hell pretty - the game might be 2011, but it still easily competes with some weaker attempts from more recent times.Everything in this game screams for maturity - from the portrayal of the storyline to some rather odd moments in the game - you might think nudity is not appropriate for games, but if you are old enough to think about it normally, you'll see there's nothing bad in a beautiful love scene like in any other movie. And indeed, the fantasy world of Witcher 2 is not a fantasy world meant for putting kids to sleep - it can easily be described as an alternative Middle Ages where humans have all their present strong and weak qualities, and the legends about the monsters lurking outside of the village at night turn out to actually be there for real.Comparing it to the first installment of the series, I would say I prefer Witcher 2 over it's predecessor, even though I wouldn't deny it either. Everything looks better thought of and finished in the follow-up, but the truth is, the Witcher 1 forged the path for the developers to get together and release a game like this. If you wonder, definitely play the first one first, but come back here when you've finished it.If you are at least a tiny little bit fan of books, don't think twice and grab yourself a copy of the Witcher stories- Andrzej Sapkowski is the mastermind of this world (book came first, then the game). Stories are not necessarily strictly connected between the books and the game, they are loosely situated in the same world, with the main protagonist being the white-haired cold-blooded and serious monster killer Geralt of Rivia. Who, by the way, is already one of my most favourite characters overall.In a few words - if you don't have the game yet and you are a fan of RPG, deep and mature stories and beautiful graphics: get it, get it now.P.S. Devs are real nowadays heroes as they release a ton of free downloadable content and updates AFTER the game is released. Yep, you get all those DLCs you pay for in the other games for free - and they added the Enhanced edition for free for all early purchasers too. They are also known for bashing the mandatory nowadays DRM too - if you buy the game retail, you just need the disc to play it. Like in the good old days.P.S. 2 I own the retail Collector's Edition of the game and I just had to buy it again on Steam. I don't mind it at all, I would put my money for those guys any day, as long as they keep releasing games like this (blink blink: Witcher 3; blink blink: Cyberpunk).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Teal DeerDevelopers: CD Projekt REDPublishers: CD ProjektInitial release: May 2011Genre: Action, RPG, Story Heavy#Worth/NotWorth: #SoVeryMuchWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationI found myself deeply enamored with the world of the Witcher. My first exposure being the book, “The Last Wish” by Andrzej Sapkowski. I started in on Witcher 1 after reading and found the mechanics slightly overbearing. Even with some background I found myself being overwhelmed by the vastness and seeming complexity of the mechanics brought fourth by what, to me, was a very cool prospect. Alchemy. The idea behind it was not as its traditionally seen, even in fantasy. It wasn't some equal exchange of two completely unrelated things. Or when it was considered theoretical science, turning common metal into gold. It was poison, concocted from traditional alchemical ingredients. This poison would kill anyone not used to it. It took years and years of borderline torture to build this resistance. All in exchange for what was essentially, a high. Which in game mechanics turns into stat buffs and regen of various meters. AND on top of all this people were kidnapped before the age of five, trained in swordsmanship and forced to build a tolerance to the poisonous alchemical drinks. All to become “thugs for hire” and slay monsters. That, is the coolest♥♥♥♥♥♥ever. Sadly I never completed the Witcher 1. Due to the overbearing nature. Suffice it to say. The Witcher 2 is a vast improvement. Mechanically, Narratively, and boy is she pretty. My first play through I found some of that residual vastness to get to me. But I decided to forge ahead. I found myself understanding the times at which potions were needed and when they were not, even if most of time was due to trial and error. I am sort of an obsessive quick-saver. I found the dichotomy between Steel and Silver swords very real. Making the action feel much more tactical than your standard, run into that room and whack at stuff with a sharp stick. You make decisions in this game like every other RPG. Only these choices are not so clear cut. There isn't really ever a clearly good or clearly bad option. Moral ambiguity at its best. Rather both sides seem to have very real unforeseen consequences. In fact in the mission “At a Crossroads”, Literally 20+ hours of content lay behind a single choice. My second play through I had a lot more fun because I could focus less on worrying about how to spec or do I have enough ingredients for the potion I need. I was able to focus on the story and actually see some of the political tension much more clearly and take a stance that was well informed.  I love this world. Its probably the most fleshed out fantasy world I've gotten involved with. That's likely due to the fact that this game is based on a book series and not vice versa. Much in the way the Metro 2033 series is. No prerequisite reading required to enjoy but it will definitely enhance the experience.Follow my curation for more ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition 

			Views: 17,130		

			Senior Reviewer Trent takes an in-depth look at The Witcher 2. Does it compare to the giants of 2011 (Skyrim and Dark Souls?) Narrated and written by Trent Edited by Nathan Please like and subscribe...		

*I originally purchased a retail copy of The Witcher 2 and completed it before purchasing a steam copy at a later date*The Witcher 2 was perhaps one of the most criminally overlooked games of 2011. With many RPG gamers looking forward to the release of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim this PC only release was lost in the hyperbolic praise of Bethesda's role playing juggernaut during end of the year awards. So, in 2012, CDProjekt Red has released an enhanced edition giving PC players ten gigabytes of additional content for free. This content includes all of the patches which added extra quests and fixed a couple of questionable design choices, adds entirely new quests, and cut scenes to flesh the game's narrative out. The Enhanced Edition opens with a rousing new cut scene depicting the assassination of Demavend, King of Aedirn. Upon starting the game the you take control of the witcher, Geralt, who is aiding Kind Foltest in a military endeavor to reclaim his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ children. Success comes but the victory is short lived as Foltest is snuffed out and Geralt is blamed for his demise. From here the narrative takes off as Geralt hunts down Foltest's assassin simply to clear his name. Amidst the hunt for the assassin of kings, political turmoil unfolds and Geralt seeks details on his lost love Yennifer. It's a top shelf fantasy RPG narrative, structured like a great season of a television show, with three big narrative threads that are explored as the game progresses. Like a television show, the game ends with some elements of the narrative resolved while others are escalating and awaiting a sequel. The world of the Witcher is dark and morally ambiguous which makes the element of choice the player us given extraordinarily satisfying. Making choices in The Witcher 2 is not about being a good witcher or a bad witcher, its about what you, the player, see fit to do. While Bioware's games are top notch, relegating in-game choices to a binary moral scale diminishes the impact of many decisions. Also, the choices in The Witcher 2 do have an impact on the events of the game—a significant impact. A choice you make at the end of the first chapter completely changes your perspective on the second chapter. The quest line completely changes so you will want to play this game at least twice to get the full effect and, depending on how dedicated you are, maybe several more times.  The narrative plays out over a prologue, three chapters and an epilogue. The three chapters make up the bulk of the game and each is confined to a single location. There is no way to travel back to previous locations once the chapter concludes. This is a narrative driven game and it wants you to move forward. Many players used to games like those in The Elder Scrolls or Gothic series may be upset by this but the narrative so greatly benefits from this rigid structure that it's hard to make a case for a more open format. Each locale is loaded with side quests and very few of them feel like obnoxious chores; a problem that plagues many other RPG experiences. The sidequests mix in some character development, world building and humor generally enriching the core experience.  There are two very compelling reasons to do all of the sidequests in a location. The first is that resources in The Witcher 2 are very limited. Unlike most modern RPGs, you can't really grind for money. Reselling items, gear and raw materials nets such a small portion of the items original value that it's not worth doing for the sake of recouping your money. You will have to carefully decide what you can craft and what you should buy since simply buying the gear and items you want will quickly deplete your coiffures. The second reason to do all of those extra quests is to drink in the staggeringly beautiful world that The Witcher 2 offers. The Witcher 2 set a new graphical benchmark with its richly detailed and carefully crafted world. You really have to search hard for an ugly texture. Everything from the biggest building to the smallest environmental prop is detailed and rendered with care. One of the standout quests in the third chapter takes you to  a mage's laboratory that is filled with trinkets, equipment and murals. It's dimly lit, with sinister stones protruding from the walls. Acquiring new armor is rewarding even if the stats aren't a significant improvement over what you have just because the detail put into it is so fantastic. It's a shame that the facial animations don't quite match the graphical leap forward. They are not bad but they are decidedly current gen in a game that was ahead fo the graphical curve on release. Combat in The Witcher 2 has been massively overhauled from the first game. Geralt can lay traps, use rudimentary magics and is an accomplished swordsman. Even if you don't focus on leveling spell casting or using traps Geralt is still competent enough to make use of these abilities. Some will see the lack of opportunity to really build a Geralt to their personal style but it's as a consequence of the character's lore. You still place skill points in the appropriate trees to buff the abilities of your choice but you don't really spec into an archetypical fantasy class. When it comes to wielding his blades, Geralt has two swords, a silver blade for monsters and a steel blade for humans. He can parry and counter so timing your attacks in key. Certain traps are more effective for some enemies and magic is a mix of healing, buffing and attacking. It's quite a repertoire and you are left with no shortage of tactical options. Fortunately, a new tutorial was added to the Enhanced Edition to help players come to grips with Geralt's skills and abilities. One rather irritating quirk of the combat is the fact that Geralt can only use potions outside of battle so this can turn some encounters into a trial and error affair. You often have to fail in a battle to see what potions may be worth using. It never makes the game annoying... It just makes alchemy feel pointless. Combat requires some skill and forethought but shouldn't be too taxing to a competent gamer and generally proves rewarding.The Witcher 2 was a great game with a few annoying flaws. The Enhanced Edition addresses many of these and goes above and beyond with meaningful new in game content. It's packed with new cutscenes and the new quests are some of the best in the game. The structure is rigid when compared to some other RPGs but it boasts a stronger, more direct narrative as a result. The ability to make choices in the game is enriching and adds tremendous replay value and the visuals look great three years after it's initial release. The combat is solid though the alchemy system is quirky to the point of being almost pointless. None of the flaws present will stay with you for long after you complete this game though. It's likely that you will be more concerned with what CDProjekt Red has in store for us in the next Witcher release. Thankfully, The Witcher 3 is as amazing as you would hope it to be.

												I started this game right after I finished the first Witcher game, so I was still very impressed with the first game and had really high expectations of this one, however, I found The Witcher 2 to be incredibly different. In so many ways. And I am not a person who likes change upon something I already loved so much like the first Witcher.I had to push through the incredibly difficult prologue, the different combat system which really disappointed me because I loved the time based sword combat in the first game, and the change from classical painting art style for cutscenes to comic art. I was really bitter about it. However, it all changed after the end of the prologue and the beginning of this incredibly complex story that had so much going on that I was really immresed in it. Moreover, the further you go in the game, the better it gets in terms of story, gameplay, graphics and art style, music, and EVERYTHING. This game wasn't really what I hated anymore, the story kept getting deeper and all pieces from the previous game and this one were coming together somehow. I found that despite all the differences between the first and second Witcher games, they still kept the core of what made The Witcher series what it is; a story about greedy, ugly human nature when politics, beliefs and money and thirst for power cause conflict. I completely fell in love with this game, and I can't wait for the third installment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2 is one of the most mature, enthralling, entertaining games I've played in years. If this isn't at least nominated for ""Game of the Year"" I don't understand the Gaming Industry anymore. The graphics are amazing, the music is beautiful, and the game features some of the best quests I've seen in a long time. Everything from monster slaying, to hot chick laying, to a ""Hangover"" style quest where you have to retrack the previous night drunken revelry. This game is a MUST for RPG fans. POSSIBLE CON: The story continues immediately after the Witcher 1 and does NOT hold your hand. If you want background on characters or plot devices either play Witcher 1 or go wikipedia the storyline and get caught up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Witcher 2 is an action- rpg and like it's predecessor, it's based on novels and short stories by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. It's developed by Polish company CD Projekt Red.Witcher games are about monster hunter called Geralt of Rivia, also known as Butcher of Blaviken. Geralt has two objectives during the game, to regain his lost memory and find the Witcher who slayed the king, while being accused of killing the king himself. The main story is intriguing and full of surprises. It highly varies based on your decision in the end of first chapter. Second and third chapters have different locations, characters and story focus depenging on your path. This gives Witcher 2 great replayability since different plot points will be revealed. Just like the main questline, side quests offer the same thoughtful and witty writing. There's morally ambigious choices throughout the game and you never know when the consequences come back at you. But very often they will.  The negatives in the game would be the horrible Inventory system, it's a pain to navigate.No overwriting saves, so every save will be a new one and save folder can grow to even 5 gb. Too many saves also slows the launch menu and has been reported to sometimes even cause crashes. So I deleted my saves manually on occasion. I also wasn't a big fan of the combat changes. While the combat in first one was bit more tactical and rhythm based, now it feels a bit too button mashy. More tools to fight have been added though, like traps and throwing knives. I was also bothered that after killing an enemy, if there's another present, Geralt will automatically leap on the next one if you just keep on mashing the attack. Sometimes quite ridicilous distances. Voice acting is stellar and the music makes Geralt's journey feel even more epic. The game was gorgeous when it first came out. Still looks good even today, which makes it harder to run well on older machines. Personally I enjoyed the first game a bit more, because of the story and even the combat. Though most people will prefer the more action oriented combat of this sequel. Witcher 2 is one of the best modern RPG:s and highly recommended to anyone looking for a great mature fantasy world.[Score: 89]			",179,96,1,28,15,3,20

Uniquely rich and engrossing // Recommended for role playing fanatics+ Environments and visuals are absolutely stunning; everything, form lighting effects, to foliage, to textures found throughout the world, are incredibly well-rendered and captivating+ Solid, well-implemented control scheme that makes good use of large swathes of keyboard real-estate; I have grievances regarding a few of the keybindings, but these are easily remedied via the menu+ Inventive combat system; it takes a bit of a push to get the hang of, but one will quickly find themselves enjoying a comfortable proficiency (with practice)+ Admirable level of PC optimization+ Impact of choices made are readily apparent, have incredibly far-reaching consequences, and lend astonishing gravity to each selection+ Top-shelf voice-acting and written dialogue+ Side-quests often have substance enough to rival the main plot+ Ending spells out in wonderful detail the consequences of your actions, often within the specific areas in which you've visited+ Very story-heavy game, and is therefore rife with lore-friendly collectibles and references that greatly enrich one's sense of immersion+ Everything, from textures to NPCs, is meticulously crafted, and the game does not rely on cookie-cutter pasting techniques+ Choices made throughout the game don't rely on a standard good/evil system, and therefore allows more flexibility in terms of character progression+ Signs, potions, oils, enhancements, and traps all combine to lend tremendous depth and freedom to combat+ Excellent game length and, due to multiple endings and story paths (which differ wildly depending on choices made during the first chapter) give the game an alarming amount of replay value+ Successfully mature, somber tone pulls the player in, and manages to do so without coming off as overbearing; definitely not a 'tryhard' game- Somewhat poor targeting mechanics- Occasional bugs that require a restart; may not be prevalent for everyone, but I certainly noticed them- Following NPCs can be tricky business, in that they often get stuck, block hallways and doors, and display poor pathing in general- Comparing equipment available via trading with that which is currently equipped is not possible, making it necessary to exit from the trading screen to check stats, etc.- Waypoints and objectives occasionally will not update properlyLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit ",195,26,1,22,22,0,22

""I'm a Witcher. I don't care for your politics!"" Geralt of Rivia__________________________________________ IntroductionDespite his words Geralt's second adventure won't keep him out of political business, as he will stumble right into political affairs, intrigues, rebellions and mysterious murders. 'Assassins of Kings' takes place after the events of the first game and throws the player into a dark, cruel and mature fantasy world full of morally ambigious (but nonetheless remarkable) characters, political disputes and an insane amount of names, lore and history. __________________________________________ The journey of a Witcher...The game's story is amazing and full of twists and remarkable events that will entertain you for a long time. Main and sidequests are very well written, diversified and more than just once the player has to make decisions where the difference between 'good' and 'bad' isn't that obvious. Geralt's journey will bring him to different cities, realms and areas and there are many things to do for the White Wolf. Sure it's no 'Open World'-game but the locations still offer huge areas to explore, that are full of monsters, characters, hidden secrets and forgotten treasures. Besides the synchronisation is all the time on a high level (even in german!) and despite its age of over four years the visuals are still absolutely gorgeous. I have spent over 40 hours on my first run on hard mode but afterwards I instantly started a second one due to the fact that the choices you make can create completely different adventures and often questlines, areas and outcomes change entirely. So far I've played it for over 70 hours and I've never been bored. __________________________________________ ContraSure the game isn't perfect. Some negative points would be that the difficulty changes between 'Geralt is Superman' and 'everyone else is Superman' (which leads to some pretty annoying situations), the fighting system is just average (...and definitly not a very strong point here), I had several CTDs and unfortunately the saving system is kind of annoying, because every save creates a new seperate data and the more data the longer some loading periods will be. As a 'frequent-saver' I had to clean out a lot...__________________________________________ Conclusion...but this is complaining on a very high level and all in all I can say that this is one of my favourite RPGs. It provides an amazing storyline with great lore and characters in a morally ambigious dark fantasy world that's far away from your typical stereotypes. And all this is backed up by one of the best protagonists of all time: the legendary white wolf, Geralt of Rivia. Every RPG-fan who skips this game will definitely miss something! (...and if only because you can import your finished savegame to the Witcher III).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2 is a narrative driven action RPG by Polish developers CD Projekt Red. To be reductive, it contains a lot of action-like RPG combat and deep mechanics common to Bethesda games, but is also extremely narrative driven to the tune of something Bioware might put out.  Over the course of the game, much of the Witcher's many turning gears become an immensely enjoyable machine, though it jumps to a rough start and could use a more enjoyable combat system.  I did play with the Combat Rebalance mod, which allegedly makes the combat better; truly I think it just made it more trivial, but those may be two sides of the same coin in this case.I started Witcher 2 having never played the Witcher 1, and generally not knowing what the game was about or how it worked.  Let me be blunt -- that is the absolute worst way to start the Witcher 2.  The game does offer an overall useless tutorial (if you have the Enhanced Edition), but otherwise it throws you right into a pretty hot mess.  Very little is explained in the way of combat mechanics, the many systems at your control (things like potions, crafting, magic abilities), and the context of the warring monarchs and their mysterious assassin which are central to its plotline.  Overall, it’s a little daunting to start.  That said, I highly recommend you persevere; lying on the other side is a huge payoff.What makes Witcher 2 shine is the well crafted, incredibly epic story of politicking and sorcery.  What’s even more impressive is the dynamic way in which it is presented to you; very few games give you the sense of control over the story the way Witcher does.  The game is divided into 3 acts, and the second act can be completely different based on decisions you make in the first act.  You will start in a different location, have different characters to interact with, and different quests.  Even more impressive is that Witcher 2 does a good job of staying away from the typical good/bad archetypes; characters usually feel complex and your decisions almost always fall into a gray area.  It never feels like the game is pushing you one direction or the other; sometimes being the bad guy pays off...other times, not so much.  The plot itself is very interesting, though you won’t find anything revolutionary about it.  Voice acting is typically well done, which is good because there is a LOT of it.  At least half the game can easily be spent talking to characters and fleshing out the world in which Witcher 2 takes place.  Cutscenes are serviceable, but nothing extraordinary.  Like many games of this scope, much of the Witcher 2 lacks a certain polish -- the game certainly looks beautiful, but animations are often clunky and transitions are not done well.Lacking the most polish, certainly, is the combat.  Combat in Witcher 2 feels mostly like a buffer between unlocking more of the story.  With the Combat Rebalance mod, parrying is automatic and after some initial struggle, I quickly learned to spam the same ability over and over again, accented by mashing attack and rolling around.  I easily beat 95% of encounters this way.  While you have a lot of options in terms of equipment etc., the majority is useless or unnecessary and I would have liked a little more variety in loot and spells.  I wouldn’t say the combat is outright bad, but it is certainly mediocre and not the highlight here.Overall, while there is a lot to nitpick about Witcher 2, I highly enjoyed it.  It’s a beautiful game which offers up one of the most interesting stories you can find in the medium.  Decisions are impactful and rewarding, even if combat is not.  If you like Skyrim, or Mass Effect, and wish there was a game which blended the two together into a great PC game, look no further than Witcher 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the greatest RPGs story and gameplay out there. It only misses horses.What do I hear? Horses will be in the third game?! ♥♥♥♥ YEAH!!!!-------------------------------------------------------------------------After over 150 hours, I have beaten the game 100%. Everything I wrote above is true, more than ever.In Easy mode, you have a button mashing experience. From Normal to Insane mode, crafting potions and using mutagens is obligatory in order to win a fight.The story is amazing. I am a big fan of Andrzei Sapkowski's books of The Witcher universe and I highly recommend reading them.There is a great mod out there, called Full Combat Rebalance, developed by the guys at CD Projekt Red: it's the best way of playing the game without it being too frustrating.-------------------------------------------------------------------------After a better review, I can safely say that this is still the best Western RPG. Let's just wait for the third (and final) installment in the serie the next year.

												One of my all-time favourite games. Geralt of Rivia has never looked better than here, everything about this game still impresses me. They took the first game and improved on almost everything except the stances..bring back the fighting stances .  This came out the same time as Dragon Age II which i also purchased and i have to say after that dissapointment i could have kissed CDPR's feet after playing this gem 7 times to completion. The game requires you to play it twice to get the full story...but i just loved it that much. The dev is also awesome and deserves everyones support, they actually treat us with some respect and not cash cows .EDIT : Unbelievable but they actually did it ! Witcher 3 is better than this amazing title. Its really something special when a dev improves on each game in a trilogy MANY other large companies could learn a thing or two from these guys.

												the Witcher II is one of the best RPG's I have ever played. The game is based on series of fantasy novels by Andrzej Sapkowski named ""the Witcher"". The story overall is a sequel to the Witcher SAGA. The game has a very extrodinary combat system, along with character development. The choices and the dialogs that you chose have a big impact on the overall story. the PROS: + great combat system+ pretty Geralt and pretty girls.+ long + huge amount of replayability+ rich fantatasy world and storyline+ amazing graphics and texturesthe CONS+ can't think of any. - crashed twice.

												War. Deceit. Terrorism. Murder. Sex. Treason. Prostitution. Violence. Loyalty. Espionage. Racism. If somebody tells you that Witcher 2 is for mature audiences, this isn’t because it’s exceptionally bloody or gory for a title of its genre – it’s because of the world and stories that it presents.It’s true: the graphics are mostly really good, even stunning in places. Battle is tactical and you have to learn how to use both your weaponry and your magic abilities in order to succeed. Music and sound are pretty good - the nice use of different dialects is a good reason that you should consider playing it in English even if that’s not your native language. The flaws that actually bothered me were few - like the fact that Geralt (your character) puts up the same facial expression for 80% of his dialogue. Yet it’s the storytelling and the way you shape WHAT story unfolds that I enjoyed most.Geralt has a real talent to end up as the “right guy in the wrong place”. And even though he progresses through the quests for pretty personal reasons, he constantly finds himself forced to make decisions that have a much larger impact than his personal fate.  Who will you trust? Who will you help? By the time you finish the first chapter you will have made decisions that will not only control the way you experience the rest of the story, but also will shape the lifes of many of the characters you met and – in the end – maybe even the rise and the fall of the nations that you cross. As usual in the Witcher games, you will find that not all of your decisions have the effect that you hoped, and often you only can try to choose the lesser evil. When I finished the game I felt the urge to play the Witcher 3  (which isn’t released at the time of this writing). Not because of the (hopefully) good gameplay and graphics that I expect – but because I wonder where Geralt's personal story and the big events that happen around him will finally lead.So do yourself a favor, get past the crappy tutorial and average prologue and then – starting with the first chapter - play one of the finest RPGs that are out there.

												If you already played The Witcher 3 and came here looking for something like TW3 in terms of graphics and gameplay, you might wanna think two times before buying TW2... The gameplay is a ""little"" different and way more limited than TW3. In terms of difficulty, TW3 is ""piece of cake"" compared to TW2. But, if you want to see Geralt dealing with an extremely complex political plot, romance, sex  and a story where your choices can change dramatically the storyline (8 different conclusions!), you must buy this game right now! It's serious, it really worth it. P.S.: And you can play it on Linux!!! =D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now, really, can you say something bad about Witcher games in general? The series are pinnacle of RPG gaming, and developers really tried to present the best RPG experience to the gamers, and, I dare to say, they succeeded. The story of Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings takes place after the first game. Someone blamed you for murdering a King, and you set off to find out the culprit. Simple as that, but, the story is also about Geralt regaining his memories.  The graphics are quite good and enchanted in relation to the first Witcher game. Attentions to the small things are amazing, from the detailed characters and environments to special effects, and Witcher is a truly an eye candy for gaming masses. In regard to that, you really need a high end PC machine to play the Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. The world of Witcher is huge and along the way you will meet a bunch of interesting characters, have a lot of...virtual sex, fight many kind of monsters, etc. Sometimes the game feels a bit to grindy, but your choices and fights you are engaging yourself into really impact the outcome of the story. Sometimes the battles seem a bit to tough, and RPG beginners could find the game more challenging, but, once you gain enough experience under your belt, the battles become easier. All Witcher games are highly recommended, and this one is no exception. This is simply something best that RPG games can offer. Don't miss it.			",255,99,7,48,21,4,48

												Reviewing the first game of The Witcher Saga I remember writing ""this is a badass RPG""... well, this second installment is at least ten times better. The combat system is much more fluid, allowing spectacular kill-streaks, and the game is pretty fun to play even with a gamepad (but navigating the inventory with it is kinda frustrating). Graphics-wise the game is just wonderful, it seems impossible that it was released in 2011. The story is compelling and full of humour, intrigues and plot twists, and since you'll have to choose between two possible paths at the end of Act I, you need AT LEAST two different playthroughs to explore all the content (but to really see everything you'll probably need to reload your savegame at least 4 or 5 times in certain situations). I cannot think about a single reason not to try this game, especially if you're a RPG aficionado. They're pretty cheap (Summer sale is about to start and I guess you can buy both games for around 6 or 7 euros) and they're absolutely awesome. Plus, you'll support CD Projekt RED, a GREAT developer that will also give you a DRM Free copy on GOG if you enter your Steam Key on their website. Try The Witcher Saga. You won't be disappointed.

												Witcher 2 deservers the title “The Best RPG of the Year” in my opinion. Graphically the most impressive RPG to date is truly a PC game, not some mediocre port from consoles. It was developed for PC and will squeeze every bit of your PC power for its full beauty. Gameplay wise, Witcher 2 deserves high praise for its rich story and dialogue. Multiple possible endings will increase its replayability, as well as possibility to permanently fail certain quests. Rich crafting, character development, large beautiful world, interesting characters make this game a must have for all RPG fans.

 Immersive story with a terrific graphics The Witcher 2: Assassins of The Kings is a game which is able to devour you for days and you still won't have enough of it after finishing. The game noticeably focuses on storytelling and explicates everything to the detail so even the most curious and demanding players get their money's worth. The famous witcher, Geralt of Rivia, lost his memory and slowly remembers what had happened. On his way he has many options what to do, how to respond or react, but still everything revolves around a mysterious slayer of the kings. This assassin might be the key to Geralt's past. Geralt's path is completed by a wide range of cutscenes which complements already thrilling story.Pros✪ Detailed story and background✪ Breathtaking cutscenes✪ High quality graphics ✪ Large scale of possibilities✪ Elaborate 3 branch talent treeCons✪ Complex background could be chaotic for new players and takes a while to understand who is who and what is going on. On the other side players can simply ignore parts which are not directly connected to Geralt.  They will miss a lot though ✪ Combat system is something I personally didn't enjoy much and had a problem to cooperate with. Still it's something players get used to. 8.5 /10 ",320,92,7,54,60,4,68

												This is a good game. It improved on the first game by a generous amount obviously. Graphics are impressive, not only for the year it was made, but still to this day in 2016. Dark, tense, and epic story. Combat to me wasn't very fluid and I highly encourage using a controller. I tried with mouse and keyboard and I got very confused and frustrated. There are moments that should be much more epic. Certain battles and stuff seem....lacking. Builds are pretty simple. One rule: never invest in the alchemy skill tree. Completely useless. There is a combat mod that cdprojektred themselves created if you wanna try that out. It is significantly better than the base game's tree system. This game could be so much more epic than it already is. You will see why if you play it. It is a good game. I was more enamoured with it before Witcher 3 came out, which set a new standard for me. Pick it up for a good adventure. Try your best to get it on sale though. Still pretty cheap regardless. Sometimes they bundle Witcher 1 and 2 together for like $10 or something like that. Pick it up then. Still recommending because it is good. Worth the money and the time.			",16,2,0,20,0,0,3

												buy this game, its worth every penny, don't pirate it and support a company that actually puts efforts into pc gaming, even the dlcs are FREE and so  the only thing costing you 10 bucks is additonal enhanced content, which adds even more depth to this great game, I promise you will not regret it and the ending is 10x better than mass effect 3 for sure. The sex scenes are also better than mass effect.-Video fanmade trailer I made -

			Just something I worked on for my return on reviews again, . Enjoy since i'll need some time to work on it, something to hype you up on. I'll be writing my honest opinion on this game .		

Anyways to start off you play as Geralt of Rivia who Is a witcher, witchers are monster hunter beings who uses alchemy to hunt demons, vampires, monsters so on. Geralt is on the search for his memory because he has forgotten his past and must rediscover who he is. While on this quest he was fighting for the king when suddenly he is now framed as the killer of the king. Geralt will have to find the killer and prove his innocenceOne of my top all time favorite game. This game has amazing graphics, Great voice acting, Great story, and devs that supported free updates. Based loosely on the book that is Polish you'll love this game and come to embrace the world of the witcher.+ One of the first few games that didn't start as a Console created port+ Well done Graphics (has high end settings)+One of the first few companies that did not feature DRM in a very long time on thier game.+Great soundtrack+ Best sex scenes ever seen in a game lol+ Well done voice acting+ Story keeps you wanting to know more+ The multiple path is great for replayability (mainly 2 major branch choices by who you join)+ Enhanced version includes Dark mode .- Lack of customization of character- The combat can be very unforgiving- Monsters don't really respawn and some of the quests are kinda boring sometimes, could be much better- Controls can be awkward at times- NEED MOAR COMBAT! (once you kill all there isn't much)- combat use to be clunky but that was fixed with update and is much better than it was			",810,183,33,104,81,7,110

IntroThe Witcher 2.... Where to start? The company is offering free DLCS and long term support and also made the game no DRM. Which means there is no negative effect on performance due to protection. Choices MatterThe game itself has excellent story telling elements. Alongside the fact that every mission you do effects the outcome of you're stories which can result to 16 different endings makes this game have alot of replay value. GameplayThe gameplay however is a deep learning curve. Anyone who hasn't played the witcher 1 prepare for a bit of dieing. The basic idea is that you use steel sword against humans, and silver against monsters. They took a odd approach in making you need to drink potions before combat in order to use them to your advantage. I found this a very huge turn in how difficult a rpg can be. Generally in other rpgs like Skyrim for example you had the handicap of being able to pause the game and drink some HP or mana potions. In this game you need to really know what your doing and what your about to fight in trial and error to prepare well.Mini-GamesThe game has a few mini-games that really add to the overall experience (Brawls,Gambling). The dice games and brawls have their own narrative in which you will get certain items or information you otherwise might not have obtained and has some-what importance though they are not vital to the overall experience. GraphicsThe graphics are constantly compared to Crysis. While it might not have better graphics tech wise. Many agree its artistic value is far superior to that of Crysis. ConclusionOverall the witcher 2 is a great game that I would recommend anyone who is already into fantasy RPGs and is looking for another solid game to play with good story elements.

												For a long time Rhadras urged me to play Witcher 2, knowing I hadn't overly enjoyed the first game due to the horrible swamp chapter. I finally caved in and... I enjoyed it!Just like in Witcher I put the combat level down to easy, or should I say the game decided I should play on easy after the brief combat tutorial at the start. I didn't mind this, as I'm not overly fond of the combat in the Witcher games, yet I didn't feel like it got in the way of the stroy like it did in the first game. The general feeling of Witcher 2 is that everything is bigger and yet it feels quicker, more refined - streamlined.There wasn't a point in Witcher 2 where I felt like I was just going back and forth forever, and the somewhat open chapter hubs kept things interesting even if there wasn't much to explore.The story does a great job of filling in the blanks for both the player and Geralt, setting up Witcher 3 very nicely.

												Oh god, how can I start this? First of all I hope you understand my position and dont downvote just because of a fanboy impulse. Thanks for reading. I tried I REALLY REALLY tried to like this game but I just can't (look at my play time, no joking around or justifying over false basis). The story, graphics and music are awesome but the combat mechanics and the insane amount of walking around with a robotic-like animation kills it. I've even tried to play it again with the full combat rebalance mod but... the mechanic itself its soooo broken that I just can't like it. I feel like I have little to no control over Geralt or combat in general for many reasons:- The awful auto targeting mechanic... Anybody would expect presing a key or pushing the stick towards a specific direction and hit the strike button and see your character attack in that direction but no... Geralt attacks the character that he is auto targetting. I've died SO many times because of that. Trying to cast an Igni sign to the front and seeing Geralt turn around and cast it on another direction is priceless... The same goes with sword attacks. I really felt like I had more control on the witcher 1 and that is saying A LOT.-Animations are confusing and illogical. Sometimes I hit an enemy and it doesn't count as a hit because the did an evade movement (even though the sword actually FULLY touched them). I thought ok then the same goes for me right? NOPE. On your evade/roll animation, if you get  touched, you are hit... Then sometimes the enemies appear to be stun locked and you think YEAH I can keep hitting them. NOPE. They magically recover from the middle of a ""stun"" animation in the middle of your next swing and OWN YOU (on higher difficulties). You really can never tell when its safe to keep slashing or back away so the game becomes a slash roll away, slash, roll away, repeat and pray that your next slash doesnt get ""magically evaded"" and your foe attacks you in a second of invincibility... -Attack animations are not in your control, sometimes the animation is ""cooler"" but it takes longer to land a hit and you never know when will what animation appear so you are basically F-ed since you can plan your attacks so well. Theres no pattern the animations are random, no combos.-You cant block while you walk, yes you read right, YOU CANT.-Did I mention the walking? You have to walk too much, the backgrounds look nice but will get old and boring once you complete the monster hunt missions and get an empty area.-Parry+Riposte mechanic is broken. Sometimes you get the symbol to do it and even though the parry animation shows and you block the hit and actually execute the attack, the enemy sometimes keeps attacking you and OWN YOU since you are in the middle of a swing, defenseless.-You cant drink potions in the middle of a fight and it gets annoying if you sum the time it takes for geralt to sit down, open the menu, make the potion, drink the potion, then stand up.-At some point you'll find out that you can beat the game spamming Igni signs.And the cherry on top of the cake of the cake: the game doesn't run so well. Witcher 3 and Gorund Zeroes run much better than this game, and that's a shame :( The game autosaves a lot and dont erase the much older saves. There are so many saves that on one point the load game screen starts to need a considerable amount of seconds to even show up. Sometime it just crashes and brings down Steam too (I have to end the process and restart steam).Sum up: Personally I think this game its a step in the right direction but it didn't reach the goal as it was supposed to. Thankfully the witcher 3 fixed every detail I'm complaining about. Even though it still shares the auto target function it lets you back away from the middle of a possible suicide attack by letting you cancel it through rolling or evading. The monsters' health bar blinks when they are about to attack, potions during combat and quick navigation through menus are back, etc. That game is what this one was supposed to be, but died trying. I reapeat: I hope you understand my position and dont downvote just because of a fanboy impulse. Thanks for reading.			",246,23,4,19,8,1,5

												Bigger, more beautiful and far more complicated, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is a terrific game, but beware, you might find yourself missing certain details and plots if you haven’t read the books.StoryWe continue our adventures as Geralt of Rivia, the famous monster slayer, this time, we face new difficulties as a mysterious group of people has started killing kings, we find ourselves struggling to clear our name after being framed for one of these murders. Following clues, finding key people and killing monsters will be the foundations for this new quest for the Witcher. More and complicated political issues and alliances are part of the story this time, as we have to take sides, each side leading to new missions and characters.GameplayThe Witcher 2 is a totally different game if we compare it to the original title, controls have been changed making gameplay more difficult to get used to, as we must learn how to use every new control and key. Bombs, traps and daggers were incorporated to make gameplay more varied, we still have the use of signs and our well-known steel and silver swords.On this occasion, signs feel more significant, they have a different touch, this time signs make you feel they are important to use depending on the battle we are having or the danger we are facing, they are concise and powerful to use, they deliver powerful blows and do a great deal of damage, even more if you level up the power and use of stamina.Bombs, traps and daggers are a great new addition, but in my case, I stuck only to bombs as they are more reliable and have more variation, poisonous, shrapnel, explosive, you name it, we have many different bombs for different situations, they are created the same way potions are created, by meditating, just get the right ingredients and the formula and you are all set.The new system includes quickslots, very helpful in fighting situations, here you can select which kind of secondary attack you wish to use, bombs, traps and daggers are the only options.Meditating is still tactical, as you may know, the witcher games are not the typical hack ‘n’ slash game, before going into any battle against monsters or humans, meditating is important and a must for you have to drink the right potion and brew what you need for battle, this characteristic has been improved as well, we no longer need a fire to meditate, just any place with no danger around will suffice. Leveling up will give us points we can spent on the skill tree where we have four paths, each of these paths have multiple options we can improve, so choosing correctly is up to you.Depending on the development of your skill tree Geralt will start showing more fighting moves, the power of signs will increase, toxicity tolerance will improve and also a new addition has been introduced, the adrenaline rush, a perk that will deliver a killing move as an in-game cinematic.TW2 offers more variety regarding armors and swords, the previous title was very limited and the creation of new swords was narrowed to some few silver and steel swords, even worst for armor sets, here we get to find new and better armor sets with many different perks and characteristics, the same for swords, blacksmiths are more common and ingredients for the creation of new tools are plentiful.GraphicsTW2 is a beautiful game, it is a gigantic step taken if we compare it to the original witcher, gameplay changed so did graphics and effects, it feels smoother and more defined. While the graphics are one of a kind here, the game also offers a great detail in weather effects and it adds a more consistency regarding the climate as well as day and night cycles. The engine really shines every time many of these aspects interact whether in battle or just when searching for clues related to any of the many missions and side-quests. There are little details in all sort of vegetation, the skies show multiple effects depending on the levels and sometimes in the distance the firmament is shown full of stars. More importantly, the engine is very keen to show off the diversity in the main cities we visit. Especially Upper Aedirn, a fantastic city built by dwarves, every stone, from a little stone to the biggest of the constructions the city is of a great design, it really captures the atmosphere of a place that has seen countless battles, magnificent.Sound and voicesThe series has always been very serious regarding sound and voice acting, and this time is not an exception, voice actors did a great job on every aspect of the acting, characters are believable and demonstrate different kind of accents during the story, we even get to listen to more of the elves’ language, superb work, nothing negative here.As for sound, TW2 is solid, we can feel the atmosphere on any landscape’s sound, nature, monsters etc. Everything is unique and deserves attention while the music adds intention and action to every battle, mission and interaction. Outstanding.The bad but not seriousPerhaps what makes this game difficult to get used to is the amount of characters, their personal views, politics and different story lines and past events that make the lore of the witcher a deep abyss of details, it might be complicated for people not familiar with the books, at least, on my first play through, I felt lost in the middle of the politics, unlike the original witcher, TW2 shows a more mature and adult view of the world. I would mention not to pick this one without a little bit of knowledge related to the lore, I strongly recommend the books to get a better insight of the witcher world and politics, after that, the series starts to be easier to understand and at the same time it helps appreciate even more the different aspects of the game, the kingdoms, lands and peoples, wars and history.ConclusionAs I said before, The Witcher 2 is a more mature game, a more adult-oriented title that will not disappoint at all, it has the depth regarding stories and lore, and it shows a more complex game style, definitely a must for RPG lovers and fans of the books.

												Playing this game once is like getting 40% of the story. (Even when you spent 50 hours to do all the side quests and trying to read in-game books, chat with NPCs and trying to get much info about in-game world as possible)When you playing the game second time - just curious what happen if you change your choices and play style (harder difficulty, different skill tree) - you would stay stunned like ""HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ There are so much possibilities, characters, events, new unexplored areas, new quests, connections, consequences and points of views I could not even imagine on first time play.""  There it comes the moment you start really realize what have you trully done, changed, and to whom you probably helped on the first play. (In game there are lots of shady characters and you can never be sure of their goal and side when you just look at them from one point of view). Obviously the second play results in decision, that you have to play that game at least one more time.To deeper understanding the story I really recommend to read all Witcher books from Andrzej Sapkowski which are events before Witcher games. And in Witcher 2 you would need those information much more then in Witcher 1 (one could say that you really dont need to know much about books in W1) to get full understanding about what is really going on. And what is finaly going to happen in W3 Wild Hunt.The impact of your choices to the game characters, lands and whole word order is HUGE and will probably means a LOT in grand finale in Witcher 3 so far as I can see and will be very interesting to see how they change the next episode. Thus I reccomend you to keep your final saves from Witcher 2 to import them to Witcher 3. (I heard that steam cloud only stores last 100 saves. I have about 250 saves on 1 ending, which means you are not able to keep all your endings in cloud after uninstaling. Keep that in mind)Summary:+ Great story continuation of Witcher books by Sapkowski+ make your choices and face their consequences+ singleplayer you can and should play more then once (multiple endings)+ choices and results imported from Witcher 1 and to Witcher 3+ shady fantasy world in its real nature (nothing is black and white)+ amazing graphic world+ nice cinematic scenes+ nice soundtrack+ swordmanship, magic and potions- too much saves results in crashing (you need to clean up your old saves in folder from time to time)- players thad didnt read books could be a bit lost in plot and could miss much important things (but still could enjoy the playing :p)- playing on the highest difficulty is both: incredible easy (most of the time) and almost impossible (on specific event when you lack some specific skill - ""riposte/position/feet work"" seems like Holy Trinity to surviving - which result in ""hours"" of reloading trying to beat the game with different skill tree. Simply boring and makes you angry. Especially without riposte it takes much much much more longer and its very hard to survive when you controll ghost soldiers in ghost battle (it seems that this is the only skill that is usable in that fight and your increased vigor - not through potions though - all other stats, improvements, and skills you choose are not applicable in that part of the game making this one skill like a must-win / must-lose-hard choice. Yeah it is possible even without it if you have the nerves and time ;) I did. Just warning you :P ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RECOMMEND WITH A WORD OF WARNINGThis game is really fun - but a word of warning:  The steam game is not fully updated through Steam for some reason.  Because of this you may run into game breaking bugs like I did.  These are only fixable by loading a save hours and hours back.So do yourself a favor and visit the developers support page and manually update the game to fix this.  Currently they are up to patch 3.4 (download 3.3 and then the game launcher will update to 3.4)http://en.cdprojektred.com/support/?support-product=the-witcher-2 ",242,61,10,29,32,0,23

												I only played it to get a better understanding of the witcher universe before starting on Witcher 3.Overall Graphics - 8/10 Pretty good for a game that came out in 2011, with mods its even better, not as good looking as skyrim modded but its good.Gameplay - 7/10 You can't jump in this game which is annoying. Combat Mechanics feel abit clunky but it gets the job done. Its not a hack n slash game, you have to plan before the fight and make use of other mechanics such as parrying, dodging, spells, oils and potions besides spamming left click - sword attack button. Else, you'll get rekt.Story - 8/10 The choices you make affect the places you go to as well as the outcome of the storyline. You could play through this game twice to experience entirely different areas and outcomes. Overall: Bought it for $2 during steam sale, You got an almost polished AAA title. Its a no brainer, get it.			",95,10,3,14,3,2,8

												This is my first time finishing the game, and I have also played through the first game. Although it kept the same quality of epic storyline, a lot was noticeably different to the first game, is more complicated in a lot of its mechanics and I found the combat more difficult, although I got used to it in the end. I liked the way you had to think about things a lot more, use more strategy in battle, use all the signs, traps and bombs, not just Aard/coup-de-grace everything in sight. The quests are also more complicated, they are no longer WoW-style kill 20 things/collect 20 things quests, they almost all have multiple ways to resolve them and some of the possible ways require you to find out things the game doesn't automatically tell you about. Even shopping is more complicated, there is a crafting system with templates to buy, and money is often scarce. A lot of potions have drawbacks and levelling up involves a more detailed skill tree. I enjoyed the return of the poker dice quest, as well as Geralt's adventures in arm-wrestling and prize-fighting. I would recommend playing it, as it has a good story, good music and satisfying gameplay, the most important things in an RPG for me, I have a few complaints: The game sometimes hangs for no discernable reason (I am using a fairly high-end Windows 8.1 laptop), which the first game also did. The 'mature' aspects of the game are getting more tacky. I quite liked the erotic artwork and occasionally bizarre implied sexual tastes of the first game, but they've been replaced by the same incredibly repetitive cut scene that leaves virtually nothing to the imagination. Even when Geralt meets the succubus, there's nothing particularly remarkable about his amorous adventures. Also, ALL the NPCs make ribald jokes and swear for no particular reason ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE GAME. And, inevitably, there are lesbians for humorous effect. It feels kind of immature, not mature. The level of explicit violence is also getting more needlessly extreme and gratuitous. and the cut scenes in the strange animated style faintly annoy me.The story still feels unresolved, as the problems you solve mostly come back as soon your back is turned, which gets my mood a little low. Geralt doesn't seem to really have much effect on the wider story of the world, he just solves his own personal storyline, mostly getting his memory back. Everyone is still at war, everything is still a damn mess. It's like a tabletop game where the GM won't let you actually change his beloved world. The growing Wild Hunt theme is the most interesting part of the story that seems to actually concern you, and the third Witcher game is called Wild Hunt, so maybe the plot will actually get somewhere next game?

												Right after i finished number 1, i started with the second witcher game. And I can safely say I am pleased with this game. This game has the perefct balance between story, gameplay, and game lenght. There's quite a bit of dialog, but if you dont like it, you can just skip the talking. This is a rpg game for adults. There's politics, ethical problems, and a bunch of hard choises to make. I spent about 35 hours, and I did almost everything the game has to offer. There's an arena mode wich does not have anything to do with the story of the game, where you fight against increasingly hard waves of enemies, wich game me an hour of enjoyment, but you can play it for quite a bit. In summary, this is one of the best games I have played. The story is amazing, and i was caught in the situations of the game at all times. I was suprised when the game was finished, since I didn't feel time flowing. The gameplay is an HUGE upgrade from the last one, and skill is a bigger factor than stats. The lore and immersion is fantastisc, i actually went through all the books i found. It altso looks amazing, still, in 2016. This one is among the best games I have played, and it deserves a 10/10. Now, I'm starting the third, and probably the last game in the series. Va'fail!			",216,36,1,39,21,5,12

												What an immersive tale! This game really ticks all the boxes (except for one very minor point) for a great RPG.Since I played this game right after finishing the first Witcher game I need to say how much more fun the game is to play. Even if there's a fair amount of 'backtracking' it never feels like a chore. My main problem with the first game (the fighting mechanics) got a complete overhaul and are now actually one of the game's stronger points.The presentation is great. The graphical style, the oversaturated colours and the effects really add up to an amazing experience even today. The music and sound effects are very atmospheric too. The voice acting is even better than in the first game and that's quite a feat to achieve.One major issue with the game is the length. It's just too short! It's an intense ride and after 30 to 40 hours you just don't feel like letting go. Luckily there's a really good incentive to replay the game right away (which I'll do now).Another minor complain is the save system. You can save manually and can quicksave, but you can't overwrite older manual saves nor quicksaves. That leads to a huge amount of save files if you don't delete them manually... one by one. Really don't know why the game does it this way.The plot and the characters are the main flesh of the game and they are making the whole game the gem that it is. The three chapters are perfectly balanced and not at all streched out this time. I only wish there was a bit more to do besides the main story, but I gladly take the 'no filler' approach if it's this well made.The game is great and even if it's packed with cutscenes, they are all worth it. Just a great RPG that makes me hungry for the third part.			",3269,1346,120,379,425,37,487

Basic InformationTitle:  The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced EditionDeveloper:  CD PROJEKT REDPublisher:  CD PROJEKT REDGenre:  Role Playing GameGeneral ImpressionA sequel that improves in almost every way compared to its predecessor and paved the way for the masterpiece that is The Witcher 3. The trilogy has constantly changed to cater the needs and desires of its fanbase, a thing most evidently found in the streamlining process of The Witcher 2 in regards to the first one in the series. The graphics in Assassins of Kings are gorgeous and demanding even after 5 years since its release. You will need both a decent system and plenty of time to enjoy this game. It's not worth rushing through it or skipping any dialogue. In fact, I highly recommend that you play and finish The Witcher 1 first, so that you may import your very own save file (and game choices) into Witcher 2. This save system and the choices that ultimately matter, make the series as fascinating as Mass Effect or Dragon Age. Only the best crafted RPGs care for player choices throughout several gameplays.Strong Points+ Gorgeous graphics.+ Excellent storyline and setting.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points-  A few glitches.Rating 10/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

Posted: November 27, 2013
												The 2011 Game of the Year.Let me start off by saying that the first Witcher finally made me start playing RPG's. It's a game that I am still thinking of once in a while even years after I beat it. It's a game, although with limited amount of NPC (even the enhanced version) and some minor issues, that will stand the test of time. It's a game, whose soundtrack I am still listening to. It's a game whose folklore still captivates me with its creativity and versatility.The art direction in this game is bound to get some awards at the end of the year. It is perplexing just to look at the distant vistas that are missing from so many games. The first Witcher pulled that off on occasion. Such areas as The Lake provided you with the feeling like you were in a big world even though you were confined to an average-size area. Witcher 2 takes this to another level. Not only do you get to enjoy the distant cascading vistas that are staggered by layers and layers of the nearby and the faraway horizons, you also get to enjoy the near environments teeming with life. Yes, we have seen some impressive NPC behavior in the past but this time, the behavior of some of the NPC is near unpredictable. And don't expect them to stand around this time and have same faces.The game features extremely well written dialogue with plenty of words that I had to look up. The story arches in many different directions depending on your actions or inactions. This is a very very mature game. I was able to import my last saves from the first game - which supposedly influences some of the dialogue between the characters. Some of the events are also going to be influenced, supposedly...The long loading times when you enter a new area or even a small house are gone now. Also, if you walk inside someone's premises, you will be amazed by the attention to detail. They devs haven't missed anything on this one.In general, Witcher 2 instantly sucks you in with its immense ambience. I cannot even begin to describe the feelings I had when I was walking through the forest for the first time. Sometimes I find myself standing still in the forest and attempting to look as far as I can and behind every tree you can see another tree and so on...I have never seen anything like it. I also love the background blur.Do not expect this game to be easy though. It is pretty hard. The combat system takes a while to get used to. You will have to time your attacks with almost near precision. Not only that, you will have to combine your regular attacks with your special attacks to cause the maximum amount of damage. The battle system in the first game was sort of a war of attrition. You would usually be surrounded by enemies and you'd have to quickly switch in between your fighting moves to finish everyone off before you yourself died. It will probably take you a while to be able to come out of the fights near-unscathed. So at first you will most likely die and die and die.The game however, gives you plenty of opportunity to roam around and collect herbs before you get into doing heavy quests. In most RPG's, there is no indication of how hard one or another quest is going to be. But we always assume that we will be able to complete it. This game does not let you do that.And unlike the first game that heavily required the use of potions on the Hardest mode, this game require the use of potions on the Medium mode. This time, you really have to look for those ingredients.The ironic thing is that even if you are able to stuff your pockets with the ingredients, you still only know the very basic alchemy at the beginning of the game. So using the temporary oils that will temporarily enhance your melee attacks is essential.Quests. Ok, do you remember all those silly fetching quests in Dragon Age 2 that take place on the same areas over and over again? Now you can forget about all that. I cannot believe that the writers of these games still haven't run out of original ideas for the secondary quests.I am also happy to see some of the Witcher 1 monsters coming back. Not to mention the fact that they look better and move more realistically.Just like with the first game, there is this dichotomy present within human interactions. On one hand, you are the monster slayer, but you are not necessarily the protector of the people. So do not expect to always find sympathizers and allies within the immediate human communities. The racial tensions are still here too and there's plenty of vulgarity to go around.The soundtrack is perfect. Does anyone remember ""Peaceful Moments"" from the first game? You'll hear plenty of that here.There are also easter eggs pertaining to Assassin's Creed and to the Lord of the Rings.Anyways, I never gave any game a ""10"", but this game truly deserves it. I really cannot see much wrong with it and I've been playing it since midnight. One thing that is annoying is the disappearing bodies and the ability to loot people's homes without any repercussion. In addition, you really DO have to think ahead and anticipate the movement of your foes.All in all, I got myself a collector's edition. If anyone can afford to get it, please get it - the devs need our support. I won't hesitate to say that this is the most beautiful game ever created, so far; and so far it is my favorite game of all time, until the Witcher 3, of course...I am also happy to boast that on May 13, 2013 after approximately 170 hours of trying I was able to beat the game on Insane difficulty (as in beating the game with permadeath difficulty).

												In the simplest terms, starting to play Witcher 2 is a lot like taking a vacation to a country where you go only sightseeing: you'll sure see some amazing and cool stuff, but you'll have to suffer a lot of unnecessary punishment, fatigue and stress (I pat myself on the back for this analogy). I mean the difficultly curve, interface and mechanics sadly limit the game's appeal. But maybe it's because the developers intentionally don't want to cater to the mainstream audience. And that's probably the attitude that is needed in order to create one of the few adult video games that confidently stands tall as a good game with it's own heart and identity.

												A great Role Playing Game.What i felt was good:+ The design of the world, it is beautifully handcrafted.+ Rich lore (there were books before there was a game).+ Voice acting is great.+ No pansy censorship.+ You have to actually study/read ingame books to figure out how to battle certain enemies or what piece of puzzle you are missing to finish a quest (one does not simply ""find an Endrega Queen in XY coordinate marked on your map""). Of course you can accidentally figure it all out, no triggers. Completing quests feels rewarding.+ Difference between Prepared for combat and Casually going somewhere hacking away is very noticeable.+ Preparation for combat is more important than ""leveling up"".Not that good:- There is no potion for sprinting. Sometimes I'd wish one could sprint for brief moments. You will find yourself running across big towns a lot, at least they are beautiful.Unsure:~ Getting used to combat mechanics takes a while, but partially it is about knowledge of enemy and how to counter it.

												Firstly, if you seek to play the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, I recommend getting the Witcher 2 first.I have never bought the first game in the series, with outdated graphics and combat, but I am really glad to have played this.The highlights of the game are quite definitely the graphics and the story. For a 2011 game, the world looks beautiful. Textures can look a bit grainy at times, but they are so colourful and vibrant you'll end up loving them.As for the story, what the Witcher series does best (at least the 2 games I've played), is make you feel like you're the main character, you ARE Geralt, his friends are your friends. This is what makes the franchise special. The plot is about Geralt trying to get his memory back, him getting framed for a crime, and all this is intertwined with a political plot. It might get a tad confusing at times though.The game is a lot about decisions. Remember, a single line of dialogue can change your whole journey.As far as combat goes, it's fun, but I HIGHLY recommend playing on normal or hard, as easy mode makes fighting human enemies a joke. I figured this after having played easy for a while, and I got rekt.Onto the caveats.The ui is a bit hard to understand, and not too user friendly. Alchemy is not too fun, although it might be me hating consumables (which is another reason why I love Wild Hunt!).The world is not exactly open world. The game is divided into three main zones, through which you can progress by doing the main quests. You can freely explore one area, but you can't go back to previous ones. And you really have no reason to explore much other than doing quests or destroy monster nests.The most frustrating part about the game for me are the invisible walls. 98% of the time you can't even fall off a ledge or go in water. The Flotsam Forest is actually a maze, because you can't go through bushes. Still, I did play this game just after playing 2 ""wall-less"" RPGs, so maybe it's just me.Anyway, definitely recommended, will help to understand the Witcher 3's story (you might wanna look up The Witcher 1's story before playing this, it will help you with your initial interrogation).8/10 ",10,0,0,7,2,0,1

												First of all I’d like to state that although I have clicked the ‘do not recommend’ option, my position toward the game is one of neutrality, neither dismissing it as unplayable nor condoning the exuberant praise that The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings seems to receive. The game has many redeeming features which shall be discussed shortly, however I feel as though there are just as many aspects that make the player underwhelmed with his/her experience. Secondly, I should say that this review builds upon my review of the original Witcher, which I have also reviewed on Steam, so I will be making a few comparative points in light of my disposition toward the first instalment in the series.The Witcher 2 is driven extremely well by an engrossing narrative of political intrigue, racial prejudice and social injustice. Although the hybrid of Medieval and fantasy themes has been done before and is far from original, The Witcher 2 fully embraces the combination and creates a three-dimensional world with rounded and well thought-out characters that have their own individual agendas and follow them accordingly. There are a few plot twists along the way which I, of course, won’t mention, but these keep the narrative feeling fresh and engaging enough to continue playing til the end. I would say that the story, fresh from the pages of the original comics, is the main factor encouraging gamers to try this game.Furthermore, we aren’t babysat. Nothing has been toned or dumbed down, which is preferable as too few games are made in modern times that have been made for an adult audience. We are shoehorned immediately into the action and I think that’s why the game puts many people off in the initial stages, claiming it to be unfriendly to new users to the series. I would argue this is a commendable feature however, as the harsh and merciless world of Geralt is directly reflected in the games content and contextual features. The combat is far more engaging than in the original WItcher, due simply to it being more enjoyable. That being said, it is far from perfect. Battles range from being far too easy to far too hard far too quickly. We can quickly descend into the ‘trial and error’ form of gaming, constantly reloading previous saves in order to trial new ways of beating a difficult enemy. You can also only drink or create potions before a battle, not during it, which is more realistic I accept, but ultimately make many aspects of the combat frustrating. If I realise that a potion improving my vigor regeneration will help me win a battle in its opening stages, why not just let me drink one? The guise of this being ‘unrealistic’ simply makes alchemy and potion consumption frustrating; constantly saving, reloading and drinking potions before a known fight drastically effect the pace of the game and cause a stuttering experience that is cause for concern.Perhaps the most disappointing characteristic of The Witcher 2 though is the world itself. I don’t mean its concept, I mean in its literal physicality. The areas you can explore are minuscule in terms of a 21st century RPG and the areas are quickly covered and recovered time and again. This makes the quests fairly limited, as there is only so much to do in a rather small gaming arena. Quests such as competing at arm wrestling, dice poker and brawling are irrelevant sideshows, yet if you take  these out you are only left with half dozen side quests in Act I and II respectively, and only a couple in the rather brief Act III. The overall longevity of the game is actually rather small, with a completed game taking between 16-30 hours (and that would be being generous). Essentially, there are a fair number of things to do in the world, but there really aren’t that many, certainly not deserving of high merit.Quest exploration (in terms of the map and quest markers) is a rather touchy subject for both fans and haters of the series alike. Fans of this game state that the map and quest hints are intentionally cryptic because the game encourages you to explore yourself, and that we shouldn’t be spoon fed as gamers. Haters of The Witcher 2 point on the map and quest markers are totally useless, broken, and ruin the gaming experience completely. While I totally back the formers idea in theory, in practice the latter is nearer the truth. Quest markers as you approach them do sometimes teleport elsewhere without explanation, whilst the game map has no concept of ‘levels’, meaning that you may arrive at your destination only to discover that its several floors above you, a particular problem in Vergen. If the developers didn’t want to spoon feed the gamer and it was all about exploration and realism, why bother with a quest marker at all? Why, at the beginning of the majority of quests, does it tell us where to go? The quest exploration in the game seems to be a halfway house between attempting to help the gamer and encourage exploration, yet it ends up failing on both counts.A problem with the critiques of the Witcher are of course, the critics themselves. Haters of the series have complained of a lack of fast travel. There is of course, no problem with that whatsoever. The developers have created a game that is very graphically impressive with some engaging characters, all of which they want you to experience. Removing fast travel will enhance the possibility of experiencing these things. Furthermore, the confines of the world itself is rather tiny meaning that fast travel is, for the large part, totally unnecessary anyway, as it does not take particularly long to run from one side of the map to the other. One of my main bones of contention with the previous Witcher instalment was its ‘mature’ content. I stated in my review of that game that having maturity in the game does not make the game mature, and I think that unfortunately still applies to the sequel. I’m not sure if it’s because the translations from Polish to English are not clear enough, but much of the dialogue feels awkward, with characters using expletives, talking of♥♥♥♥♥♥and ‘ploughing’ for the sake of it. I think the developers could have included this content without making it so blasé, and it still seems as though the developers are trying to show off to kids and young teens. Nearly all dialogue refers to some obscenity and it becomes tiresome rather quickly. In fact, many of the characters are unlikeable because of this fact, most noticeably Roache and Ioveth. This does help serve the ‘shades of grey’ approach that the developers are going for, using a ‘lesser of two evils’ mindset, yet it is hard to play out an entire game without at least having a couple of likeable characters that we wish to associate with.  A positive note however, is that the ‘Sex Cards’ from the previous game have been removed, presumably because those who were amused or aroused by such content hit puberty and discovered internet porn.Overall, the experience is okay and the narrative really is interesting. But the content of the game, although acceptable, really is not the experience that many exaggerated reviews on Steam that lavish the praise make out that it is. It has many issues that make it fall down. However, I would say that the commercial success of The Witcher 2 should allow the developers the funds to make The Witcher 3 into something special, reflecting an intriguing and exceptional storyline with equally impressive gaming content (for a change).Please review and comment, any feedback is welcome and thank you for reading.

  OVERVIEW  The Witcher 2 is a single-player fantasy role-playing game by CD Projekt RED, starring Geralt, the hero from the first game released in 2007. Geralt is a witcher, a ghost-haired mutant that can wield swords and magical powers to dispatch foes. Expect a large cast of characters to interact with, plenty of ways to upgrade and customize Geralt to suit your play style, and at least one boss fight against a giant tentacle beast.From what's been said about the game so far, The Witcher 2 is enormous. The official word is 38 hours long, though it's unclear how much that may vary if you decide to take part in all the side quests and minigames. Like in the first game, your actions while playing affect what happens later. In the sequel, this may mean you'll miss entire towns (as well as the associated storylines and side quests) on your first playthrough. According to the game's official site there'll be four different beginnings and 16 possible endings.  COMBAT SYSTEM  Combat has also received a significant overhaul. Gone is the restrictive timing-based system used in the original, replaced by a more free-form system that should be more familiar to those who play third-person action games. You'll be able to equip lots of different armor pieces this time, as well use weapons, spells and alchemical components to kill your enemies. It's best to use Geralt's steel blade against humanoids and the silver one for monsters. Geralt's active target is painted with an icon, letting you know who you'll strike with an attack.The most important thing to be mindful of in combat is your command wheel, which can be brought up by holding the Ctrl key. Bringing this up slows time and allows you to select one of Geralt's magical signs, as well as switch between combat items. Using the magical signs is a must. Even before they're powered up through leveling, these abilities can set enemies on fire (Igni), stun and root them in place (opportunity to perform finishing kill), knock them down and a temporarily dampen incoming damage (Aard), shield (Quen), trap to immobilize enemies (Yrden) and triggers a hex that causes an enemy to fight alongside with us (Axii).  Axii is my favorite sign while fighting with group opponent. Hexing them to fight along your side will reduce their enforcement pressure towards us when they are tightening their fight.   PERFORMANCE  The Witcher 2 looks great. Only hours in you'll be treated to stunning views of enormous, sweeping vistas from the side of a castle under siege. Nearly every scene is populated with plenty of characters; the animations are more realistic than the first Witcher game during conversations and combat. Contrast lighting and warm color tone really brings up Witcher 2 among the best-looking games in existence - only the facial animation is imperfect. Background music and sound effect suit the atmosphere so much plus good voice acting supports a charismatic script really brings up Witcher 2 as a whole fantastic game.   ACCESSIBILITY  Approaching a sequel to a dense role-playing game can be daunting. If you never played the first, The Witcher 2 stars an established character you may know nothing about and is set in a detailed fictional world you're likely not familiar. Why bother playing if you're not already invested in the story and characters?So far, a number of reasons The Witcher 2 feels like a older style of role-playing epic: a rich, detailed experience packed with curiosities, creative and flexible quest designs, powerful reasons to explore and deep gameplay mechanics. And, as a bonus, it's much prettier than its predecessor.Witcher fans that played all the way through the first game are definitely getting something extra here. For you there's an existing emotional bond with some of the characters. When Triss and Geralt walk across the screen and reference past events and the names of lands and cities, there's an added layer of meaning.If you didn't play The Witcher you'll be missing out on context, but it won't be long until you're caught up in the pressing drama of the sequel. I certainly wouldn't say you should wait to play The Witcher 2 until you've completed the first game. Due to a number of changes, mostly for convenience's sake, The Witcher 2 for now appears to be the better game. There's a definite learning curve when it comes to things like combat, managing the numerous menus and brewing and using potions, but it doesn't take long for it to make sense.  CHOICE AND CONSEQUENCE  Some role-playing games present choice and consequence in very clear terms. Sometimes you're given points for being good and evil. Your overall moral standing is displayed as a giant glowing meter on your character statistics page. All your decisions are distilled into one numerical value. Sometimes your appearance changes and characters react differently to your presence. The aim of all this is the make your decisions feel like they're having an impact in the world, that the virtual people you're helping or terrorizing remember your actions and, as a result, feel a little bit more human.In The Witcher 2, there's no meter for good and evil. Instead, Geralt operates outside the reach of a persistent morality rating. During a quest Geralt can choose to help out or tell people to get lost in blunt, explicit terms. The results aren't as simple as unlocking a few extra dialogue options. Instead, there are significant changes to the direction of the quests.In The Witcher 2, choice is not an illusion. At no point has this been more obvious than how the story develops toward the end of the first Chapter. A decision needs to be made about how to proceed forward, and the impact will radically change how things evolve. It determines the next city you visit, the cast of characters you follow and the quests made available. It changes your entire perspective on the main events of the game.  CRAFTING AND ALCHEMY  Though the core sword-slashing combat of The Witcher 2 might strike you as straightforward – time mouse clicks to string together slices – there are a lot of ways to modify Geralt's effectiveness in battle. One of the best ways to secure upgrades is through crafting. Most of everything that can be used and equipped in The Witcher 2 can be crafted. You can make traps, steel and silver swords, armor and even crafting components. When you have the appropriate Diagram, usually purchased from vendors, you need to go talk to crafter NPCs standing around in town. By interacting with them a crafting menu can be called up that displays all your Diagrams as well as whether or not you have the proper components. If you do, then after a simple button press the item is generated. There's no percentage chance to fail and there's no associated mini-game.The value and function of potions in The Witcher 2 differs from fantasy role-playing game standards. You can't consume health restoration potions mid-battle in this game. Instead, you need to drink them before a fight begins, which gives Geralt temporary boosts to things like damage and health regeneration. It's a great system because it means you can't run into a conflict without thinking. Making potions is similar to crafting gear. Vendors sell Formulas for potions, and by combining the appropriate plants special brews are created. The actual process of creation isn't handled by a vendor, but instead accessible through Geralt's mediation menu. Here you'll find listed all your Formulas for potions, bombs and oils. If the proper ingredients are in your inventory, the product can be outputted with a keystroke. Simple enough.  REPLAYABILITY  Of course, if you have dozens of times. The Witcher 2 has four different beginnings and 16 possible endings. Enjoy !   VERDICT  8.5/10			",158,40,0,15,1,2,6

												I like The Witcher series so much that I buy extra copies, when they go on sale, and give them out to everyone on my friends list like candy. I then, like a mindless monkey, dolled up my Steam account to be all about The Witcher. Why? Because the game is so ploughing good that I've deemed it my most favorite game of all time and I cannot recommend it enough. The Witcher 1 might not be good for everyone, but I still recommend giving it a shot. If you don't like it, then ignore that and move on to The Witcher 2 instead.Oh, I also bought all the books.

Story:""The Witcher 2"" was inspired by a polish book series  called ""Wiedźmin"". The game tells the story of Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher who is trying to recover his lost memories. Witchers are basically superhumans who can also cast spells and work as mercenaries, who can work as bodyguards, monster hunters, etc.In the beginning he is blamed for the murder of King Foltest (who he was working for at the moment) and went to jail. While there, he is given a chance prove his innocence and goes after the King Slayer while still trying to get his memories back.It's good story overall. I might not be the best but it's certainly good, especially due to the fact that your choices can completly change the Storyline and it has around 4 major endings.GameplayMany people keep complaining about the battle system, but I actually enjoyed it. However, it takes some time until you get used to it.Geralt has 2 different swords: one is made of steel and the other is made of silver. The steel sword it's used against enemies such humans and elves and the silver one it's used against monsters. He can perform a quick and a heavy attack.Geralt can cast 5 different spells, a.k.a. signs: -Aard: Knocks back the enemies, preventing them from blocking your next attacks. There's also a chance of stunning the enemies, which allows you to kill them with just one hit;Yrden: Creates a trap which stuns the enemies and prevent them from defending themselves;Ignis: Geralt casts a fire ball;Quen: Provides full damage protection for a short period of time against a few hits;Axii: Used to turn an enemy against their allies and to persuade NPCs during some dialoguesHis health regenerates very slowly even when you are not in combat, but he can speed it up through potions. However he only drink potions by meditating (which can't be done in combat) and he can't drink too many because they're also toxic.Visuals and SoundtrackThe game still looks pretty good, especially considering that it was released back in 2011. To make things even better the soundtrack was also very well produced. Combining both elements you can get easily immerse in this fantasy world.ConsNow it's time for the cons:-It's not an easy game, but that's not a problem by itself. The real problem are the difficulty spkies, which can be really frustating and some enemies that might seem cheap;-The lack of a fast travel mechanic or even a vehicle or an animal to walk around the map can be annoying at times. It might feel good to walk around exploring the world, but when you pass multiple times through the same area it can get a bit annoying;-The game doesn't explain certain parts such as mutagens and alchemy.Overall it's really solid title and I recommend it to every RPG fan.

THE WITCHER 2: ASSASSINS OF KINGS ENHANCED EDITIONREVIEWThe Witcher 2, even before entering the main menu, shows us maybe the best CG intro ever in a video game. After the shocking ending of The Witcher leaving us with a cliffhanger, The Witcher 2 starts shortly after the predecessor. Geralt of Rivia, after saving King Foltest of Temeria, works for him now, as a personal bodyguard. Hunting traitors, Foltest sieges a castle and “invite” Geralt to help his army. Something shocking happens in the action-packed epic prologue, and now Geralt must prove he is saying the truth, and have his vengeance, seeking a mysterious man. The Witcher 2 storyline is more action-packed than the first one. It’s epic, it’s complex and have a lot of politics involved. Also, you have to make dramatic choices, that even before the half of the game, show a totally different perception of the entire story, making it almost two in one. (Beat the game two times for the full experience!) Personally, I prefer the first Witcher story, but the second one is really better in showing it’s themes and involves a lot of more things happening in the world, with decisions that matter even in The Witcher 3, drawing to one possible conclusion, showed in an epic CG. The ending does not disappoint and put another cliffhanger that serve as a promise for the epic The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, the conclusion of the saga. Character development is very good and you will possible love two characters, Saskia and Ioverth. They’re amazing and shows a good background. But… it’s The Witcher! Everyone have their own personal story and unique quests, everything in the world have something behind it. The game’s campaign is shorter than the first one, because is kind of divided in two, but its more action packed like I also said and includes even more epic Boss Battles, that I bet will surprise you. Besides the campaign being smaller, the game itself is bigger, have more quests, bigger areas to explore and more content! The graphics are impressive, as still of today. The darker style of the game shows beautiful scenarios and regions, and well done animations, a problem from the first game. Alongside the epic soundtrack and sound effects, it all boils down to the amazing fantasy atmosphere the game shows you. The movimentation is more fluid than in the first game and you can even climb some obstacles. Combine this with combat that also shows an amazing innovation. Maybe the worst aspect of the first game, turned in one of the triumphs in The Witcher 2. The combat combines the Signs again, but now it’s not a totally combo-based like the first one and have a lot of movements and sounds like more a hack’n’slash game, with truly epic fight scenes with all kinds of monsters, that are now bigger in number than on the first game. Contracts are back as always and you have to clean monster nests and destroy them. As this is the enhanced edition, it features better graphics, bugs correction, and all of the released DLC, so you may find trolls in the game world with some interesting stories, and there is also the special Arena mode where you fight waves of enemies. Talking about the game itself again, there’s a lot of weapons again, and this time, a lot of armors, something I found lacking in the first. You can breed potions as always that help you in combat and sometimes is even necessary for quests. The world feels alive and you have a lot of romance options, but this time with no romance cards, but explicit scenes, even more than its successor, including specially one with Triss…There is also a crafting system for the armor and weapons which gives you the best ones in the game. Now you can meditate (to pass time and brew potions) anywhere if there’s no enemies, so it’s more practical than the predecessor. Dice poker is present: you can play a game with almost everyone and it's very fun and have quests related. The perk and level up system is cool and works well. The bad aspects for the game includes some bugs, random crashes that make you lose your progress and even lose your save in some cases (do a lot of them) and the lack of “RPG interactions”. The first one had a lot of food, drinks that you could eat and an animation was showed. This one does not feature all of that and no animations are present. Ok, that's a minor thing but...my opinion. Another thing is the game can be too punitive at the beggining, not stimulating someone into proceeding in. After you level up a bit it becomes fun, however. Mini games are present in boss battles. And they are annoying. The inventory menus are kind of chunky for me, also. +High Replayability+Choices and consequences+Epic story with political background+Epic and amazing soundtrack and sound effects+Big Immersion+Customization, lots of weapons, armors and skills+Top quality realtime weather and passage of time +Charismatic characters +Beautiful scenarios with large areas+A lot of sidequests and talk+Cool scenarios+Variety of monsters even a dragon!+Lots of content+Fun combat+Romance scenes+Epic CGI in the start and in the end of the game.+Level up system+Dice poker+Boss battles+Arena mode-Some bugs-Random crashes-Annoying boss battles mini-games-Lack of minor details-Over-punitive beggining-A bit chunky inventory menusVa fail, Gwynbleidd.

												Awesome game.   I initally had a hard time getting into it, as I found it was harder than most rpg's that I play ( I'm a big fan of Dark Souls and Demon's Souls, though the Witcher 2 difficulty is different from those kinds of games. )  I also found it akward to play with a keyboard, and once I switched to a controller, my gameplay satisfaction significantly increased.  Once I got through the first chapter, I hit my stride then and figured out how to be a more effective Witcher, and the initial learning curve was overcome.  Gameplay is good, coupled with really good fighting animations, proves for a satisfying experience. Graphics and audio are very well done; the game has a satisfying and fitting soundtrack.  The story is interesting, and I always felt compelled to find out what happens next.  However it does allude to the first game quite a bit, and while it does fill in some details for you, it may be better to play through the first  game, but in my opinion it is not absolutely necessary.  The game also features multiple meaningful choices and there are several endings to obtain, giving alot more playabilty. All in all I would highly recommend it.			",479,120,12,62,36,2,41

You really have to invest time to read everything and listen to everything they mumble to you. I didn't and I was lost 90% of the time. But I still enjoyed it and can recommend it! Two thumbs up.

												This game is worth well over two, maybe three playthroughs simply because the amount of actual content, storyline branches and replayability is absolutely ridiculous.Although I'd suggest you enter with a gamepad, a mouse and keyboard works almost as well, and no matter what you do the game will always, always have more to show you if you play your cards differently every playthrough.All this combines to create one of the single greatest RPG's on the PC of all time.

												The Witcher 2 as a game is the meaning of the word progress. Everything from the graphics to the systems behind the game are an amazing feat, one you would expect from a big named developer backed up by a huge budget. The looks of the game are not only unparalleled due to its PC only nature, but also because it presents a world that feels hand crafted. The attention to detail borders on the extreme: the clothes, the houses and buildings, the faces of the characters their weapons and in general every corner, nook and cranny of the world has a distinctive touch. The scenery is simply breathtaking, and if you are like me you will want to make a screenshot out of every frame. It also shows that you don't need an overabundance of browns and blood reds in your palette to show a gritty dark fantasy world. This game shows its maturity not through a pretense of adult topics or over the top action animations, but through a careful use of its elements and by showing the player some respect: yes, you are an adult, and you can handle these topics, because indeed the Witcher's is a dark world filled with conspiracies, racism and characters in between every single shade of gray. It is a living, breathing, unforgiving world.The story is as complex as in the first game, filled with twists and choices that may change the fate of many, and forking paths that make a replay of the game not only encouraged, but required in order to see the extent to which they occur and diverge. Normal and hard difficulties are recommended and will test your skills if you don't face every battle with all seriousness, preparing beforehand by brewing and drinking potions and using all of your abilities during the fight, i.e. your swords your magic signs depending on what enemy you face and traps and bombs for your crowd control.The actual combat is in no way dumbed down. It will still punish you if you go unprepared and you can't mash your way out of battles. It is in much better shape than in the first game, and friendly to both the use of a gamepad or mouse and keyboard. The user interface is slick and great looking.The ending of the game comes abruptly, and you might feel that it doesn't solve every issue the game presents (the main storyline issues ARE solved, though). It is no excuse from what many will consider a downbeat ending, but in all honesty it doesn't detract a single beat from what this game does right, which is almost everything else. Even if you don't like the ending you will feel that the journey was worth it.In the end I feel like I'm required to praise this game so high despite its shortcomings not because it is a perfect game, but because it is an honest one. When more and more AAA releases are done with specific quarters or demographics numbers behind, or executives who never play games are calling the shots, The Witcher 2 really feels developed to please it audience, to show them they too are tired of these.There is a certain level of quality you expect from bigger developers which have more of a history and a name, because they deliver experiences that go way beyond what you might get from the indie guys. It is OK, they have the money and the numbers behind. This is a trend that has been changing in the last years and that no longer holds true in most cases though. In this case in particular neither of these apply. In my mind CDProject RED are already the big name, from whom I will expect unrelenting quality. Because after what they achieved they can't be considered the little guy any longer. With the Witcher 2 they delivered a game that is truly above and beyond any RPG from the last years, that feels like a product of love, careful planning and an overall shout to fans and the gaming community that says ""we know what you want, and we can deliver. Where others have failed you we will prevail."" And God if they don't.A serious contender for the best game of 2011, and frankly there is little in the horizon that looks like it might compete with it. Five years from now when other games made by bigger companies are all forgotten in the $5 bargain bins of the world, many will be reinstalling this game to reminisce and fondly say: ""yes, I played a game was this good in 2011, and it was glorious.""Congratulations CDProject RED, you just released your first masterpiece.

 The story The witcher 2 continues the story from the last games ending, where an assassin attempted to murder the king of Temeria, king Foltest. The assassin was unsuccessful, Geralt murdered the assassin before he could kill Foltest. When Geralt unmasked the assassin he is revealed to be a witcher.There's alot of hatred towards nonhumas in the witcher universe. Many nonhumans flee to the forests to join the Scoia'tael, an army of nonhumans who fight for freedom. In the witcher 2 you will meet a commander of the Scoida'tael, Iorveth. Some time go by. An unkown assassin kills Demavend III, the ruler of Aedrin. Perhaps not the best ruler as he was known for being rather cruel, but also quite intelligent and knowledgeable about the tactics of war. More time go by, Foltest with his army and Geralt at his side, attacks La Valette castle. They are successful in taking over the castle. King Foltest reunites with his two children, Anais and Boussy locked up in a tower, with the help of Geralt. In the tower with Foltest's children is a blind monk. As Anais and Boussy leaves the room, the monk throws off his cape to Murder king Foltest. This time the assassination on Foltest was a success. The assassin is reavealed to be yet another witcher. He flees and jump out of the castle tower. Two soildiers enter the tower only to find Geralt with king Foltest's corpse lying on the ground, Geralt is framed for the murder of the king of Temeria. He is taken to the castle dungeons for interrogation, this is how he meets Vernon Roche, a commander of the Blue Stripes, a special force in the Temerian military. He trusts Geralt and thus he decides to help Geralt find the real murderer. Geralt is still trying to recover his memory which he lost in the beginning of the first game.The dialogue system is very good, the voice acting is superb. It doesn't feel like you're talking to a wall anymore. The graphics The graphics have certainly seen a big upgrade from the first witcher game, it actually looks quite amazing for the time it came out. Characters also look much more unique. They have also added more cutscenes and the animations look very good. The UI has also seen a big upgrade, The UI in the first game was a mess but it looks alot better in the witcher 2. Something i miss with the UI from the original witcher game, is the 3D witcher medallion in the corner, it looked very nice. In the second game it's just 2D medallion next to your health. The sound and music The sound quality is much better than it was in the first witcher game, and of course the music is still amazing, the soundtrack has become one of my favorite soundtracks of all time. The soundtrack is epic and it fits the theme of the game. The gameplay Perhaps one of the biggest changes to the witcher 2 is the new action combat system, the group fighting mode is gone now you can use either fast attacks or strong attacks in battle. They have added rolling and blocking to the combat, the combat is much more fast phased. I have to say i really like the new combat system, its not as frustrating as the first games combat. You still have your magical witcher signs, and this time you have every sign unlocked from the start of the game.There is also a brand new alchemy system, now you can only create and drink potions while meditating, and you can only have three potions active at a time. The potions also last very short, in the first game they lasted for several in-game hours, now they only last 10 minutes. A big problem with this is that potions and other buffs last over cutscenes which means that some potions wear off before a fight, and you can't drink a new one since you're in a fight and you can only drink potions while meditating. The character building is not as good in the witcher 2 as it was in the first witcher game in my opinion. You can however get some quite satisfying finishers. The alchemy tree is not very good, and thats due to the bad alchemy system, so if you're planning to play this game i wouldn't recommend to do an alchemy build as it might not work out so well.The game runs pretty good on my computer, but I have heard of people having optimization issues. I have however experienced a couple of hard crashes and freezes, which is pretty annoying if you haven't saved your game in a while, I learnt that the hard way. Cons and pros  Pros:  Great story, perhaps not as good as the first game but still an amazing story Amazing graphics that look ahead of its time Epic soundtrack that really fits the theme of the game Great sound quality, a big upgrade from the first game Great combat system UI looks way better than it did in the first game Fantastic experience Cons:  The game can be a buggy mess sometimes I experienced some hard crashes and freezes which slowed down the story and led to some frustration The combat can still be very frustrating poor alchemy system  The wicther 2 is shorter than the first witcher gameThe game has its flaws but it's still an amazing game. I'll give an 8/10 to the whole game as I didn't really like the alchemy system nor do I think that the story can match up with the witcher 1 story, but the combat is definitely a big upgrade to the games gameplay and a kick in the right directionThe witcher 2 - trailer

												Don't buy Witcher. Buy Witcher 2. Need explanation? Read on.OK, let's make something perfectly clear. I've spent at least 17 hours in Witcher and although I've recommended it in my Steam review, I don't think too fondly of that game. I've never got through it. Although the story is OK (but not great), I consider Witcher to be ''buy it on sale'' title. Game mechanics are so broken I've lost all of my will to play it. I just couldn't stand it.Although a friend of mine (Witcher fanatic and a gaming journalist), a guy that says Skyrim can suck his balls, recommended Witcher 2 to me on more than a few occasions and although he pointed out the game is different than the first one, somehow I've managed not to get it until this last summer sale. And I didn't buy it this summer, either - this friend bought it for me as an act of protest because I've neglected an awesome game.Did I say awesome? Yes, I DID. Witcher 2 is AWESOME. It goes straight into a Chamber of greatness which includes titles such as Doom II, Duke Nukem 3D, Quake II and Morrowind.Witcher 2 brings an awesome and oh-so-needed upgrade to every single system of Witcher universe. The story gets really suspenful and interesting now, so great it leaves the first one in the dust. It makes it funny. Combat? ♥♥♥♥ing finally. No more mini-games click-on-time attacking that made me so nervous. This is a proper sword-wielding and cast-spelling game. Fighting numerous opponents is a joy now. You can dash and stab almost in perfect harmony; fights in Witcher 2 are soul-soothing experiences. Quest finding and resolving is easier and more logical, menus are no longer a cluttered mess, girls are more naked and dwarves curse and drink like late GG Allin.Witcher 2 is a great, great game that shall be rewarded with a CLASSIC title as the time goes bye. Its living and breathing world will suck you in and you will choose a side. And you'll ENJOY IT.Once again, DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY AND TIME ON WITCHER. Get Witcher 2 and don't let the first game keep you away from this masterpiece.P.S. Dwarves. I love MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING DWARVES!!!***If you like this review, feel free to join me for some more recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/libereviews ",369,92,14,42,49,6,45

												TL;DR version: Despite a rocky start and painful setup (graphics), it won me over within no time. The story is amazing, voice acting is great, maybe not as polished as the Witcher 3, but still great. Playing through this will help understand a lot of things in TW3. Buy it, it's great value for money, especially considering there is a lof of replayability, given the 16 endings based on your choices, and different Acts 2/3.Detailed:Initially almost refunded it. The installation includes a scan for 'optimal' settings, which is completely broken. It was so unoptimised, the motion blur gave me motion sickness... 2-3 hours of my playtime went into that launcher toying with the settings until I got it right. Even though I cover it sufficiently, and should be able to play on max settings, I had to tone down a few things and disable all motion blurs. Boom, now it was playable.The Enhanced edition seems to have the Arena tutorial, which I only used to test my graphics setup to be honest. It's something you may like to skip, pretty awful. I actually used the Prologue as a tutorial, works fine.Combat is a bit clunky, not as polished as in TW3, but after getting used to it...makes sense. The Space key is your friend. The game is not as linear as the first game, but not open world like TW3. You still get plenty of areas to explore and side quests to do. I disliked the carry weight limit, but that can be fixed with mods. Some people dislike the lack of fast travel, I was okay with it. Apart from some mob farming for a certain armor in Act 1 that took forever and Geralt wore the shoes off his feet, there isn't too much tourism.The story is great. Your choices matter, and for some of them there are real repercussions, like SPOILER ALERT the fate of entire kingdoms! Yeah, plural. Intricate story-telling, not too pushy, keeps you interested, although can be confusing at times for people new to the Witcher world. It actually made me buy the books to learn some of the references, so there you go.There are indeed ♥♥♥♥♥houses. I must have paid 2,000+ orens for such services just for the fun of it. Great stuff. There are also other options, ahem, but you'll find that on your own.All in all, it's a great game, if unoptimised for a lot of devices. The story wins you over and it's definitely worth the money. Even better if you buy the game during a sales period, like I did. Will definitely make the TW3 more enjoyable and enhance the experience there. Also ♥♥♥♥♥houses.Buy it.			",29,2,0,3,8,0,2

												I HIGHLY recommend this game as an intro to Witcher 3. Being on sale now for Christmas, it is definitely worth more than $3, make sure to pick it up. The story and lore are hard to get into at first for Witcher noobs, but 2 hours or so in the game immerses you in lore and facts.By far one of the best RPG's out there on the market. Your decisions actually make a diffrence in the storyline and in Witcher 3 ! Choose wisely .... There are no good or bad decisions, only ones t hat test your morale judgment (Which is a huge +, especially since choices actualyl matter). Get this game NOW, do not think about it, do it NOW......Done ? Bought it ? Now enjoy ! Make sure that if you are also picking up Witcher 3, to pick up and play this one first as it provides plenty of lore and background material and is a nice seguey to Witcher 3 !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Witcher 2 improves over the original in almost every way. The combat is the biggest change it’s much better overall.  Just like the first game the story is one of the best stories I have played in a video game, I feel so involved in everything that is happening. The amount of detail in the lore just makes the whole experience very rich. Amazing writing, character depth and voice acting sell these characters as real people. Every character is fascinating and you want to learn more about them and in doing so you become more connected to them. The way the story changes by the choices you make has never been so expansive as it was in this game. One choice in particular about a third into the game changes the outcome in the story completely and it almost becomes two games in one because the outcome is so different between each other they end up being completely different experiences. The only thing that keeps this game from being a 10 is the linearity, it is a very linear experience overall, there isn’t much free roaming you can do it’s only strict linear paths. This is something I know the witcher 3 addresses which I am looking forward to.9/10 (Amazing)			",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												I wanted to like this game, It appeared to be right up my alley and It has everything I love in an rpg but I just couldnt get into it. First of all its hard as hell, thats not necessarily a knock against the game itself but for a casual gamer it surpasses challenging and crosses into the realm of frustrating. The story is compelling but it doesnt draw you(me) in and the characters are kind of bland. Quests are sometimes unessarily confusing (i.e. follow this blood trail....multiple irrelevant blood trails) I would still reccomend this game to rpg players because its well made and has a lot to love (Graphics, intuitive crafting, super customizable player etc.) just not for me personally.

												Right then... I absolutely adore the first Witcher game. It introduced me to the world, lore and books. I expected more awesomeness from the second entry in series. Well, to be honest with you, i am a bit mixed on it. I love the story, the characters, the voice-acting, world, graphics, every little sound, but i can't say the same about combat system. Yes, i have problem with one of the most important part of videogames. Gameplay itself. I feel like i'm just going around this beatiful world on rails, spamming the ""X"" button, occasionally mixing it with ""A"" button to roll away from attacks.I really don't know how to feel about The Witcher 2. I love it, but at the same time, it feels often like a chore to play. Let's just say, don't buy it for gameplay. Buy it for pretty much everything else. If you are a fan of the books or Witcher franchise as a whole... Well, then you have already played this, haven't you... I can't say i don't recommend it, because i love it. But i hate it when it comes to combat. I'm sorry, just buy it for yourself and try it on your own. It's really cheap most of the time.			",1243,366,56,175,146,19,176

												*might contain minor spoilers*Almost 5 years after the release, I finally played Witcher 2. You play as an imprisoned witcher, Geralt of Rivia, who is accused of murdering a king. The game begins with compelling flashbacks in which you storm a castle, and it shows how the murder happened. Through the game, you are chasing the real killer as well as try to recover your memories about the Wild Hunt and Yennifer. You meet interesting characters (some from the 1st Witcher game), and in one point have to choose who will you follow. This changes the story quite a bit (mainly different location in chapter 2), so the game can be enjoyed in the 2nd replay. The game has prologue, 3 chapters and an epilogue, with different maps you cannot return to when you finish the chapter. I don't think you must play Witcher 1 to enjoy it (I didn't finish it for instance). Pros and cons:+ The game still looks very pretty.+ Good voice acting and quality mature dialog (even non clickable npcs ramble when you run by).+ Intriguing main story, the world is rich (although you might get lost with all the different names).+ You can 'steal' anything and nobody will attack you.+ You can sleep with a number of women (there's a cut scene with boobies and booties).+ Sweet soundtrack that fits nicely.+ Not black and white: monsters aren't necessarily bad. You also have a choice to kill or spare     some people which effects the political map of the world.+ You can skip dialogue and cut scenes.+ Some of the quests are very interesting...- ...but some are classic monster slaying type. Either eradicate xxx or you fight through monsters to get to the place, find item etc.- Walking back and forth can be a chore sometimes.- You must meditate to drink potions.- If you are trying to collect materials for crafting weapon/armor, the local shop will have good alternative relatively cheap, which makes crafting undervalued.I cannot really comment about fighting difficulty as I played on easy (focused on the story), but for me, the fighting mechanics were better than in Witcher 1.The game has a few puzzles, but I also cannot comment on difficulty as I was mostly too lazy and just googled correct sequences.All in all, it is a great game which can be bought really cheap on sales. If you haven't played Wild Hunt yet, I think these ~40 hours into Witcher world can be well spent before throwing yourself in the latest installment of the Witcher saga.			",64,16,0,5,5,1,2

												Ah Geralt of Rivia , my favourite character...I know its been a while since the game came out but still I felt the need to write a review, because this game is simply a masterpiece, in every aspect i could think of... so here goes my review: Gameplay For some people the gameplay mechanics are outdated n lots of stuff they complain about, but honesty whats wrong with it? I know the counter is a bit tricky but meh u get to kick everyone's♥♥♥♥♥ what else do you need? and throughtout my experience, i've loved to do every side quest n and explore every area, the gameplay was smooth n entertaining. Graphics Firstly u don't judge a game by its graphics but still I have to say, the game still looks pretty darn good.... n it still looks amazing after all the time thats been passed since its release... Witcher's Story ``SPOILERS`` ``WOSH``WOSH`` BE CAREFUL ( ͡ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) A man seeking for his love, in the process gets blamed for a murder he didn't commit, continues his journey to clear his name and find his love.... damn am I not a fan of these kinds of stories, truly I enjoyed the story to its core, listened to every conversation, made every decision carefully... ah what else can i say, the story of this game cannot be expressed in words, you just have to feel it..Triss the one and only true campainion of Geralt, vowed to stay be his side no matter the circumstances, no matter the pain, no matter the concequences, honestly I feel in love with her...and Triss & Geralt have always been like "" Friends With Benfits "", y u du dis Geralt ;-; Conclusion I'm just gonna say this in the end, if u haven't played this game, get it now.how can u not play this game? seriously buy this game already... the gameplay is entertaining, the graphics are not bad and the story is interesting, keeps u focused , what more do u need?

												Rating: 8/10Overview: Third Person RPGThe Good:+ Making difficult choices is at the heart of the Witcher series, early in the game you must make a choice that completely alters the story and quests providing a very good incentive for a replay. These choices are not black and white, good or evil but often fall in the moral grey area forcing you to really think about your actions. Every choice has good and bad points and often carries consequences with it.  + Well written side-quest that offer multiple ways of completing them. Some side quests span the entirety of the game depending on your choices. + The story is very deep and complex and can be overwhelming given the number of people and locations involved. The story deals heavily in politics and power and those that really immerse themselves in the lore will truly appreciated everything the designers and writers have made.  + 3 skill trees; magic, swordsman and alchemy, each one provides a different way of engaging enemies in battle. + Find items, plants allowing you to craft potions and equipment+ Lots of mods The Average:+/- Combat is much improved over the first game but still feels a bit lackluster compared to other games. You must invest in certain skills for combat to become more flexible.  It isn’t until halfway through the game when you have enough experience points for combat to feel a bit more engaging. You can’t move and block at the same time making it almost pointless to block.   The Bad:- The game does not overwrite any saves, doesn’t matter if its an autosave, manual save or quicksave, it makes a new file for each one. After a few hours of playtime you could have a lot of saves that could cause problems. - This game has a nasty cloud save bug where it no longer works properly causing you to lose many hours of game time. Disabling steam cloud doesn’t seem work and the ‘solution’ to fix this doesn’t always work.  Deleting and reinstalling also didn’t work. Conclusion:A brilliant RPG that isn’t afraid to deal with serious, mature subject matter. Your choices carry a lot of weight making the story feel more impactful. A combat system that takes a while to really feel good and a nasty technical bug holds it back.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2 has well made story and smooth feel to the combat.-There is a lot of lore etc. behind this game and I do expect the story behind this was good, but I personally never played the first Witcher game, and didn't feel the need to. You decide whenever or not you want to know more about the backstory and such or if you want to just jump straight in.Review:All the rolling, swings and magic usage feel incredibly fitting at almost all times which is very rare in a game with swords as well as magic. Sure the enemy lock on system is bad, but otherwise there is little to no complaints to be made. Just remember that you have all the bottles and magic  for a good reason and you will need to use them a lot.Each enemy has their weakness and the combat is extremely hard. (If you are new to gaming, you might want to play on a lower difficulty setting than normal) I am still amazed by the people who beat this game without grinding for money to get better gear at the insane difficulty, just shows how much skill you can gain at this game as I can barely survive the very first moments at the hardest difficulty setting.The world you explore feels very open even though it is as a matter of fact very linear and restricts you to a few chosen paths. It's very fun to explore the maps for items, which are gained trough killing enemies and completing tasks which people give you.They also have this alchemy system in which you craft these potions which give you buffs to help you find items in the environment as well as to help you effectively deal with your enemies.You also have a vast amount of armor, swords and recipes for potions, which some of appear to be behind the wall of rng. While yes it is quite a shame that some equipment may be inaccessable for you, but on the positive side you do get more things if you happen to feel like playing trough the game again.There are also some moments in which you see nudity at, or some small scenes in which you can optionally have sex with other women, just as a small disclaimer in case you did not know this already.Hmm, so the characters do seem to each have a personality which you can really get attached to and you can as a matter of fact interact with a lot with these people besides the NPC's which some of you can interact a little with. But I personally did not like the talking scenes that much at all. Otherwise this game has been a blast to play.Highly recommend it to every person.			",137,17,2,4,10,1,8

												Compare to Witcher1, 2 has a lot more combat actions, you can't just stand still and hit them combos like in 1, Geralt needs to dodge attacks, parry, roll around and stab enemies in the back to gain more damages. The boss fights are even more interesting, you need to use potions, signs, and enhancement smart or you can get stuck at the boss for a long time. For me , it took me almost 1 hour trying to kill that karyan and another 1 hour figuring out how to beat Letho for the first time. Also, weapon choices are super important in 2, so keep in mind you need to constantly upgrade your weapons or you will have a hard time fighting the bosses as you go down the storyline. *SPOILER* For the ones who chose Shanni in 1 like me, she didn't even appeared in 2. Triss is the one always sticks with Geralt.Make sure you watch or fastforward through the credits(somehow i could magicall scroll the credits down real fast using my laptop mouse pad), it just makes you wanna buy 3.Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone who wanna play a great RPG game while enjoying a long movie at the same time.

												Much like its predecessor, The Witcher 2's greatest strengths lie in its storytelling. The characters are deep and flawed and you feel for both the heroes and the villains, the dialogue is at times witty, at times profound, and the twisting, turning intrigue of nefarious plotting, civil war, and the corrupting influence of power is always engaging and motivating. On top of that, TW2 is a vast improvement in terms of visuals, and I dare say it remains one of the best looking games ever made.  But again, like TW1, it's flaws lie in the games technical aspects. The combat system is the most frequent target for criticism, and I must admit, when I first played the game before the balancing was patched it was the single most frustrating experience of my life. Perhaps it was the benefit of hindsight that assisted me, but my second playthrough was a breeze by comparison. In saying that, the combat remains difficult to learn and beginners are unfortunately punished for lacking the clairvoyance to know when one must save before a big battle. Generally speaking, the autosave points are placed a little more kindly than in TW1 and restarts will often only send you back to the start of a fight, but when they don't it can be an annoying experience. There's also a single poorly implimented stealth section towards the start, which again tests the commitment of newcomers. But once you understand that you can dodge-roll infinitely and you put a few points into your skills you'll find that, while not the most elegant system, it's far more interactive than that of TW1 and allows the player to become quite powerful when they get the hang of it. Criticism aside though, I'd say that this is a must-play RPG for any fan of the genre. It streamlines a lot (if not all) of the inconvenient gameplay quirks of the first game, and continues to build on Geralt's epic story in a beautiful and detailed world. I played through both games in preparation for TW3 (come on Steam, discount the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!) and while I felt every one of my 33 hours in TW1, this game never felt like it overstayed its welcome. Ultimately I was sad to see it finish, especially as the last moment of gameplay is a wonderfully powerful emotional climax. I recommend this game at whatever price it's sold for.

INTERESTINGLY-Witcher is about spell casting, dragon slaying, medieval ages.-My love for Witcher starts with (gasp) Witcher 1, and remains LOVE rooted from there, with only a technical appreciation for WITCHER 2, and (wow the graphics) WITCHER 3. (I appreciated the layout of Witcher 1 being simple in its story telling effect, Witcher 2 is definitely a change compared to that, many of my friends may disagree with me saying how much ""better"" Witcher 2 is to Witcher 1, I shall remain unconvinced, I guess its the IMPRESSION it made on me, I wouldn't mind if Witcher 2 were delivered in Witcher 1 format :-)) -Although the genre is loved, to the credit of the series is the voice actor for Geralt, a smooth talking baritone, that may have won easily 30-40% of the core audience loving this game.-I have hated myself for liking WITCHER as; it is fictional, and has little redeeming truth or/& facts in it, rather than being historically based like Assassin's Creed and an educational experience, we gorge on storytelling. The creator of The Witcher is still with us today and though NOT without merit (he has received recognition for promoting Polish culture).GAMEPLAY-The format is much like any Assassin's Creed game, 3rd person and open world. If that's your thing, this is going to be enjoyed by you.-The world is the same as in Witcher 1; the people, the culture, ""the orens"" :-) -I was SO excited learning of the possibility to transfer saves from game to game in the genre (by the time I learned of this Mass Effect was doing so too, :-) I just loved anything to do with Witcher).CRITICISM -If you think I just won't stop praising this game, apart from an obvious comparison with Lord of the Rings, THIS GAME and all Witcher games CONTAIN GRAPHIC CONTENT, unlike and to the credit of LOTR, I would appreciate if there was a setting in our OPTIONS menu we could input that may limit the level of this CONTENT we are looking at without affecting gameplay, HEY, there are some young children looking at  cartoon images here of WHAT, then there's unbridled SWEARING that they are exposed to??!!. I would agree with stricter measures for censorship of the sale of these games to certain age-groups otherwise.  ; in conclusion,I recommend Witcher 2.GAME ON			",906,268,12,52,34,7,57

												The Witcher 2 by CD Projeckt Red review.I will start off by saying that I was late to the Witcher series. (Still haven't played Wild Hunt) With that being said, they are games that should not be overlooked by RPG fans, even though the first 2 are 5+ years old. I played The Witcher about 3 years ago and I wish I would of played it alot closer to my Witcher 2 playthrough because I had forgotten details about some of the previous characters and locations. A quick trip to google cleared up all my confusion and my gameplay experience was great.Story -> 9/10I was fully immersed in the story once I cleared up a few things I had forgotten from the first one. It moves along a steady pace and ramps up to a good finale by Act III. I imported my character from the original which added a few weapons and armour (as far as I could tell) as well as a few references and minor story alterations. There are some very tough decisions to make which can alter the course of the game. The voice acting (English) was a little wooden from some of the characters (Dandelion, Triss and to some extent, Geralt himself) but it didn't diminish my experience any. The dwarves in particuliar were great as they are vulagar as f*** and are always good for a laugh. I am also happy to report not a single character took an arrow to the knee.Sound -> 8/10 [Creative SB X-FI Platinum]The sound effects were very well done, especially in combat. Ambience while walking around really pulls you in. From the idle chatter in towns to the various sounds while out for a stroll in the wild. I found the music score to be great but there was not as many tracks and got a bit repetitive. The music in the taverns is burned into my memory probably forever now.Graphics/Performance -> 9/10 [Asus Maximus VII - 4790K - 16GB 1600MHZ - R9290X Crossfire - Freesync]From a 2011 point of view, the graphics are amazing, from a 2017 point of view.....I still thought the graphics looked great.(Looked better and ran better than Skyrim all modded up) The enviroments were extremely detailed, in particular the forest in Act I. Textures were fairly hi-res and the lighting was very nice. Character models look good and the clothes/armour all looked great. Some minor clipping and characters teleporting around abit but nothing major.From a performance standpoint everything was top notch. The game scaled amazing with multi-gpu, I had no problem maintaining 144 fps. (Dips down to 115-120fps in some places) With that being said I played alot of the game with a single gpu with the framerate locked to 90 fps because my monitor only can run Freesync up to 90hz. If I ran Freesync on with multi-gpu, the framerate would just rocket out of control (sometimes to 200fps) turning my room into a sauna. I ran all settings on max except the Uber setting, which just tanked performance, at 2560x1440 resolution. I experienced about 5 crashes in 45 hours of gameplay which is exponentially lower than the Bethesda games I've played on the same system.Gameplay -> 7/10 [Normal Difficulty]The Good: The overall feel of the game was generally good. I was able to map the keys in a way that I was not fumbling around like some games. The combat was improved from the first one. It feels rewarding as you start to accumulate better talents and equipment. By the end cutting down 6+ enemies at once was easy using a combination of weapons and signs. I didn't use alchemy much as I couldn't be bothered to meditate everytime I wanted to drink a potion. Also it is nice you don't need to be near a fire to meditate anymore.The Bad: The quicktime events are horrible and whoever puts these in the game and continues to use them to this day should be shot. I was kind of let down by some of the mini games, especially the dice, you can't win!!! The economy is sort of crappy. I found a rare elven sword and I went to sell it and I was given enough money to buy 5 apples from another vendor. WTF? If you are a completionist and need every book and every crafting diagram (which I will do on another playthrough) you better enjoy killing harpies for hours on end. Money is scarce. I believe there is a mod for it which I may use on my second playthrough.Conclusion -> 8.5/10I would recommend this game to anyone that even had their eye on it in the slightest. You can always pick it up for cheap. Halfway through the first act I realized I should had the difficulty alot higher since normal was a leisurely stroll. I put 45 hours in one playthrough and like I said I never went through it with a fine toothed comb. I see myself putting one maybe two more playthroughs so I could easily have over 100hours in it before I never look at it again. I recommend play the first Witcher prior to playing this one because it sets up the world and events happening. I felt that this game felt smaller in scale compared to the first Witcher. I felt that way about Mass Effect 2 & 3 as well. But still, 45 hours for a game I probably paid 5 bucks for on a Steam sale is great value. Now on to The Wild Hunt!!! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: RPG; Mature; Adventure; Fantasy; Choices Matter  My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 30-70 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWThe Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition provides a great experience, and tells a captivating tale... although it has a somewhat bland and frustrating combat system.  The game boasts a myriad of mature themes and storylines, and it is very enjoyable for those who appreciate impactful decision-making in their games.  However, the sheer magnitude of the game may cause it to drag a bit for completionists.This game is absolutely beautiful.  The story is deep, rich, complex and mature.  The world feels immersive and lived in.  There are sufficient RPG elements (crafting, items, leveling, spells) to appease any fan. In order to experience everything in the branching storyline, you will need to play through it a few times… or at least play through sections of the game a few times to see the results of different decisions.  The combat is probably the weak point of the game, as it is pretty bland and on higher difficulties can be frustrating.  You may want to consider playing on a low difficulty to just enjoy the story and avoid frustration.  If you can afford both the time and the money, I suggest you play the first one through at least once before playing this.  Or at the very least read a synopsis of the plot of the first game.There are dozens of aspects I could go into detail describing when it comes to The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition, but it doesn’t seem necessary.  If you are a fan of epic RPGs with dark, immersive stories and captivating atmospheres then you will most likely enjoy this.  If you are someone who has trouble getting invested in story-driven, slow-paced experiences, then you may want to look elsewhere for your next game.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												I'm amazed. I finally found the time to start playing this game and I'm glad I did. I was of course expecting it to be good, maybe a bit mediocre compared to TW3, but to my surprise it never felt that way. It holds up better than I expected. While it did take time to grow on me, I still enjoyed almost every second of the ride. I ADORED the story. Especially near the end, it was even more engaging than TW3 at certain points. If you haven't played it yet, I highly recommend you do. Its length is on the shorter side if compared to the Witcher 1 and 3. It took me about 35 hours to finish it while doing all the side quests available. But I think I'm going to replay it to see the outcome of different choices. The game also fills the gap between the books and the games, they're actually tied together way more than I thought.			",12,1,0,7,1,0,1

												An awesome RPG with beautiful gameplay, graphics, characters and storyline. If you didn't play the first chapter then i suggest you to play it before you start this game, since it will give more background about the story. You will be required to make choices, like who you want to ally with, or who you will want to kill, but to be honest i hoped for a more variety of choices since there aren't many overall. Also i wish the game had better longevity, i have done it in around 25 hours on the hardest difficulty, including all side quests, but i guess the game deserves a second playthrough making different choices to fully enjoy all the content. Overall i really recommend this game for any RPG lover, and for who wants a more mature game than the vast majority of RPGs around.			",15,9,1,2,6,0,6

 The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition  The Witcher 2 is an amazing production that I finished a couple of times and I had a lot of fun at the same time. In game we play as a Geralt of Rivia who, along with Triss Merigold serve the king Foltest. The story is divided into three acts and an epilogue in which we will visit four different locations depending on our choices. As for choices there is a large amount of them and they will have affect on the whole world and on the storyline of The Witcher 3. According to me, this is a must have for those who intend to play the third part. Cool story, choices, soundtrack, locations, graphics and combat system are well made. The production is worth the time and money. Especially that it can be cheaply purchased on steam sales.  ",442,96,20,45,31,7,33

												Pinning down precisely what makes the world of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings so enthralling took me some time. It's not that the fiction is particularly ""mature,"" though that's undoubtedly a term that will be tossed around until the next hyper-gritty fantasy game pops up. Think about it for a second: The Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, is a crag-faced, cat-eyed, gravelly-voiced mutant hardass who only stops screwing and fighting when occasion calls for a philosopher, at which point he dutifully duels scholars and monarchs with a tongue as sharp as either of his two swords. He is a character straight out of a 15-year-old boy's misused English notebook; the wounded warrior poet who, by the way, gets all the consequence-free sex he can handle, since he's totally shooting blanks, bro. And sure, he's stoic -- but he's also got a sensitive soul somewhere beneath that scar-laden chest of his, damn it.No, what makes the Witcher's world so absorbing is an amazingly cohesive and consistent visual vocabulary that is -- and I know this is going to sound ridiculous -- far more logical than is typical for fantasy games. The impoverished fishermen of the riverside village of Flotsam shuffle around in nothing but ruddy underwear. Dumpy town guards patrol in filthy rags that still bear their national colors. Ornate attire is (for once) consigned solely to the upper class. Buildings look planted and properly dilapidated. This may seem a small thing, but from the first minutes of the game, it's clear how much effort has gone into researching how a society like the one portrayed would look; this medieval civilization, infused with -- but not dominated by -- magic and mystery (props to developer CD Projekt), is just awesome.Similarly impressive: the degree to which the story changes based on your actions. Game makers (and publishers, and shareholders, and preview writers) love to crow on about choices and consequences. Hell, if you buy the PR spin, every single BioWare game in the past decade has been a watershed moment for cause and effect in video game storytelling. But frankly, the lofty language usually leads to a letdown -- the best we usually get are mundane tics on a morality slider that may or may not unlock a new dialogue tree, or perhaps a new companion somewhere down the road. I'd go so far as to argue that the only stable of games that's been quietly, consistently offering a serious set of genuinely game-altering forks-in-the-road for nearly a decade now is Acquire's Way of the Samurai series.Not anymore.While we have the underlying storyline of murder, intrigue, and (more stupidly) amnesia to which The Witcher 2 continually returns, the minutiae is wholly malleable. The allies Geralt makes on his journey and the enemies he combats shift with your mood swings; larger decision points alter the landscape of the world dramatically, but even minor events can cause repercussions much later in the game -- and how the whole thing ends is entirely your choice. Reading after-action reports from fellow players is like a game unto itself. Nobody seems to experience quite the same scenarios.Not all is well in the Pontar Valley, however. Combat, for instance, is a serious problem made even worse by a poorly implemented, obscenely difficult and unhelpful opening segment. Plow into battle unprepared, and you might as well expect the worst: Even on moderate difficulty levels, this is not a game in which potential sources of aid can be ignored. Traps, bombs, magic, daggers, pre-battle potions... every tool in Geralt's arsenal is an absolute necessity.Once I got the basics down, the extremely acrobatic, constantly active feint-and-parry style of Witcher warfare became seriously enjoyable -- just don't expect the prologue section to teach you much of anything valuable. And even when I finally felt like a proper monster-hunting mutant badass, I occasionally came across the rare room or fight so absurd that I had to wonder if CD Projekt understood the limitations of its own combat system. Geralt in a room too cramped to allow for falling back and trap placement? Battles before which you have no time to meditate and drink potions? No thanks.Worse still, the user interface only exacerbates the combat system's flaws by forcing the player to keep an eye on everything but the melee itself. Geralt's vigor (read: mana) meter, health meter, buff/debuff indicators, and equipped spells/items are all scattered across the screen, which is a serious drawback when you're surrounded by screeching harpies.But not even a terrible introductory sequence can take away from what is otherwise a fantastic game. Sure, the story is goofy, and at times the fighting is offensively clunky. The world isn't as colossal as the first Witcher's, and the ending is a bit of a tease. But in a time when I rarely bother to finish single-player games, I'm happy (and slightly embarrassed) to say that I'm already several hours into a second playthrough of Assassins of Kings. And I can't think of a better compliment than that.Pros:Engrossing worldstory has more branches than a sycamoretechnically astonishinggreat voice acting.Cons:Combat takes getting used to and never becomes fantasticpacing problemstoo many quick-time events.My Rating: 9.2/10 ",807,308,49,101,97,14,113

												The Witcher 2 is a sequel to CRPG's The Witcher . The game sets after the Witcher timeline (No spoilers, just in case). You play as Geralt of Rivia, a monster-for-hire. He was framed for murdering the king, so he had to clear his name somehow. It is your choice how you play and how you interact to people. Story is what this game more interesting. Once, you have made the decision, it affects the environment, also the characters as well. The atmosphere is based on Medieval structure (I think).+ Pros + Great Story + Import Save file from Witcher to Witcher 2 + Dark and violent side quests + Atmosphere + Graphics (not bad for 2011 game) + Story about under 50 hours (Replayability available) + Characters- Cons - Combat seems to be repetitive (dodge rolls, slashes animation) - Consuming potions by meditating - Skill trees - Slight steep curve on controls - Messy User Interface (UI) - Crafting seems to be dodgy (because of picking up sums of any particular ingredients)This game is recommended if you are insist to play the game. It is enjoyable game but the combat seems to be mashing clicks and space button to dodge. I forgot to mention how messy the game's UI is. Overall, it's a great game to play.Updated: 13 Apr @ 10:21am: adding the Messy User Interface (UI) for Cons and headlining the Pros and Cons			",48,3,0,9,2,0,0

												Very very fun! Better then the first one if you ask me. The controls are better, being in conbat is actualy pleasing now, and the quests are very fun too. Altho, if you spent a long time doing all the side quests, you might want to just rush to last chapter part because you just start losing interest in the game by time point.9/10 ENjoy ^-^			",251,102,1,77,43,1,40

												I highly recommend this game and this is why:Storyline:The storyline is packed with distrust, politics and personal agendas which I found very interesting. Every character had their own ambitions, attitudes and reason for their actions. I found that I either liked or was undecided about a character, with a few characters that I hated. The storyline flowed well and almost every side quest made sense given the situation that the character was in. You even had some sidequests were you had to track creatures nest and blow them up which was fun and a different version to the usual kill x collect x formula . You were able to make multiple choses in the game and almost every chose matter towards either the main storyline or a sidequest and possibly both. Many of the choses that you choose from had its positive and negatives. You rarely got an option that seemed like the best option but more like 3 or 4 options that could be good but also could be bad. I like this and made me think of what option I should choose. Some warning there is a lot of dialogue about the political issues of Geralt's world and they do shoot out a lot of names which may push some people away. But if your intrigued about  political struggles, regicide, betrayal, mystery and even some romance then you will love this storyline. Gameplay:Utterly love the gameplay. It is an action rpg with a skill tree, some what, similar to diablo or other action rpgs. But the overall gameplay is different then your typical action rpg where you kill a huge mobs of monster one right after the other. In this game you do more exploring around and talking to people than killing creatures. But when you do kill creatures they are incredibly dynamic battles were you have options on how you want to kill your foe. Do you want to ensare the creature in a trap and stab it with you sword or do you want to shock it with a bomb and run in for the fatal blow. Also you do not stand their and fight the monster exchanging blows, no you try to dodge or parry the blows so you don't get killed because you can be overwhelmed in the game pretty easily if your not careful. Oh but dont forget your potions. There is an alchemy system where you can make potions using herbs that you find in abundance in the wild as well as oils and poisons that can be added to your weapon for a short period of time. These potions will increase your stats, or allow you to see in the dark, some even give you advantages at a cost of another stat being reduced. These potions are extremely helpful and usually only last around 5 to 10 minutes unless you have some points in the alchemy skill tree. Potions can only be used before a battle starts and you have a limit on how many potions you can drink. So I enjoyed thinking about what potions I should use and when I should use them. You are also capable of creating bombs, traps, armor and weapons which I have seen before, but still adds something to the game, especially the bombs and traps. Graphics:The graphics is just amazing for its time and I was suprised at the differences between the looks of some characters that were from the first Witcher game. I also liked how original the creatures looked  in comparison to many other games I have played. This difference added to the dark tone of the game quite well. The graphics made exploring around a lot more enjoyable overall. Replayability:There is some good replay value to this game. There are several different difficulty levels that you can play on, and the storyline branches out in two different ways. Therefore, you will have to play the game again to see the other part of the storyline that you missed the first time. There are also differences in sidequests depending on which storyline branch you choose as well as different results to the side quests depending on your choices.Cons:Yes, like all games there are some cons to this game. The big one is... the map. It might just be me but I found the map to be utterly confusing to understand.  Some things on the map that looked like walls ended up not being walls and other parts of the map that didn't look like walls ended up being walls. I was playing on the controller and there seemed to be no shortcut button to see the bigger version of the map, you had to open up the selection menu and press map every single time which got on my nerves a bit. Another con to this game is the game's inability to work properly. Sometimes the game would either slow down making gameplay difficult or just crash. Also this issue could very much be an issue with my computer and not the game. Another issue I had with the game was although the towns were well thought out and dynamic the same people walking around kept saying the exact same two or three lines every single time you would pass by them, unless you were having a conversation with them. Next time I hope that the people have atleast a few more lines that they could say.  So overall, this is a great game that you should play to get prepared for Witcher 3, which looks amazing.

												For me, Chapter 2 made this whole game. I made some poor decisions that caused me to likely not get enough out of Chapter 3 than I otherwise would have had I made better decisions so that's on me. I may make another pass at it in the future. Started out with the tutorial, which cause me to get discouraged because I couldn't get past it either, lol. But this game is overall worth playing because chapter 2 is so good. I would have liked to see a bit more in most aspects of this game such as more weapons, armor, stats, character levels, side quests and so on. Not much money to go around but its enough to buy everything you need. But I understand this was only one step in the overall story that I will likely continue in Witcher 3. NPC banter is fairly entertaining. Loved the LOTR references that they all have a laugh at. Not much more entertaining than midevil sex talk either. Ploughing was a word that took me a second to understand that that's what they really meant. Just keep small children away here, gets much more graphic than just talking (depending on whether you have Geralt sleep around or not, I was fairly promiscuous). Great experience for the most part.			",23,0,4,2,6,0,2

												The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is an example of a video game that was made as a labor of love. The developers of this game have created one of the best RPGs that I've ever played. The combat in this game is a vast improvement over the first game and feels very fluid. The characters are very well thought out and I can relate and connect to many of them. The storyline is one of those that makes me forget about everything else and focus on it with great intensity.			",159,43,0,37,17,0,18

												Долго я воротил нос от серии Ведьмак. Потом от скуки с играл в первую, которая понравилась. Вторая часть, просто гигансткий скачок вперед. Я потратил 44 часа на прохождение игры. У меня не разу не было чувства, что меня задолбали однотипные занятия. Потому что их нет, все уникальны. Для примера можно взять Ubisoft со своими играми с открытым миром. Я только поэтому не играю ни в Ассасина, ни в Фар край. Тебе обещают 40 часов геймплей из них только 5 часов, что то интересного. В ведьмаке такого нет. Все сделано на высшем уровне. Интересная не линейная история, приятная музыка, отличный геймплей и конечно же ГРАФООН =) Не знаю, кто занимался русской локализацей, но к ней не подкапаешься. Актеры подобраны хорошо и говорят реалистично. Единственный минус в том, что, то что я делал в первой части, никак не повлияло на вторую, ну вроде только броню дали и все. Я теперь понимаю, почему для третьей части не будут делать дрм защиту. Такую качественную игру стыдно качать с торрентов. Вообщем очень жду финала и охота узнать, чем все закончилось. Обязательно куплю =)			",484,112,15,52,30,5,54

Posted: February 26, 2015
												When I played the Witcher 1, I enjoyed it, but felt it had some annoying bits which unfortunately lessened the overall experience.In The Witcher 2, almost anything I was bothered with before is fixed. The combat is much improved. It's not perfect, but it's an solid improvement. There's also a mod out there that changes the combat fairly significant, for better or for worse.The story is awesome, although I feel the first one had more of an impact. It starts right after the first one but it gives enough info to still get the general gist of the story. I still highly recommend you play the first game since it's still a good game and you won't get lost here.The graphics are amazing. It's really jaw-dropping, especially once when you realize that it came out in the same year as Skyrim. It's simply stunning. Ubersampling is nice as it makes the obvious aliasing disappear, but it taxes even my GTX 970. You may prefer turning it off completely and dealing with the aliasing or using SweetFX.The music was less memorable to me than the first one. There wasn't anything I really particularly liked, but in general it's acceptable. The music might be the weakest part of the game for me, it just wasn't really noteworthy. It's not bad, but compared to the Witcher 1 it's meh.The content in this game is huge. I've played it twice as much as I have the first game. Without spoiling anything, you have to make a significant choice at a certain point which changes the game so much it's as if it's completely new. While there's still no jumping, and some invisible walls, they never irritated me in my playthrough. The maps are so large and the motion of climbing and descending cliffs are fluid. Signs and potions were a much bigger deal in this game than the last. I played it on normal difficulty, and while not as hard as Dark Souls, without a proper strategy and using brewing potions you're going to die...very easily.One noteworthy con is that the skill tree alchemy is useless. There's a limit to the number of skill points you get, and you'd much rather spend them on tangible things that affect your overall combat skills, not potions. Similarly, I probably used only one mutagen in the whole game. There's a wide range of weapons and armor in the game, so you won't really need to buy from merchants. You'll likely want to craft them yourself, or find good ones through quests and loot. Also this is personal preference but I found a gamepad to be better than KB+M, ignoring the inventory which is good with a KB+M, but annoying with a controller. I'd constantly unequip my boots when using one and found it really hard to manage my stuff. I still enjoy using a KB+M, although I think I prefer a controller with this game.It's a really solid game that any RPG fan should at least try. The environment is vast so you won't feel restricted even if it's not open world. The combat is good, not Dark Souls level but not Skyrim level either. Story is excellent as expected, with minor hiccups here and there.Although I feel like it's a great game, it's not perfect. Replayability is low for those who don't like seeing the same story again and combat can be tedious and downright frustrating at times (Not to mention targeting sucks).You'll want to save often as dying can send you way far back but too many saves causes frequent crashing. There's no way to move quicker, no sprinting or mounts. There's rolling, but it can't be done in areas like towns where they don't want your sword out. I also think the general atmosphere in the Witcher 1 was better, it had a darker and more serious tone although quite bleak.And...let's not forget the existence of the Witcher 3. I'll say this, play this game before TW3. TW3 is more of an improvement from TW2 to there compared to TW1 to TW2, and that's saying something. TW3 is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ masterpiece, better music, visuals, gameplay, story and pretty much everything. Playing this and TW1 will make your TW3 experience that much better.			",107,5,0,16,5,0,4

												Let me begin by first congratulating you on clicking this wonderful game. Kudos to you. Let me next congratulate you for looking at the reviews of this game, as rightly you should. Now let me slap you in the f*cking jaw for clicking on ""Negative Reviews"". Entrance a little too strong? Well consider it a wake up call.If you have played many an RPG and completed it with a lingering craving for depth and lore, then this game is your healing salve. This game has some of the richest storytelling I have ever had the pleasure of being part of, paired with it's sheer beauty and somewhat impressive mod support, you can not go wrong with this purchase. The voice acting is on point, similar to that of Fable, with its regional 'Typically British' dialect which is laced with humour and one-liners. The gameplay, whilst some suggest is 'clunky', works well considering the type of game this is. The graphics are demanding, but if you have the power to run this at high settings, they will leave you awestruck. The storyline is fresh and cleverly written (with enough room for plenty of side quests), and although it seems typically linear, the areas you visit are open enough to allow you to breath. The game is without a doubt targetted at a more mature audience, with an abundance of nakedness particularly from the female cast (which is brilliant for us single men - am I right?!) as well as a great deal of 'curse' words throughout. I can not say exactly how to play this game, nor can I elaborate on how much you will enjoy it - you quite literally just have to sit down and indulge its richness and take your time, let yourself break away from the quest grinding, go explore, talk to NPC's, loot houses, do some crafting... whatever it is you take delight in, just... do it. Its simple, and your decision to purchase this game should be too. The negative reviews that flood this page genuinely are talking out of their ars*s, their play time alone is enough to suggest they havent actually PLAYED the game. They have obviously gotten past the tutorial and cried because everything wasn't handed to them on a silver plate. For roughly the 6th time now I've seen this game go on sale for less than £5... If you are worrying about ""wasting"" £5 then you have issues. Seriously, you could find that on the street. Or you could go busking for an hour, whatever. Buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Definitely one of my most favorite games of all time and the best RPG EVER. In The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings you play as Geralt of Rivia, a legendary Witcher, based on the novels of Andrzej Sapkowski. Witchers are monster slayers for hire, with their mutated bodies and skills they wipe out monsters for a pay. But in this saga Geralt tries to regain his memory which he lost when fighting the Wild Hunt. (Read novels or play TW1/2 to know more about the story) on his way he has to deal with choices that have influence on your progess in the game.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROS+ Beautiful breathtaking graphics+ Epic long and interesting story+ Non-linear gameplay+ EXTREMELY immersive atmosphere+ Choices are important, in the game you always have the possibility to make choices you like and they all have their different consequences.+ Awesome soundtrack+ Interesting sidequests, unlike other RPGs or games these sidequests will totally not get you bored.+ Great and original characters+ Possibility to lay traps and hunt+ Different Monsters are spread throughout every location+ You are able to explore caves, areas, forests, etc+ Dynamic combat, dodging and attacking on the right time is VERY important. + Alchemy, you can craft potions and enhance your weapons in order to prepare for a battle.+ Really nice boss battles+ Skill tree that has 4 different ways with useful abilities, Training, Swordmanship, Magic, Alchemy+ Huge arsenal of weapons, magic light armor to heavy, obtainable through sidequests, lootable chests, barrels, etc throughout the whole world, even forgeable with the right materials and diagrams!+ Steam trading cardsCONSThis game totally has NO cons at all. I will just state some stuff that might be a con to other people. But in my opinion this game is way too perfect to have cons.- It really seems complicated in the beginning but you'll get used to it, dont give up to fast. (You'll understand what I mean if you play the game for the first time)- The combat system is not like your average RPG game, it has special and dynamic mechanics. Every enemy has a different pattern and the way you approach it is very important. Dont start rushing to kill your enemy, block and dodge till you learn how he moves and attacks. And maybe which magic is fatal to him. Even when playing it at easy mode you will struggle at a certain moment. Even I, myself, had died a couple of times at a boss battle because of not being serious and not knowing his pattern and style.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I double-recommend you this game, you'll totally fall in love with it. TW2 is a huge improvement to TW1, you can start at TW2 since you get the storyline told of TW1. TW3 is coming in May so while you are reading this review dont hesitate to get TW2 and prepare yourself for the third saga of The Witcher after you finished this game. The atmosphere, characters, maturity, choices (Which are VERY important to a lot of people, no one likes scripted stories and wants it their own way while they progess through the game) and many other stuff makes this game so special. This game is totally a must have for RPG lovers, even if you never tried RPGs or dont like them then try this one. Its worth the money and wont disappoint you.			",230,46,5,18,20,0,14

												This review will not be kind, and I will be covering nothing but its flaws. If you're looking for someone to sing The Witcher 2's praises, there is nothing for you here. Just downvote me and move on.After spending 31 hours playing this game, I am finding it extremely hard to understand why this game and the developers (CDPR) are seen as some sort of hallowed, sanctified version of perfection and PC development done right. CDPR (and this game specifically) are brought up as a shining beacon almost every time there is a discussion about other devs making stupid decisions (whether it's QTEs in Tomb Raider, or devs not optimizing for the PC platform, etc), and I honestly could not tell you why.I really tried to like this game. I REALLY did. I played the vanilla version, and when I found the combat to be impossibly clunky and frustrating, I downloaded the Full Combat Rebalance mod, which definitely fixed the combat but unfortunately didn't fix any of the rest of the clunky, frustrating base game.-The texture work is distractingly disjointed (with awesome high-res textures right next to disgustingly cheap ones). Overall the game looks good, but why put hours and hours into an awesomely-done texture, and then stick it next to an asset ripped from Mario Kart 64?-The dialog is well-acted but was recorded at seemingly random volumes. Two characters talking calmly when all of a sudden one of them is talking REALLY REALLY LOUDLY, BUT STILL IN A NORMAL VOICE. It is beyond weird, and ridiculously lazy/shoddy.-The story is political intrigue by everyone towards everyone, secretly involving everyone. It gets UNBELIEVABLY tiresome, and you stop being surprised by it halfway through. Twists stop being interesting when that's all there is.-Dialog-based intimidation and charm are always successful (at least for me) so there's really no reason for them to even be there.-EVERYTHING is pre-scripted. fist-fights are QTEs, story battles that are supposed to be time-based will continue until you kill X number of enemies, and even WALKING THROUGH A DOOR is a scripted event. No loading screen, just stand in front of door and press X, Geralt centers himself against the door, opens it and goes through, and closes it behind him. Repeat for EVERY character! If you have a group of 5 guys, each individual one centers themselves, opens, walks through, and closes. Unimportant, sure, but it is SO HIDEOUSLY STUPID, and would be SO easy to fix.-Story fights that need to be repeated over and over and overandoverandoverandover.-Speaking of fights: Combat ends up being a slash or two and a sign or two, followed by 27 rolls around the arena while your signs recharge and the enemies un-bunch. Repeat for 40 minutes.-You cannot walk freely. You can't jump, and can only climb in pre-ordained places. You can only jump down in pre-ordained places. The whole thing is SUPER stuffy, and this game does NOT deserve to be called ""open-world"" at all.Ugh, there are so many more things that I could not stand about this game, but I'm done spending time on this ""review"" so I'll stop.If you've made it this far, it's worth saying that the game is not TERRIBLE. If you can put up with its problems, you might enjoy it. I, however, had been lead to think that it was a fantastic world-changing game, and when it turned out to be merely a good game marred by frustratingly stupid design decisions, I was beyond annoyed. Combat was a let-down, the plot was a let-down, movement in the world was a let-down, etc.I have been a PC gamer all my life. My Dad bought me the full version of Doom when I was 8. I cracked Dark Forces to work without the CD when I was 10. I've played Strife, Ultima Underworld, Wing Commander, Earthsiege & Mechwarrior, Jedi Knight, all the Descents (including both Freespaces), etc.I have ALWAYS loved the PC, but this latest brand of blind fanboyism just because some dev shows 12% more attention to the platform? I want none of it. Either a game is good because it's good, or it's bad because it's bad. THERE ARE NO OTHER QUALIFYING FACTORS. I wanted to love this game, but I couldn't even like it. 31 wasted hours. Fool me twice, CDPR.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I had to use an xbox 360 controller to enjoy the game, it is a ery solid RPG. The story telling is solid and original. The game starts out on rails but opens up a lot. The bulk of the gameplay is town-base with surrounding countryside questing. The player decides what objects to pursue and how to develope his charcter.  THe towns are just the right size and have interesting npcs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I only discovered The Witcher due to the extensive media buzz aroudn the third. Not wanting to leave empty handed during the Summer sales I decided to see what the buzz was and picked up the second for £2.First impressions are good, the game looks like it has a massive world and story to discover with graphics that suit the scope it aims for. It's nice to feel early on that I'm not missing out by not playing the first game, picking up the basics as I go, learning a bit about the main character Geralt as I play.For an older game the graphics are brilliant, showing Skyrim up for what period pieces should look like when money is spent wisely. The game runs at high settings on my machine, the ultra for the first time seem to run awfully, though I'm hesitant to just blame the game rather my PC showing it's limits finally. The landscapes are fantastic, big broad views and draw distance keep the world wide open. Character models look great though the voice acting sometimes drag it all down into parody territory.However the controls, combat and UI are just short of disgusting. The layout of the buttons is annoying on keyboard, using Alt to aim while trying to cycle to 'R' or 'E' to parry and press the mouse button to attack, he's not the quickest at reacting to the key presses so it becomes tiresome fast. Switch to a controller and discover the preset key bindings are barely configured, these can't be changed in game so you have to exit if you want to correct them. The fighting itself is slow and calculating, opting for a more realistic approch with two main options to fight, strong attack or light attack. Then there's powers to be used, traps/ranged attacks and an option to attack after a parry. It feels like everyone had an idea on what the Witcher fighting should be like and no ones ideas were shot down.Walking feels cumbersome and janky, it works but there's something odd about it. Perhaps it's the camera that doesn't really attempt to follow the character in any decent fashion, often gifting you the view of the back of a bush while you struggle to fit a small army. There's no jump feature either so the world has a very linear feel, restricting you to a set level.The UI is horrible at best, an entire screen filled to the brim with all kinds of options, inventorys and menus. There's no realy layout scheme that makes any sense, compared to Skyrim or other RPG's that utilise all of it's features in a nice easy to view way. Crafting, levelling up, sub levelling up and this weird power menu and another power wheel where you can take a nap or quick view your weapons all feel like over kill, you don't need to add that many features. I honestly can't be bothered to learn it all, I want to immerse myself in the world not get bogged down trying to earn my degree in Witcher menus.Overall, this is much more beautiful than Skyrim ever was and the story is engaging. However the actual gameplay drops this title into Two Worlds territory for me. Absolute ambivelance I'm happy to part with £2 for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great place to enter into the Witchers gaming history.The game has aged suprisingly well and carries the same great plot choices/storlines the series is known for.The combat has a steeper learning curve than 3 and many people prefered this old system.Either way - It's dirt cheap on special and shouldn't be missed if you loved The Witcher 3.

												The Witcher 2: A.O.K. is a linear, chapter based story game inwhich you to decide the fate or future through the choices you make throughout your journey, that's as straight forward as it can get.Aspects of Witcher 2 Worth Praising● The Ability To Save Wherever. Sadly not many games allow you to save on your own time and it's certainly appreciated at least by me when a developer includes it. You can save anywhere when you're not in combat or a cutscene.● Unique Outlook Through Different Eyes. One unique aspect of the Witcher 2: A.O.K. is that  throughout the game you're able to play as different characters and the choices you choose with those characters greatly impacts the story.Aspects of Witcher 2 Worth Criticizing● Quick Time Events. An overwhelming majority of quests involving melee combat include this ""mechanic."" I've said it time and time again, quick time events are not a valid combat mechanic and only conceal the developers incompetence.● Lack of Game Funtionality. You can't swim or jump in the Witcher 2: A.O.K. and there's invisible barriers preventing you from falling or going more than knee deep in water.● Can't Rebind Particular Keys. In the Witcher 2: A.O.K. you use Mouse1 to activate doors, talk to people, light torches, fight, climb up or down ledges, and quick time events; pretty much the majority of things in this game. This is ridiculous as you constantly swing your sword or light a torch when you want to open a door.For a linear chapter based game that heavily uses cutscenes, I enjoyed traveling through the game and felt the story was an interesting experience; I'll recommend the Witcher 2.

												To start with I must say that Witcher 2 is the best RPG I have ever played and one of the best games out there. It is an absolute masterpiece of a game with an awesome storyline, graphics that stay beautiful and full of detail throughout  the game, interesting characters and a fun and exhilarating combat.The story is an exceptional beauty throughout , with moral choices that effect small changes like killing a character or letting them go, and huge changes that effects the entire story and leads you on different paths and goals. the game is full of cleverly thought out and designed quests, from the wonderfully interesting main plot to side quest that'll have you finding and killing ghosts , solving crimes and if you don't want to go out and discover the mysteries beyond the walls you can stay in at the tavern and earn yourself money by gambling on fights or competing in them .  The combat can be quite challenging and can require preparation like the placement of traps, the drinking of potions that will increase weapon damage , health and many more and covering your weapons in oil and poison so the sword deals more damage and has effects. This all has to be done before combat so the player must cleverly think and path his next battle. once mastered the combat is a very fun and accelerating departure from other games combats that involves hacking and slashing by simply mashing a single button till the target is dead.The Graphics are a outstanding astonishment ( on maxed out anyway) , with an unbeatable lighting effect and texture that doesn't get poorer and poorer  the closer you get to it and focused on, the games textures stay amazing throughout . overall Witcher 2  is an incredible game and if you have a powerful enough rig it can be an amazingly beautiful one as well, with a different but fun and creative combat and a cleverly written and presented story  Witcher 2 is a master piece of a game and without a doubt is worth buying .   	Just a little something to add this game can be made even better or made different by adding these two mods that can be found on the Witcher 2 nexus. ( There are other mods but these are the most effective and a thrill to use.) Rise of the Sword - this mod changes and adds in a huge amount of features that includes changing the shop to buy new and epic items and changing the combat to use more attacks and most importantly the ability to change and customize the camera to have it be where ever you want it to be. ( doesn't have to be but would recommend playing the game through and then playing it again on a second play through with this mod installed to get the full effect and fell the difference.)       http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/672/?tab=1&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fwitcher2%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D672%26preview%3D&pUp=1Extreme Quality Flora v1 - This mod Dramatically increases grass , trees and moss rendering distance. it also increases the detail on bushes , shrubs and trees and most importantly Grass pop-in is completely eliminated. ( this is a huge recommend if the grass pop in is annoying anyone and you simply want the game to look even more better.)http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/653/? ",220,17,3,26,11,2,12

												The witcher 2 is set in a fantasy medieval world inspired by polish and Russian mythology and based on Andrzej Sapkowski’s books. You play as Geralt of rivia, a witcher. Witchers are white haired mutants engineered to be professional monster slayers and are generally feared and looked down upon by regular people, Geralt uses two swords, a silver sword to fight monsters and a steel sword for humans. Because the game is a direct sequel the opening prologue puts you right into the action and new players to the series can get a little lost, however you don’t need to play the first game to fully understand what is going on, plus the witcher 2 has an extensive journal with all the information. The prologue starts off with Geralt imprisoned after being framed for assassinating the king during a siege, he’s being interrogated by the kings special forces and you play through his memories as he explains what happened during the siege. Later you manage to escape from the prison and your quest to clear your name and find out who’s really behind the series of assassinations begins. The story will take you to a number of different kingdoms and cities and you’ll meet lots of very interesting characters, how different events happen during the story is based on the decisions you make, As the story goes on the plot gets deeper and deeper, and the bigger picture becomes clearer ,who will geralt save? who will he kill? who’s side will he choose? the faith of entire kingdoms can be directly or indirectly be affected by the choices you make, the line is blurred between pure good or evil and there’s no clear morality, you do what you think is best, sometimes choosing the lesser evil in the name of the greater good, The role you play in the game has a very heavy effect on the story. The game has 16 very different endings and fully completing it will take you around 40 hours. Also i have to mention the game and story touch on drugs, murder, torture,♥♥♥♥♥♥ incest, racism, nudity and more, however they all fit very well into the witcher universe and make the game feel very realistic and mature. If i was to compare it to a tv series it’s like game of thrones but with a richer world and with an eastern European flavour added to it.Gameplay wise the Witcher 2 is in third person and you fight in real time, combat is not easy, Geralt is not invincible and a group of knights could easily kill him if you’re not careful. Geralt can you use a number of potions and traps as well as his mutant abilities to give him an advantage in combat, potions can help him do more damage to certain monsters or improve his health, while his mutant abilities can be used to deflect arrows or stun opponents.The witcher 2 is a fantastic sequel, everything that was great about the first game has been immensely improved, the combat, the story, the characters all have been improved to a degree that is almost unbelievable, graphically it is one the best looking games ever made. The game is truly a masterpiece with a rich and detailed world, good gameplay and a deep and interesting story.			",214,33,5,16,16,1,25

												I bought this game for $3.99, is it worth paying that. Yeah!Some positives---1. I like the combat with the varying swords, and steel and silver depending on your opponents. Throw in some magic and it feels balanced.  The combat is better than Witcher 1.  Witcher 1 combat; some people just got fed up with the combat system in the game and stopped playing because of it, sadly missing out on the story in 1.2. I like the crafting, you have potions and sword oils to improve your combat and health perks.3. The story line is good, it flows and it keeps it's reference to Witcher 1.  4. The characters are rich with personality! Each character has their own personality.  Elves, Dwarfs, humans, mutants,  monsters have their own environments, attitudes.5. Dialog choices are pretty clear, and there are two paths you can take in the game.  It isn't entirely clear whether you are going good, evil or more evil through the game though. However the 2 paths effectively give you 2 different playthroughs, with some side missions available on one path and slight different missions on the other path.6. The environments are unique and atmospheric, and feels large enough for the game.7. It has Steam Achivements, and for me they are like an added guide to things and directions to take in the game that I might not have otherwise discovered on my own. (there are secret achievements as well)8. Merchants are great, they vary on what each sells.  However make sure you don't accidently sell the wrong thing or the buy back will be expensive (save often in case of mistakes)9. There is a primary storage location so you don't have to carry all your crap around, and it is maintained in each town as you progress through the chapters.10. Will I play it through a second time to experience the other story path? Yes!Some negatives---1. Sometimes the combat for magic is delayed even when mashing it... which causes you to die.  I did a lot of cursing! Read on a forum where one guy said to disable the enhanced features, so I did but it didn't fix it.  Maybe it's a keyboard thing? All I know is I wasn't the only one who experienced it.  And I've got a custom high end machine, and my keyboard is a G11 gaming keyboard.  Regardless the magic works on time sometimes, but not instantly another time. (it's also noted as a bug on some of the forums)2. The potion creating system can get tedious and a bit over drawn out, even picking up plants gets annoying with having to click mouse, then move mouse to yeah pick it up and then click again.  It'd be better if it was quick like ES:IV Oblivion, picking up and creating.3. No fast travel.. and I would like fast travel (I've read where people say you don't need fast travel because the environments are small enough).  Here's 2 reasons I feel it could use fast travel... 1) the running is like a jog and would be nice if it was faster so give me a sprint option!  I even searched for a way to increase run speed (like you can for FO New Vegas in the console) but couldn't find a way to increase it though.  2) the second reason I'd like fast travel is the map pretty much sucks a$$! If you don't believe me then watch this video another guy created! 


YouTube™ Video: The Witcher 2 - Why The Map System Sucks!!! 

			Views: 5,610		

			In this glorious video Renn tells you why the map system in the witcher 2 is crap. Come check out our LOVELY site - http://avidgamerreviews.com/ Go ahead and throw us a like on Facebook -...		

 4. The map sucks!!! Hire a cartographer for the mapping system, someone who understands the importance of elevations in maps! LOL  Refer to YouTube link above! When you get deep into the game, yep you'll likely start yelling like this guy does in the video listed above. I had to keep going to YouTube/Google to find certain locations... it was really annoying! And when you don't run really fast and you wind up on the other side of town and want to see if the mission is the other way you have to keep going back and forth and back and forth it's annoying! Again a sprint or fast travel would have helped! Luckily in the second playthrough having already found the locations it should be less of a headache to find places.. if I remember where they are.. LOL5. The nudity is tacky, plain and simple! LOL  Seriously the make out session with Geralt and Ves, Ves is completely naked makin' like she's banging him but Geralt still has his pants and boots on!? LOL It's a double standard plain and simple, saying it's okay to exploit women but not men. If they are going to have gratuitous sex, that will only appeal to guys who can't get laid in real life then at least make it something like they had in Dragon Age Origins.  I could do without the women are all sl_ts attitude, minus the mages who are apparently b*tches and can't be trusted in this game.6. Lastly the Quick Load could use an improvement to the programming and insert an algorithm to speed load times, so it looks for the last created quick save to load instead of reading oldest to newest file then load.  If you save a lot then later in the game your huge save folder will slow load time.  I'm a chronic saver, due to my need to explore dialog options and I accumulated 2 gig of saves in one playthrough. The slow loading can be avoided/fixed by moving a chunk of your oldest saves elsewhere if you find your quick load slowed.  This is a case where it was fast when you started the game but suddenly noticed the load times slowing, towards mid to end of the game.  If it was always slow to load then it's prolly your machine...Don't let my negatives deter you from buying.  Just be aware it's not perfect! I bought it cheap so no skin off my butt! I'd like to see a Witcher 3, but with my negatives eliminated.. LOLThere are also mods here that will enhance the game: http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/top/? ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really, I could probably summarize Witcher 2 by saying it's an improvement over the original in almost every game-related way that matters, subjective things like atmosphere and alike being debatable, because CDPR upped their game significantly and actually worked with the engine of their own making, but that would be an easy way out and I like to complicate my life.First notable change is a clear 180 towards making the game into a more action-based installment, further enforced by removal of old combat styles and instead focusing on light and heavy attacks which give you more freedom in a sense that you can combine them on the fly without getting locked into a carefully choreographed sequences. Other than that there are changes which I would tentatively summarize as ""streamlining done right"" which is quite a claim in this day and age – alchemy removes the need for alcohol basis which finally lets Geralt stop being a walking cellar lugging around all kinds of high quality alcohol. It should also be noted that changes like these don't really simplify the game in any significant fashion primarily because other elements, like actual gear variety, addition of proper crafting and traps, etc easily offset whatever may have been removed.  That's not to say everything is perfect because some people had problems with the way combat works and overreliance on Quen aka protection Sign as a crutch, but I never really went through those problems so I can't testify to that.Story and characters of the game are an entirely separate beast worthy of being mentioned on their own. Witcher 2 continues after the first game, but works perfectly fine as a standalone story, although it is HIGHLY recommended that you're familiar with the original to understand who's who and what's happening in general. It retains the same old moral ambiguity and holds back no punches for the player but it's even better this time around thanks to increased world reactivity as well as choices & consequences which are really cranked up to 11. Fact that Act 2 is different depending on a choice you make previously practically guarantees at least two playthroughs to get the entire story and even then you'll still miss some modular things which can be done differently. Even though the stakes have escalated as far as the story goes, it's still a story very much grounded in reality except you now get to dabble in politics beyond just a cursory introduction.In the end Witcher 2 gets a resounding thumbs up from me. Importing your old Witcher  1 save file is also recommended. Not so much for the imported gear you'll replace fairly quickly so much as for decisions you made previously.			",908,390,16,194,90,8,172

												This has been probably one of the best gaming adventures I've ever had. It's hard to compare its weight, story, dialogue, character and mood with any other. It's choices are the of the weightiest I've ever had to make. The world, script and atmosphere made several of these major choices nerve-wracking for a variety of different reasons. There is no ""good"" path or ""bad"" path, it's just choice and consequence, and it's not always 100% clear what those consequences are, but the reactions and effects are fantastic to see unfold.It's improved over the Witcher 1 in every single way, and even now, years after it's release, the graphics are still downright great, the combat challenging but fun, and it still feels humble, well-acted and a solid adventure title. I would extremely recommend this to anyone looking for a good story that isn't squeamish. It's very adult, and it treats you like and adult.My cons with it would be perhaps a better tutorial, and a few other specifics like certain abilities better explained. As well as fast travel wouldn't hurt a few times. I played using keyboard+mouse and found the controls decent, though it seems to be well-made for controllers too. Overall, I had a total blast and definitely will be playing it again in the future, using a different path and different choices. Very few games I've ever played could match this for quality writing, content, script and atmosphere.			",257,74,5,20,26,3,26

												The Witcher 2 is a great game where your choices matter a lot. Choices matter so much the entire second act is completely different based on who you decide to follow at the end of act 1. What's even more satisifying is that there is no black and white here, only shades of grey.Witcher 2 is rich in detail, the voice acting is terrific, the graphics are among the best and the stories and consequences of your actions are well thought out and believable. However, be warned that this is a difficult game and there's a lot of boring backtracking to do. Also, there's very little hand-holding; you'll have to listen carefully to dialogue (and read books and your journal!!!) to know what to do and where to go instead of just walking blindly to your next map marker.

												This game is actually great,Great voice acting, visuals, and the developers know how to get things done.One of my few dislikes is the controls you need to get used to, and many visual bugs that don't really interrupt gameplay, but do come in quantity. Which you do hope to have been fixed in the 3 years since release.Maybe not a game for everyone, I myself am not heavily into RPGs, but definitely something I'd recommend picking up during a sale to atleast try it out.

												I bought this game for $2.50 and all I can say is, wow. After purchasing the first and second games for the price of a chocolate milk, I have spent over 85 hours on the games. I really enjoyed the first one, then when I played this it blew my expectations out of the water. The story, the characters, the settings, but most of all the highly improved sword and fighting mechanics. I finally felt in control of Geralt. This game was smooth and well polished at the time of playing. Although some of the game seemed quite easy, it regularly proved to be difficult in others requiring you to think about your steps. Not challenging enough to make you give up, but enough to really involve you in the battle. Yet, this is where my one complain of the game comes up. You cannot consume any of your alchemy items or oil your blade once the fight has started. A lot of the time you may not know who you are going to fight or when. Since all consumables are timed, you don't want to always use them up. This meant sometimes saving your game, running around, loading back to the previous save to know what you should consume. I hope in the 3rd title this is changed back. Over all, amazing game. Will play through again since the story can go 2 ways. I want to see both paths that Geralt takes and am really looking forward to playing through again. Also want to see how many boobies I can convince women to show me since so far it's 100% more in this game than real life.			",276,36,5,19,11,1,26

												This is one more of those cases like Portal where the first game felt like a real PC game and the next one feels more like a console-optimized interactive movie. (To a modest degree, but in that direction.)Yes, the production value might be high, the story might be interesting, but I'm not reviewing a movie here, but a game.While in the first Witcher game, I liked the style, all its strong points so much, I could easily overlook the various weak points, but in this game, from the very beginning, I saw little but its flaws.And because I saw way too many to edit them elegantly, here is a list of notes of the things that bothered me, in no particular order:- Dithered lighting!- Anisotropic filtering is enforced in the nVidia driver (since the game doesn't seem to have the option), but it still runs on trilinear!)In these two points the graphics in Witcher 2 are actually worse than in the first game.- Almost immediately vanishing corpses. (Same in the first game, but come on! Go with the times!)- No graphics engine or keyboard config settings in game, only via launcher. The first game had all of this.- Some fast-mouse-click QTE (quick time event) minigames are unnecessary and kind of harm immersion (sometimes practically ""click now or die"" - especially one scene in the prologue was annoying, since it was multi-phased and involved a sudden 180° change of camera view) - It makes little sense to expect very heightened adrenaline-pumping awareness while watching a cutscene and feels more like harassment.Even the relatively lame fist fight mechanics of the first game I found more appealing than mere WASD button pressing on command.- The precise-aim crosshair for daggers and such is almost invisible.- Some quest/dialogue progression in the prologue doesn't make much sense, i.e. leaving continuity holes- Selectable dialogue texts don't really match the Witcher's response that well. It's generally difficult to lead a conversation according to your true intention. You might end up accepting a task without wanting it. I often had to reload and try all options to at least get an idea of what I was doing.- Some dialogue barely audible because mumbled, need to reduce music volume (e.g. inn), but might be too low in other cases then.- Blood and dirt splatter on screen in cutscenes - harms immersion (4th wall breaking)- Some gold bags might be untouchable due to usable objects nearby.- An occasional geometry flicker issue that I saw in the first game, too, but no other game. Also some texture gaps.- Not being able to take a killed guard's sword during a prison break is kinda stupid, and it's not like it would be overpowered in that situation.- Game crashed before boarding a boat in one scene - couldn't save in that segment for some non-apparent reason, so had to redo and loot all the stuff I took there.- No launcher bypass possible using witcher2.exe or via other means. Launcher then places a symbol in the task bar just to add annoyance to the whole thing.- Inventory UI is kind of stupid in that it shows no stats for items in the list while highlighted, and menu items change size when highlighted, which impairs usability.- The game package doesn't even include the manual. It's just 7 MB, but I had to download it separately. Also outdated!- None of the 4 inventory sorting icons (whose meanings I had to find out by myself) gives you a value-for-weight sorting.- Inventory sorting keeps reverting to time-of-pickup.- Dropping an item from the inventory scrolls the whole list back to the top.- Key-based inventory scrolling doesn't use Windows settings. Repeat rate and trigger delay is way too high for my convenience. Also, PGUP/PGDN have no function.- Voices during conversations often have a strong reverb that doesn't match the environment at all.- A more general issue that was already in the first game: You can take stuff out of storage crates and such, and none seems to be owner-tagged, although most of it should. In a game that seeks to create immersion, this common RPG trait is always disturbing that.- Message ""item cannot be sold"" when trying to put it in my storage. Thus, unsellable items cannot be put in storage. Apparently the storage is just a crudely repurposed vendor.(which can lead to bugs)- Quest texts go ahead in time, telling what's gonna happen later or supposed to happen. The player doesn't seem to be considered relevant in these things and it feels like a bit of a spoiler.- Wavering camera during dice minigame is unrealistic and annoying.- Missing comparative feature of inventory item stats with worn item stats.- Fight club quest - when I'm asked to lose, I cannot decide to just quit, only accept the scam or fight (to win) anyway.- Often repeating NPC lines. Less would be more (immersive). They say the exact same thing every time you pass after an area has loaded.- Dialogue response timeouts - stupidest thing ever. For most dialogues it's perfectly fine or you to think about what to say for as long as you like (and I don't see a problem with that, and it's often necessary because the dialogue options are so unclear), but for some reason I don't see some dialogues will default to whichever option your cursor is on after a few seconds. If you don't notice the timer icon right away, you won't even know what you just chose.- When moving through the world, occasionally there's a loading symbol in the lower right corner, but loading is almost lag-free, so that icon is distracting, because when it briefly flashes, I keep thinking I just walked over a lootable object.- Geralt looks straight and not down when he's talking to a dwarf.- Small things like cursor not staying on menu when exiting to main menu with intention of selecting quit game. UI usability sucks in this game.- At least one quest didn't allow me a proper outcome in the journal and a quest tied into that one was absurdly unrealistic regarding changing a shop owner's conscience.- I am led through endless cutscenes that last long enough to let any potion run out and then right after that I'm in battle with a boss enemy, without potions. (Maybe the timers halt, but if they do, that would actually harm immersion again.)- First boss battle sucked, because while the game wants to look like a movie, the difficulty style is like hardcore indie games where you are likely to fail dozens of times, which I literally did. I must have tried 30 times. I felt like an actor and the director was shouting at me because I didn't do every move exactly according to script. I had to concentrate more on the ""click now"" like symbols on the screen than on the boss itself. I also at first didn't know when exactly the battle started and had to reload just to be able to drink potions in advance without wasting some of their meager 10-minute effect. Then I was frustrated because it used the wrong trap, despite me having selected the special trap for the boss. I eventually realized after several tries that I was supposed to left-click the marker with my mouse to place it. During the battle with a gigantic menacing boss, crows were sitting on a nearby corpse as if nothing was happening.- Many events could be enacted in a non-instantly-lethal way and especially in normal game mode. But instead: cutscene after cutscene. One time I was to play another character in a short event and fought someone in a duel. I fought well. The moment I defeated him... cutscene where I fail. This is disappointing and borderline insulting to the player. Don't let me fight if you intend to cheat me out of my deserved victory.Bottom line: This game often feels like it's trying to make me its trained monkey and has its fun toying with me, like I'm just an employee meant to move the story forward.A lot about this game is the same stuff that put me off about games like Castlevania LoS 1+2 (of which I played the demos).It gets surprisingly easy later-on though.- Geralt of Review			",181,65,2,17,12,4,26

												Witcher 2 is by far the best RPG i have played in many years. I features graphics way ahead of it's time and amazing story which is based on a book series. The combat is indepth and requires alot of thought before entering a battle. You character Geralt requires preperation before fight, He is not invincible and unstoppable like Kratos or Dante. The world has alot of packed lore into it and this all given to you in beautiful cutscenes, indepth monster species books, ancient texts and all the interactive npcs that you can encounter on your journey. Witcher 2 is overall a Hardcore RPG that deserve my approval of a 10/10			",162,18,5,15,9,2,11

												The Witcher 2 is one of the best action-RPGs around.  Well-written and mature story, plot, and dialogue.  The characters are well-developed. And, the decisions that you make throughout your journey changes the game dynamically.The controls are fluid, intuitive, and mapped in a style that is conducive to gameplay.  For those that are curious, I played all 60 hours of gameplay with a mouse and keyboard.Visuals are excellent for its time, and it has aged well.  Also, it is well-optimized.  My graphics and video options were set to ultra, 1200p, all maxed except for uber-sampling.  When I played The Witcher 2, I was using a GTX 670, i5-2500k.However, The Witcher 2 focuses less on monster hunting lore, and more on the political aspect of The Witcher universe.  Even then, there is some monster hunting and ghouls to fight during your downtime before you return to the game's political intrigue.If you are a fan of The Witcher books, The Witcher 1 videogame, and its universe, you owe it to yourself to play this game.  Maybe, even twice.  9.5 out of 10Highly recommended			",96,21,1,10,1,0,4

												Easily one of the best RPG's I've played in years. Skyrim may have a gigantic landscape riddled with dozens of ""fetch quests"" but The Witcher 2 blows it out of the water in nearly every aspect.*It has an engaging story, and you'll learn more about the plot after subsequent playthroughs.*It has a practical crafting system.*Many of the quests actually make sense. You rarely meet random NPC's that ask you do something important even though they barely know you.*Combat can be improved with FCR.*The game is 4 years old but the graphics are still AMAZEBALLS.*Soundtrack is epic!I put this game on hold for a long time, but I'm glad I actually got to finish it. 11/10			",320,73,7,30,27,3,22

												Just stop reading and give CD Project your money! Witcher 2 is a great improvement to the already great Witcher 1. Not to mention that you get a huge Patch for free with the  you get the Enhanced Edition which Adds more Cutscenes, Quests and even new Difficulty Modes with Extra Armor-Sets. EA would have released it as a 20$ DLC. The Graphics are beautiful, but the Game is pretty good optimized so you don't need a super high-end PC. I would recommend to play Witcher 1 before you get to Witcher 2. You can import your Savegame and keep your awesome Weapons/Armor you got in Witcher 1. And you will encounter some more NPCs in the Witcher 2 that you already know from the first Game, that may even thank/attack you for what you have done in the Witcher 2.If you like  Action-RPGs with a very rich Lore: The Witcher is the way to go!

												The Witcher 2 from a gaming standpoint is the meaning of the word progress, and how they improved from the first in the series. Everything from the graphics to the moving parts behind the game are an incredible feat, one you would expect from big named companies backed by a large budget. The looks of the game were not only unparalleled in 2011 due to its PC only nature, but also because it gives us a world that feels hand crafted. The attention to detail borders on the insane: the clothes, the houses and buildings, the faces of the characters, along with their weapons and in every corner, nook and cranny of the world there is that distinctive touch. The scenery is simply breathtaking, and if you're like me you will want to take a screenshot out of almost every frame. It also shows that you don't need an overabundance of browns and blood reds in your palette to show a gritty dark fantasy world. This game shows its maturity not through a pretense of adult topics or with over the top action animations, but through a careful use of its core elements and by showing the player some respect: ""Yes, you're an adult, and you can handle these topics!"" Because indeed the Witcher is a dark world filled with conspiracies, racism and characters who live between every single shade of gray. It is a living, breathing, unforgiving world.The story is as complex as the first , filled with twists and choices that may change the fate of many, and forking paths that make a replay of the game not only encouraged, but something you'll want to do in order to see the extent to which they occur and diverge. Normal and Hard, as easy is just that, difficulties are recommended and will test your skills if you do not face every battle with all seriousness, preparing beforehand by brewing and drinking potions and using all of your abilities during the fight. i.e. your swords, your magic signs, depending on what enemy you face and the traps and bombs for your crowd control and a little breathing room at times.The actual combat is in no way dumbed down, even if it feels less based on timing then the first. It will still punish you if you go unprepared and you can't mash your way out of battles. It is more finely tuned than in the first game, and friendly to both the use of a gamepad or mouse and keyboard. The UI is slick, easy to figure out and great looking.The ending of the game is abrupt, but one youve worked for. You might feel that it doesn't solve every issue in the game (the main storyline issues ARE resolved, though). It is no excuse from what many will consider a downbeat ending, in which it still sets up for the next in the series greatly though.  In all honesty it doesn't take away a single ounce from what this game does right, which is almost everything else. Even if you don't like the ending you will feel that the journey was worth it. There are also quite a few endings, 8 in fact, more if you consider all the side choices that could affect it.  Some are much better feeling than others, and all of which lead into the next game quite nicely.With the Witcher 2, CD Projekt RED delivered a game that is truly above and beyond any RPG from the few last years, it plays and feels like a product of love, careful planning and an overall shout to fans of the gaming community that says ""We know what you want, and we can deliver. Where others have failed you we will prevail."" And man did they ever. I would play this game again 5 years from now, just to remember how great a game it truly and to see how masterpiece RPGs are done.			",284,110,12,73,20,4,48

												Without  a doubt I would say that this game was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had. It is challenging at times and the game refuses to hold your hand and guide you through it like a baby. It is a refreshing change of pace from games like Skyrim. It is incredibly immersive, beautiful in almost every way, and the world itself is so engaging and interesting that I was actually sad that it wasn't more open for me to explore. Combat is challenging, skill oriented, and at time not forgiving or errors. However, right off the bat the game gives you all the tools you need to succeed and as you level up you can fine tune your character to reflect your personal preferences...even if that Talent Tree could use a bit more deviation.The dialogue (and there's a lot of it) is fantastic, the allies lovable and the enemies hateable. You care about characters and persons are portrayed in a very realistic and believable way. That's the thing about the Witcher 2. It's Believable and by extension is wonderfully immersive.If you want a challenge and an immersive adventuring experience, then you need to buy this game. ---Rags' Rating - A Yummy Strawberry Cheesecake / 10			",127,7,1,6,5,1,8

												The Witcher 2 is the second game in The Witcher trilogy based on the books of the same name. Compared to the first game, TW2 improves on every single aspect. The graphics are amazing, probably one of the best in recent years. The music is great. The combat feels a lot better compared to the first game. The voice acting is also better. You can feel emotions behind the voice. The facial animation in TW2 feels real compared to the stiff faces in the first game (Zoltan's crazy eyes). The story this time takes on a larger scale which involves different sides that you can choose, meaning the choices you make in this game matter a lot.   Overall, The Witcher 2 does an amazing job serving as a sequel for the first game and as the second game in the Witcher trilogy.If you're interested in the books. I suggest reading the books first before playing the games. The games take place after the books so there are a lot of dialogues and references that spoil the events in the books. Besides, there's a satisfying feeling when you meet the characters from the books again in the games. The books order: The Last Wish -> Sword of Destiny -> Blood of Elves -> Time of Contemp -> Baptism of Fire -> The Swallow's Tower -> Lady of the Lake			",92,11,0,19,13,0,5

												The Witcher 2 is the best storyline in a game I have ever experienced. A cross between Skyrim and Lord of the Rings, the story is compelling and movie-like. You feel attachment to the characters, and you genuinely care about what will happen to them. The scenery is stunning, the tasks are varied and not repetitive at all, and it keeps you involved right to the end. Yes, the swordsmanship is a little clunky in battle, and it's annoying that you can't change the controls, but these are seriously minor ailments of what is probably my new favourite single player game.

												It's the second game of The Witcher Franchise.  The whole game mechanics and graphics have improve greatly compared to the first game. It's beautiful looking game with a strategic combat mechanics. Yes, as an RPG game, more of the Action RPG side, it have a quality storytelling campaign with a challenging combat. You have to learn how to time your combat rather than just go with a 'typical' mob mentality. It's hard at first but rewarding along the journey. Once you get the rhythm, it will be Dark Souls like kind of enjoyment out of fighting, especially if you ramp up the difficulty. But for people who just want to play it for the stories, just choose the lower difficulty. It's no shame on choosing it, cause you do have to strategise before you enter combat with potions etc.Campaign wise, it's way wayy better that Witcher 1 for sure, and it's even have two seperate campaign after 1st chapter and its totally different set of environments/quests and you might want to replay the other side of the game later on (keep extra save games for that part). Both set line of quests offer a different agenda rather than just same old RPG style quest that make no different in the end. In Witcher 2, both side have their own agenda and it's up to you which one you like to explore. The sidequest also interesting and most of the time it's not requires too much time to be completed as it is near etc. So pick it up and enjoy the quest.Along the way, you will be presented with a lot of choices in term of how your choices affect the game storylines. The result of some choices might appear straight away or only near the end of your journey. You choose what you like, there's no definitive right or wrong. Most of the time, it's just a lesser of two evils ..... it's your choice.""In Witcher's world, there's no right or wrong, only decisions and consequences.""			",342,61,17,39,67,5,61

												The Witcher 2 is a really well made RPG. The 31 hours that i put into the game had me really immersed. Even if you do not plan on getting the Witcher 3(but why wouldn't you?)I would definitely recommend this game.Pros:-Great story-Decent characters with good voice acting.-Good combat system(in my opinion) that is not too easy nor too hard.-The biggest highlight of the game is that the choices that you make has a really significant impact on the game unlike many other RPGs and choice based games which only give you the illusion of choice/choices with insignificant outcomes. You end up on two completely different paths with different quests and allies based on your choices. Also core decisions that you made in the game carries over to the Witcher 3.-Great graphics for a 2011 game and also relatively bug free.-Has many side quests which are fun to do with good story.Cons:-Not very optimized.-No fast travel. Sometimes it can be a pain to walk long distances.			",510,180,17,97,80,13,91

												This definitely is Game of the Year 2011. The single best RPG I have played since Planescape: Torment. The characters are deep and complex, the storyline develops depending on your actions and choices. It takes what was good from every single RPG released in the last 15 years and makes it into something better. The graphics are simply the best ever seen in an RPG to date, if not the best that we have so far in any game (compare to Crysis if you want to). The flaws are few if any. The stealth sections are not the best, but they are optional, and there are a few bugs and such. There is no ACTUAL character customization, but you can change what the protagonist is wearing with quite a bit.The combat system works quite well. It may not be the best combat system in gaming history, but it does exactly what is is supposed to do. But all that is just beside the point. The atmosphere, the music and the character lines are just amazing, combining to create one of the best RPG's of all time.			",129,28,7,25,12,0,23

												Excellent storytelling. Great characters. Your choices have a profound impact on the story. The second game of the Witcher franchise is rather short (compared to W1 and W3) yet captivating. This is one of the few games you actually want to play several times (this reimburses for the overall time it takes to actually beat the game) in order to see the different outcomes of your choices. Only downside to this game is the rather abrupt ending. It basically ends when you acquire the best gear which is a little bit unfortunate for players who like to gear up properly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2 is one of those rare games in which you do not predict what is going to happen, one of those amazing games that, if you make the wrong decision, you will face the consequences. The thing that makes this so good is that not everything is clear, it is not black and white/paragon and renegade actions. Of my current hours (37.7), I have played within the span of 3 days. It is an addictive and excrutiatingly hard game(on dark difficulty, which I decided to start on) and while the learning curve is quite steep for begginers, it's well worth it.Alas there are a few cons to every masterpiece, for example, very little carry over from the first Witcher game (coming from a Mass Effect background) and was quite dissapointing that there were very few references to Alvin or any of the major decisions you made (eg. The scoia'tael beating on your♥♥♥♥♥even if you helped them in the first). Also, I finished the game without any need for the alchemy skill tree, and a lot of tasks such as building the Oathbreakers outfit is long and tedious.The lack of big bossfights were a little dissapointing and for me personally, the bosses were too easy (except that damn squid).However, the game makes up for it with breathtaking graphics (especially seeing as it is around 4 years old) and quite fluid combat, along with amazing storytelling elements and interesting plot lines. Although the lore can be boring for some and confusing for others at times as the game attempts to keep you in the dark on various matters.All in all, fantastic game.			",148,27,0,23,22,1,20

												One of the best RPG games I've ever played!Game is really highly enjoyable and a must-buy especially for european RPG fans.It's a lot better than Witcher 1 and more fun.The story is good and branched in several ways and the quests are fun to do, giving you good reasons doing multiple story paths, endings that depends on choices and a good replay value. Only cons in my experience are the lack of sprinting, fast travel and bugs (There are some severe ones) and the fact that you can't bind some functions like map and journal to the mouse. And the combat system is bit annoying sometimes, Although the Enhanced Edition improved it a bit, but still there's a mod to make it better if you still don't like the original one.9/10			",424,74,10,30,31,5,42

												This review is from the perspective of a new player to the series. Yes I have “played” the first witcher but dropped it after realizing how broken the game play is.The points:+ Controller support+ Combat+ Dialog+ Characters+ Art/Level Design+ Solo+ One Ring to Rule Them all/ Lesbomancy~ Animation~ Story (my bad)~ Menus- The world- Short- Triss’s BS8/10-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay let's start off with the middle ground issues, the ones that were annoying but didn’t break it for me. The animation at times was great the problem is the other 50% of the time they look like ventriloquist dummies, which is worse than the Mass effect stare. The story is very hard to follow and get into the swing of understanding it however after about 3 hours in I could fully understand what was going on. The menus leave much to be desired but it’s a huge step up from witcher 1, it took about an hour to get used to after that didn’t have much issue.Now the negative, the world makes no sense I don’t understand how 8 tiny countries smaller than rhode island can pump out more then the huge southern nation. I’m sorry but these nations are conquered. The story is short like COD level game short for a RPG. And Lastly Triss’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, this is not a damsel in distress issue. The issue with Triss is it’s obvious by the 80% mark of the main story that ALL this time she has been lying and manipulating you, BUT NOTHING COMES OF IT. no dialog, no nothing, I’ll be starting Wild Hunt sometime today if this is not brought up I will mark that game down as well for this. Now for the good, I glad this game has controller support because rolling around using a keyboard would have been a massive pain. And it’s done very well, I have some issues with inventory but besides that everything was handled well. The combat is actually combat in this game I can sense hints of Dark Souls, which isn’t bad because this game has a better combat system then Dark Souls (no one likes a game that ques your button presses). The dialog is not Mass Effect level crap of good, funny, and mad. It’s actually a bunch of options that may lead you to what you need. The Dialog system shines best with the Golem in the mission The Secrets of Loc Muinne. The characters are properly developed and have depth to back them except for Triss(her whole character is “she wants your D” -.- not joking). The world is beautiful and the levels are large enough for the time spent in each area to make it worth it. And lastly the solo experience, this is Geralt’s story not “Geralt and his friends” story. At first I thought I would hate this, but as time went on it made you feel more awesome. Do to the fact you were doing everything on your own.			",148,13,0,19,20,0,19

Introduction:A second chapter of the world of Geralt.Good: graphics (looks good but my eyes were bleeding in the beginning); a story line (nice trick to split it into two ways of completing the game); soundtrack (still good and not so frequent as in the first game but sometimes you lead your hero through the silence); fighting system is changing when you level up some skills; crafting system (a great variety of things available to craft); atmosphere of mid-ages battles is really impressive and you feel yourself a part of them; a strong link between games (Witcher and Witcher 2) those legendary armor and swords imported from first game were the best for a long game-play time; game stability is increased (it crashed only once for me); game saves don't take too much space anymore (comparing with The Witcher EE).Bad: an amount of side-quests is reduced (no more hidden quests you can get from some random NPC while talking. Now each active NPC is shown on mini-map); no more gifting thing (I mean in the first game you could gift some ring or something to NPC and get something for it in exchange, now all those jewelries are just a useless trash) too much bad words in the game; no more alco *parties* no more romantic *cards* (currently only porn cut-scenes :-(In total: 7 / 10P.S.: 50 hours only in total (yes, mate I completed the story once and I don't have any wish to replay it again). Sorry guys but I liked the first game more while this one is still good but not perfect.			",1769,606,78,166,182,17,255

It's never too late.+ Simpler, objective combat system as compared to Witcher 1.+ Superb Graphics that make you feel like its a 2013/2014 game+ Skill and problem solving oriented combat+ The true RPG, multiple choices, multiple outcomes and affects how you experience the game. + Dark mode and Insane mode is a good challenge+ Fantastic voice acting and character models+ Extremely re-playable+ Digital porn (Yes girls get naked in this game and you'll be choosing who to skoodilypoop with.)+ Realistic ambiance, Immersive and epic soundtrack/score+ Camera rotation has this blurring effect that makes combat feel even more fast paced than it already is.- Dodge heavy, making it seem like combat is about 80% dodge, 10% hit with a sword and 10% magic usage- Although it has multiple choices, it's still linear in comparison to Skyrim- Limited gear and weapons- For a powerful and legendary Witcher, you'd get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you by the smallest things sometimes.- Some choices are instant deathIt's very different from Witcher 1, and I only sunk 3 hours in Witcher 1. Witcher 2, I had my first playthrough and spent 48 hours. I will be going back for more playthroughs for different choices and experience once I complete my other games that are collecting dust. This is the biggest bang for your buck during Steam sales. Trust me.			",104,5,3,10,5,0,6

A Paladin’s Review: Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings: Enhanced Edition: It's A Fun Time But....Plough The Lilies. Err, I Mean The Combat.Genre: 3rd Person Western RPG, In-Depth Conversation System with Combat.  Developed & Published by: CD Projekt REDPlatform Support: Windows, Mac, Linux and Consoles.Business Model: Base GameCopy purchased by myselfRead the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Preamble and DisclosureRPGs are a difficult genre of game to review. With their vast worlds to explore, hours of gameplay that measure into the 50s or 100s for a single run through and each experience guaranteed to be different, well, it can be challenging to say the least. Laying my cards on the table, I played The Witcher 2 at hard difficulty for one playthrough. I did another playthrough at normal difficulty but only got part way through. I believe those two campaigns have given me enough experience to create my thoughts for this review. The Witcher 2 was purchased on Steam by myself, two years ago. Yeah, it has been that long. So, without further ado, I present A Paladin’s Thoughts and Review of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings: Enhanced Edition. 3rd person RPG for Windows, Mac, Linux and Consoles.Overall Gameplay ThoughtsOne half of the game is having a lot of long conversations with multiple NPCs. Participating in said conversations allows for world building, acquiring side-quests, trading and/or participate in….distractions.  These are generally well fleshed out conversations and you can skip a lot of lore if you want. There’s also different conversation options that can influence the responses you’ll get. It’s not as black and white as say Mass Effect’s paragon/renegade system. Instead, it generally influences how diplomatically Geralt will approach a situation. You can also use signs or intimidation to influence the conversation to your liking, provided you’ve leveled them up enough. The other half of the game is looting materials & personal possessions from every house, building, cave and castle Geralt can get into. Right from under people’s very noses. It’s insane how often Geralt is able to just steal from nobles or kings. Hehe ok, the actual other half is the combat system. It’s a fast paced hack-and-slash system that tries to encourage tactical and quick thinking as well as planning ahead. While it is possible to avoid some fights, usually by choosing the right response or avoiding a quest altogether, it’s not possible to avoid the majority of it.Story ThoughtsMany of the characters are an unlikable lot. There are very few good guys and Geralt isn’t one of them. It feels like a lot of attention was given to Geralt, Iorveth and Vernon and the rest were mostly regulated to side arcs or doomed to two-dimensionality. Despite TW2’s attempts to subvert tropes, many characters still follow many traditional tropes and stereotypes. After all, it’s kind of hard to find characters surprising when they’re given such obvious names like Dandelion, Triss Merigold or worse: Deathmold. I mean, really? Deathmold was the best name you could up with for an evil villain? Why not just have him give us an over the top laugh when we meet him? It would have been more subtle. Everyone else is pretty easy to figure out once you meet them. They rarely stray from their outward appearance and are largely predictable. There was little attempt to justify some of the heinous acts committed by evil people. They just did it because that’s what the universe expected.The Combat SystemThe combat system seems to be designed for tactical and lethal swordplay. It rewards prepared Witchers and punishes mistakes and overconfidence. Getting yourself surrounded by the enemy will lead to a quick death while setting up traps and oils will result in a lot of dead enemies. It doesn’t help that Geralt is often outnumbered by enemies. So, he’ll need to use all of his kit in each encounter to survive. 1v1 fights are very rare in this game. Though I wish they hadn’t been. While every fight has different enemies and somewhat different attacks, I found that I had to deal with them all in basically the same way. With lots of dancing, rolling and quick poking into enemies when you can. Occasionally using a sign or bomb, hoping all the while that Geralt’s health doesn’t get nicked to death. It’s too repetitive to be ignored and towards the end of the game, well, it’s just a tiresome chore.PC Settings & Port ReportThe Witcher 2 still looks impressive after all these years. There’s a decent amount of variety in locations, character models, rich weapon & armor designs, flora, buildings, you get my point. The realistic style TW2 went for is consistent with nothing looking out of place. However, the cracks are beginning to show and I can’t ignore them. Texture quality is all over the place. Geralt and other main characters can have impressive looking armor or clothing. Take a glancing look at some other people though and you start to see some gnarly texture quality. Heck, there were some textures not far off the beaten path that looked incomplete, missing or bugged out entirely. They seemed to have a hard time keeping a consistent quality at any point, which can pull you out of the world. Worse still is the view-distance. Even at max settings, pop-in is a constant problem. Foliage being the worst offender of popping in right in front of you. Combined with character models sometimes being a bit old looking and I suspect this will lead to problems in the future. That’s if we ignore a number of animation glitches, visual clipping and others. I think that TW2 will start to age just as poorly as the first Witcher has in the coming years. It’s still not a bad looking experience for now, and a lot of these issues aren’t major, but it will add up over time.Final ThoughtsIf you’re up for a fantasy story with a solid adventure, political intrigue and interesting conversations, The Witcher 2 is certainly good for it. However, it comes with some major problems that are hard to ignore. Character’s are often two dimensional. The combat system is overly difficult and punishing even on Normal mode. Not to mention, the difficulty curve can swing wildly from fight-to-fight, especially if you install the combat overhaul mod. I’m finding it harder and harder to recommend story-based games with poor combat systems. I think it’s long overdue that devs pay equal attention to both the story & combat so that each are enjoyable to experience. I give this a very hesitant recommendation. It gets that for what the devs attempted. The Witcher 2 tried to go big and very nearly succeeded. Given more time for polish, I think this truly would have been a remarkable game. For now, it is what it is. Perhaps its sequel will be what The Witcher 2 couldn’t be.Read this Review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]A Paladin's Review: The Witcher (1): Enhanced EditionA Paladin's Review: The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt.

												Still somewhere n the middle of the game, but I'm already in love with this game only for one thing - The real nature of elves revealed. Elves too sneaky, they are cowards, they are liers.I just dont like em and i'm found - Witcher 2 game. This is the first game i've played where truth revealed about elves ever.I'm found game scenario quite cool, even for single player its still very nice with Great story line.I've never player Witcher before, but im sure i'll order Witcher 3 for myself. Some stuff is really missing in Witcher 2. You character is unable to jump, swim, make short-cuts.The rest is just - Perfect. Im rating this game with 9/10. Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A good rpg game. Very well made, and thoght out. Is it Skyrim? No. Does it need to be? It never attempeted. This a not so classic rpg in the old school sence. There are no GOOD GUYS and BAD GUYS. There are only sides, ony choices, no one is evil or bad. Just like life. Thats what makes the world and story interesting. It is a novel come to life in video game form. A mature, complicated tale, with ood gameplay to support it.(cause if the gameplay sucked, kinda hard to say its a good game  afterall) .The Witcher 2 is what made me a fan of the seres. Its a bit old school in the sense that it does not hold your hand, which might force you to google a thing or to, but it is well worth it. The action is satisfying, the sound is as it should be. The graphcis are beautiful no matter what generation you are from. No one will say its too ugly to play. Now the only warning i could give is, it is complicated. You need to read up in the journals what happneded before in the world, who hates who and why, and so fourth. It takes dedication. Somethign not every game has. But if you do, grab a sword and go fourth WHITE WOLF.			",82,20,1,10,5,2,12

												The ♥♥♥♥♥er:♥♥♥♥♥amp♥♥♥♥♥of Mings is a short documentary of rare asian women that have inhuman amount of booty.

I like this over the first one because it doesn't focus on monsters, games with monsters are for nerds like dota. I don't like how infinity ward didn't sexualize Geralt enough, why isn't he a Chris Redfield? I just want to see huge meat, infinity ward!!!! gosh!!!!! this game is also hard, which sucks because its targeted for no-life nerds. The graphics look like the♥♥♥♥♥♥of a wimpy black man that got anally devastated by 40 horses on cocaine. Overall, I don't like it, it's for nerds and the game has bad graphics compared to Modern Warfare 2 and Halo 4, my favorite games.			",124,9,5,6,6,0,12

												Amazing RPG. Exactly what a sequel should be.Great storyline that reveals as you play through the game and just keeps pulling you in more and more.Beautiful graphics, great voice acting and as usual UNIQUE and AMAZING soundtrack.Combat is refined since the first game and is good enough to provide a challenge but could be better.I reccomend to play the game at Dark or Insane difficulty to get the absolute maximum feeling from it.If you import a save from the first Witcher don't expect to see a lot of the choices made there have some influence here. The game itself has many choice which affect a lot in the game (and except a lot of things to be affected in the Witcher 3) therefore it has replayability value.Overall i recommend this game. One of the top 5 RPG's i've ever played!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is a decision-driven fantasy RPG released by CD Projekt RED in 2011.  Like all The Witcher games, The Witcher 2 is based on The Witcher series of novels by Andrzej Sapkowski.Story (mild spoilers):The Witcher 2 (W2) takes places in a fantasy world heavy inspired by Slavic mythology and Polish history.  The universe of The Witcher games is steeped in political intrigue and features strange monsters and magical forces that influence people's lives for the better or worse.  In this world, a sect of mutant warriors called ""witchers"" (or hexers) serve as itinerant monster slayers for hire.  One of these witchers is the famed Geralt of Rivia, also known as the White Wolf.The game picks up shortly after the ending of The Witcher (W1), which showed Geralt of Rivia defending King Foltest of Temeria from a mysterious assassin.  In the aftermath, King Foltest ""orders"" Geralt of Rivia to serve as a glorified bodyguard.  However, a sinister plot by a mysterious faction compels Geralt to search for answers, reacquainting him with certain figures from his past.  Still suffering from amnesia prior to the events of W1, Geralt must regain his memories and find out who is killing the Northern Kingdoms' monarchs.W2 feels fairly shorter in story length than W1.  Nonetheless, the decision-driven storytelling of W2 remains strong, and I found the supporting cast highly memorable.  The game presents almost entirely different story paths which start near the end of Chapter 1 and dramatically change your character's quests and location for the majority of Chapter 2.  The grey morality surrounding monster slaying, philosophical issues, and political matters remains a key aspect of the decision-driven narrative.  The game ends on a bit of a cliffhanger and some plot lines seem unresolved...at least until The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.  Nonetheless, the narrative remains fairly compelling.Finally, the import system is not as comprehensive as in games like Mass Effect 1-3, but some decisions (e.g. decisions on Princess Adda, Siegfried [Order] or Yaevinn [Scoi'atel], and a couple other characters) add/change dialogue options and alter certain NPC interactions.Rating: goodGameplay:The timed attack clicks of W1 have been replaced with a more ""Dark Souls""-esque combat gameplay style (if you want to use that analogy).  Geralt has a basic skill tree alongside three other skill trees for alchemy, swordsmanship, and magic.  I favored a build centered around swordsmanship with some perks in magic, but found most of the alchemy tree useless for this build.  Like in the first game, your character uses two swords: steel for humans, silver for monsters.Enemies can feel RELENTLESS early on.  You may find yourself underleveled at first, but can become a powerhouse of destruction near the end.  This unbalanced difficulty, however, may deter many players.The alchemy system of W2 does away with alcohol bases for potions in W1.  Instead, you simply combine ingredients and voila: a masterpiece.  You must have the necessary ingredients and recipes beforehand from looting and finding merchants.  Meditation is now required to consume potions, but is offset by being able to meditate almost anywhere outside of combat.  In addition, you can utilize bombs, specific sword oils, throwing knives, and traps against your aggressors.As this is a decision-driven story game, dialogue remains key to discovering info and shaping the outcome of the narrative.  You can utilize persuasion/intimidate/axii abilities to steer a conversation to your benefit provided you have the required level for each.  Be mindful that your decisions can have drastic story consequences.  This game does not hold your hand.  You are free to choose the path you believe is right.The game offers several side quests, from contracts to arm wrestling, brawling, and dice poker.  There is no fast travel, so you'll be backtracking a lot to complete these.Rating: goodAudio:I played the game in English since that's my primary language.  W2's voiceacting has certainly improved since the last game and features quality vocal talent for many NPCs.The music is AMAZING.  It is highly atmospheric and more than captures the mood and identity of each area you're in.  Some of the combat music may really get your blood flowing during fights.Rating: excellentGraphics:The game looks gorgeous, especially if you have the hardware to enjoy the lighting FX.  On high graphics settings, the environments and character models are bristling with detail.Rating: excellentOverall: I loved this game, and it certainly improves over some of The Witcher's shortcomings.  My biggest concern was the story, which felt like it was on a slightly smaller scale that that of The Witcher to me.  The cliffhanger ending is an obvious setup for The Witcher 3, but I still felt right at home playing this game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Review - The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition""A marvelous adventure RPG that makes you really think of what decision you should make.""The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is an Adventure/Action RPG that welcomes the player once again to the world of the witcher, Geralt of Rivia. The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition starts off with Geralt being detained in dungeon as he was accused for murder of the Temerian King Foltest. He is then interrogated by Vernon Roche, the leader of the Blue Stripes, to tell his part of the story. After persuading Roche, your adventure then begins.The game has very much improved in terms of graphics and gameplay. The game's environment and atmospehere is so detailed and very engrossing that just removing the minimap can really get you lost (well, unless you have memorized the area). The soundtracks and voice actings are great. Even if you're just performing sidequests, you'll actually feel that those tasks really matter as if it's as important as the main plot of the game.One thing that sets The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings apart from other RPG games is its combat system. Geralt's swordplay is very different and unique. There will be times that hack n' slashing enemies head on could lead to your own demise.As you explore the game's world, you'll eventually come into crossroads of decisions and this is The Witcher series strong-point. Just like in the first game, your decisions really matter and affects the flow of the story, the actual ending of the quest and it even affects how the NPCs react to you. Siding with the humans can lead to elf merchants ignoring you and not giving you the service they provide. The decisions you take can either lead to death, a scar on a relationship, a new item, a battle or even a romance scene with one of the girls, etc. The player's decisions shape what kind of personality you want Geralt to portray whether you want him to be a merciful hero, a seeker of justice or just a plain old witcher doing his job.The game is quite short with having only 3 chapters (4 in all if you include the prologue) but its immense design on each quest makes the game very long. After your first playthrough, it'll make you want to start all over again as you'll wonder what would have happened if I made this decision instead of the other.The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is a totally great game that once you finish it, you'll end up looking for more of it. I highly recommend this game to big fans of the Witcher series and to those who really love Action/Adventure RPG games with great story content.Personal Rating:Story/Plot: 9/10Gameplay: 8/10Music: 9/10Grapchics: 8/10Overall: 8.5/10			",99,66,2,18,11,3,15

												The Witcher series is an odd one for me. I enjoy the atmosphere, the art, the story telling, the boobs, but I outright hate the combat.  I've tried several times to sit down and go through this game but the clunky combat keeps me from really diving into it. Not this time, though, NOT THIS TIME. I've put my big boy pants on and I'm finally ready to enjoy this Action RPG masterpiece of Gaming known as The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. WIth my hatred for the combat I still have to give this game a two big thumbs up. I see it's often on sale for next to nothing. Go for it. Also, easily still one of the best looking games out there. There seems to be a fair amount of mods for it as well. I came across one that addresses the combat with numerous fixes. So pull your pants down, mod it up and enjoy yourself with some epic Fantasy.

												The Witcher 2: Assassins Of Kings is an incredible game. It has great graphics, great gameplay, awesome characters and dialogue, a fantastic soundtrack, a fascinating universe and lore, an incredible storyline and the best political intrigue I have ever seen in a video game. It is awesome how the choices you make affect the game and how the branching paths differ from each other, giving you the chance to experience the game's story from two opposite perspectives. The only problems I have with the game are the interface, which is hard to navigate, and the hit detection is kind of weird, but the latter is quite easy to get used to.Overall it is a brilliant game.

												If not for Skyrim this would be the best RPG in the last couple of years. Its Skyrim meets Dark Souls meets Game of Thrones. Hard to not like it if a RPG fan, the world and lore is great, the plots are like an episode of Game of Thrones, and wandering the areas doing side quests is as fresh as going for walk-abouts in Skyrim.Its more linear then other RPGs out there, esp sandbox ones like Elder Scrolls, but does well because of it, theres dozens of choices you make that do actually effect outcomes massively, the whole of ACT II is in a different area and people depending on how you end ACT I for example.Still one of the best looking PC games out there too, get it.(Also has boobs)			",161,11,3,19,11,0,37

												The Witcher 2 stands out for its gorgeous graphics and superlative storytelling. The world you explore is enormous, stunningly rendered (assuming you have a PC powerful enough to handle it), and filled with secrets that players must seek out. Among these secrets are countless side quests that introduce you to memorable personalities and shocking events that help shape Geralt’s personality. Playing the game feels like seeing an adult-oriented fantasy novel spring to life and then stepping into it. Just get this game and enjoy!			",124,16,0,18,9,0,24

												The Witcher 2 is a game with memorable characters, beautiful towns and landscapes, and a story filled with political intrigue. It's rare to come across a game with choices which feel impactful while avoiding typical 'black and white' or 'good and evil' situations. What lacks in gameplay is made up through the narrative.The gameplay is sub-par. Geralt of Rivia is equipped with two swords: one for human-slaying and one for monster-slaying. With magic-like abilities called signs to go along with his swordplay, Geralt is a force to be reckoned with. Dodging and parrying are two important aspects of the combat system. Geralt can die in a moment's notice if the player isn't careful, so it's vital to know when to be aggressive or defensive. However, The combat feels sluggish. The tab-targeting feels unresponsive at times, dodging does not always go the way the players want it to, and contact with enemy units does not feel responsive. A huge plus though is the way a player has to prepare for each encounter. Geralt cannot use potions during combat, only when he is meditating, which a player can do at anytime outside of combat. Potions range from boosting his recovery rates to increasing his attributes and resistances. It's a fairly comprehensive system and adds a layer often missing from other games.To level up, the player is given a 'skill tree' to add attribute points to four different categories, each composing of their own active and passive skills: Training, Alchemy, Signs, and Swordsmanship. The leveling up system is not complicated, but the choices you make are important. Geralt can level up to 35, which for example can fill up  the Training Tree and one other. So the player is given the choice of specializing in a certain tree, or become a jack-of-all-trades, balancing their skills points across all areas. It's a simple system which relies on player choice as a main driving force.The story is interesting enough to continue unraveling its many mysteries. Geralt meets friends, foes, and backstabbers along the way. What's great is that each character has a sensible motive to their actions. Voice-acting is great and the writing is well-done. The cutscenes do not offer much in terms of action, but the dialogue options and the strive to know more about the characters is enough to justify the more static encounters. Visually the game is absolutely beautiful. The lighting was and still is the best in the gaming industry. It benefits to take a second and marvel at the scenery surrounding Geralt. The forest around Flotsam, the first town Geralt encounters, is stunning. It helps make the world come alive, and like Mass Effect, creates a very convincing world, as if there's a lot more going on than what Geralt sees in his eyes. The character models, although great, could use some variety. It was common to come across the same character models across various parts of the game.If you are a fan of mature-themed RPG adventure, this game ranks among the best of them. It comes highly recommended.			",311,85,5,45,22,5,35

												This game is plain out great! The quests and story are really amazing, very very interesting and is very sad at the start when you lose one of the characters. But that said, I have no completed the game and is very challenging and some areas. And Triss is amazing, what more can I say?			",64,6,3,9,9,0,3

												Beautiful graphics, mature plot, explicit language, nudity & gore are one of the main reasons to play this game. The Witcher triology features a (restricted) induvidual storyline (depending on your decisions/answers), which makes the story even more gripping. Btw, did you know that CD Project didn't know♥♥♥♥♥♥about codeing/developing videogames like 10 years ago? It's been a long time, and eventually they've learned a lot about their business as you can see in Witcher 2 & 3.			",53,3,3,2,8,1,2

												The Witcher 2 improves upon the first game in terms of combat, graphics and scale, however the game world is more linear in design and the story is debatably not as compelling as the Witcher 1. The choice and consequence system is brought to a new level here, with one decision changing half of the game entirely. The game has a somewhat darker atmosphere than the first and the soundtrack isn't as memorable. The combat is greatly improved with more options and tactics thanks to the extensive skill tree. Overall, this is a great game and a worthy successor to the first.			",463,99,9,67,34,3,48

												A good game, but not a perfect game. The atmosphere, the graphics, the idea behind the game are wonderful.  As are many of the characters, even the character you play is quite amazing himself. It's an immerssive game that captures the player and throws lots of enemies at you and lots of very neat little details. This game, based on the books definately does feel like an RPG. The gameplay is relatively satisfying, with visuals probably outdoing the gameplay itself but they create a very uniqe atmosphere which I prefer to other RPGs.In this game the choices actually do matter, there's quite a few and it's not just black or white (morally speaking). What is also unbelivably suprising about TW2 is that, despite the game coming out in 2011. This game on Ultra looks still up to date as ever, it looks astonishing truely.While this game succeeds in delivering a good RPG experience, there are some issues which don't make it a 10.. - The saving game system is far from perfect, not allowing you to save over games or choose the name of your saves instead every time you save it creates a new save. Doing this can make a huge cluster of saves which freeze your game every time you click load. So you must periodically clean old saves.- 3 big skill trees to pick from but very few skill points make it quite difficult to build the ultimate Witcher. - The game is actually quite short, especially if you don't do the side quests. Of course, after this there is the Witcher 3 which only continues the best kind of fun. The amount of hours I have are not correct, as I tried to play this game before but never completed it so it's more hours than needs be. - The facial animations are subpar, not really great at showing off emotions of the characters.- The combat is unforgiving at the begining, defiantely needs getting used to and remember Space is your friend.

												This is one of my favourite games of all times. I've finished it a few times already. And it still has great replayability valuePros Very nice graphics and pleasurable atmosphere Story and quests are fantastic. Some decisions of the player have interesting complications. One of the acts can be played in two different locations depending on your decisions. The game has about sexteen endings, some of them are very different from each other Characters are well developed and are very convincing Cons Some stability issues, game can crash from times to times The are some minor issues with gamepad supportAnd you can get this game for like 2,99€ from times to times (like right now)			",161,62,3,20,25,1,21

												I think this game is great and will be even greater if I ever pass chaper 1, act 1.But on Linux (Kubuntu 15.04, Nvidia drivers) it's just unplayable. I cannot recommend this game for any Linux gamer as it is too buggy for now (and I don't think this will change ever).The game begins with a great and epic prologue, telling you what happened after the ending of Witcher 1. The game is far more polished than Witcher 1 with a new fighting system and more variety of weapons and armor.I was only able to play the prologue and the beginning of the first act. With the first act, the bugs begin to appear: Since ever I installed this game (on multiple versions of Linux - upgraded installations, fresh installations, newest drivers, Ubuntu's supported drivers, ...) I am not able to trade anything, resulting in crashes in the trading menu. Sometimes the game still crashes from nowhere.If somebody says: ""Then play it on Windows - dualboot!"" - No - I - won't - dualboot - !What if it would be the opposite direction and somebody tells you to dualboot to Linux to play Witcher 2?Conclusion: Great game, bad port and unplayable.Chance of getting fixed: Almost none			",10,1,0,6,5,0,2

												First off, I'd just like to say that I have never played the first game, and I have never read the books that create the basis for this game. If you are looking into buying this game, go onto t""The Witcher"" youtube channel and watch the small little overview they offer about the first game. Onto the actual review, this is easily one of the best RPGs out there on the market at this time. The graphics are absolutely stunning and run quite smoothly, the artwork and textures are brilliant and vibrant, yet bleak enough to preserve the game's ""feel"". Speaking of feel, this game has a dark, mature attitude full of corruption and disgust. The moral choices in the game require Geralt to make morally ambigious decisions. There are no rights or wrongs, only decisions based on the scenarios. Combat can be best described as playing Dark Souls with a character who doesn't weigh 450 pounds, fun, but challenging as well. The plot has enough turns to keep things flowing, but it's not ridiculous. Plenty of sexual encounters. To conclude, I rate the game as a strong 9/10, and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good game. I got 60 hours out of it and bought it for 2.50.			",60,3,1,9,4,0,1

												The Witcher 2: Assassin's of Kings is not only one of the finest RPGs but also one of the best games ever made. It boasts an insanely amazing intellectual mature non-linear driven story made by your own choices, and it lives up to it's word. Very well written, memorable characters, some dam amazing dialogue and very well structured. One has to play this at least twice to realize/understand the entire game as every playthrough will have something different to offer. And this is with no doubt THE best looking game out there (until The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt comes out), real feast for the eye.For fans of RPGs and rich complex story telling, this is a must play.My full review: http://expedition-megacosm.blogspot.in/2012/05/witcher-2-assassins-of-kings-enhanced.html ",358,104,3,59,11,2,35

												I really enjoy games that walk me through an interesting story and dump me in a fully fledged world. The story has heritage in Polish culture and is based on The Witcher books by Andrzej Sapkowski. Fantasy worlds are fascinating but are sometimes difficult to be drawn in to. With the Witcher I did not find that to be the case.The gameplay is quite linear in some senses where there are three main chapters plus a prologue and epilogue which significantly move on the story and change the environment. However, when playing within a chapter you are given time to explore the beautiful environment and complete the quests around you. It is not necessary to play the first witcher before playing this but inevitable there are quotes which relate directly to the first game.The combat swordplay feels a little clunky and some small amount of time should be spent on the wiki to understand signs and so on (Aard is your friend). All in all, before this gets too long - definitely worth a pick up.			",46,5,0,3,3,1,2

												Drawing from it's rich source material the Witcher 2, continues the tale of Geralt of Rivia as he seeks to uncover the truth behind a mysterious group of assassins who are after royal blood. Building on the amazing story which started with the first Witcher game, considered a classic by many, Witcher 2 also improves the experience of being a professional monster-slayer. The combat is challenging and realistic ( no chugging fifty potions in the middle of a fight :P ) and the visuals and voice acting are excellent, and the story as aforementioned is gripping filled with impactful choices, characters that you will grow to love and others whom you'll want to introduce to a witcher's blade.  For those who have played the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and want to immerse yourself more in the witcher world but find the first witcher to have not aged particularly well Witcher 2 Assassins of KIngs is an excellent game detailing Geralt's adventures leading upto the events of Wild Hunt. Overall an amazing RPG and good entry point for those who have never played a Witcher game as well as returning monster-slayers.			",36,6,4,8,2,1,2

												The Witcher 2 EE is like your neighborhood cougar. A fine woman who's grown wise through her experiences. Seductive in her gaze, can treat you to a good time then read you a bedtime story. (Compares a computer game to an attractive woman.... descending ever deeper and deeper, are we?)Right, Right...... The Witcher 2.An essential chapter in The Witcher video game trilogy. Unlike the original game from 2007, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is an absolute must for those interested in playing it's sequel, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The state of the Northern Realms in the third game is a direct outcome of major events that transpired over the course of Assassins of Kings. The Witcher 2 continues the tale of an amnesia-struck Geralt of Rivia. After foiling an assassination attempt on King Foltest's life, the legendary monster slayer turned royal bodyguard must accompany Temeria's king into battle against traitors of the realm. As stated, a player need not play the original for an enjoyable experience, but for those who prefer complete participation, emotional investment, and absolute understanding of its references and characters, it is advised. Positives:  - Stellar choice-driven narrative. - Immersive gameplay mechanics. - Soundtrack is brilliantly enveloped around a player's every action; electrifying during combat yet sentimental when required. - Believable fictional world brimming with interesting interactable characters. - Stunning visuals. (Dem textures doe!!!!) - Punishing difficulty that forces players to use all the tools at their disposal. - Pixilated tittays! ...in your face literally a few minutes after you start the game.Negatives (More like knit-picks):  - Conversation persists even when paused by the player. - Geralt's Grayish silver hair rather than the lore-appropriate milky white. (Easily corrected with a mod) - Glitch where unlooted items from fallen enemies disappear after reloading a save.  - Geralt's movement constantly interrupted by invisible surfaces belonging to furniture and vegetation. So F*ckn good, y'all don't even know.			",68,4,0,7,1,0,0

												I bought this game years ago... when I played it the first time I didn't like it tried another five times still no dice. Now I'm here don't know what changed maybe I just didn't understand it but I'm glad I gave it a shot, better later than never right?So let's get all the good stuff out of the way first, the biggest and greatest change has to be the combat it's fast paced full of action and well it just feels great. The game looks good and has aged well, has a tonne of options to mess with too always a plus. The keyboard and mouse work great but default key binds feel odd and a controller works perfectly. The audio is amazing from the voice acting to the sound effects all the way up to the soundtrack. I would say the game length is good took me roughly about 30-35 hours to complete, there's also a tonne of side quests to do and of course heaps of main quests. The user interface is great with a mouse and keyboard but a bit weird with a controller still works fine though. There's some great game changing choices to be made and that's to be expected from a heavily story driven game. It also comes with a arena mode it's as fun as you'd expect from a survival based mode but it's still a great pass time.Now the bad... first thing I want to get of my chest is the navigation I don't think I have ever played a game with such a detailed but useless map and mini map, I found myself getting lost often because of it. There is no sprinting and at first it's fine but later you'll find yourself pulling out a sword just to dodge everywhere. A downside to the new combat is once you corner a single enemy excluding main bosses they get stuck and can't fight back, small gripe which made it feel cheap. The games pacing feels off most of the time, sometimes it's quick sometimes it's slow other times it's super quick etc it never seemed subtle. There doesn't seem to be enough different armor and weapons to go collect and spend time on, which is fine I suppose but I excepted more. A minor bug I found on dual screens was an invisible second mouse pointer would appear on the second screen hovering over things, not a big deal but annoying.I honestly think the game is great if you are craving a story driven game, it might not appeal to some but it's definitely up there with the Mass Effect series.

												Although 'The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings' happens to be my least favourite game in the trilogy, I still found it very enjoyable. It begins with a very exciting introduction, and the new combat system is well-explained in the opening quests. Also rather early in the game we meet the antagonist of 'Assassins of Kings'.My favourite of all the 'Witcher' villains is from this second instalment: Letho of Gulet. Letho is a man of colossal proportions, and matches his incredible power with a sharp, cunning mind. Some of the other characters introduced in this game are also rather memorable, but none so much as Letho. The perfectly written villain is just one element of a very good story.These days, we're all familiar with RPGs offering players a choice. We were also very familiar with this feature five years ago when this game released. Still, none of the games I've played have offered a choice quite as significant as one of the ones presented in this game, in which your selection will change at least 6-8 hours of gameplay.I wish this game had been as open to explore as the other 'Witcher' games, and I think more investment in side quests could have been made. Still, play 'Assassins of Kings' and you'll be signing up for a first-rate fantasy adventure, full of highly entertaining battles and well-written, well-acted characters.			",111,36,1,26,5,0,5

												It's a great game.  As in Witcher 1, your choices matter.  When it was released the graphics were next-gen, but it was nearly unplayable on my system due to bugs.  Here we are years later with the Enhanced edition for which I am playing it through a second time, and there are still bugs.  Nothing game breaking, but highly annoying nonetheless.It's still a great RPG with an intriguing story, though I am betting you'd appreciate it more by reading the books, which I have not read.  Gameplay wise, it can sometimes be a little hack and slashy, but on the higher difficulties you're forced to use a bit of strategy; it differs a good bit from Witcher 1 and takes a little getting used to.  If you're an RPG fan it's not one to miss, but you really should play the games in order to know what's going on (I actually like the 1st more than the 2nd in a few ways).			",250,55,2,37,7,1,10

												Truth be told, I am very new to this type of game. Especially the RPG element as I spent most of my time playing FPS. So one day, i saw that The Witcher 2 had a discount. So i thought, why not try an RPG game? Besides, the reviews are good.I bought it, downloaded it and got ready to jump in. I thought the game was nice and all, till I tested its combat. I can't recall how many times have i died, trying to get the ballista in the Prologue. But i eventually passed through it. After 15 hours of gameplay, i realised that my items were still on the low level side; so long story short...i restarted the whole game and spent hours grinding and searching for the good items in the game. And it was very worth it.Each quest reveals the story and lore of The Witcher universe, which I daresay, is very wide and large. I enjoyed the story telling and presentation by the Developers, though sometimes I find the voice acting a bit..off. - Story 9/10Combat was very new to me too as I've never played any games similiar to the Witcher series. It might be a bit hard for new players like me to get it at first, but soon you'll find it natural just like breathing. Combat 8/10The Witcher 2 has an abundant of interesting characters to suck the players into its universe. Iorveth would had to be my favourite character :) . Good Job CD PROJEKT RED - 10/10Overall, this game is very well-made and tailored. After I finished this installment, I bought the Witcher 3 without hesitation.I expect my mind to be blown, CD PROJEKT RED :)			",91,12,0,7,8,1,4

												Solid game here, much better then the first witcher with a great story that really makes you think about each choice you make. Every choice isnt black or white, good or bad, but has its advantages and disadvantages and helps to build your personal version of geralt. cant recommend this game enough			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings followed in the glorious path that was set by the first Witcher game but took even greater turn towards the perfection that was topped by the third title.What the first game lacked, it was greatly improved in the Witcher 2, be it the wonderful graphics (which were pretty incredible for 6 years old game!), top notch storytelling and the much criticized combat mechanics.I write this review after my second playthrough before embarking on a journey of the Witcher 3 and I can tell you, I had a blast even after playing this game twice!I loved every little side quest, I loved reading the journal entries which were fun and entertaining (I really recommend to read them!) and I thoroughly enjoyed all the dialogs and plot twists and turns.The gameplay was fun and challenging and the combat issues I had in first game were no longer a bother.This game has also one of the best romance scenes in the gaming history (yes, I mean the one with the Triss Merigold :-)) ) and the choices you make throughout your adventure makes you feel like they really have impact on the story (which they really do!).If you played Witcher 3 but haven't tried previous two titles, I highly recommend you to go for it - you will have ton of fun! And if you haven't play Witcher 3 yet and you are thinking if you should start with the previous games first - hell yes! It feels great to go through the lore from the very beggining, absorb the story, the characters and all the things that will come back at every corner in the Witcher 3.Eternal glory to CD Projekt Red for their incredible work!15/10!

Time of completion: ~21 hours (68 days total)Date of writing the review: 22.February.2015Difficulty I played at: Easy (with a little twist, read below for more info)My rating: 7.5/10=====================================My review will be separated into different parts covering the many different aspects of the game. First let me give you my overall opinion and if you want you can read about every small detail about it.This game is great, I loved it. Unfortunately it suffers from many design flaws, which really make your experience frustrating at times. It seems that the developers didn't learn their lesson too well from the previous game's problems. I had to stop playing for about a month because of how the missions were layed out and the unclear mission markers.I played it on EASY difficulty, but only used the armor I imported from my ""The Witcher 1"" save and that armor sucks. I did not use trophies or good trousers or gauntlets. This really gave me a challenge and made the game a lot more enjoyable. Graphics and performance  I played it on a PC with an i7 4770, GTX 770 and 8GB ram on MAX settings. The performance was perfect. Stable 60 fps in every part of the game. It only dipped to 40-45 fps while exiting out of a cutscene, but it wasn't for more than 3 seconds anyway.The loading times are way too long though. The one that really stands out is when you die. After dying it takes a huuuge amout of time for the ""reload"" text to appear, staying in a black screen for more that 10 seconds. That forced me to constantly quick save so I don't die and have to wait for the black screen to disappear, I reloaded the save before the final blow.The graphics at first felt very weird to me. The whole prologue has this yellow overlay and makes the scenery look cartoony and fake. After the prologue is over the graphics look just right. Lots of greenery, beautiful scenery and an amazing view. Story:   I had no trouble understanding the story of ""The Witcher 1"", but this one was too much for me. I found it very difficult to follow. I often asked myself: Why does this guy do this ? Why is this here ? Why can't I just do this instead of this and all our troubles will be gone? The multiple choices were great though because I didn't like certain characters in the game and I wanted to see them suffer. Choosing to kill someone instead of saving them gave me the feel that I am in control of Gerald's life and I am not just there for the ride. This opens up the option to replay the game and have a different experience. I will definitely replay the game again in the future. Combat system A HUGE improvement over the combat system in The Witcher 1 in my opinion. There is just so much more to do than just mashing the left mouse button. You can dodge, parry, set traps, use mutagens to increase your abilities, meditate to drink potions and more. Unfortunately some of these options are completely unnecessary. I never once used a trap and never threw a dagger at someone's face.The meditation system is terribly implemented. In order to drink a potion (something which will decide the outcome of the battle) you have to meditate. You can only meditate before a battle and not during it. Then how the hell am I supposed to know when exactly a battle is gonna start ? How can I know when to prepare ? I know it looks more realistic this way, but in my opinion the game suffers because of it. This forced me to constantly quicksave after moving 20 meters because I didn't know when a battle wound start. Controls: The controls are not bad, what annoys me is that one key is used for so many actions. For instance the left mouse button is used to: attack, put out fires, jump down, climb up, talk, open doors and pick up items. I play on a PC, I should have the option to choose, not to have everything on the same key. I often picked up items I didn't want instead of opening a door, or climbed down a ledge instead of picking up an item. This adds to the frustration I mentioned earlier. Freedom: ... or the lack there of. There is not much freedom in movement. The Witcher 1 suffered from this too. The world is big, but it doesn't feel big at all. There is a pre-determined path you have to walk on. What if I want to go behind this house, or go and see this bush up close ? I can't. The world is very limited in terms of where you can go. Another thing is the ledges. I can't jump down from a half a meter tall ledge without clicking the left mouse button and waiting for Gerald to align himself to the exact spot where he can jump down and wait for an animation. I cannot just jump down from anywhere, no, I have to find the ledge where it says: jump down and then click on it. both TW1 and TW2 suffer from this and really slow down the game play a lot. Speaking of that... Gameplay: This is a story-driven game and unfortunately the gameplay will be constantly interrupted by a cutscene. I swear the cutscenes are so abundant that you can't walk 50 meters before being interrupted by a villager or a dwarf wanting to arm wrestle me. Not much gameplay to be had here. Fortunately the battles and especially the boss battles are very well made and some take a long time to complete without an interruption. Length: I was really surprised by how short the game felt. That must be because about 40% of the game is cutscenes or dialogue. If felt really short. Even after replaying the first 2 hours, starting from scratch, completing the game, spending an hour or 2 on arena mode, the game still felt very short for some reason. I mean it's 2 times shorter than The Witcher 1 and that game did not have so many cutscenes. ( 39 hours in TW1, 21 hours in TW2). Side missions: While the first game had very lengthy side mission, which made sence and gave you great benefits after completing them, this one  has none of that. Most (maybe 80%) of the side missions consist of: kill X number of enemies in this area and bring me proof, or win X number of arm wrestling contests, or win X number of dice poker games. Speaking of which, dice poker was my favorite distraction in TW1, in this one the dice are way too dark and hard to see, the symbols on them are almost identical, so I avoided playing it, that's unfortunate because I really loved that mini-game in TW1. Other small nit-picky things, which didn't fit anywhere else: + Boobs: You will see boobs, lots and lots of boobs. You will see and touch at least 5 pairs of boobs, if you search for them, you might get to see even 10 pairs.- Mission markers: Very difficult to determine where exactly they are. Often you will be standing on one, only to figure out that it is several floors below you. Now you have to find another way to get to it. Even games from 2002 had mission markers that indicated if the objective is above of below you and actually made sense (GTA Vice City)- Vergen: There is this city in Chapter 2 that has the worst layout ever. I am willing to bet that about an hour and a half of my playtime was spent trying to figure out how to get to a lower lever or find where exactly the mission marker is located. This chapter made me stop playing for about a month because of how annoying the layout of the city was.=================================================There is more to talk about, but I will leave it here because I ran out of characters. If you have questions then ask away, I will answer everybody. That's it for the review, I recommend the game, I paid 4 euro for it on the summer sale, but would not buy it for full price. The game definitely does not deserve the ""best RPG ever"" award and does not even come close to it. It is highly overrated and does not deserve a score higher than 7.5/10.Please play The Witcher 1 first, it was incredible and this one is a downgrade from the original.			",38,11,1,4,1,0,4

												In many aspect this game is better than Witcher 3 especially when it comes to consequences of your choices,graphics still looks great.This is the first game which i felt treating me like an adult.If you played the Wild Hunt you probably won't want to play this due to older and less fun gameplay but if you didn't play Wild Hunt, first try this one.

												If you've got the patience to deal with being thrown directly into a world without having your hand held, this is honestly one of the best RPGs and stories you can play. Grabs you like a good book does, and encourages you to do the work necessary to uncover all it has to offer. An excellent game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An excellent rpg with great soundtrack and dark humour where your choices does make a difference. The game has pretty interesting lore. I suggest you play the first game or read the books to have a better understanding of the story. The graphics were pretty good for an 2012 game. I find that their dialogues can be quite humourous at times. Be warned however, as this game's combat system punishes those who rush into the fight without preparation. Use everything in your arsenal including potions, spells, equipments and buffs to fight your enemies. The only problem with this game is that it always crashes when you have a lot of saves. All in all, I'd give it a solid 9/10.Glad I spent money on such a dedicated team. Look up CD PROJEKT ;)			",65,8,2,13,4,0,12

												After finishing the Witcher 3, I decided to replay the Wicher 1 and eventually Witcher 2 I never fully played back in the day, to complete the story and this experience. I can never tell which part has my favorite storyline, they are all so well written and interwoven so each one is marvellous and feels like a brilliant piece of a larger set. The gameplay itself playing this part in 2016 does feel a bit clumsy since this isn't the Witcher 3's open world free movement and you end up feeling like going through a labyrinth half of the time. However the graphics still look amazing, the story is even more amazing, there are choices, there is politics, there is action, drama, love-making, a little bit of everything. It's a build-up to the Witcher 3 and I have seen many people say you don't need to have played 2 in order to pick up 3, but I definately wish I had played this one first, so i wold recommend doing that. It's brillaint, well-worth it and gives you the background for the next installment. I really hope they make another witcher game. 9.9/10 for me.			",17,13,0,4,1,0,7

You know, you could just go about your life not playing a game that was actually developed for the personal computer platform which is built upon the best graphics engine to grace the industry, you could also not experience a game that treats you like a grown adult rather than an imbecile. It would also be completely fine that you wouldn't want to support a game that has improved virtually every single component from the first game which won countless awards and won the hearts and minds of the computer role-playing populous. Yeah, I bet you'd feel like a cool guy.			",450,130,11,45,32,3,63

												I don't do reviews often (that's my friend HOTSHOT's job and specialty, hehe) but this game really deserves one from me.Simply one of the best RPGs I have ever played in my entire life. Amazing story (follow-up to The Witcher 1 in some ways but with a few new twists in the plot), awesome gameplay and really memorable characters. Keep in mind that the game has a bit of a ""steep"" learning curve when it comes to the combat mechanics. You really need to kind of ""study"" and pay attention to your enemies' moves/patterns (sort of like Dark Souls but not near as difficult) because you die pretty quickly, even on Normal difficulty.You need to get this game, even if you don't like RPGs, just the story itself is so compelling that you will have the desire to finish the game just to see how it unfolds. Buy it. Buy it. Buy it.			",168,7,20,18,7,1,5

												Amazing game! Play through twice to get both sides of the story. Combat was great and challenging especially at harder difficulties. If you are planning on playing The Witcher 3, definately go back and play the first two games. It will give you a lot of perspective about the world and why the events in three are unfolding as they are.			",110,19,0,16,6,0,7

												Honestly im torn on the witcher 2, one the first hand it has so many improvements to the first game. On the other the story ending seems extremely rushed, a 4th act would have made this from a great game to an instant classic.The story continue to be amazing however the use of ""ploughing"" nagged me something awfull.The Combat is by far the best of all 3 games, being challeging and so bloody rewarding that forced me to change style multiple times in the game in order to become just that little bit more effective which makes it even more rewarding when beating each challenge that geralt faces. The first and epsecially the third games don´t do this to nearly as great an effect imo.The alchemy system is not nearly as good imo with potions and especially oil lasting wayyy to short cause of a bloody upgrade tree :< i will take my aard and igni upgrades thank yougrachics are still extremely good even 4 years down the line however it seems that cd-red took of bit more than they could chew with quite the few grapichs glitches even in the ""enhanced edition"" Which just leaves me with my biggest complaint! Since i don´t want to spoil the story i will just say the ending(s) feel super rushed and it´s just one gaint infodump that leads up to a gaint war that in the witcher 3 isn´t played up nearly as much making it super anti-climatic. Also as i said the game really could have gone with a 4th act as the games ending again feels aprupt.Note: if all you want is the sex scenes, youtube it cause its just the most awkward thing to watch 3d models rub against eachother-.-Note 2: this game is quite a bit shorter than the witcher 1 and 3 as seen here:Witcher 1: 50 hours (50% of sidequests)Witcher 2: 30 hours (about 60-70% sidequests)Witcher 3: err im at 182 hours atm and i think at 100% (this game is soo ♥♥♥♥ing good)Lets grade it:Story: B+Combat: A+Graphics: BValue for money (19.99 euro): AOverall Grade: A (Must buy)			",178,41,7,15,38,3,34

												this game's an old dusty uncle of a game (came out in like 2010 or whatever,) but it's still worth playing. The world is great and your choices matter. They're hard choices for the most part, too.The bad stuff included not being able to fast travel (makes you more careful and appreciate the detail however,) and it's really really laughably gratuitous. don't play this game with your mom.I hated the game until I gave up the controller and used the M+KB as god intended. Combat was pretty easy so don't be scared to bump it up a notch. Steal everything you possibly can and make cool armor out of all the bear asses you pick up.E: lol one of the negative reviews on steam says theres too few sexual encounters. i was knee deep in the poontang it was embarrassing to play it with my large adult sons next to me hooting and hollering			",121,16,1,30,15,3,33

												This game is about our beloved witcher, Geralt of Rivia. Join him on an epic journey to clean his name and help the kingdom from falling apart. This is a game where your choices will have some affect on the later parts of the game. The games about The Witcher are very story-driven, so I would recommend you to read or play through the first ""The Witcher"". The combat is fun, and not only Hack and Slash, so it is challenging, and after some fights you will need to combine attacks with potions, poisons and Signs, magic spells Witchers use. The story is great, and after a while you will find out that Geralt is a character with great depth and a incredible backstory. If you want a monsterslaying game, a game with good story and atmosphere or just a game with good combat, this game is for you.			",61,12,0,12,3,1,7

												Witcher 2's great in all fronts, graphics, gameplay, story, lore, charecters and so on. The action-RPG's a unique one, having been developed by CDProjekt Red, a Polish dev company bringing us a real prideful offering as to how a western action-RPG presents itself on the global stage. Unique in what regards?Positive:W2 has plenty of choices in the story arc, even outside the main forks in the road such as Roche's path, or Iorveth's path, there's certianly multiple ways to handel meeting up with bosses, and other key plot points. There's ways to close/not initiate certian mission b/c of xyz, so I sugest watching the ""Changing Locations"" vid from the devs on the multiple stories. W2 is indeed practically 1.5 games in 1.  The dialogue trees fill a convergence in the emersiveness and gets away with some pecilular takes on the cast's rogueish attitudes, Geralt picking up on chicks, the dice minigame, midevil slang, such as bugger, wh0r3son, ba$tard, all terms you don't really hear in the modern Americas, but used in Scottland, the UK, and such, however b/c this is a myere'd and dark time, synergysticaly it all plays to the story. Negative:The combat can be handled via simple mash to progress, however if you get into the rolling and dodgeing, you can fine tune your fighting tactics. Geralt's the archetypical battlemage w/ rather straightforward skilltrees for wizardry, and alchemy, however his swordplay and dodgeing whilst in combat are his coup de' grass. The skilltree progressions are linear, un-complicated, and arguabley a bit of a toss. Wizardy allows you to throw spells at a one shot per meter rate in battle, giving enemies status effects such as catching fire, while the alchemy tree has you crafting interesting potions that, unfortunately, can only be used just before the battle commences. The weapon/armor progression system's unique in an unfavorable way in regards to the story's tendancy to branch meaning you can miss a NPC needed that would have given you quests, or items, or even find yourself in custody, or in a dundgeon, and if you didn't explore it just right, you will lose your confiscated gear.W2's submenu's and UI are still difficult to nagivage, and aren't user friendly, however they're mods to it.Witcher 2 has a modding community as well, w/ game dev's even adding to the combat w/ advances from Witcher 3.

												I understand why people love this game—I get it, it has fantastic graphics, a great story, wonderful music and characters—so much to love. But what in the liviing hell is up with the terrible menus and AWFUL controls?! ""Oh, I see I'm surrounded, better roll around and make sure to attack in the direction I'm facing""*Geralt attacks blindly in opposite direction while getting hacked in the backWhy can I not look at the key bindings in-game?Why can I not adjust the graphic settings in-game?Why does Geralt REFUSE to attack the guy with the shield who is on his &$#*ing KNEES?! He's right there, Geralt, it doesn't take a #$*ing witcher to NOT swing your bloody sword over his head, or for some unknown ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason turn your back to him while attacking in the general direction of the camera.I want to love this game. I love everything else about it. But without something resembling competent gameplay, a game is NOTHING to me. If the gameplay and UI were any clunkier, it would a box of rocks (that you pick up with the same button as attack, because yes, the gameplay here makes THAT little sense).This game isn't hard (I think I'm one of the few people who thought Dark Souls 2 was too easy), but I feel like I'm being punished by simply playing the game.What a massive dissapointment.**I am still going to try to get into this game (again), and if my opinion changes I'll update, but this is now my third time, and I still hate the combat in this game.

I am playing it on a very high difficulty level as that is the only way for unique items to be available in the game, so I'm not sure if the battling is challenging on the lower settings. My experience so far has been a difficult one so far :)The graphics engine is absolutely amazing and if you have a beast of a machine you will fully enjoy the beauty of this game.

												Easily the best RPG I have played in years.A rich and vivid world that is home to a story that defies typical fantasy cliches. It's a story of complex political intrigue and not the same old good versus evil hogwash.  A rather challenging real time combat system plus the gorgeous graphics make this one of the overall most complete experiences of 2011.Every RPG fan must play this and people that just like a good story as well as graphics freaks will also get their moneys worth out of this for sure.LINUX Port warning (June 2014): Currently the port suffers from abysmal performance issues and quite a number of stability problems due to it being made by a company that used a wrapper instead of porting it native. They are currently working on fixing it but I would not recommend buying it at full price if you are going to play it on Linux. Sale discounts leave the game at around 4€ which might be worth the gamble.			",225,61,1,23,19,1,27

You no longer need to follow a specific story line that was designed and waiting for you to play, now you can make a story of your own. The game might be a bit hard to get into it but after you do, you won't stop enjoying it. In this game, you also can try out all kinds of mods after you start to get board of it.

												Like a little action in your RPG? I know I for one have been disappointed with many offerings in the ARPG genre, but The Witcher series has done alot to win my interest back to a once shining section of the video game world. There is a lot too this game, while I feel its not for me to break down all the flaws and finesse's of the sequel to The Witcher, I will point out that you will be hard pressed to find another game anything like it in its lore. In fact, everything in The Witcher is different from the normal; from a very interesting system progression system to the combat mechinics (which come with a fairly steep curve for those who havent the patience to learn the practice it takes to time blows and parries). There is alot to like about this game. I've come only to write this ""Review"" to tell you that if you havent tried this series out dont worry, The Witcher 2 story brings new players in nicely without making it feel patched into the story. Other than that, this is a AAA rpg that has added the action combat element near flawlessly. Its got its kinks and there are some questionable interface choices but really Im nit picking because there isnt a whole lot to complain about. Just buy the game. Its worth your dollars if your a fan of fantasy rpg with action combat. The difference here is the difficulty isnt insulting and the depth is rewarding. Get the damn game, okay?

												One of the greatest RPGs ever made. The biggest positive of this game is it's non linearity- there are many difficult choices that we will have to make. Second chapter of the game looks completly different depending on our previous decisions. The story is pretty decent, just a bit ""too political"" in my opinion, but all those movie-like cutscenes are downright gorgeous. It just makes it really easy to feel involed in what's going on. Combat is ok, sort of a tactical hack & slash. It's up to us whether we'll help ourselves with magical signs, traps, potions or with little of everything. The only two flaws that I can think of is difficulty arch (game is hard at the beggining and gets quite easy later), and the fact that it could really be longer. Takes 20+ hours to finish the main story, and 30+ hours to finish it with all the side quests. But still I think it's a great game and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes action RPGs.

Posted: December 22, 2014
												A good successor to the first game. That said, It did have problems.  The gameplay, more specifically the combat, in my opinion didn't get better, in fact it just turned more frustrating.For starters, the targetting system is an utter failure.  Now you say, ""Can you elaborate?"".  My response to that is not really, so if you are expecting Batman Arkham Asylum smoothness in regards to targetting, prepare to be disappointed.  Second, the practicality of Geralt's sword combat.  When in comparison to the first game it had three fighting stances:  The strong stance, reserved for heavy/bulky enemies; the fast stance, for the quick and agile enemies; and the group stance, for those times when you were outnumbered and surrounded.  In the Witcher 2, those stances were thrown away and combat became streamlined by replacing it with light attacks by clicking the left mouse and heavy attacks by pressing the right mouse.  That doesn't sound bad, right?  In some cases, yes, it worked out fine.  But there were some instances where this new combat mechanic just sucked completely.The big problem is that the new mechanic didn't leave it as straightforward as the first game.  Geralt in this game does his super stylish spins in the worst of occasions.  Where in the Witcher 1, he did his spin attacks more in his group stance to keep from being overwhelmed, and in this game he does his spins for the sake of spinning, whether you are surrounded or not.  Sometimes when you want him to do a wide slash spin when surrounded, he doesn't, or when you want to do powerful but quick attacks on one or 2 opponents, he does his spins and all that time he used up spinning he gets hit like the idiot he was.  TL;DR  You have less control of the swordplay in the Witcher 2 in comparison to the Witcher 1.Next up is the potions/enhancements.  Oh god...  This was probably the most frustrating bit.  In the Witcher 1, you could go into your inventory and drink a potion.  Before or during combat, and the effects lasted much longer.  Simple as that.In the Witcher 2, you have to predict when combat will show up, sit down, drink, have him♥♥♥♥♥♥around for another 10 seconds, stand up, then you are good to go.  And no, you can't drink potions during combat.  So, if you show up at a boss fight with no potions in your system, you are screwed.

												Like a little action in your RPG? I know I for one have been disappointed with many offerings in the ARPG genre, but The Witcher series has done alot to win my interest back to a once shining section of the video game world. There is a lot too this game, while I feel its not for me to break down all the flaws and finesse's of the sequel to The Witcher, I will point out that you will be hard pressed to find another game anything like it in its lore. In fact, everything in The Witcher is different from the normal; from a very interesting system progression system to the combat mechinics (which come with a fairly steep curve for those who havent the patience to learn the practice it takes to time blows and parries). There is alot to like about this game. I've come only to write this ""Review"" to tell you that if you havent tried this series out dont worry, The Witcher 2 story brings new players in nicely without making it feel patched into the story. Other than that, this is a AAA rpg that has added the action combat element near flawlessly. Its got its kinks and there are some questionable interface choices but really Im nit picking because there isnt a whole lot to complain about. Just buy the game. Its worth your dollars if your a fan of fantasy rpg with action combat. The difference here is the difficulty isnt insulting and the depth is rewarding. Get the damn game, okay?

												One of the greatest RPGs ever made. The biggest positive of this game is it's non linearity- there are many difficult choices that we will have to make. Second chapter of the game looks completly different depending on our previous decisions. The story is pretty decent, just a bit ""too political"" in my opinion, but all those movie-like cutscenes are downright gorgeous. It just makes it really easy to feel involed in what's going on. Combat is ok, sort of a tactical hack & slash. It's up to us whether we'll help ourselves with magical signs, traps, potions or with little of everything. The only two flaws that I can think of is difficulty arch (game is hard at the beggining and gets quite easy later), and the fact that it could really be longer. Takes 20+ hours to finish the main story, and 30+ hours to finish it with all the side quests. But still I think it's a great game and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes action RPGs.

												A good successor to the first game. That said, It did have problems.  The gameplay, more specifically the combat, in my opinion didn't get better, in fact it just turned more frustrating.For starters, the targetting system is an utter failure.  Now you say, ""Can you elaborate?"".  My response to that is not really, so if you are expecting Batman Arkham Asylum smoothness in regards to targetting, prepare to be disappointed.  Second, the practicality of Geralt's sword combat.  When in comparison to the first game it had three fighting stances:  The strong stance, reserved for heavy/bulky enemies; the fast stance, for the quick and agile enemies; and the group stance, for those times when you were outnumbered and surrounded.  In the Witcher 2, those stances were thrown away and combat became streamlined by replacing it with light attacks by clicking the left mouse and heavy attacks by pressing the right mouse.  That doesn't sound bad, right?  In some cases, yes, it worked out fine.  But there were some instances where this new combat mechanic just sucked completely.The big problem is that the new mechanic didn't leave it as straightforward as the first game.  Geralt in this game does his super stylish spins in the worst of occasions.  Where in the Witcher 1, he did his spin attacks more in his group stance to keep from being overwhelmed, and in this game he does his spins for the sake of spinning, whether you are surrounded or not.  Sometimes when you want him to do a wide slash spin when surrounded, he doesn't, or when you want to do powerful but quick attacks on one or 2 opponents, he does his spins and all that time he used up spinning he gets hit like the idiot he was.  TL;DR  You have less control of the swordplay in the Witcher 2 in comparison to the Witcher 1.Next up is the potions/enhancements.  Oh god...  This was probably the most frustrating bit.  In the Witcher 1, you could go into your inventory and drink a potion.  Before or during combat, and the effects lasted much longer.  Simple as that.In the Witcher 2, you have to predict when combat will show up, sit down, drink, have him♥♥♥♥♥♥around for another 10 seconds, stand up, then you are good to go.  And no, you can't drink potions during combat.  So, if you show up at a boss fight with no potions in your system, you are screwed.  You either have to go back a save or two, drink the potions on the prior knowledge of meeting the boss/hard part and beat it/them, or you have to bite the bullet and beat it/them without potions.  Hilariously enough, you can enhance your armor and weapons during combat.  Why not stay consistant?  I don't know.  Even worse, the potion effects only last 10 minutes (a tiny bit more if you have devote your levels to the alchemy skills).  TL;DR  Your potion usage is restricted (in comparison to the prequel again).What else...  The game is shorter in content overall and in my opinion feels just a little bit more linear and less open.Oh, and the game's soundtrack doesn't feel as memorable as the first.So far, everything from the above is dedicated to those who played the first game.

												TLDR:-This game is phenominal, buy it.Long Version:My first experience with The Witcher was the third game. I decided to play through the first two for background then the third one again. I expected the first two games to be a drag, especially after being spoiled by the graphics and gameplay of The Witcher 3. I was pleasantly surpised, to the point that I decided to restart the first game after skipping most of the side quests in the first two chapters. I also decided to read the novels and short stories to gain a greater understanding of the characters and story in the games. I am extremely glad I did. Not only do they obviously give you a much greater understanding of the aforementioned elements, but they are also phenomenal stories by themselves. This game has stood the test of time surprisingly well, and is definitely worth your money, even at full price, though, if you are willing to wait, you could get it much cheaper on sale, as I did.

												This sequel really lives up to the name. The battling system, character development and abilities have been completely changed. I am playing it on a very high difficulty level as that is the only way for unique items to be available in the game, so I'm not sure if the battling is challenging on the lower settings. My experience so far has been a difficult one so far :)The graphics engine is absolutely amazing and if you have a beast of a machine you will fully enjoy the beauty of this game. I sometimes just stand around and admire the landscape. As with the first Witcher there are some of mini-games for you to spend some time on.Whether you are a Witcher fan or not.. this is an exceptional RPG!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is superb in almost every aspect. It has a very well connected story with mature content and its ""replayability"" is  enough to spend more than 40-50 hours playing it. The game is closer to a linear than a non-linear game, but in a certain way that's what makes the story special, because you can realize how the decisions you make change the story/world through each chapter (still, the player has a wide freedom in each chapter, excluding the prologue/epilogue). The script is written in a way that sometimes decisions are extremely hard to make, something that I liked a lot. Sidequest in this game are well made and worth your time since they are mainly separate stories which will engulf you even more in the game, also, they sometimes have *minor* impact in the main plot.The combat and skill tree is ok, much better than in TW1 IMO, in the end, it depends on your tastes.The graphics are really cool and it has been a game to take as reference to make benchmarks.The soundtrack is awesome and every track fits every part of the game. A must have for RPG lovers. 9/10			",93,8,3,18,7,1,2

												The Witcher series turned out to be one of my gaming diamond. It's not about graphics, but strong plot and solid RPG elements will stick with you in every moments of the game. The Witcher 2 still remain its standard of story (some parts are modified from The Witcher novel). You might want to catch up from The Witcher 1 to gain full experience of the story. The highlight is various decisions along three main chapters which point you out and force you to deal with consequence. This give high replayability like The Witcher 1.The combat system is changed from point-and-click (The Witcher 1) to dynamic hit-and dodge (The Witcher 2). For me, the combat is greatly flexible, but less complexity in strategy (The Witcher 1 gives your more different sword styles and Sign charge). The skill system is quite stricted than The Witcher 1 skill pattern). However,  the game provides you a lot of armors and weapons choice (Yeah, you can hit boss with a scoop).QTE is also another factor that's shouldn't be in RPG game, I feel kinda disappointed they put QTE in the end of boss fight and fistfight minigame. Cause the game lacks some challenges.I may complain too much about its problem. However, it's just minor issues and I understand it's hard to keep its previous standard if you attempt to change something. The Witcher 2 still one of my strong RPG game all the time. even it's not deepest, longest, or toughest, but I feels very very enjoyable in every moment of this game and I have high hope for The Witcher 3.

The battle system is unique and can be challenging, and the choices you make can literally change entire chapters. The fighting mechanics could use a little tweeking, but the faults are minor at best.

												CD Projekt weaves an impressive, mature & complex storyline that evolves based on your decisions.  I'm really in awe seeing how my choices made a deep impact.  In one playthrough, Geralt aided the murder of a king.  (He deserved it!)  In another, Geralt was a liberator.  The third time, our ""hero"" was in it for himself reigning death & having mobs have their way.Other games are just too linear by following a single path to a given destination.  The Witcher 2 destroys the mold by varying the direction of the game.  By the 2nd chapter you've chosen a side which massively affects everything:  allies may now be enemies, where you end up is completely different, and those you saved may have dire consequences later on.With multiple endings, I highly recommend this RPG.

												Now I sit here with the Witcher 2 finally finished.I am not a big fan of it's combat but then I am spoiled with the Dark Souls series. The game although bring a lot to the table. Anyone playing Crusader Kings 2 will feel like they are playing a minor hero character in a big world of politics and schemes. It is brutal world, a beautiful, brutal world! The story continues from the first game and puts Geralt in a messy messy time full of troubles. This game was released same year as Dragon Age 2 and Skyrim. It is probably not as big and as long as these two but I think it out perform Dragon Age 2 with flavour and story, I care more for the characters in Witcher 2 than those in Dragon Age 2. In Dragon Age 2 I wanted to kill them. In Skyrim I did not care even that much about NPCs and many places felt very empty. The Witcher is a very gorgeous game. As I said before the combat is not my favourite but I can see if people prefer this over the more unique Witcher 1 combat system. The sound is good and the voice actors are in my opinion very good. The models also come in more flavours this time compared to Witcher 1. It feels a bit shorter than Witcher 1 but comes with a big replayability with the a split in the road. I do hope that all your options, Kill A, Let A go, Save X over Z, Help Nr 1 and fight Nr 2. I hope these options have consquences in Witcher 3. The game is not perfect but to consider what a failure the big guys at Bioware itself released this year and how they continued to release overrated games with plenty of flaws, it is hard then to judge this Polish studios struggles. It is a excellent  game in a grim world! Showing the darkness of humanity and the chaos errupting from a dead king. Resembling the chaos in Europe in the middle ages in a bit. It is a grim bloody world, full of prejudice, hate, treachery and  destruction. But also lot of comeraderie, courage and love shown. 9 out of 10. Trigger Warning: It is not a game for you SJW wimps!

												Pros :+ Pretty good graphics.Not THAT good,though+ Beautifully written story line+ Tons of things and quests to do+ A lot of items variation available,from potions,weapons,enhancements,etc,so there's a lot of thing to find,craft,or buy so you won't get bored after several hours+ The words you choose to speak will affect the story+ Uncensored nude girls characters sometimes appears along the game story.This game even has some sex scenes in it.I'm not sure to put this in the Pros.But since I'm a guy,so...Cons :- I don't really like the combat system.It's a little bit crude and it's impossible for me to win without getting hit if multiple opponents attack me.- Characters have no expression.It's vital to add facial expression and good voice acting in a story rich game.The voice actor for Geralt (main character,the white haired guy) isn't a really good one for me,and there's no facial expression at all- Crude animations during the 'talking' session where you choose what do you want Geralt to speak- Strange movement animation.The animation when you walk to right/left/back direction is really,really bad.- Controller support is a failure for me.I can't manage my inventory at all using my controller.No,mine is not a third party controller.I don't know the problem is me or the game,though.Overall,the cons are meaningless and it's totally acceptable and it won't ruin your gameplay.Unless you can only play with a controller,of course.I love this game so much for its story line and the ability to control the way Geralt respond to other characters (not for its nude girls and sex scenes).This game is totally worth it an I'm really looking forward to play The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt.Buy this game if you want to know the whole story.

												If you appreciate a well-done story with great characters and RPG elements, then you'll be hooked on this game after the prologue. The battle system is unique and can be challenging, and the choices you make can literally change entire chapters. The fighting mechanics could use a little tweeking, but the faults are minor at best. If you're one of those individuals who enjoy, or don't have an issue with, consistent looting, crafting, and trading, then that won't be an issue either.Visuals are sexy, too (No, I'm not just talking about the occasional boobs).

												Unique and rewarding experience since I played it on Dark mode strait away.Armed with patience finished a game in about 50 h (all quests done going Roche's path) .Used the combination of swordsmanship tree and magic tree.Prepare to die a lot until you learn the mechanics of the fighting and using oil's, potion's and skill's.Great story and lore (reading the books optional :)) maybe a bit too much politics unlike the first Witcher game.All in all one of my favorite games all time for this genre, I recommend playing the first game which is a little dated by now but equally good and fun. With the release of Witcher 3 this trilogy should become one of the masterpieces of gaming industry. Recommend highly for anyone looking for a great action role-playing game.

												CD Projekt weaves an impressive, mature & complex storyline that evolves based on your decisions.  I'm really in awe seeing how my choices made a deep impact.  In one playthrough, Geralt aided the murder of a king.  (He deserved it!)  In another, Geralt was a liberator.  The third time, our ""hero"" was in it for himself reigning death & having mobs have their way.Other games are just too linear by following a single path to a given destination.  The Witcher 2 destroys the mold by varying the direction of the game.  By the 2nd chapter you've chosen a side which massively affects everything:  allies may now be enemies, where you end up is completely different, and those you saved may have dire consequences later on.With multiple endings, I highly recommend this RPG.

												I had this game sitting in my Steam library for sometime and was reluctant to play it due to playing the first witcher game with that god awful combat system! - But, Oneday i was bored and decided to fire this game up just to see how ""bad"" it was. ♥♥♥♥! I couldn't of been more wrong! - I won't say it's perfect because it isn't, with that god awful running animation and the fact that sometimes it does lag out a bit, But the story is amazing! I honestly feel like I will become addicted not only to this game but the entire trilogy (You know.. if you can excuse the first game). If you love RPG's and are looking for something with a great story, then from what I have seen so far. This is the game you want!!!			",90,14,3,13,19,0,8

												A lot can be said about this game. It has its great moments, but also some very lame sides. First, the positive things about this game: It is a nicely done rpg with lots of costumization possibilities. You can not travel between cities and have to follow the plot of the game, but once you're in a city, you are free to explore it however you want to. There are lots of side quests and the main plot itself is very interesting. The side quests are also meaningful and mostly fund, not of the ""fetch me this flowe"" kind. The game is clearly made for adults, since there's a lot of brutality and nudity in it. This is nice to see in an era where almost every game is being made for all audiences. The crafting system is also one of the strong features of Witcher 2. You can craft weapons, armor, potions, traps etc.On the other hand, there are some things which ruin the game. The checkpoint (aka autosave) system is a failure. You watch a cutscene, you listen to a conversation and then get to the fight scene. If you die, you don't get to fight again immediately; no you have to watch the cutscene again (which you can skip btw) and listen to the conversation (which you can click through). It is very annoying to constantly have to click your way to the fight after every death and it only adds to your frustration. There are also instances in the game where you don't control your main character, but you are rather given the control of a character in the story to fight. The game is almost telling you ""Hey remember all those skills you gained through collecting experience and all? Yeah, they're gone. Have fun!"". This is very very frustrating. In the end, you should make up your mind: can you endure the frustration of this game to enjoy its exciting plot and positive features?tl;dr Witcher 2 is a beautiful game with some very annoying bull**** in it.

Combat is fun, though I played on Easy mode. Normal is probably better for most people.			",90,49,0,62,13,2,28

												Haunting and atmospheric just like the first in the series, and very fun and challenging to play through. The series seems to be becoming more action/adventure oriented than an RPG meant for purists, but what this game does it does very well. The combat system has become more oriented toward player skill rather than Geralt's attributes, but this turned out to be pretty fun once I got the hang of the controls. Branching storylines encourage replayability, as in the first game. At first I had a problem with the excessive use of bloom and shader effects, though these things are implemented far better and more artistically after the first chapter, so I suggest everyone keep these settings enabled. Overall this is a very well-written and clever game and I would recommend it to fans of the first game or fans of the fantasy fiction genre in general. You won't be disappointed!

												Played it in late 2015 with Windows 8.1. I did not play Witcher 1 previously.This game has its flaws. It is not perfect. Among the bad things, we have:- Several Crashes. In my 35 gameplay hours, it crashed like 4-6 times. - Awful UX. I didn't like the menus. For instance, when buying a new weapon, you don't have the option to compare the new weapon and your actual weapon. You have to exit vendor's menu, enter your inventory, memorize your weapon, and then enter vendor's menu and compare both weapons. Awful.- The combat is a little rough.Among the good things:+ The story is great. I really liked the story and the plot twists. + Your choices matter.  There are several endings based on your decisions.+ The bosses are incredibly hard yet fun. I cursed at the screen several times, yet I couldn't stop playing.+ Graphics are nice even as today.+ Playing Witcher 1 previously is not a requirement.			",140,32,2,14,9,1,8

												This game was good, I don't really know what to say about it.Amazing soundtrack.The artwork is appealing and it transmits the atmosphere that the game is living in.The combat system I don't know I think I liked more of witcher 1 combat system although in w2 it's much more free so it has is advantages and disadvantages, there was also some fights that were ridiculously hard for example the first one against letho, you do that and you beat the game honestly.The story was ofc really good I think, good interesting characters, but I have to say the ending was a♥♥♥♥♥♥cliffhanger, it's like they gave you pizza and you only drink the soda, but whatever. Also Letho for the badass character he was I think it deserved a bit of more an highlight throughout the game, you just get to know more and see more of Letho at the ending but again that's probably the way how the game ended abruptly.But it was a really good game overall.

The Witcher 2: Assassins of KingsPros:. Well written, easy to follow story. A lot of choices which are divided into 'Major' and 'Minor', the major will affect the story and the minor will usually be something personal to Geralt, such as a choice between Orens (the games currency) or some gear. All of the main characters are fantastic, and even then, the more minor characters will have some short story behind them. Very good graphics which still hold up today. Good combat for the most part, knowledge is key in this game, if go into some fights without correctly preparing with oils and potions et cetera, you're probably going to die very fast. A good 'rewardingly difficult' system similar to Dark Souls (although not as hard) . Fairly good replayabilty. Good game length for the priceCons. Game is pretty unoptimized, I bought this on my old pc, which was bad but still above the recommended requirements and couldn't this game at a stable frame rate at all. Now, however with my 390, the framerate dips from the usual 60 (on ultra) all the way down to 20 in certain situations. The game is quite buggy, such as the game not allowing you to do simple things like climb a rock which can halt your progress into the game. The horrible targeting system the game uses for its combat, you can only target one enemy at once which can screw up entire scenarios as the target is chosen via who is at the centre of the camera, which leads to things like being unable to attack another enemy with easeOverallI give this game a 8.1/10 and heavily recommend it to any Witcher or RPG fan for its great narrative, characters, and gameplay, but be wary of the games bad optimisation and bugs.

												I'm still not sure what to think of this game. Visually it's absolutely beautiful. The story and the lore are great, there's a branching path which makes the game play differently, there's no ""right"" and ""wrong""... But the actual game itself, as a game with its technicalities and mechanics, falls short of my expectations.The user interface is confusing, and not only because there are no tooltips:The only witcher sign whose purpose I could remember was Igni, because it burned things.Inventory management is a mess; they have tried simplifying it compared to the first game, but again, without any tooltips, the only sorting options I figured out were ""by newest obtained"" and ""by most weight"". The others... I have no idea what they're about.The character skill tree won't list where mutagen slots are located. I've talked to a couple of people who played the game, and they all mutated their first ability with something stupid. You can't remove the mutagen, so you're stuck with that choice until the end of the game. If you're reading this, don't do it until you're absolutely sure that you chose correctly, because it won't be surprising if you used a lesser mutagen and got a greater mutagen five minutes later.You have to decide early on which path to take: magic, alchemy, swords. Not enough talents to push all three branches.Looting is a problem, as there is no ""highlight loot"" key, and there are no labels. If a corpse leaves more than 4 things to be looted, you won't see them until you enter the loot window. Positioning the character to loot items and rotating the camera is too hard.The map is confusing, especially if you're outside a city. Sometimes it seems you can go a certain way to get somewhere, but it's blocked by some bushes and you have to go back and find an alternate route. You can't leave markers, nor is everything on the map marked: for example, in Flotsam I found a book merchant in a random house.Buying weapons/armor from merchants doesn't let you compare stats to items you own.You can get good items by crafting diagrams, but you have to find someone to craft; Geralt can't do it. He can just make potions. I actually had to use pen and paper to write down what I want and what I need to craft it.Speaking of potions - you can't drink them during a battle. You have to do it before, but... How are you supposed to know you'll be in battle? Some people like it, some don't, but for most, if they desire challenging combat, it'll be a case of ""save often, reload often"".Eventually I dropped down to easy difficulty, stopped caring about my inventory, looting, oils, potions, bombs and all of that, and just concentrated on the story and the quests. Before that, I was fighting the game itself, instead of monsters.And the game became fun.If you want a deep story - go for it. If you want perfect and streamlined game mechanics, go for it still, but you might want to do what I did.Recommended anyway. Looking forward to the third game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some my Pros/ConsPros:+ Mod support+ Ritch storyline+ Nice looking visuals even on low settings+ Perfect soundtracks+ A lot of craftable items+ High quality NPC voice acting+ Fun during monster hunt (preparing traps/poisons/reading up on the creatures etc)Cons:- Unrealistic sword combat. It doesn't feel right. - Unbalanced gameplay mechanics - Oils and potions barely last long enough to be of any use, and forcing you to drink them in meditation mode is tiresome. Also fairly unrealistic and breaks immersion somewhat. Many skills over/underpowered (i.e. dodge-roll, shield sign, alchemy tree etc.)-Clunky UI and menus. Bad sorting options, unintuitive selection design (i.e. hover over recipe with mouse cursor, then press space or enter to complete recipe. but don't click and make sure not to move your mouse away from recipe in list). The map, while looking totally freaking awesome, is almost entirely useless. Many more problems with UI.-Lack of camera controls and options.-Unclear or non-existent tutorials.-Also, doors. OMG DOORS. Another obvious piece of the game programmed with the fortcoming console port in mind.Overall. 6/10.  I can recommend Witcher 2 if you are keen on fantasy setting and magic items crafting...			",59,5,5,10,4,0,0

												I highly recommend this game simply for the facts that the Story is great, It's good looking, the fighting mechanism is really good and it contains hard puzzels (you got to read the quests to make progress).  It's not a rush game (where you kill and proceed) in this game you have to dodge, parry and barrel roll and then strike.  The fighting mechanism is more like dodge until you find a great opportunity to strike and prepare before you go into combat (drinking potions, use poison ETC).The cons though would be the ""target select mechanism"" because when you're fighting a lot of enemys, the character ""Geralt"" attacks (often) the nearest enemy pointed in the direction you're looking at, and also when you have a companion the enemys rather attack your companion than you (which makes the game a lot easier).8/10 IMO ",47,8,0,9,6,0,3

												One of the best RPG I have ever played. Great story telling, great character development and character engagement. The battle system is also very well executed and at some points (and at hard difficulty setting) challenging. Side quests are atmospheric and far from feeling grindy. Morale choices are all over the place and those choices matter and they also alter the experience making replayabilty a must rather than a chore . Graphics are stellar and there are also some mods if you are fun of modding . On the minus side there are are some bugs but nothing game breaking. I had a boss fight stuck and the game could nor progress but this wasn’t often and didn’t ruin my enjoyment. All in all a great game that should not be missed from any RPG fun and its on SALE very very often ;)  ",107,18,3,15,9,0,17

												♥♥♥♥ing Brilliant - Is tied in my Top 3 RPG's of all time list.I originally purchased 'The Witcher' after reading positive reviews about a week after launch - With the Death metal band VADER helming the official music video that I checked out on youtube; it was SOLD for me, I purchased it via Direcct2Drive as it was not on the Steam Platform at that time. TW1 on its launch was hailed by critics and myself for having an amazing story - and even more impressive: (Re-Coding the BioWare ?Aurura?) engine used for Neverwinter Nights into a Third Person Action / Tactical combat system; with optional WASD movement.-As soon as The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings popped up on Steam for pre-order I pre-ordered with huge excitement. I checked out the system requirements and I had just ordered my 560 ti SLI's from that era; along with 120hz monitor and Nvidia 3D Vision 1.0 - -Once it came to launch day I was able to play everything on Ultra aside from having Ubersampling on (Now with my 780 ti's in SLI ubersampling is cake; it was also 100% smooth when I had SLI 680's and SLI 780 GTX MSI OC edition) - The Visauls set the bar for the Genre, perhaps ""in house"" engines in general. The art design was outstanding, dark and gritty edged with realism in every nook and cranny. The lighting/Shadow, weather+day cycles all realistically done in a mind blowing fashion.  ""Nvidia 3D Vision Ready"" - I popped on the original Nvidia 3D vision 1.0 wireless glasses with the old asus 120Hz monitor I had. This may still be the most brilliant 3D vision title ever released. Geralt's swords literally (unsheath and just stand holding it) would pop out in a way that it seemed the blade was coming a foot+ out of the screen and right into my face; the tip of the blade. - I had an entire play in 3D Vision and it was the most astonishing ""3D"" experiences of my lifetime in gaming. I've completed the game 5 times, with one being totally 3D Vision, one Playthru when I got my 680's initially, then began a playthrough that I finished when I received my 780s (each series I had dual SLI) - Seeing the transformation of all ultra with Ubersampling enabled from SLI 560ti's to 680's was outstanding and jaw dropping; then not worrying about hitting 70Cish once I git my 780's was even more-so outstanding -laughs- : I was still being held back a bit in overall performance due to my CPU an AMD 8150 that would bottleneck such great CPU's; and using all 4 slots on my MOBO for ram with an AMD CPU is a no-go idea for performance; as I had 16 gigs of G.Skill ripjaws. - despite this I finished that play, and finally decided to play it with a non ""Vernon Roche"" chapter 2 (yeah I was stubborn, I always intedned on the next play being the completely different chapter 2 but had to keep going with Vernon Roche's ideals as it felt like who I was as a player, and the Geralt I wanted to play as. I upgraded my CPU to an AMD 9370 8 core liquid cooled at 5.0GHz, and grabbed 2x8GB G.Skill Trident X's with very low (fast) timings and higher over-all speed of the ram and saw amazing boosts in all my benchmarks; and Played thru-once more. I began a playthru again; just completing all but one of the interrogation flashbacks with Vernon Roche - When I upgraded my SLI 780's to SLI 780 ti's (Each Nvidia GPUs mentioned have been the MSI Manufactured versions). The 780 Ti being the fastest GPU ever created with 1GHz faster memory speed per card than the prior ""OC Gaming Edition"" 780's I had, and 800 more Cuda cores amongst other very impressive improvments.- Having a 144hz monitor with Nivida G-Sync Kit attached in and working (the asus 144hz Nvidia 3D Vision 2.0 / Nvidia lightboost 24 inch monitor came G-Sync kit ready 6 months prior to G-Sync being announced; I am glad this was the monitor I purchased back then; I was dissapointed when I read about G-Sync specific monitors then elated when I saw this was the only current monitor that was G-Sync Upgradable.- For the most recent play-through I contacted Nvidia for a G-Sync kit; used a phillips head on the back of the monitor and easily plugged in the chip (has a nice clear and labled spot for it to just plug right in) It's hard to even describe the difference until you actually groove with it and see / play with it yourself! My PC is totally ready for Geralt's Finale in the gaming franchise (I have yet to read the original books that the games are based)With many RPG's coming out for each platform; I had a huge J-RPG crush during the SNES-PSX era; Highlights being FF2 cartridge(FF4)-FF3 Cartridge(FF6) and the reason I purchased a PSX for the timeless Final Fantasy Vii, The dissapointing FF8 comes to mind as I forced myself to play it due to hype and having it pre-ordered the same date the Dreamcast was released on 9-9-99, and then despite having amazing adventures on my PC With Baldurs Gate 1-2, Planescape Torment etc - I gave Final Fantasy IX a chance which blew me away and was able to give Square another chance in my book; for the awful FF8; releasing a rather fantastic and ""Interesting FF9"" - Still J-RPG's forced linerality which defenders proclaim ""It's about the story"" (It seems these defenders have never played PLANESCAPE TORMENT or Baldurs Gate 2 The Witcher 1 suffered SOME gameplay and combat elements for an excellent story; Dragon Age Origins and The Witcher 2 had far superior stories than any J-RPG I've played without the lineraty style seen in J-RPG's, but thats a battle between fan's that  will never end as JRPG diehards assume any PC/Western RPG is an Elderscrolls style Open World Title with very poor story (Although Morrowind <3 <3 had a rather excellent story; despite the shallow characters that Bethesda still continues on with) - Perhaps the Witcher 2: Enhanced Edition release on The Xbox 9800 or whatever (Atari Jaguar 720 etc) was an excellent wake up call to many console Atari Joystick gamers; they got to finally experience our 2011 GOTY / RPG of the year; which then was a GOTY candidate and RPG of the year winner again in 2012 due to the Enhanced Edition console release (Confusing indeed.) which brought more revenue and spotlight towards the wonderful minded CDProjektRED; without that occuring and having TW3 be multi-platform (WITH PC as the Ultimate Intended platform still; partnering with Nvidia for hardware owning only options that are mindblowing in the Press Conference highlighting them all by Nvidia <3) - Then perhaps TW3 would not have been on the cover of Game Informer pumping up people who perhaps didn't even notice the 360 version on store shelves as ""Skyrzrimz"" is all they've ever heard of in the Role-Playing Game Format; or ""Falloutz"" Not that these titles have anything wrong with them The general public just murders anything excellent with their subpar Console versions while being blown away by the graphics (I saw skyrim on a friends 360 and threw up in my mouth a little)-I was sent a promo copy of the 360 version to review due to CDPR knowing my love for The White Wolf and his awesome adventures, I grabbed a 360 and blasted through the 360 form of the title which seemed to have pushed the console to its limits and then some, arguably the best looking 360 title to date - I was happy gamers who settle with 8 year old hardware could enjoy TW2 on Less than Medium PC settings!-Now with The Wicther 3's release looming; my PC being ready for the game to run smooth on Ultra; I cannot wait to be immersed completely rec. footage via Nvidia Shadowplay & Twitch.TV No Death Ruleset streams; with SLI 780 ti's prepared for all the Nvidia exclusive hardware graphical / immersive implementations that will not be possible with the ""Next Gen hardware from 2010"" consoles but when I shut up and think about it, Atleast more people are still experiencing TW2 and will experience TW3 (even if it is subpar to the build we'll be pre-ordering here on Steam).

												The Witcher 2 world is simply wonderful, picturesque, varied and vast, incomparable to any other role-playing game.It isn’t open world game. But don’t worry, you won’t run along the paths on both sides limited by invisible walls. CDPR replaced them seamlessly with natural obstacles like chasms, giant trees or very thick bushes. Locations are very diverse. These are cities, villages, open areas, and covered with dense vegetation and ancient elven forest where tree crowns blurring high in the clouds. All amaze diversity and ingenuity. The new proprietary engine Red Engine perfectly shows a play of lights, creating a magical atmosphere, paradoxically also realistically.Combat plays crucial role in the game at any moment we have the opportunity to duel difficult opponent and even take part in the epic battles. The fighting has changed since the first Witcher. We have stronger and more powerful attacks to choose from, varied by passive and active skills. There are three paths of character development: swordsmanship, alchemy and magic. Generally, fighting system is fun, scenic and rewarding, it requires constant attention and feline reflexes, because sometimes we literally have only split seconds to activate protective emblems or attack an open enemy. Not everyone will like this rule, since some players might get frustrated fighting larger groups or one difficult enemy. Overall, The Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings is a beautiful game with modern graphics and addictive gameplay, with its emphasis on realism, psychologically complex characters, original and surprising missions, elections burdened consequences, rewarding combat, good music, humor, sex and climate. First of all, the climate! All these elements form a coherent whole for making up the unique atmosphere. We have, moreover, to deal with the so-called immersion, true masterpieces in terms of visualization and scenario.			",92,16,2,15,9,0,7

												Really fluid combat system. Beautiful graphics. In-depth gameplay with lots of game mechanics (skills, combat moves, items). Also tons of side-quests for you to do. HOWEVER! No rebindable keys! System requirement that is too damn high! Lousy port to Linux, especially for non-Nvidia gamers! I'm talking about a ""native"" game that runs much WORSE than using Wine.If you have to use a wrapper, use Wine instead of an unknown one. Would not recommend this game to someone using Linux with non-Nvidia video cards. Otherwise, I recommend it :P			",236,58,2,31,22,0,33

												While The Witcher 1 was a big first and successfull attempt to bring the world and feel of adventure of Witcher books to the video games, Witcher 2 wanted to up the quality. Tell an even better story, look better, play better... Which might've worked if not for all the issues this game had during the development, issues that are felt throught the rather messy experience The Witcher 2 is.They did succeed in making it look better, obviously, but the look actually aged a bit worse due to the colour filtering choices and the fact that for all the looks it achieved, the world feels smaller, more cramped, more boring to look at. Not everywhere, of course, act 2 has few locations that look nice and the opening scenes can be impressive, but most of the game just looks like a mess of drab colours.It tells the story in a more interesting way, but the story itself is less interesting. It has more nuances, it has some very exciting global implications on the game world and choices feel more natural, are provided in a more personal way. It does bring even more wit and humour from the books, it evolves the characters. And it is the very best thing about the game. Although, it seems, that in Witcher 3 most of the choices are invalidated by events out of your control anyway. Oh and if you do play for story - just go with Iorveth. While Roche path has some pretty interesting (and also mostly invalidated in TW3) choices, all of Act 2 and most of Act 3 will be extremely boring, as Roche gets the most boring locations, quests and dialogues in his path, seemingly mostly due to the fact that this path was developed last.As for the gameplay... If you play on Normal, it's not bad. If you try the Full Combat Rebalance 2 mod it might make some things more interesting. If you play Dark mode or something like that, then don't try the FCR2 mod... Actually, just don't play Dark mode at all, or any other higher difficulty. Despite some attempts by CDP RED to make gameplay fun, gameplay is mostly pretty frustrating and is either simply not fun, or in some cases maddeningly broken. A lot of ideas, with recipies, crafting and such are just a mess (and Dark mode only ""benefits"" depend on those). In addition, all those small animation limitations, you encounter everywhere and things like that make The Witcher 2 to be not a particularly fun game to play.But the story can be worth it. And was for me, twice. Just, don't expect to like anything else.			",691,306,19,81,38,2,88

												The Witcher 2 is a masterpiece.The story is amazing and the way it develops just kept me playing this game for hours, I couldn't stop playing until I finished it and even then, it wasn't enough for me.The combat system is really challenging and fun, it makes you think about things like - how to attack and from where to attack.The graphics look awesome even for today, the lighting makes the game look so alive, I'm admiring the work they did with the lighting.So, if you have any thoughts about getting this game, I really think you should buy it because you won't see another game like this.

												Played it in late 2015 with Windows 8.1. I did not play Witcher 1 previously.This game has its flaws. It is not perfect. Among the bad things, we have:- Several Crashes. In my 35 gameplay hours, it crashed like 4-6 times. - Awful UX. I didn't like the menus. For instance, when buying a new weapon, you don't have the option to compare the new weapon and your actual weapon. You have to exit vendor's menu, enter your inventory, memorize your weapon, and then enter vendor's menu and compare both weapons. Awful.- The combat is a little rough.Among the good things:+ The story is great. I really liked the story and the plot twists. + Your choices matter.  There are several endings based on your decisions.+ The bosses are incredibly hard yet fun. I cursed at the screen several times, yet I couldn't stop playing.+ Graphics are nice even as today.+ Playing Witcher 1 previously is not a requirement.			",140,32,2,14,9,1,8

												Some my Pros/ConsPros:+ Mod support+ Ritch storyline+ Nice looking visuals even on low settings+ Perfect soundtracks+ A lot of craftable items+ High quality NPC voice acting+ Fun during monster hunt (preparing traps/poisons/reading up on the creatures etc)Cons:- Unrealistic sword combat. It doesn't feel right. - Unbalanced gameplay mechanics - Oils and potions barely last long enough to be of any use, and forcing you to drink them in meditation mode is tiresome. Also fairly unrealistic and breaks immersion somewhat. Many skills over/underpowered (i.e. dodge-roll, shield sign, alchemy tree etc.)-Clunky UI and menus. Bad sorting options, unintuitive selection design (i.e. hover over recipe with mouse cursor, then press space or enter to complete recipe. but don't click and make sure not to move your mouse away from recipe in list). The map, while looking totally freaking awesome, is almost entirely useless. Many more problems with UI.-Lack of camera controls and options.-Unclear or non-existent tutorials.-Also, doors. OMG DOORS. Another obvious piece of the game programmed with the fortcoming console port in mind.Overall. 6/10.  I can recommend Witcher 2 if you are keen on fantasy setting and magic items crafting...			",59,5,5,10,4,0,0

But don’t worry, you won’t run along the paths on both sides limited by invisible walls. CDPR replaced them seamlessly with natural obstacles like chasms, giant trees or very thick bushes. Locations are very diverse. These are cities, villages, open areas, and covered with dense vegetation and ancient elven forest where tree crowns blurring high in the clouds. All amaze diversity and ingenuity. The new proprietary engine Red Engine perfectly shows a play of lights, creating a magical atmosphere, paradoxically also realistically.Combat plays crucial role in the game at any moment we have the opportunity to duel difficult opponent and even take part in the epic battles. The fighting has changed since the first Witcher. We have stronger and more powerful attacks to choose from, varied by passive and active skills. There are three paths of character development: swordsmanship, alchemy and magic. Generally, fighting system is fun, scenic and rewarding, it requires constant attention and feline reflexes, because sometimes we literally have only split seconds to activate protective emblems or attack an open enemy. Not everyone will like this rule, since some players might get frustrated fighting larger groups or one difficult enemy. Overall, The Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings is a beautiful game with modern graphics and addictive gameplay, with its emphasis on realism, psychologically complex characters, original and surprising missions, elections burdened consequences, rewarding combat, good music, humor, sex and climate. First of all, the climate! All these elements form a coherent whole for making up the unique atmosphere. We have, moreover, to deal with the so-called immersion, true masterpieces in terms of visualization and scenario.			",92,16,2,15,9,0,7

												The Witcher 2 is a masterpiece.The story is amazing and the way it develops just kept me playing this game for hours, I couldn't stop playing until I finished it and even then, it wasn't enough for me.The combat system is really challenging and fun, it makes you think about things like - how to attack and from where to attack.The graphics look awesome even for today, the lighting makes the game look so alive, I'm admiring the work they did with the lighting.So, if you have any thoughts about getting this game, I really think you should buy it because you won't see another game like this.

												The Witcher 2, like the WItcher 1, is focused on telling a good story! You get characters that are true to themselves instead of plot devices (well they ARE plot devices though but..that's good story telling). You have a clunky fightning mechanic that one of the dev's went and fixed with a mod.  You've got gorgeous graphics, multiple ways to play (2 main ones IMO with branches from those trunks).  I highly recommend it as I don't think anybody that likes RPG's that's played the Witcher games came away disappointed.  Well some did.  I don't talk with them :D			",199,55,6,18,6,1,29

												Very in depth, great title, worth replaying 3 times if necessary to conjure up different endings, setting up the Witcher 3. Controls are tight using the 360 gamepad, combat could be described as well timed button mashing, while everything else is very responsive. Having 27 hours for my first playthrough, this was a great purchase during the steam summer sales. Story is well written, with a variety of interesting characters (featuring a badass intro movie) and with the inclusion of choices that changes the outcome of the story dramatically. The Witcher does a good job of explaining what happened prior to the events of the game with the exception of some names and such (being a newb to the series it's hard to keep up with names). And finally, the graphics are soo damn pretty, I spent a great deal of time admiring the art direction and landscapes of the various HUBS and feilds. 11/10 would play again (after I finish the original), done.

												Is the game good? Yes. It's a flawed gem of a game and one that could well have been one of the best RPG's ever made, if it wasn't for one thing: the combat. The combat is either shallow and dreadfully easy on ""Easy"", or absolutely impossible on ""Normal"". ""Normal"" is really hard mode and they need another difficulty in-between.Putting that aside, pretty much everything else in the game is good. Graphically it looks very pretty when maxed out for a game this old. Having never played Witcher 1, I found it's not very beginner friendly with regards to the story - but then I kind of expected that anyway. Nevertheless, if you have not played the previous game, expect to be confused... a lot. When you finally get your head round it you will find it has significant depth and is highly engaging.Your companions all have back stories of their own and they are well fleshed out. Not many games have had me caring for characters I have only spent a minimal amount of time with in game, but this one got me!The RPG elements are solid and allow for quite a bit of customisation. It has an interesting potion mechanic, based on your ""toxicity level"", so you can't just swig every potion you have before a fight.So, all in all, it's a good game. It could have been brilliant if a few issues were resolved. Regardless of which, it has made me want to get Witcher 3 this February, so consider me hooked!Jimbo Rating: 7/10			",134,5,5,9,5,0,4

												This game has violence and nudity, do I really need to say more? Well if that doesn't convince you, you should know that the game also tells an amazing story, and you do NOT need to play the first game to understand it. I tried the first game and hated the combat, but this game's combat is much more action oriented, fast paced, and fun. The world is incredibly immersive, and while small, it drew me in much more than larger worlds ever could. Also, boobs. Seriously, get this game, it's awesome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hmm, again the Steam recommendation system provokes thought. This isn't a great game, it's a good one. It has numerous flaws. Ridiculous boss fights (thank goodness for easy mode), stupid missions with auto fail conditions (I nearly was reduced to tears by one idiotic sequence where you had to follow someone through a greyscale cave where the mission was restarted if you put one foot wrong), display and path finding glitches, and a bizarre plot that lost me some time ago. But it also has much goodness - smashing combat, once you figure out you have to roll a lot, stunning visuals, a fantastic main character and decent supporting cast, including several strong female characters - don't be deceived by the pandering to teenage boys with the top heavy character models. There is action aplenty and a reasonable amount of exploration to do, however I feel it didn't live up to it's predecessor and it does feel curiously amateurish in places. I really have no idea how this devteam is going to pull off something as ambitious as Witcher 3, but I'll certainly be playing it. Recommended? Yes, but with the caveat that the game is deeply flawed and a definite slog at times.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, I played The Witcher 1 a little bit, a few hours and eventually dropped it not because I didn't like the story because I did but because the combat was really, really boring and well, there was quite a lot of it so it was hard to avoid it, especially in RPG games.Moving on, The Witcher 2 got released, didn't play at launch but a few years later I decided to give it a shot. It is so much better than the first game in my opinion. The story, the gameplay, graphics and most especially, combat, they're all better.Now, the game itself is not THAT huge as you might think it is. At first glance it does seem so but after finishing it you realize it's really not. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean there aren't things to do. There's plenty of side quests, lore to explore, books to read (I think, didn't touch them that much), monsters to slay and yeah, you get a lot of content, especially for the lowered up prices you can find right now.I really recommend this game because CDProjekt really nailed it.Get it m9s ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			",251,25,4,26,10,2,43

												I love the ""Witcher Series"" and this game was a ""masterpiece"" .  I played Witcher 1 too . The story was good , ambience and the music were perfect but gameplay was horribly bad. But this game is perfect. Gameplay is so funny , story , music, ambience are way better. + Story was perfect. It was one of the best stories I've ever seen.+ Voice acting is still perfect.+ Gameplay is so funny. Its very smooth.(Dodge and parry system is also good.+ Signs are more useful than ""Witcher 1's Signs"" .+ Embience is also perfect.+ A lot of side quests. (Every side quest has a different side-story.)+ Witcher 2 Save is affecting ""Witcher 3"" .+ All side and main characters are so different and good designed.+ Graphics are good.+ Soundtrack is good.+ EPIC ENDING!- Steam didn't recognize the game and i couldn't get the achievements of the game.- Some stability issues, game can crash from times to times.- Some language options do not work as it should.- The number of creatures is not good.- Enemys are easy to kill.

												Really, really solid Action-RPG. The story is engrossing, full of well-developed characters and locales. Many choices are made throughout the game, and all of them feel like a moral shade of grey, being much more interesting than the good-or-evil binary in some other games. The game feels like it covers only a small section of a much larger canvas, and it is always obvious that important events are happening around Geralt and company. The world feels alive and lived-in, and there are many small details that draw you in. NPCs gather in town centers and taverns and banter between each other. Some of the dialog ends up repeated if you stick around one area too long, but it is written well and does not become grating. Creature design is good, and some of the larger ones are very intimidating. Monsters in the wild form packs and hunt and attack other monsters (and you).The combat in this game is good, but not great. Most fights can be either rushed down quickly or kited around, getting in a few hits at a time. Strong attacks seem more effective than fast attacks almost all of the time, and I sorely missed the ""group"" attacks from the first game. The signs are useful to varying degrees. I found myself using Quen, Aard, and Yrden signs fairly often, but Igni and Axii signs were hardly ever used. Preparing for combat by drinking potions and using sword oils is very important, especially for more challenging fights. For some reason, you cannot lock on to bosses, but the camera is still cooperative and not too much of a pain to manage.The inventory system is streamlined from the first game, and is less of a chore to manage.

												The Witcher 2 is indeed a title that needs to be experienced by every single RPG fan out there; however bear in mind that this title does carry a PEGI age restriction of 18, and is not suited for anyone below this age limit. As stated before, this is not just because of the nudity or the graphic violence, but due to the fact that The Witcher 2 has an in-depth storyline that covers a diverse range of political and racial aspects, which allows it to be the spectacular mature title that it is.When it comes to lasting appeal, The Witcher 2 will take between 30 to 40 hours to complete, depending on your skill level and whether you partake in various side-quests. If you have not picked up a copy of the Witcher 2, I can highly recommend it wether on sale or full price, it's worth every penny of your cash.			",645,142,31,79,97,12,138

												I started this game a few days ago and unlike the first witcher game where I could dump hours at a time, this one feels like a chore to play for a number of reasons. 1. Combat.  The combat isn't hard, it's cheesy. It's impossible to lock on to a target, there is no sword stances like the first Witcher and you die extremely quick in any difficulty and there were fights early on where the only option I could find was to exploit the AI programming. There's a fight with 10-15 creatures(you have no aoe and can't agro only one at a time) in act one and if you dive into them they will gather around you and you just die with no ability to escape(Fair enough, realism... BUT the only way I found to do this fight after multiple attempts is fight them one at a time at the limit of their programmed agro range. 2. Map and NPC's. I can't find f*%$ing♥♥♥♥♥♥even when it's marked and NPC's that have valuable items you need to buy for quests are no where to be found. I resorted to googling a lot of quest locations and even then couldn't find a lot of them.  3. Menu. the UI is god awful and is a chore to navigate around. 4. Boss fight. My first bossfight I died a dozen times just trying to figure out what to do and how to execute it, this isn't Dark Souls FFS. Finally when I got through phase 1 (yay) a f%%king rock just drops out of the sky onto my head killing me. I died a handful more times in phase 2 trying to figure out what I was suppose to do, walk up to the boss, instantly die, run around, rocks kill you. 5. Dumb mini games. They are boring, clunky and again feel like a chore to play. The first witcher was more fun throwing dice in.5/10 would not reccomend.			",99,19,0,9,8,1,17

												The Witcher was a fantastic game. For some reason, the devs felt like they had to change the combat system and slow down the pacing of the sequel. I am sure the control changes were to appeal to the console market, and it was a big mistake. It completely ruins the game. Not only the controls overly complex and counterintuitive, but they are made worse by a very steep difficulty curve. This combined with the lack of clarity in the storytelling and what is far and away the worst menu system I have ever seen in a game and you wind up with a disappointing shadow of what could have been. I love the story and really wanted to experience it in its entirety, but could not do so due to the game's awful controls, terrible pacing and confusing menus. Also, as much as I like dialogue heavy games, this one overdoes it. Too much of a good thing. I can't count the number of times I've wished an npc would just shut up already. When you can sit down in a game for an hour or two and accomplish nothing, something is very wrong.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lovely story, but the gameplay is a burden.I haven't seen such a buggy game in years...It's much better than Witcher 1, but not enjoyable for me.It feels like a beta, maybe Witcher 3 is the full version.Some of the bugs I encountered:- Serious Input Lag issues.- Bad gamepad controls (and more input lag than with mouse)- Mouse & Keyboard controls aren't too great either. Interacting with the world feels sluggish.- Getting stuck, because a candlestand is lying infront of the door.- Getting stuck in the stealth mode, only able to sneak left or right along an invisible wall- Talking to invisible NPCs (that was quite funny to be honest)I recommend watching a let's play or a longplay, but not actually playing the game.

												Really damn good game overall. Good graphics, a great mature story and setting, gameplay is astronomically better than Witcher 1. That being said the combat while a million times better than the game before is still lacking, but its cons are outweighed by the pros of having to use intelligent decision-making to prepare for fights which is something that is completely missing from almost all modern RPG lately.Remember when you had to drink that potion of fire resistance so you could fight that dragon in Skyrim? Or you had to keep a stash of holy water so you could fight vampires? Me neither.In Witcher if you do not prepare to fight monsters like a Witcher you will fail miserably, and rightly so for thats what sets apart Witchers from just really juiced up monster slayers.The game does suffer from trying to be too cinematic, but fortunately this is only for the Prologue. Its recommended that you play Witcher 1 before playing this but you really don't need to as Witcher 1 can be a bit of a chore to play.I would argue that the most important aspect of this game is the mature story, if you are not very into story driven gameplay then I cannot recommend this to you.

												The Witcher 2 is a prime example of how an RPG SHOULD be made.  No morality meters, no light side or dark side, and an extremely non-linear storyline that changes each time you play through the game.  You MUST play this game on DARK difficulty to really get the full experience of the Witcher 2.  Why?  Because if you play on anything below you won't get the full Witcher feel.  I played through the first time on Normal and never used traps, alchemy, or bombs at all.  In Dark difficulty you must use EVERYTHING at your disposal to defeat monsters and your enemies.  Dark is what the game intends you to play at.  You must read up on monsters before you go face them, learn their strengths and weaknesses, and defeat them by the skin of your teeth.  Although not a perfect game the Witcher 2 is a masterfully made game that inspires you to play through it again and again.  If you've ever played an RPG you MUST play the Witcher 2!  It's a thrill ride and extremely immersive.  The Witcher 3 has become my most anticipated game of 2014 thanks to this game and the first.I have to give this game an 8/10.  I would give it a 9.5 but the third Act of the game and the ending I felt were a bit weak.  Regardless this is one of the pen-ultimate RPGs ever constructed in gaming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm playing the Witcher series backwards - started with 3 and then 2, and currently in the process of playing 1, so I am somewhat spoiled by Witcher 3's incredible gameplay and story and voice acting.The gameplay in 2 is ok, but I didn't like the fact that you needed to take your potions *before* heading in to a fight. Sometimes you don't know you're heading for one, so I missed the opportunity a few times. Compared to 1, the skill tree and meditation practices are much easier, but compared to 3, they're a little complicated. I like the improvements in 3.The storyline was very good, the voice acting was pretty decent - a great improvement over 1, but not quite up to par with 3. Perhaps I shouldn't be comparing, but it's hard not to.Overall I enjoyed this game. It was hard at times, trying to figure out what spells or combat should be used on a boss, but challenging. It was good to get more background to the whole Witcher series story. 7/10			",80,10,2,12,2,1,0

The levelling up is greatly improved with much more scope and variety available and the mutagens make it more fun still :)Well worth the couple of quid in the steam sale. I would even go so far as to say - I would happily pay a tenner for this game - now that I know it is this good :DOnly downside is my framerate is pants on ultra settings.			",97,6,3,16,2,1,6

The story has great plots and you can go throw gameplay in many different ways and therefore there are different endings of the game. In addition to the main campaign is worth noting the arena mode, which occurs in the enhanced edition. Really worth to play!			",337,153,20,43,59,5,58

												After messing around with the tutorial and prologue, I never truly gave the Witcher much of a chance. It appeared to have a deep story and well-developed setting, but I didn't particularly enjoy the combat with a keyboard and mouse. Returning with an Xbox 360 controller, I now find the combat thoroughly enjoyable. The controls take some time to learn, but the combat is fair and requires thought (unless playing on easy). I am at the start of Chapter 2 and have officially become hooked on the Witcher universe. This has been one of my most enjoyable playthroughs this years. I greatly look forward to continuing the story in Witcher 3. If you are a fan of fantasy, adventure RPGs and clever dialogue, then I highly recommend the Witcher 2 Enhanced Edition.

												Witcher 2 inspires awe, every game you play after you finish this game is a slight dissapointment. The story in this game has so many different choices and endings it feels like a different game everytime you choose a different path. The graphics are unreal and beat everything realeased, even today, the animations and voice acting is superb and the sounds are so clear and music is amazing and it fits really well into the dark fantasy world. There are some memorable tracks to this game which have made their way into my playlists.The combat style is not different from most rpg's, hack and slash, magic spells (called signs) and potions. Some people say it came out as half baked, but I love it and it really gets you to think about your stategy, especially against large groups of enemies. The constanting rolling around that you ahve to do to avoid enemy attacks is rather tiresome, as blocking is ineffective against many different enemies. The different skill trees are all very well balanced and each skill impacts combat and how you play big time. The drawback with the alchemy system is that potions can only be consumed outside of combat, so constantly saving before entering a new room is advisable, so it is possible to reload without worrying if you have lost a large portionof time spent doing quests. The main protagonist, Geralt of Rivia is a badass monster slayer who you just love form first sight (much like his hot girlfriend Triss!!). And the most hyped up and important part of the game, the story is written and directed like a AAA movie title, only ten times better! Going through the prologue is like watching Game of Thrones, it is awesome.This game also utilises Witcher 1 saves so all the different choices and descisions you made in that, impact your Witcher 2 game! The story's allusions to the whole witcher univerrse allow you to roleplay the witcher effectively, but the main plot pulls Geralt out of his main profession, he turns away from his witchering throughout much of the main plot, with only a few quests showing off his full monster hunting aspect. This game is magnificent, it is a visual feast and contains a plot which constantly twists and turns and gets you to think long and hard about decisions you make over your favourite characters.Overall - 99/100 Must play!

												By far one of the best games I've played. It has it's problems, but they don't take away from the game enough to ruin the experience in any meaningful manner. It has a slight old school feel to it as well, which I liked very much. Feels good to die over and over and over again in a game like this for a change as well :) You get to solve how to beat the game, learn it, and then finally beat it when you've figured it out, which reminded me of some good games from the past. Way past, that is... This game also respects the players intelligence and maturity, and won't try to hand you everything sugar coated.And then there's the story, and the different branches of it. It definitely surprised me how much of a difference your choice might make in the game! It won't make it obvious either, so if you don't play the game again, or check the differences on a video, you have no idea what the changes are, how big they are, and how much they affect your playthrough. Certainly recommended for anyone interested in fantasy, rpg, good story, or just a good gaming experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was the best RPG of 2011, and for me, 2013 as well. After two complete playthroughs to get the full story, I believe this is the most well written story in a fantasy RPG to date. The combat is also a joy once you get the hang of it's initially unintuitive style. Witcher 2 is more narrative heavy than most action RPGs, but that's what brought me back for a second full play. Two years later the graphics are still striking to behold at times. This game is definitely not for everyone, especially if you get bored with long story sequences. Passive or casual gamers will quickly get lost in the narrative. It was the most enjoyable RPG played by me the year it came out, and I was hard pressed to claim an equal this past year when I played a second time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At last, I have play The Witcher Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition. Even though this was my 7th play through. XD it was worth it!!! I have never played the ""Enhanced Edition"" until recently. Well, is was a good thing too. Or else I wouldn't have this wonderful experiance and chance to see all the visual and quest imporvments that they've made to the game. From the very detailed options in enhancing the game performance at the start menu. From the numerous new quest givings at the ""notice borads in each new area"" plus new items they've placed all over the game. It gave me a completely new expreriance altogether to enjoy.  The combat, however, is still not as bad as it was at luanch. Still needs aa few works ups here and there. Nevertheless, still a sold expreiances.. :)  Reminds a lot of Game of thrones in a differnet perspective. Well..... it's more like the other way around really :P since I've played this before watching the""GOT"". Where the monarchs are at war with each other planing, ploting, plouing. XD for the most part this game gets me more hypted and excited for ""The wild hunt"" even more. More importantly, If you ever want to play a good non linear game. With all kinds of dark fantasy like world. Where consiquences can make the diference between life and death. As well as where monsters, vampires, ghost, gouls and goblins wreak havoc all over the place. Well all i can say is this is your game. So give this series a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2 is unlike any rpg that came before, because of one word only ""story."" The witcher 2 might not offer a open world but what it does offer is a great story. Have you ever been lured in to a rpg with them saying ""choice will change your game."" Well, The witcher delivers in aces, not only will your choice change the future, but where you are in the world and the people you meet. Sure the're are set pieces and story character you have to meet, but i found they always had something new to say or a new quest for you to do. The choices witcher 2 supplies has you picking from one evil or another evil, with no one being greater than the other. You don't gain lightside or darkside points, you just are the way you chose. Combat is pretty straight forward, you have a sliver sword that kills monsters and a iron sword to kill humans. Potions can be consumed before a fight to say increase your ability to dodge incoming attacks or see in the dark. Geralt of rivia has large skill tree, and each point you put it makes you feel stronger, wither it be strength, wisdom, or alchemy. Geralt the character you lead through this adventure is a anti-hero to a T. Geralt's profession is monster slaying, with a bit of humans on the side. All and all I enjoyed the game, set paths and hand holding hurt the opening, but what is to follow is indeed a rpg to be had. P.S with your steam purchase you also get the game ""DRM free"" from Good Old Games website as well.			",158,20,2,22,4,0,18

												Picked it up for € 3.99 on special offer and boy, was that a deal. People talk about ""the graphics"", but that's the wrong term actually. Yes, the 3D engine is good for a 2011 game, but what really blows your mind is the LEVEL DESIGN. Screenshots don't do it justice since you really have to experience the diversity & complexity of the world hands-on. The entire visual design of the game is just so masterfully done that I don't even mind the fact that it regularly crosses the threshold of kitsch I can tolerate. Especially the sex scenes could do with a little less stilted moaning & catwalk moves, and instead some more teasing & creativity in general.So while I'm recounting the downers here's the rest of them:- Animations (doors, climbing, taking/dealing damage etc.) sometimes lock other movement annoyingly long. Especially casting sometimes gets locked for no apparent reason, so I end up standing like a dork in the middle of battle while hitting the cast button until it finally happens.- Male characters are quite well done, both visually, substantually and vocally. They are diverse and relate to the world in a meaningful manner. Female characters however seem generally a little more shallow. There are very few meaningful female roles, and all female characters in the game seem to fit a much more narrow blueprint. They look more alike, they act more similar, heck, they even seem to be all the same age. It's like somebody wanted all the women to fit a particular stereotype of ""hotness"" which gets boring very quickly (I still like Triss though, but she's about the only deep female NPC).Other than that I really can't think of any more downsides to this game, so since the ups have been discussed in other reviews extensively, it should be clear that this is a SUPER-awesome ARPG.

Rank: 8.5/10Recommendation(s): Play another Witcher title before (The Witcher 1)Major Theme: Slightly sluggish, but a great mix between 1 and 3.Bought at Price: $2.75 - Steam SaleI honestly thought I was going to have enough will power to play the Witcher series in order, but that turned out to be not the case. The first title turned out to be so dry; it was equivalent to having a dry mouth, being dragged face down in a desert for kilometers. There was a serious lack of humor, but the combat system proved to be greatly overhauled. While the system having its own new issues, made gameplay more pleasant than the machine like structure of the first.Graphics are vastly enhanced from the first, but still do not compare anywhere close to that of the third (and last?) Witcher title. Maybe that’s why they called it the “enhanced edition”. On that note, I cannot describe the difference between the two editions, as I have not played the original release.While the story was logical, and easy to follow, was a little let down. By no means was it horrible or not worth playing, it just again lacked humor. At some points in the game, you will find yourself playing a part just to move the story along (which felt very much like the first game in the series).I probably will not be replaying this title as I will be doing with the 3rd, but that should be no judge of quality.

												One of the best current rpgs. The Witcher 2 represents great dedication of developers to improve upon the original Witcher. Sequel is better at every aspect. Witcher 2 contains everything that good rpg needs: interesting world you will want to spend countless hours exploring, many different foes, good skill progress and exhilarating storyline. In addition, the devs continued to add new content for free and even released the improvements made for xbox version to pc users for free also. It is a rare sight nowadays when other companies are releasing countless dlcs cut from the game for additional price.			",15,4,0,4,2,0,13

												Great game though i feel like your options don't impact the outcomes as much as in witcher 1. But aside from that the story is still good and you learn a lot about the different factions. I really enjoyed the combat, which was a nice change from Witcher 1 although i would have liked to see the different combat stances. Can't wait till Witcher 3 is out!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I warn those in advanced.  This is not your typical RPG.  It is not a sandbox, create your own empty character kind of game.  This isn't Dragon Age.  If that's what you're qxpecting, look elsewhere.  This game is complex, difficult, and treats you like an adult.  There is no hand holding.  But it is, overall, quite the amazing game.  I had already played the Witcher 2 on xbox 360, but I always wanted to try it on PC.  It's even more wonderful.  Load screens, in comparison to the 360 version, are a breeze.  The combat is better and I don't need to mention the graphics.  Play it before Witcher 3 that way you better understand the world.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Note: You do not need to have played the first game in the series to play this. Many people turn it away due to it´s poor graphic quality. I say give it a go. If you can´t stand ""old style"" games you will however easily get immersed into The Witcher 2.  CD PROJEKT RED has brought Andrzej Sapkowski´s novels to life. I am 100% certain no other company could have done it as marvelous as they have. (Yes I have read all the books.) You are in for a real adventure with this one. If you are into linear RPG style games + Some added optional quests in each zone. The optional quests sometimes yeilds something you can always use as examples - Potion recipes, a treasure map, a book with useful information about some of the creatures you are battling or they can have some information about known characters. Then there´s the lustful side to Geralt. Sometimes you will be awarded sex with very graphic imagery and profanity. It´s a adult game so of course adult situations will occur.This is not your usual RPG -  You will come to love Geralt whether you´re a guy or a girl. The witcher 2 is a wast game with many memorable characters and monsters that you will meet on your quest to find out who the Assassins of Kings is. The game is divided into three acts each with their own unique environment. This is truly a epic game that deserves all the awards it has won. You will need to play through the game more than once (or watch a youtuber) play as in all RPG´s your decision has in impact in the world. Each decision needs to be considered as you will not know how it will impact the story ahead. One question that might seem insignificent can have a very big impact further on. I have played this game for many hours searching and discovering hidden caves with monsters or a tomb with a treasure chest. If you are not customed with this sort of game don´t go Hard mode and make yourself frustrated resulting in you not wanting to play anymore, however if you are up for a challange go ahead, there are so many magnificent encounters and I do believe playing them for the first time on Hard and not giving up will really reward you it will get your adrenaline pumping when you have just beaten a hard encounter.

It is easily the best action RPG that I have ever encountered.  It is surely for a n adult audience, as it has plenty of nudity and sex.  Yes sex in cut scenes.

												First let me say The Witcher 2 is an incredible game that should not be missed by any fan of the RPG genre. The goods are as follows-Great combat that combines magic, swordplay, and crafting very effectively-Excellent story that's well written-Good voice actingThe cons are as follows-Bad map system. I found myself many times getting lost and in some way either on top of the objective marker or below it. Being a long game in the first place wasting time navigating the bad map was a bit of a disappointment.-Not enough loot to really feel rewarded from combat-There was a lack of accomplishment upon leveling up. This is due to the fact that the leveling system never really shows you where you are in level so your leveling is out of sight and out of mind. Although this isn't a huge drawback, it does subdue the desire to reach level capOverall I would highly recommend this game to anyone, especially with the witcher 3: the wild hunt coming up as well as the low cost during steam sales.

												The Witcher 2 is somewhat linear compared to the first game, with a heavier focus on action and story than variety and depth, much like the difference between Dragon Age 1 and 2; The first game didn't look as good, nor was the combat as fluid, but it certainly felt more like an RPG. That being said, it's still an exceptional game that walks a fine line between maturity and juvenile fantasy. Luckily though, even with all the sex and violence, it manages to maintain a respectability that only a dark fantasy done very well could hope to obtain.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Geralt of Rivia has returned, and with warm welcome. The Witcher series is becoming one of my favorites within my list of fictional sagas, and this game certainly delivers on all fronts.Assassins of Kings pulls no punches. It starts off with an incredibly beautiful CGI introduction that rivals even the best studios. Once you start the game, you're thrown right into war, and the rollercoaster ride hasn't even reached the first hill at this point. Geralt's adventures are plentiful - every quest, whether tied into the main questline or just a trivial matter, fits within the world and doesn't feel disjointed or forced. The graphics are certainly a huge step up from the original, and still hold up well as of this review (May 2015). I have a AMD 7970 3gb card, and still can't even run this game on 'true' max settings - mind you, the only thing holding me back is the 'Ubersampling' option, which looks unreal, but cuts framerate to a halt on most systems. It's reserved for the 'best of the best' and not many can run it, even today. Aside from that setting, the Witcher II is still beautiful in every respect. The coastline city of Flotsam feels salty and dirty. The nearby marshes displays a sticky, dense fog that utters caution within the unknown. Details such as these are scattered throughout, and you'll never find yourself tired of the eye candy.For those who played the original, the combat is a huge breath of fresh air in comparison. Gone is the timed left clicking jumbled mess, replaced by real time combat. You can light attack, heavy attack, or block/riposte. That's it. Despite this well-needed change, however, the fighting can get rather intense, especially on harder difficulties (I played on Dark). Dodge (basically roll) is your best friend. You will find yourself rolling out of harm's way so often, it's not even funny. Roll or die, that's about what it comes down to. 95% roll, 5% swordfighting. Apparently Sonic the Hedgehog is Geralt's spirit animal. All the original Signs are back - Aard, Yrden, Quen, Igni, and Axii. In this game, Quen is your best friend. It will save your life countless times - my advice is to invest in upgrading it early. That said, there is a simple yet effective skill tree for Geralt's Signs and other abilities, split into four parts - Training, Swordsmanship, Signs, and Alchemy. Allocate points to the playstyle you like - you'll typically never level them all, so choose wisely. Briefly touching on loot here - swords and armor are much more plentiful than the first game, which is nice. However those who import Witcher 1 saves will find that their imported content won't last long until a trade in, which is disappointing, especially with one particular weapon you acquire from the first game that its storyline seemed to hold in high regard.The story is certainly good, and not too over the top (well, aside from a detail or two). Geralt's choices have much weight in this game, and you'll find more impactful choices than in the first iteration. Also included are various ways to get information in the dialogue options - persuasion (Axii), intimidation, and so forth. I'm not sure if its based on your current skills or a random number roll, but its a fun take on the 'click to ask X question' bit.My only real gripe with this game, other than the occasional dodgy combat roll, is the Steam achievements. The game practically forces you to play twice to get absolutely every achievement. 100%'ers, beware. The insane mode alone is risky - one death and your save games become null and void. Overall, this is an tremendously enjoyable sequel. Not as long as the first, but it has depth and production quality. Definitely worth a playthrough or two! (Note: This game has 'something after the credits'. Stick with it!)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2 is a vast improvement over its predecessor, and, as the franchise is known for, has many new and variable tropes for a Fantasy RPG game. To highlight some of the game's best features, The Witcher 2's combat is reminiscent of Batman: Arkham Asylum, but requires far greater skill and preparation. I'm not new to Action-RPG's by any means, but I found the first half of the game very challenging and new to grasp, which is a good thing. The combat is by far the most enjoyable, compelling, intense, and straight forward experience I've had in a while, and for the first time, the magic, enchanting, and alchemy systems aren't overly convaluted.The story of The Witcher 2 is dark and riviting, and is filled with lots of mystery, political strife, and several player-driven decisions during major events. The only complaint is that the game takes too fondly to the objectification of most, if not all, of it's female characters. I won't get into detail, but if you're ok with that, then I highly recommend playing The Witcher 2 for a new Action-Adventure-RPG experience.			",40,18,0,8,3,0,7

												The Witcher 2, is my favorite game of all time. Here is why:When you first get into this game, one of the most incredibly made cinematics bids you welcome to the world and story. I am amazed that a small company like CDPR (used to be) could possibly deliever one of the most beautiful PC titles of all time, even in 2014. But these guys did it right. With a huge focus on story and it's characters, this game slowly opens up for a world that has so much more depth and feel to it than many other AAA open world games. This world has the advantage on being based on a great bookseries and a having a company behind it, that has the best intentions for everything that is behind it.It can be confusing to begin with, but without a doubt fully playable, without having played the first installment of the series. The mechanics can be a little clunky, and the developers have been forced to limit the world to big explorable areas instead of making it truly open world. But it works out for this game - Simply because everything you CAN do, is so incredibly detailed and perfected in every way. The lore and story is absolutely amazing and along with a great soundtrack and mindblowing visuals, it adds up to be the very best game I've ever played.I write this review after completing the game several times, on each difficulty and gathering all achievements. It is extremely challenging in beginning, but in this game, preperation and strategy, is highly rewarded. This is what makes this game so different and so much better from other games:- Choices matter. The choices you make can change the story completely. There's actually two completely seperated chapters based only one single choice in the game. It makes everything so much more interesting.- Everything is means something. There's no generic sides quests, like you know it from Skyrim and WoW. There's a lot of content, but they are all well thought out. You won't be forced to gather resources for hours - It will make sense in the end.- The story is so rich and incredibly well put together. Unlike many other RPGs, you don't get to costumize your character, but also means that the story becomes much more personal, mature and interesting. - The world, based on a book franchise, that I have now read, because of my love of the game gives this game a huge advantage. The lore is deep and detailed and CDPR has truly taken care of this in the best way possibly. This game also features some of the best soundtracks I know of.I am incredibly excited for The Witcher 3. And I believe that, to be the only game to ever beat this. That experience will show a truly open world, with a much bigger budget and therefore, far fewer limits. The simple fact, that the main story is around 50 hours long, says a lot about how important the story is in this franchise. I would recommend anyone who want to play Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt, to begin here. It'll give you a wonderful time, and prepare you for the third installment. I like the first game as well, but I think it might be a little too outdated by now. TL;DR: If you want to be a medieval jedi knight, you should play this game. And who doesn't want to be a medieval jedi knight? Seriously?			",157,14,6,19,11,1,24

												The Witcher 2 is a stylish, mature take on and RPG. It's graphics and linear storytelling are enjoyable and beautiful at times. Sometimes the game gets confusing because of several glitches I have come across but forget that and you are filtered with an incredible experience and certainly one of the best RPG games out there. Buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Picked it up for € 3.99 on special offer and boy, was that a deal. People talk about ""the graphics"", but that's the wrong term actually. Yes, the 3D engine is good for a 2011 game, but what really blows your mind is the LEVEL DESIGN. Screenshots don't do it justice since you really have to experience the diversity & complexity of the world hands-on. The entire visual design of the game is just so masterfully done that I don't even mind the fact that it regularly crosses the threshold of kitsch I can tolerate. Especially the sex scenes could do with a little less stilted moaning & catwalk moves, and instead some more teasing & creativity in general.So while I'm recounting the downers here's the rest of them:- Animations (doors, climbing, taking/dealing damage etc.) sometimes lock other movement annoyingly long. Especially casting sometimes gets locked for no apparent reason, so I end up standing like a dork in the middle of battle while hitting the cast button until it finally happens.- Male characters are quite well done, both visually, substantually and vocally. They are diverse and relate to the world in a meaningful manner. Female characters however seem generally a little more shallow. There are very few meaningful female roles, and all female characters in the game seem to fit a much more narrow blueprint. They look more alike, they act more similar, heck, they even seem to be all the same age. It's like somebody wanted all the women to fit a particular stereotype of ""hotness"" which gets boring very quickly (I still like Triss though, but she's about the only deep female NPC).Other than that I really can't think of any more downsides to this game, so since the ups have been discussed in other reviews extensively, it should be clear that this is a SUPER-awesome ARPG.

												The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is one of the finest examples of how great an RPG can be, every action we take has a consequence, visually impressive even if the game was released long time ago, it still stand on top graphics, gaming and story, the battles are wonderfully hard, this is definitely worth a buy, cant wait for The Withcer III Wild Hunt as I alredy made the Pre Order as I'm convinced it will be a success <3 :D :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2 is unlike any rpg that came before, because of one word only ""story."" The witcher 2 might not offer a open world but what it does offer is a great story. Have you ever been lured in to a rpg with them saying ""choice will change your game."" Well, The witcher delivers in aces, not only will your choice change the future, but where you are in the world and the people you meet. Sure the're are set pieces and story character you have to meet, but i found they always had something new to say or a new quest for you to do. The choices witcher 2 supplies has you picking from one evil or another evil, with no one being greater than the other. You don't gain lightside or darkside points, you just are the way you chose. Combat is pretty straight forward, you have a sliver sword that kills monsters and a iron sword to kill humans. Potions can be consumed before a fight to say increase your ability to dodge incoming attacks or see in the dark. Geralt of rivia has large skill tree, and each point you put it makes you feel stronger, wither it be strength, wisdom, or alchemy. Geralt the character you lead through this adventure is a anti-hero to a T. Geralt's profession is monster slaying, with a bit of humans on the side. All and all I enjoyed the game, set paths and hand holding hurt the opening, but what is to follow is indeed a rpg to be had. P.S with your steam purchase you also get the game ""DRM free"" from Good Old Games website as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A wonderful game with great immersion, tough decisions, and it's a ton of fun.  The story isn't fantastic, but it's very interesting, and the way you progress through it just sucks you in, so you forget how long you've been playing.  The combat is fun, while also being challenging as long you're not playing on Easy.  There's multiple ways to go through the story, so there's definite replay value.  The only con I can think of is the game isn't optimised very well, so either have a great computer, or run it on minimum settings (Still looks pretty great, imo)TL;DR  Great game, get it!  Check Min requirements and expect to run on lowest settings if you're close to that.			",546,137,9,79,37,2,66

												The Witcher 2 is the much anticipated sequel to the original The Witcher. Featuring a brand new engine, intense combat and a returning cast of characters.As much as I like this game there are fairly pronounced flaws if you were a player like me, who went through the original game. Everyone except Geralt got a new voice actor, and as a result everyone feels really different for some reason. Alongside that, importing your saved game from the original is very pointless. Your magical swords and unbendable armor that previously saw you through massacring armies of enemies, now has you selling it for the first new bit of equipment. Not only that but a lot of your choices simply do not carry over. In the original game for instance Geralt could choose to romance another girl instead of Triss named Shany. Who replaced Triss from then on in the story and was just as important. You could also choose to side with the Squirrels, who start out in this game wanting to murder you despite whatever import you might have had.Aside from this the game is perfectly flawless, your choices are very pronounced and your consequences very real. I just wish the game had a bit more perspective on where it came from and where it was going.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2 is somewhat linear compared to the first game, with a heavier focus on action and story than variety and depth, much like the difference between Dragon Age 1 and 2; The first game didn't look as good, nor was the combat as fluid, but it certainly felt more like an RPG. That being said, it's still an exceptional game that walks a fine line between maturity and juvenile fantasy. Luckily though, even with all the sex and violence, it manages to maintain a respectability that only a dark fantasy done very well could hope to obtain.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Since the 2.0 patch, combat is smooth and fluent.  The storyline is great, albeit somewhat shorter than what I had hoped for (around 40 hours on hard).  However, with the new Dark Mode, the replay value has gone up, not to mention two very distinct story's branched at one major decison.  Overall, a fantastic RPG with action-oriented combat.

												Really damn good game overall. Good graphics, a great mature story and setting, gameplay is astronomically better than Witcher 1. That being said the combat while a million times better than the game before is still lacking, but its cons are outweighed by the pros of having to use intelligent decision-making to prepare for fights which is something that is completely missing from almost all modern RPG lately.Remember when you had to drink that potion of fire resistance so you could fight that dragon in Skyrim? Or you had to keep a stash of holy water so you could fight vampires? Me neither.In Witcher if you do not prepare to fight monsters like a Witcher you will fail miserably, and rightly so for thats what sets apart Witchers from just really juiced up monster slayers.The game does suffer from trying to be too cinematic, but fortunately this is only for the Prologue. Its recommended that you play Witcher 1 before playing this but you really don't need to as Witcher 1 can be a bit of a chore to play.I would argue that the most important aspect of this game is the mature story, if you are not very into story driven gameplay then I cannot recommend this to you.

												The most immersive game world I've ever experienced. Everything about it really draws you in, from the detailed lore to the excellent voice acting. CD Projekt Red really appreciate their fanbase so have been updating this game consistently over it's lifetime. It's so good, the Polish Prime Minister gave Barrack Obama a copy as a gift.My only negative experience with this game is with the Steam version and it's issues - I had to download it from GoG (using my steam key) to get a DRM-free version without problems.

												Just finished The Witcher 2 and I got to admit it's like it tries to be both a RPG and a VN, yet fails (as I see it) to be either. I guess that's just because I like my RPGs to be action RPGs and my VN be no action (in the sense of text and choiced only, nothing else). Yet I will recommend it for I suppose it's not that the game is bad, it's that I wanted not the things this game has to offer me and it's kind of my fault for not having thought this through.The fights are either too short (too few enemies) or either too hard (too strong enemies) the only fun being those fought when approaching the Harpies nests and on the Vergen's walls. Oh! And no experience for you, level up via the quests only, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (well, you technically can gain 2-3 levels by fighting during the game, but you have to fight loads of monsters, more than the game actually gives you. And you will not get the exp for them after some time, so no grinding for ya). The loot is poor and you are poor as the Price/Sell ratio is like x5, more for better items (buy for 2500, sell for 100, yeah, right. Or the crafting! Buy a recipe for 100 gold, buy ingridients for 150 gold + pay 20 gold to craft a subart... which you can buy for like 25 gold. Why, again?). Do I have to mention the horribly sluggish system of potions, alchemy, crafting, trading and menus in general? I had to ggole how to switch off the mouse smoothening (there is not a single PC player happy with mouse acceleration/deceleration)The ""VN"" element is... well it's not bad in and of itself, yet the differences in the endings are minute and the dialogue is diluted by the need to fight - or just run around - in between. So I won't be playing it through again, not in the nearest half a year, at least, I see no reason to. Fun is heavily diluted. For me at least.What an irony, but for the aforementioned combination the game might have been actually fun for me. Like if the action RPG elements were to be enhanced and stripped off of all the dialogue nonsense OR if the VN elements (well it's kind of R part of the RPG, so you should give them credit for that) were to be enhanced with meaningful differencies in endings and without the need to have to fight 2-3 enemies in between (come on, 500 enemies slain only after playing for good 30 hours?)But I assume all the modern ""story rich"" RPGs are in some way like that (ME, DE, whatever else). Or am I mistaken and the fighting system and other ""action"" elements of an RPG in those are fine?All in all I suppose personally I should have picked the Skyrim instead. Or Diablo 3, still haven't played but for its Demo.			",84,9,1,8,7,0,14

												""The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition"" is the title almost compulsory for fans of Geralt, but also for those who like a really dynamic fight. The story has great plots and you can go throw gameplay in many different ways and therefore there are different endings of the game. In addition to the main campaign is worth noting the arena mode, which occurs in the enhanced edition. Really worth to play!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After messing around with the tutorial and prologue, I never truly gave the Witcher much of a chance. It appeared to have a deep story and well-developed setting, but I didn't particularly enjoy the combat with a keyboard and mouse. Returning with an Xbox 360 controller, I now find the combat thoroughly enjoyable. The controls take some time to learn, but the combat is fair and requires thought (unless playing on easy). I am at the start of Chapter 2 and have officially become hooked on the Witcher universe. This has been one of my most enjoyable playthroughs this years. I greatly look forward to continuing the story in Witcher 3. If you are a fan of fantasy, adventure RPGs and clever dialogue, then I highly recommend the Witcher 2 Enhanced Edition.

												Not really sure what this game was about. I was in prison but then I was running from a dragon, only seconds later to be boning a sorceress and thrust into the center of a war-torn battlefield only then to be suddenly teleported back into a prison cell being beaten by two men.I can only conclude that the main character has inter-dimensional teleportation abilities but felt this aspect wasn't represented well in gameplay. I could only roll and slash with my sword and do some wierd fire thing. Wtf Nintendo? Please fix this.I also found it strange that a man can apparently kill a king in broad daylight in his own room in his own castle, only to escape by jumping out of a nearby window and plummeting to freedom whilst the main character sort of just stands there with his sword out and takes the hit for the whole thing. Why didn't Geralt just teleport away like he did earlier? On the other hand, almost every female character is naked at one point during this game, which is edgy for Nintendo to say the least. So I guess there's that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Picked it up for € 3.99 on special offer and boy, was that a deal. People talk about ""the graphics"", but that's the wrong term actually. Yes, the 3D engine is good for a 2011 game, but what really blows your mind is the LEVEL DESIGN. Screenshots don't do it justice since you really have to experience the diversity & complexity of the world hands-on. The entire visual design of the game is just so masterfully done that I don't even mind the fact that it regularly crosses the threshold of kitsch I can tolerate. Especially the sex scenes could do with a little less stilted moaning & catwalk moves, and instead some more teasing & creativity in general.So while I'm recounting the downers here's the rest of them:- Animations (doors, climbing, taking/dealing damage etc.) sometimes lock other movement annoyingly long. Especially casting sometimes gets locked for no apparent reason, so I end up standing like a dork in the middle of battle while hitting the cast button until it finally happens.- Male characters are quite well done, both visually, substantually and vocally. They are diverse and relate to the world in a meaningful manner. Female characters however seem generally a little more shallow. There are very few meaningful female roles, and all female characters in the game seem to fit a much more narrow blueprint. They look more alike, they act more similar, heck, they even seem to be all the same age. It's like somebody wanted all the women to fit a particular stereotype of ""hotness"" which gets boring very quickly (I still like Triss though, but she's about the only deep female NPC).Other than that I really can't think of any more downsides to this game, so since the ups have been discussed in other reviews extensively, it should be clear that this is a SUPER-awesome ARPG.

												This was the best RPG of 2011, and for me, 2013 as well. After two complete playthroughs to get the full story, I believe this is the most well written story in a fantasy RPG to date. The combat is also a joy once you get the hang of it's initially unintuitive style. Witcher 2 is more narrative heavy than most action RPGs, but that's what brought me back for a second full play. Two years later the graphics are still striking to behold at times. This game is definitely not for everyone, especially if you get bored with long story sequences. Passive or casual gamers will quickly get lost in the narrative. It was the most enjoyable RPG played by me the year it came out, and I was hard pressed to claim an equal this past year when I played a second time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rank: 8.5/10Recommendation(s): Play another Witcher title before (The Witcher 1)Major Theme: Slightly sluggish, but a great mix between 1 and 3.Bought at Price: $2.75 - Steam SaleI honestly thought I was going to have enough will power to play the Witcher series in order, but that turned out to be not the case. The first title turned out to be so dry; it was equivalent to having a dry mouth, being dragged face down in a desert for kilometers. There was a serious lack of humor, but the combat system proved to be greatly overhauled. While the system having its own new issues, made gameplay more pleasant than the machine like structure of the first.Graphics are vastly enhanced from the first, but still do not compare anywhere close to that of the third (and last?) Witcher title. Maybe that’s why they called it the “enhanced edition”. On that note, I cannot describe the difference between the two editions, as I have not played the original release.While the story was logical, and easy to follow, was a little let down. By no means was it horrible or not worth playing, it just again lacked humor. At some points in the game, you will find yourself playing a part just to move the story along (which felt very much like the first game in the series).I probably will not be replaying this title as I will be doing with the 3rd, but that should be no judge of quality.

												The Witcher 2, is my favorite game of all time. Here is why:When you first get into this game, one of the most incredibly made cinematics bids you welcome to the world and story. I am amazed that a small company like CDPR (used to be) could possibly deliever one of the most beautiful PC titles of all time, even in 2014. But these guys did it right. With a huge focus on story and it's characters, this game slowly opens up for a world that has so much more depth and feel to it than many other AAA open world games. This world has the advantage on being based on a great bookseries and a having a company behind it, that has the best intentions for everything that is behind it.It can be confusing to begin with, but without a doubt fully playable, without having played the first installment of the series. The mechanics can be a little clunky, and the developers have been forced to limit the world to big explorable areas instead of making it truly open world. But it works out for this game - Simply because everything you CAN do, is so incredibly detailed and perfected in every way. The lore and story is absolutely amazing and along with a great soundtrack and mindblowing visuals, it adds up to be the very best game I've ever played.I write this review after completing the game several times, on each difficulty and gathering all achievements. It is extremely challenging in beginning, but in this game, preperation and strategy, is highly rewarded. This is what makes this game so different and so much better from other games:- Choices matter. The choices you make can change the story completely. There's actually two completely seperated chapters based only one single choice in the game. It makes everything so much more interesting.- Everything is means something. There's no generic sides quests, like you know it from Skyrim and WoW. There's a lot of content, but they are all well thought out. You won't be forced to gather resources for hours - It will make sense in the end.- The story is so rich and incredibly well put together. Unlike many other RPGs, you don't get to costumize your character, but also means that the story becomes much more personal, mature and interesting. - The world, based on a book franchise, that I have now read, because of my love of the game gives this game a huge advantage. The lore is deep and detailed and CDPR has truly taken care of this in the best way possibly. This game also features some of the best soundtracks I know of.I am incredibly excited for The Witcher 3. And I believe that, to be the only game to ever beat this. That experience will show a truly open world, with a much bigger budget and therefore, far fewer limits. The simple fact, that the main story is around 50 hours long, says a lot about how important the story is in this franchise. I would recommend anyone who want to play Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt, to begin here. It'll give you a wonderful time, and prepare you for the third installment. I like the first game as well, but I think it might be a little too outdated by now. TL;DR: If you want to be a medieval jedi knight, you should play this game. And who doesn't want to be a medieval jedi knight? Seriously?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2 is an exemplarary sequel that manages to build upon the strengths of the Witcher 1, namely it's combat mechanics and plot twists, while addressing and improving on it's predecessor's flaws . An outstanding Role Playing Game, no two replays of this game will ever be the same. In the Witcher 2, you are thrust into the character of Geralt of Rivia, famed monster slayer and unintended savior of a king, where you must make the decisions that alter the fates of not only the protagonist but the world and its many characters about him. Its a compelling narrative about maintaining neutrality in a world that is morally ambiguous and deceptive. You will feel the sting of unintended consequences, and with a variety of supporting characters, all whose lives and motivations you will come to understand, decisions in this game are not made lightly . Aside from its storyline, the actual mechanics of the gameplay are superbly executed. Combat is visceral and tactical. Magic, Alchemy, and swordplay are your means of defeating your enemies, and the Witcher 2 introduces a menagerie containing all sorts of monsters, both fantastically gargantuan & sometimes human, whose strengths/weaknesses must be taken into account, especially on the hardest of difficulties. In the end, the Witcher 2 is a satisfying video game with a storyline that leaves it's impression upon you because of it's relation to your impact as Geralt. I'm optimistic about this franchise and look forward to future sequels.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my top 5 favorite rpg's of all time. Solid graphics and solid gameplay with a fantastic story. Countless amount of hours can be spent doing sidequests and exploring. The only gripe I have is the fight system can seem a little wonky but with some practice it can be mastered. No DRM on launch is a big plus. For only $4 this is a steal so grab it while you can!

												Bought it because it is on sale, and saw how awesome Witcher 3 was at E3. If you love RPGs then you need to do yourself a favor and play this game. It has taken the top spot on my list and I am not even done with it. Combat is fun and tough. Boss fights are epic, and character builds are fun. Worth every penny and more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well... What can i say im not done with the game but god. The story is so good and just i hate haveing to leave it for just going pee or poo. now thats just one thing im not dont with i love this game so much and i need the ending soon. Now for the gameplay. On easy fun and still not boreing like most games some thigns are still hard you still need to learn how to fight diffrent badies mostly monsters. and you hunt them you a witcher its what you do. There is really no bad thing about the fighting gameplay i think i do keep it on the lower levels just for the story and fun. So if you kinda stupit (like me) the game tells you how to kill monsters after you kill alot of them also some cool lore about them. Like with the Harpers (spelling is BAD) the first time you unlock the lore for them you find out they steal dreams while you sleep, also you dont get them back and they feed more off nightmares so thats good for some people. Now for the story stright up without spoilers. ITS FREAKING ASWOME! Now this is just the best story in a game ive seen in a long time just so good i never wanna stop playing jsut to see what happens next and theres HUGE choices to make and they can change everything. Also first time you see you girlfriend shes nude so BEWBS :).  Now for the bad things....  theres gliches for sure its almsot like skyrim kinda with them. Theres less but there wierd and some of them almost break the game for me and theres one bit in chapter 2 where the game dosent really tell you what to do so i kind adident die but got really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that it kept restarting me at teh same stupit place. but all in all its good. i give it a 9/10.

The ConsipracyCD Project RED have sold their souls in exchange for creating perfect digital art.The Original ClassicI remember back then, when the first Witcher came out it was something refreshing, captivating, even good, but still it wasn’t spectacular, despite some people calling it a new best RPG. Among its great strengths in story, quests, art and music it definitely had glaring issues: most notably, some annoying (to the point of being silly) combat moves and the fact that a good two thirds of it is spent in some sort of swamps, sewers and similar-looking dungeons.There was no hint of something huge coming ahead.Enter the Mighty SequelBut suddenly and unexpectedly, The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings is upon us. And here I am, trying to review it with my jaw dropped and dangling somewhere around my knees.You are Geralt, a witcher — a professional monster slayer caught in a midst of political conflict, intrigue and soon after that, on a long quest to clear your good name and discover more pieces in attempt to solve a puzzle of Wild Hunt and your dark past.Now this is something like ubelievable upgrade over previous installement, unmatched by anything in recent history. Everything you can possibly think of have been drastically improved, expanded and taken to breathtaking levels of visuals, music and sound. All environments are unique and are extremely rich in details: there’s no copy-paste ever.The characters, even NPCs, are alive, deep and interesting. There’s no other RPG where you would stop just to listen to NPC talk and smile at some story they tell each other. Every place, every spot, be it in town or outside, has an event connected to it and some amazing quest you can take on: escape from prison (be a master of stealth, or you can make it a little rough), participate in an assault on rebellious town alongisde king and teach his stupid son some good lesson, prevent military abuse of innocent civillians by beating an officer in a one-on-one swordfight, and get away with it because your king favors you so much; visit abandoned and haunted asylum to calm down the spirits of its victims and learn about its grim past, uncover treason and crime, take a taste of dirty medieval town life by participating in brawls, dice poker and arm wrestling games — and earn some additional coin with that!But There’s Much More!Meet mages, trolls (friendly and not so much), fight a giant Cthulhu with a sorceress by your side, join elves in their guerilla struggle against humans, assist dwarves and visit their mysterious town hidden somewhere deep in the mountains or, if you rather prefer that, stay in a dirty human military camp and become a new star of its colloseum-like fighting arena. The choice is always yours: so be prepared to take it and face the consequences (or enjoy them :-).CombatAnd did I even mention how great fights can be? Devise your tactics, approach and hunt monsters: all different, inhabiting their own areas and requiring unique means to successfully kill; pursue finest gear upgrades to assist yourself in your dirty job. Harvest for ingredients during your trips outside to brew and drink awesome poisions (of a witcher sort) and acquire inhuman powers for a short amount time. Buy materials, schematics and construct deadly traps, bombs and daggers to leave your enemies no chance. Approach several knights that dared to threaten you and perform a powerful finisher move, killing them all at once. Redirect arrows back at your enemies, use powerful witcher magic tricks to trap or stun your foes: block, riposte, perform a quick roll away, then jump and cut your unfortunate foe through while he recovers from a good blast of your yrden (not a typo). You have to fight dirty: you have to fight like a witcher.And all that above is just barely one third of what is in store for you.ConclusionI have no idea how CDPR were able to pull that all off.(Disregard my hours, I own it from elsewhere.)* * *[A blast of fire from dragon’s breath]— Witcher, how do you fight something like THIS?!— You don’t, you run.— Some professional you are!Outstanding.

												A much different product than its predecessor, The Witcher 2 maintains what is good about the first, and refines what is bad. With vastly improved graphics and a new fast-paced & brutal combat system, The Witcher 2 is very engaging and even challenging when necessary. Otherwise, The Witcher 2 retains an excellent story, and is definately a great contribution to the series. Overall, The Witcher 2 is definitely worth the money.			",49,7,0,9,4,0,13

												Alright, I'm here! I'm very late to the party, but finally I'm here. It only took close to five years. What took me so long, you ask? Well, part of the answer is that I'm not that into RPGs, but I've heard so much good about The Witcher 3 so I had to play the second to be able to import the save file to the third game. ""But why didn't you play the first game?"", good question. I did play the first game for some hours, but as many others I stopped due to it's fighting mechanics being really bad. Storywise, it was just fine.So, what did I think about this game? It's a great looker, even though it has been five years since its first release (Enhanced Edition was released a year later). The voice acting is as solid as expected - especially Geralt's voice. The background music is really fitting and ups the mood for the player, really bombastic and energetic music when there's a huge battle against a dragon or something like that. The story was great and can't wait to see how they continue it in the third game.But most of all - if you're a fan of RPGs and you haven't play this one yet, I do recommend you do that. When there's a sale, you can get this game for less than €5, that's NOTHING.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2 continues the epic story of professional monster slayer for hire; Geralt of Rivia. If you have played the first game you will probably already have an idea of what you can expect. The Witcher 2 begins a few months after the events of the first game. If you haven't played the first you may be a bit at a loss with regards to some elements in the story.Without spoiling the story you proceed through the game searching for the 'kingslayer' and the choices you make will ultimately decide the ending of the story you get. (This ending can then be transferred to Witcher 3.) You follow one of two main story paths. You either can side with blue stripes commander Vernon Roche or with Scoitatel renegade and guerilla fighter Lor'veth. The combat in Witcher 2 has been refined considerably from the first game. whereas the first game relied on a timing mechanic; The Witcher 2 adds in things like parry's to the mix. I strongly recommend playing the first game prior as it will give greater context to the events that occur in this follow up. I also strongly recommend playing this game prior to Witcher 3 for the same reason. However the Witcher 3 does a decent job of providing additional information about the world and characters. You can find these in in-game character profiles as well as books you can find during your playthrough.As you can see it took me about 40 or so hours to play through the game. But this is a game where your investment will pay off with a satisfying conclusion that you can then build on in the Witcher 3. If you are looking for a deep story driven RPG where there is no 'right' choice; and for those choices to matter? Witcher 2 is a fantastic choice.			",85,9,0,9,7,0,16

												*Disclaimer A: This is an ongoing review, I'll update it once I progress further into the game**Disclaimer B: This review was originally a negative one, it now has been edited*Thank you, killJoy12345! My initial review was very negative. It was based on me trying the game with a controller. Here is recommendation no.1: Do not try to play this with a controller. Who knows, I am sure some will succeed playing the game with one... I didn't. At all. The tutorial alone, attempted with an Xbox-controller, frustrated me so much that I had to quit right in the middle of the arena. It just felt so incredibly imprecise, confusing, clunky and weird. I compared it to being drunk out of your mind while trying to control an overloaded 40 ton-truck with a wobbly old joystick from the early 80s or something. I quit and uninstalled, not bothering to try again as I had bought this for like 3 bucks during a sale. I have changed my mind very much, and am falling more in love with the game the longer I play it, and I think I start to understand just why the game is so revered. I am now playing this with a mouse and a keyboard. The mouse to look around and using my attacks, the keyboard for moving. I use a Razer Naga, and with the number keys on its side, it's quite easy to control using the standard/default key settingsWith these numbers (with the Naga or keyboard), WASD, Q and R plus the Alt key to target-lock, the controls get much better. I'd also recommend to adjust the mouse settings, and lower the sensitivity. With the naga, it's set to the lowest possible value. This works well for looking around without being too slow, plus it is precise enough to handle the arm-wrestling minigame (which you need for a quest, where you do that instead of paying with money). Said arm-wrestling takes a tiny bit of practice, but I was then able to beat most opponents. Now for the game itself. Graphics/Setting/storyI said that the graphics are merely ok. I kinda stick to that, even considering the game isn't brand-new. They're quite pretty, but they're not exactly total state of the art even for the time it came out IMO. They ARE quite atmospheric though, and help to suck you into the game. And gee, there is a lot to be sucked into, as the game REALLY is quite addictive and enticing IMO. The story is quite interesting... a bit of cliché sometimes, but mainly a well-written and multi-layered story. Depending on how you want to play Geralt, you can be either a nice goodie-two-shoes, sticking to a moral high-road, or you can be a rather intimidating, threatening and sinister figure, doing whatever it takes to achieve his goal. The dialogues are nice, sometimes you have to pick your answers quickly. I am not that far into the game yet... I mentioned this will be an ongoing review, I will add updates once I progress more. So far, I am VERY into it, want to see how the story plays out, want to learn more about the world it is set in. Handling/Controls/FightingI mentioned above that the combination of KB plus Naga works quite well. I still need to practice a bit, as some of the controls are a bit...wobbly. It sometimes takes a tiny bit longer to target a lootbag, ladder, climbing/point. Fighting feels pretty dynamic, and you can succeed even if you don't target-lock enemies. So far, it was pretty much up to me how I wanted to fight mobs... using mostly swords, signs or quickslots (traps/bombs/daggers). I am sure that later on, you need to decide on some of these for specific mobs, acting with a bit more tactic, while right now, I am slashing my way through the mobs rather easily while throwing in an occasional Aard or Ignis for tougher mobs or those that shield themselves. Regarding controls and handling, this game gets a 7 or 8 out of 10 so far. I wish it'd feel a bit more precise especially out of combat, when you pick up stuff or loot. Not as good as some AC or Arkham-titles in my opinion.Update: Just did the first boss fight, and it was tough. I did have to do some research on YT. An NPC gives you SOME hints during the fight, but Im not sure how much they'd help to figure out the correct tactic without help. However, I eventually beat it, and it was quite satisfying. Soundtrack/Voice actingVery very nicely done. The music isn't annoying you, it rather adds to the atmosphere, and even with quite a few repetitions, it doesnt get boring. Pros:- Graphics are decent to very nice. Not mind-blowing, but pretty dang good.- Music and voice-acting are very well done and work nicely for the vibe.- FIghting feels dynamic... even if sometimes it's buggy (fighting my way out of a prison often had me light or extinguish torches on the wall while trying to actually slash away at a guard. Didn't die, but the combination of ""use torch with left-click, slash at opponent with... left click"" wasnt helpful.I hear Witcher III will be even better when it comes to controls.- Interesting and deep story, very nice to follow and read, even though there are a LOT of plotlines and chars, so maybe some extra research at a wiki would be helpful to understand it better. Cons- Controls often are a bit too wobbly, not quite precise enough. If they weren't, the game would be close to absolutely perfect. This doesn't apply much to the fight, but more to everything in between.- 2 crashes so far, hope this doesn't happen more often. The game does autosave, but I recommend to manually save from time to time. 2nd crash was on exiting an instance, and not even CTL AlT DEL would help to close the crashed game (funny: the ""loading icon"" was still moving, but the game had crashed)- One big immersion-killer: You can't jump. Yes, you can jumproll in certain directions while fighting to dodge attacks (direction key plus space, took me a bit of practice). So this powerful demon hunter walks through the area, and there is a 10 inch rise in the landscape... you can't raise a foot or jump up, you have to walk all around it. This kinda kills the immersion and feels weird. I guess they wanted to do this to guide you with paths in between rises, but that adds a ""on rails"" feeling while also feeling very unnatural. - Some of the QTEs are very fast and you might fail a few times, especially since the first ones happen quite surprisingly. DOn't worry, they won't kill you quickly, you just need to adjust quickly in order to succeed. YMMV:- Your questlog fills up rather quickly. A lot of the quests have a tracker to help you find the right spot and person, but some require you to think or search a bit. Also, read the questlog (which is well-written!). If you are used to WOW-type questing, with handholding to the extreme, TLDR-summaries at the bottom and trackers for every single quest, you might have to readjust. - Some might dislike the minigames like the wrestling. It does take practice for sure.- The menus can be quite overwhelming at first. Alchemy, talent trees, meditation etc... take your time.And that leads me to one big piece of advice: I think (at least so far) this game is MUCH more enjoyable if you take your time and savor each step. Watch the cutscenes. Read the questlogs and information provided. Enjoy the quests and solving them instead of trying to rush through them as much as possible. Try some different approaches to fights, don't ignore the quickslot items or potions or signs. If you prefer swordplay, then go ahead, but I recommend to try different styles, or mix them up a bit. I haven't fought a boss-yet... so far, the game hints that it will be a bit of work to kill the first one, and requires tactics. I hope it does, and I hope I will figure it out.So, for now: A solid 9/10, very fascinating and immersive, with a cool story, cool main-character, a very nice and sinister vibe to it (the 18-rating is pretty appropriate as far as I can tell), and it's obvious that a LOT of work went into this. WILL UPDATE!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												They took everything great in the Witcher 1 (the story, the dialogues, the immersion...) and made it better by upgrading the graphics, the gameplay and the character design. I really recommend this game, and if you plan on playing the 3rd, don't hesitate to play this one too (or even the first one if you are not afraid of the difference in gameplay).I have only sided with the Scoia'tael yet (same as in the Witcher 1 as it seemed to be the only reasonable choice to me) but I already know that I'll replay it siding with the other faction as both groups are ambiguous.I would just recommend to take a few mods to make it more enjoyable (nexus account is free) :http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/276/? : automatically hides the UI out of combat.http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/697/? : Geralt is supposed to use pirouettes, not rolling on the ground, this mod just changes the animation for dodges to make it more book friendly.http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/115/? : this one is maybe the most important as the most annoying thing in this game is that all items are way too heavy (including all ingredients for potions/bombs)A few advices for beginners : I see people complaining about the tutorial at the beginning... it's actually because there isn't really one ; I would then recommend anyone to just check the different controls online, recommend you to use potions (always use the regenerative one), oils on your blade (they increase dramatically the damages you deal to enemies) and runes on your weapons and armors. The steel sword is for the humans and the silver one is for all kind of monsters, and if you have a doubt wether it's a monster or a human, use the silver one.			",74,18,0,27,7,0,8

												Well... What can i say im not done with the game but god. The story is so good and just i hate haveing to leave it for just going pee or poo. now thats just one thing im not dont with i love this game so much and i need the ending soon. Now for the gameplay. On easy fun and still not boreing like most games some thigns are still hard you still need to learn how to fight diffrent badies mostly monsters. and you hunt them you a witcher its what you do. There is really no bad thing about the fighting gameplay i think i do keep it on the lower levels just for the story and fun. So if you kinda stupit (like me) the game tells you how to kill monsters after you kill alot of them also some cool lore about them. Like with the Harpers (spelling is BAD) the first time you unlock the lore for them you find out they steal dreams while you sleep, also you dont get them back and they feed more off nightmares so thats good for some people. Now for the story stright up without spoilers. ITS FREAKING ASWOME! Now this is just the best story in a game ive seen in a long time just so good i never wanna stop playing jsut to see what happens next and theres HUGE choices to make and they can change everything. Also first time you see you girlfriend shes nude so BEWBS :).  Now for the bad things....  theres gliches for sure its almsot like skyrim kinda with them. Theres less but there wierd and some of them almost break the game for me and theres one bit in chapter 2 where the game dosent really tell you what to do so i kind adident die but got really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that it kept restarting me at teh same stupit place. but all in all its good. i give it a 9/10.

												The Witcher 2 was a wonderful game in all aspects and a major improvement over the first game in the series. Geralt isn't only dealing with Temeria anymore. The fate of all the Northern Kingdoms is at stake. The story and narration lives up to the hype of the first, and in fact, has Geralt making many more decisions with varying consequences. Characters are much more fleshed out. Be prepared to face situations where you're wedged between two characters that you like, only being able to help one of them. Many times, decisions simply don't have a right answer, and other times it can be good vs bad mystery that you have to decipher by paying attention to clues given to you. You get to shape Geralt to become the character you want. My main complaint, is that the game eventually forces you to a fork in the road. This decision essentially takes over a full chapter in the story, and I although you get to visit places from both paths in one playthrough, you can end up missing a lot of important story elements if you aren't careful. I ended up glossing over the sidequest for an important character in the Witcher 3 because I was so invested in finishing the main quest. It's also totally neat to see decisions carry over from the previous game, and don't forget, the decisions you make also carry over to the Witcher 3!Combat has been completely overhauled. Say goodbye to the timed clicks, because the new combat system is entirely momentum based. The new perk tree allows Geralt to fight as a swordsman, a mage, a hunter, or any combination. Sword swings are dictated with the left and right mouse buttons, alllowing Geralt to alternate between fast or strong slashes. Enemies will flinch when attacked, giving your offenses a sense of weight. Spells and sidearms can be conveniently selected and used via a quickbar, and Geralt can roll around dodging attacks like a madman. There's still much room for improvement, however. Fighting still feels a bit clunky at times, and ragdolls (or the lack of) can make killing enemies really awkward because they just topple over. Attacks from bosses can also have extended hitboxes, as I have died many times over after getting clipped by an attack that was seemingly out of my range. Rolling may become your primary means of mobility, and it can be troublesome to use. Enemies will tend to swarm you, and blocking/reposting leaves you vulnerable from other angles while rolling may tumble you into other enemies. It's all about tactically positioning yourself, which can be seen as a welcome challenge, or an eventual annoyance. I will definitely say that there is a high learning curve to this new combat style. Unlike the first Witcher, which has Geralt acquire each of his Witcher signs throughout the game, the Witcher 2 throws all of the signs at you at once, along with a load of projectiles and potions which aren't explained very well at all. I totally failed the tutorial, which suggested for me to play on easy. I was still able to complete the game on hard, but it was far from easy. Aside from the main gameplay, you can also participate in dice poker, arm wrestling, and brawls (QTE simulator). They weren't that fun, but hey, they're not nothing.Graphically, the game is beautifully designed. The forest outside Flotsam was densely packed with greenery and looked totally sinister at night time. It was dissapointing that there were no major cities to explore, but each settlement Geralt visits has a unique rugged atmosphere. I do think that the world is a bit oversaturated, though. Colors tend to be very sharp. Characters also have great face textures, and unique characters have great memorable designs. Unfortunately, a lot of models are reused throughout the game for minor characters. The music, although my least favorite of the three Witcher games, still isn't bad at all. There was a wide array of scores that fit both emotional and intense scenes from the game. To me, the soundtrack just sounded more like stereotypical fantasy music as opposed to The Witcher or The WItcher 3 (hands down my favorite!). Still, try listening to the song Sorceresses. It's quite enchanting.In the end despite some flaws, The Witcher 2 was a true fantasy RPG mixed with exceedingly challenging yet rewarding combat. I highly recommend playing the original Witcher to get a better sense of the massive story/world and a basic handling for Geralts abilities. It is defintely an exciting experience to learn about the world of the WItcher. Pros:-Great interactive story filled with morality-based decisions-Challenging but rewarding combat-Interesting and well designed recurring characters-Beautiful level design-Solid soundtrackCons: -Combat can seem a bit unrefined-Newbies to the Witcher may have a hard time finding their footing-Fork in the road can cause you to miss some story elementsTL;DR: Play as Geralt of Rivia, the White Wolf, as you choose the lesser evil, mess around with spells, roll all over the place during fights, and die a lot.

												The lame action-based fight system is a disappointment. I mean Witcher 1 didn't have a good fight system, but who cares? It was a RPG with great story, atmosphere and original alchemy system, and these aspects weren't improved In W2. Otherwise, they tried a new fight system that really didn't work well. I still recommend it for the story and atmosphere, but it's certainly a worst game than W1, which is better in all aspects, except graphics and art.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. The story is great and the voice acting is one of the best I've ever heard. Has some great reasons for you to replay the game. The choices actually affect the story and the eventual ending. There is also multiple endings which you make you want to know what happens if you chose the other guy instead the guy you chose, or what if I fought this guy instead not fighting him. (I'm trying to leave as little spoilers as possible). The graphics are fantastic and the environment around Geralt really fits the situation that he's currently in.			",88,12,4,13,7,2,5

												Perhaps my favorite RPG ever. Excellent writing, good voice acting, absolutely beautiful. If there's anything bad I can say about the game, it's that the combat is rather unforgiving to start -- but if you play through a second time, you'll find it much easier, which is to say that the combat is based on player skill. So, I guess that's not really a bad thing.			",96,28,4,34,16,0,27

												The tale continues and it looks pretty impressive, but it's quite fundamentally different in all the ways that made The Witcher loved or hated or just extremely annoying and yet it's more of the same and a lot you've never read before. It can be quite entertaining, which compensates for the boring and frustrating parts, but it really leaves me with a mixed feeling. The good parts isn't about gameplay at all, but the bad and really bad parts is all about gameplay. Graphics, music and voice-overs are all pretty well done even though the language can be really weird and far too modern at times. Combat is completely different than the first game. The first Witcher game punish you for clicking too much, too soon or too late. I didn't like it, because that was also a twitch-fest. Not about clicking a lot, but clicking on reflex and a timed one of that. This game on the other hand punishes you for clicking too little all the time. It's also a much more hand-held game that constantly flashes buttons to push during brawling and wrestling is a total click-fest and it happens quite often that the game ignores its own features and mechanics and flashes the primary button to push to advance the story. People that mention being Geralt of Rivia in their reviews are totally wrong. At best you are a puppet, at worst you are just a spectator, but it's all just a story and the telling is pretty good. Geralt just happen to be the lead actor and therefore the game mostly puppeteer you as him, but on occassion it switch characters and leave you to make that one lose or moonwalk just because it can. Sometimes it changes the game into an isometric platformer.. Other times it let you jump or climb the same step.. But never the one that would be a shortcut and mostly never anywhere where it would have been really useful.. It takes control away from you to show you moves that you wish you could do on your own, but it never let you. During the first chapter you have to deal with a huge creature.. You can make a trap for it, but the Trap isn't like any other trap.. You can't deploy it randomly, there a few select spots where you are supposed to left-click to use it - not at all like a trap. It happens quite a lot that skills that normally work in one way has to be used in a completely different hand-held way.. Several times during this fight, the game will switch your game view or flash a button, both the LMB and the RMB and then you also have to use the Space bar.. I really resent games like this, because I don't feel like a player at all, but like someone who is being played with a bunch of twisted developers laughing in the corner gloating about what they made me do.. It's really humiliating. During an interrogation of a prisoner you are supposed to use a particular sign to calm the prisoner, but you are not supposed to select the sign and fire it.. You are supposed to move around the prisoner to a specific spot where the game will flash you a LMB to activate the sign and then a click-fest ensues. Epic fail, again. No more Pin-ups. The trophy hunting for babes is virtually non-existant. There is only one new trophy (with an Achievement for it) without a pinup.. You also get to do Triss again, but somehow it feels more like kissing your sister with the recycle of an animation that is virtually the same for every prosti--tute in the game. There is a actually a lot of women in the game and thus a hell of lot of missed opportunities and the reason I bothered faking interest in any of them was because of the Pin-ups of Witcher 1. Pointless. Unfortunately the game is also much more unresponsive, slower and clunkier than ever before and it has a lot of immersion breaking cutscenes in combat, where your view changes and the game changes your direction or the game shows off some vicious killing blows that ends with you dying once the game stops gloating about how awesome it would really like to be and relinguish control to you again, because during all these cutscenes, where you see everything in slow-motion, the rest of the game moves at normal speed.. Seriously?!  It happened a lot that I was keeping a distance to foes and trying to single them one at a time and then suddenly I would lose control as the game would show me some particularly vicious move and as soon as I finished I was completely surrounded by that group of enemies that I had kept a distance too.. And then there is nothing to do, because every Sign, Move and Bomb has a substantial trigger time that is easily interrupted by enemy hits.. It's a bit hard not to recommend this game, even though I've often been tempted to do it, because even though it has an insurmountable lot of flaws and too much hand holding it is a pretty great and intriguing story and it has value for two replays, because there are two branching story lines (Either you go with Roche and you get one special Chapter 2 or you go with Iorveth and you get a different Chapter 2) that changes the middle part before it finishes up to the same end. Why would I not recommend this game? Well, for one thing most of the fanbois seem to think that this is the greatest RPG of all times even though it's virtually not a RPG at all. It's pretty much ""only"" a great Action Adventure with some light RPG Character Building elements. Thinking of this game as a RPG at all really turned me off in the beginning. Picking dialogue is .. like pushing play to a non-interactive cutscene of conversation.. Just like in the first Witcher, there is a massive level of missed opportunities to step  into character. And just playing ONE class.. It doesn't matter how much or little else you can do with Geralt, because he's a two-handed swordman that either wields a steel sword or a silver sword. He's neither good nor evil, not even when he pick a side. If not-picking means less gameplay, not-picking is not a valid option. The combat is a huge click-fest and has a bit of OOMPH about it, because in the first fight in the game 60% of all players unlocked the Perfectionist Achievement where you kill 10 foes without loss of vitality.. But even though it's a bit entertaining it's just a means to do something else, but the worst part is that the game often falls flat on your face when faced with mortal danger and when you realize there is one and only one solution how to kill a boss it really cheapens the experience. Frustrating at best, forgettable at worst. Never gratifying. Dialogue is all scripted. The game is literally drowning in missed opportunities, but then again, it's on the rails of a book..  I guess this game represents what Blue-Ray wanted to be. (Partially) Interactive Movies. I played this game on PC with Mouse and Keyboard. On a system, that were pretty high-end 5-6 years ago, but is somewhere in the middle now. The game decided that I should play on High, but I picked a custom setting closer to Medium and enabled Morphological AA to smoothen out the picture. FPS were about 45-50 at all times during gameplay. This is really a game where a programmable mouse with an X-Fire button is a bliss. On my old and venerable A4-Tech X7 I have this X-Fire button that shoots Triple-left-clicks at the speed of light which saved me from more horrible gameplay than I can count legs on a caterpillar. I imagine it would probably be better suited for a Gamepad or an XBox experience, because all the fancy moves are double taps, which is really quite silly, because it's the only useful way to move in combat at all. In Combat ""rolls"" should have been the default action. I played it twice, first on Hard to Easy and second time on Dark, each one on one of two different paths. This is the first time I felt the need to use a Walkthrough. Not because it was hard, but because it was so bloody annoying at times and slow moving.			",73,19,1,12,0,0,2

												One of my absolute favorite games of this decade. The grim, unpredictable story is just amazing. Character development is great. Dialogue is exciting. The choices you are gonna have to make, are many in numbers and impacts the story greatly, leaving you the desire to play it again and go different routes. Definetely not a game you wanna rush. Combat is good. Skill progression is fun, with lots of options. Graphically, it's still amazing, even when compared to recent games. Exploration feels great, and rewarding. Good variety of fun, interesting and well designed side quests, with well written stories. Overall, this game is a piece of art. This is one of those games you should play before you die. And I'm not lightly saying that. It is a great example of how a game should be.     I cannot wait to see what CDR does with The Witcher 3. I have no doubt it will be a great game, and maybe even more than that.Need I say more? Go, minions.. Go, and BUY this game.			",136,23,2,14,8,2,30

												I really wish they would quit advertising this game for linux on the front page of steam.. Keep selling it for linux if they must, but its advertisement as being available for steamos/linux has been on the front page for far too long. This is not what we want linux noobs to try and play and think this is what linux gaming is about.. they have heard enough crap about gaming on linux and this only adds fuel to the negative press linux gets as a gaming platform. Yes it starts up.. and yes you can technically ""play"" it. Though I cannot suggest anybody play this title in linux. I had picked it up on sale and never really played it until the linux version came out and I finally got excited for it only to be really let down. It is NOT a native linux title by any stretch of the imagination as it uses a ""wine type"" wrapper to make it run on linux. So just deal with it and play this game on windows if you are going to play it. I will not ""not"" recomend this game as it's gorgeous if you have the hardware for it and from what I have played is a great game. I am just adding to the growing list of warnings about this title for linux so the linux noobs don't get the wrong idea.EDIT* Forgot I wrote this, I should note that they made great strides in getting the performance of the EON wrapper to a much more acceptable level and I can actually recommend it to be played in Linux now. Don't expect it to run as well as in windows but it is certainly acceptable IMO.			",171,15,4,12,8,1,22

												A vibrant, violent fantasy world where the inhabitants are not absolutely good or evil, but rather act for the benefit of themselves or of their people. The storyline differs heavily (especially at one point) depending on your choices so you need at least two playthroughs to fully experience it. A must play especially if you are into Western RPGs, especially at the prices it drops to during Steam sales.  Looking forward to the sequel!			",171,45,4,29,14,1,17

												A masterwork. The only problem I find in this game is that sometimes cutscenes feel a bit awkward, with Geralt moving his arms in a weird way (could be a bug/glitch but I'm actually not that sure) or looking at someone else with weird face. It could actually also be me.One of the best action-RPG games without any doubt. The combat is pretty awesome combining spells and two swords. There's also crafting recipes in towns and upgrades, loads of gear and awesome locations (play this game on a high-end machine - if you have a not-so-powerful PC just go for the console version).A pure gem - buy it (you have to prepare yourself for Witcher 3!!). And read the books if you're into books.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great story, great characters, great graphics, great game. It surely has it's flaws, some of them bigger than others, but then again what game is perfect?The biggest problem I had with this game was that it has been crashing quite a lot, usually that's not a major problem as long as you quicksave frequently but it's annoying regardless.I've been playing on the highest difficulty (which is ""Dark""; ""Insane"" is the same but won't let you save) and gameplay wise I had the feeling that the difficulty curve was a little off as it started out pretty hard but became fairly easy towards the end. That being said I know that it's nearly impossible to perfectly balance an open world game as this one and on the upside this game supports all sorts of mods so you can tweak the gameplay to your liking.The combat feels rather clunky at first but I found myself getting used to it within a short period of time, nonetheless I think that having the ability to (hard-)lock on enemies would have vastly improved the combat experience (while there is a lock-on system present, it's kind of useless as it doesn't lock your camera as well). Also a little tip, make sure to max out your rolling distance as soon as you can.Another freature that I'm missing in this game is a New Game Plus of some sort (starting over with your current gear but stronger enemies), the game offers great replay value so it's a mystery to me why nothing alike was included.While you don't need to play Witcher 1 in order to be able to follow the story of Witcher 2 (the stories aren't even related for that matter), I would still strongly recommend to play Witcher 1 first as many of the main characters are returning and knowing the backstory from Witcher 1 will make your experience in both Witcher 2 and 3 superior.TL;DR:In contray to Witcher 1 this one isn't an old school but a ""modern style"" RPG and it's a pretty great one at that. Buy it.			",42,6,0,4,1,0,8

												The Witcher is a dark, gritty, and mature RPG. It is probably one of the most grounded, and interesting RPG I've ever played. The Witcher itself is based on its famous novels written by Andrzej Sapkowski. Geralt of Rivia, The White Wolf, is a monster hunter for pay. Throughout Geralt's journey through Temeria for work, he is conflicted with political issues that arise after the events at Vizimia; this takes place during the Witcher 1. Geralt is now faced with treason, and is set out on a journey to clear his name. The Witcher 2 has a though provoking story that requires your attention. Books you pick up, as well as notes should be read. The books you find will tell you the history of the Witcher universe, and give you tips when fighting difficult opponents. You will also be making choices that actually do make a difference within the universe. The combat in the Witcher 2 is probably its weakest aspect. It is, however, much better than the combat system introduced in the Witcher 1. In the Witcher 2, you are required to roll around during almost any combat situation. This effectively makes signs, or any other defensive abilties obselete. The Witcher 2 requries a necessary playthrough as its story, characters, and universe are provoking. Even if the Witcher's combat system is medicore at best, it won't stop you from enjoying the numerous other aspects that the Witcher does correctly. Summary: Positive:+Story+High graphical fidelity+Unforgettable charactersNegative: -Combat			",167,30,3,26,8,0,12

												Performance:Really impressed with how well-made the new engine is. Loads faster(which is kind of surprising because the first game's load times weren't even long), stutters less, and, of course, looks prettier. And I mean much prettier. You don't expect games that look this much better than their prequels to actually perform better than them.The only things about it that I don't like are the differed rendering(alternate form of rendering that only supports [and works] [with] a form of anti-aliasing that has been specifically coded into the game, cancelling out any kind of AA forced on from your graphics control panel. Use SweetFX for AA.), sharpness filter(you'll wanna turn it off in your user config, but make sure to force Anisotrophic Filtering on), and the bloom. The bloom.. I usually am ok with bloom in my games, but I had to turn this game's off. There is just too much of it. For my eyes, anyway.Graphics settings:Many graphics settings available for tweaking. There's a lot you can make changes to that will help the game run better on your rig, if it needs itControls:Controls are greatly improved. Dodging actually works consistently, unlike in the last game. Same with parrying. Same with attacking. I remember instances in the first Witcher where the system sometimes wouldn't let me attack opponents if they were close to me or surrounded me or just didn't let me attack them(while not stunned, etc). When attacking, you use either the left or right mouse button. Either are for heavy or light attacks. Is not like the first Witcher where you select an attack style and click on a foe. The buttons are the styles, so they have to be used/pressed after each attack. Can be combined.They took out the feature that let's you press/hold a button/key to highlight/display whatever in view can be interacted with, as well as the the feature that's you select what you want to interact with the cursor, while you hold/press a button. It's not that big of a deal not having it, but you now have to just run up to something you see, and click on it to do whatever with it.Gameplay:Am a few hours into the game, but can say it's very much like the first. Only, better.Combat is same, but more engaging. Also kinda harder(but I was playing on Dark/Insane difficulty.). You can meditate anywhere(no fireplaces/characters needed) that wouldn't be considered dangerous(out of battle, not in the presence of enemies). Inside or outside.So far, the choice system is still here. I've been in situations in the game where I could, as an example, stop a crime or let it follow through. There are also sub-choices, which can sometimes be made after main choices have been made. Good/bad/etc ones are available.EDIT:Overall:Have since spent more hours playing the game and am enjoying it. The story is very much still that of The Witcher's, and the gameplay is very fun. Good combat, and there more options for interacting with characters you encounter than there were in last Witcher game.The game feels like it was made on PC, which is awesome. Same as the last game. Same level of detail in the enviornments, great graphics, and doesn't feel like some technically-constrained console port.""coughs"" Skyrim ""coughs"" Fallout			",84,5,0,4,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2 isn't a perfect game. The inventory system is pretty terrible compared to Witcher 1's, blade oils and potions have been downgraded significantly  (and  the timers for them, now reduced to a few minutes at most, don't seem to pause during dialogue, meaning if you don't skip through dialogue after reading the subtitles you might spent several potions and oils preparing for a fight only get into a pre-fight dialogue and have them all unwittingly wasted away), and the magical signs in turn have been buffed to the point of almost being broken, with Yrden in particular rendering most bosses trivial. The dice poker is now a single-round exercise in trying to move your mouse as microscopically as you can in order to not cause every dice to go canonballing off of the board, and the fistfighting diversion is now just a bunch of QTEs.But when you look past all that, The Witcher 2 is by far one of the better RPGs of its generation. The dialogue and general writing are great, and the politics and general lore are more fleshed out and interesting than in the first game. The quest design in general has been greatly improved, and even though there are less monster hunting quests than in the first game they're generally deeper, involving you researching the monsters and doing specific goals to fully eradicate the threat instead of just lobbing off a few heads and turning them in. The game is overall shorter than the first game, but only because it branches off after the first chapter and essentially becomes two different stories which then further branch out, leading to plenty of replayability. You'll have forgotten all of the flaws I listed up above within the first chapter of the game, and it's overall definitely worth a purchase if you're into RPGs.  ",574,245,9,46,42,6,55

												Supposedly one of the biggest & best RPGs ever, well I certainly went in with some expectations reading that.The game started off great, sure there was a lot to take in, but the boss battles were tough, there was tons of stuff to experience & everything looked terrific.  Unfortunately as you progress the boss battles become too easy, the isn't really that much in the world to explore & the game seems over too quickly (well it feels quick even though it was +30 hours for me).Had the boss battles remained tough, crafting provided more reward & the ending not so abrupt W2 would be a solid 9/10 for me.  Unfortunately these issues plus a known quit to desktop issue you have to google to find a solution to leaves me at a 7/10.			",140,21,20,27,4,0,17

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition Short Review: Still in progress. :P  Graphic: Superb Simply one of the best looking game at the time of its release and still is in my opinion. You probably need at least a GTX660 to run this one in 60 fps.  Gameplay: Good I rate this as good because while the overall gameplay is Excellent, however, the combat is kinda a let-down. It's difficult and it takes a while to get used to it. Dark Souls may be hard, but the combat isn't that bad. It's fun and altogether very enjoyable. It's a very different case with The Witcher 2, I'm afraid.  ",41,8,0,7,12,0,16

												The Withcer 2 is definetly a must see game.  If you haven't played any of the Witchres series you don't know what your missing !  If the story line doesn't pull you in to put in more hours then the constant non stop action will.  Not to mention the graphics and content are amazing, You kind of drawn into being ""Geralt of Rivera,"" as if you really him.  I only wish that the blood was a litle redder... But gaining levels and increase in Witcher magic and creating potions with alchemy, and increasing your swordmanship in skill.  And being one of the best bounty hunters ever created is your thing ""The Witcher 2 Assiassins of Kings is the game for you.  Can't wait purchase Wild Hunt!  Game on!			",140,14,2,28,4,0,8

												I own both, the first and second part of The Witcher. I was not able to finish the first game, didn't like it that much, seemed quite boring for me, although it introduces you to lots of things that will make The Witcher 2 much more enjoyable. The Witcher 2 is Stunning. The graphics are very nice, the sounds make you feel like if you were in a real medieval town. The gameplay is much better than the one of the first game. Storywise i've liked it so far, to such point that I am already considering to replay it just to know what would happen if I had chosen a different path (just for your knowledge I never replay games). Some people say that the first game is better than the second one. When I started the first one I ""Meeh I just want to finish this one just to be able to play the second one"". I only have 15 hours of gameplay of the second one and I can't wait to keep playing, the plot is unbelievable.BUY THIS GAME... it's worth the money and it will be a good way to pass this winter holidays.For my taste it is best played with a controller.

												BUY THIS GAMEV.I. -  variable immersion  ->  You can immerse yourself in the witcher world as much as you like.The harder mode you select the more you will be immersed.  YOU (not your character) will NEED to learn how to make the best/cheapest potions, swords, armors etc. And you WILL need to use them in order to finish the game. Hard=Rewarding combat -> In the beginning you might find the combat hard, but if you spend some time in the ""Arena"" (an Arcade like mode that you can play before you start the story , you can practice and learn the combat). Killing a monster makes you feel like a real witcher , because it requires skill and THOGHT.Great side missions ->  The side missions are NOT  repetitive. In each area you will have contracts which you don`t have to  take, they are not even mentioned in the story , you will have to find the board where they are posted on. They EXPAND the world of the witcher.  There are huge areas that you might not even see if you don't take on the side missions.GREAT DEVELOPER -> This team has updated their game with DLC for FREE since 2011.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my favorite RPG of all time. FULL STOP. You are hearing this from someone who played Planescape Torment, System Shock 2, Baldur's Gate, Fallout, and so on...The amount of meaningful choices in this game is immense, you can even change 2 entire chapters of this game just because of ONE choice. The story is really intriguing, filled with political and racial conflict, while still maintaining a very personal feel and with some great characters to accompany you on this journey.The combat is probably the most divisive element of the game, some will enjoy it (like I did), and others won't (at least it's a better combat system than the one in the first Witcher).Technically, it still holds up today, and this was released in 2011, although some animations are a bit robotic, but that is something omnipresent on RPG's, so I let it pass. Both the voice acting and music are great.Honestly, if you like RPG's, just buy this, it has some insane replay value, great modding comunity, and you can catch it on sale on Steam regularly.

												The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is one of the finest examples of how great an RPG can be. There's simply no competitor that can touch it in terms of poise, characterisation and storytelling, or the way in which it treats you not as a player - someone to be pandered to and pleased - but as an adult, free to make your own mistakes and suffer a plot in which not everyone gets what they deserve.In the end, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is a visually impressive game that contains a very sturdy gaming engine. If you haven't played a traditional RPG in awhile, the learning curve is a little steep and challenging at the start but once you have the experience under your belt and selected a direction for your character, battles will slowly become easier but fortunately there is always something along the way to challenge you. This is what RPG's are all about and I sincerely hope that this game will become the template for games to come on the PC.I Consider the Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is the Best RPG Ever Made!  I RECOMEND THI GAME!			",175,33,4,19,14,4,20

  8.60 Out of 10	 The Witcher 2.Sigh..This game.It was released on 2011,a year when another great game did release,Skyrim,from the Elder Scrolls Series,which..lets say...made The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings...go a little more ''underground''.However,this game apart  from the beautiful graphics,complex gameplay,and great story,it actually treats you like an adult![adult scenes,(not porn scenes!)]Personal Completion Length : 38 hours.Disclaimer : I Bought Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings when i used my older computer.Bad news were,i couldnt play this game,because that pc was ancient and..i had to buy a new gpu. Lets Continue on the Critics,shall we? Story 8/10	 The Main Protaganist-You-Geralt,a Witcher,which suffers from Amnesia.The Main Antagonist,Letho,An assassin of Kings,which is also a witcher,murdered king Foltest,and the people believe that Geralt is the assassin.Geralt now has to find Letho and clean his name.Whatever you do,you will be chillin with your buddies,Zoltan and Dandelion,and your Sexy girlfriend,Triss. Graphics 9.5/10	  The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings' graphics and visuals are absolutely STUNNING,even on low settings.Beautiful scenes and views,gorgeous and detailed world,this game will make you take a break and start screenshotting. Gameplay : 8,6/10 	One thing i loved about this game,are the swords.Geralt uses 2 swords,one steel,which is effective against humans,but ineffective against non-humans.The other one is a  silver,which is effective against monsters,but ineffective against human creatures.Furthermore,The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings , has a great variety of items to craft,from armor and swords,to   potions and bombs.The Perk System is also good.There are 4 tree perks,Magic,Alchemy,Swordmanship and Training,which is the basic,you need to complete this one,to unlock the rest.The game lets you choose your destiny,where most of your choices will change the story,which is something i loved.The Combat system was also positive,you can use 5 spells,from igniting your enemies,to actually controll them.Finally,the game keeps saving and saving,a positive thing that lets you play again and again and change the plot.One of the negatives,was the targeting system,was kidda bad and difficult to use.also,there were long routes,which were great to explore,but..there was no fast travel..something which made the game a liiiiiiiiiiiiiittle boring.The Worst,lets say part of the game was the tutorial,a total disaster,which doesnt really teach you how to play.lets say,you need to experience the game yourself. Controls 7.3/10 Keyboard controls were kidda awkward and difficult to use,but time after time,you get used to it. Sound 9.2/10	 The Actors who voiced the characters were pretty decent,and made them sound pretty reliable.Also,the sound effects were pretty good too(i enjoyed the combat while wearing a headset)And finally,the OSTs were magnificent			",83,9,0,8,2,0,13

												I started this game right after finishing The Witcher and the biggest improvement between the two is definitely the gameplay, namely combat.  I have very little bad to say about it other than that some of the strategies you can abuse (namely always have Quen up when fighting) make some of the fights a little dumb, but really any monster can kill you if you aren't paying attention and I really like that.  It makes the world feel very real that all monsters pose at least some threat throughout the entire game.I suppose the only other gripe I have is how poorly optimized the game is.  I should be able to run this maxed out with no frame drops at all, but there are times when I get pretty poor FPS and it has nothing to do with my system and everything to do with the game itself.  That said, there are some pretty fantastic sights to be seen in all the different locations the game takes you.  For a game that's about 5 years old, it has aged surprisingly well graphically.All the small negatives aside, this series is seriously one of my favorite of all time now.  The story telling is top notch.  The way the world and Geralt evolve as the story progresses is superbly done.  All progression feels extremely organic, especially from one game to another (where you can import saves that will keep your decisions intact ala Mass Effect so you can have YOUR Geralt through the entire series if you so wish). In addition to feeling organic...it just makes sense.  The way the politics change with your decisions or the decisions of other characters in the game...nothing feels contrived or silly because t's all justified by the world that has been crafted here.I can't recommend this game enough.  At times it gets frustrating because there are definitely some fights that will take a few tries to beat, but it is also rewarding in the sense of accomplishment, but also in the sense of story telling.  Any fan of RPGs where your decisions actual matter worth a damn should already be playing this, and if you have the stomach for it make sure to pick up the first game as well.  Both games took me just around 30 hours to beat (all quests for the given paths I had chosen completed) with a fair amount of exploration (which you should always take advantage of because you never know what cool weapons you'll find)...the ability to transfer saves from one game to the next (and even into The Witcher 3), really sells me on the idea that it's the right way to go if you're going to really get into the series.

												As nearly everyone seems to be saying, this is an excellent game. Great RPG elements, great plot, wonderful difficulty, wonderful graphics, etc. All of this praise applies to this game, keep that in mind. Two important things to say, if you already can't tell, this isn't a a game for kids, the M rating, if written down, would take up a standard office paper. Second, this game has poor optimization for particular builds of computers, don't let this scare you away, but if you are on the lower end of the spectrum when it comes to minimum requirements, you should check online to ensure your gaming experience will be satisfactory, I was decently ahead of the minimum requirements with a 2.9GHz dual core (AMD) and a Nvidia Geforce GT 240 with 1GB DDR3 VRAM, with 8GB of 1833 Mhz of ""normal"" RAM. This said, being reasonably well ahead of the minimum requirements, I had to set every graphics setting to the lowest possible setting, and then set my resolution to 800x600 to play at a playable FPS (30). In defense of CDProjektRed, I did have an ""interesting"" graphics card at the time, and have since moved to a more ""standard"" card. Everything under consideration, this is an excellent title.

												 It Is Just Beautiful In Everything That It Does.

So Crisp! Looks so damn good! It tells such an epic story and a which you can change it and manipulate it. A lot of people compared this to Dragon Age Origins or Dragon Age itself. I'd say it's almost two completely different types of games. I mean yeah you have choice and yeah you cut things up. But it just feels incredibly different and I don't know how to really explain that. It just feels very correct. It flows correctly and it's a very very very awesome game. ",198,45,0,21,19,0,17

												The game is awesome! It has got it all: graphics, thick branching story, serviceable combat mechanics, and occasional nudity. The story is so rich that it actually bogs down the experience in the prologue. Tons of characters with their own public or hidden agendas drop in and out. After a while they become familiar enough, making the tons of plot twists impacting. The combat also has a rough start, in learning curve and outright weakness of the protagonist. Once you learn the basics the combat can make you feel like a skilled video game swordsman. Although, the hardest battles are a matter of long-winded tedium of exploiting the same combat techniques used in any other battle.All these elements compile to make an RPG that may not have the drowning, yet shallow, expanse of Bethesda games, but does dive deep in the few acts it contains.

												CD Projekt RED is now widely regarded as the 'new Bioware' in terms of quality and polish. I cant really argue with this CD'PR built an RPG that's hardcore but nonetheless accessible in The Witcher 2, and the the Enhanced Edition improves on an already amazing game. Let me also state that while you can jump into the Witcher 2 without playing the original Witcher, I would not recommend it. The game does little to help players new to the lore find thier feel, but the EnhancedEdition does come an introduction in the form an animated scene. However this will not explain most things, and I would seriously recommend playing the first one first as it's also a great game, though rather dated. The world of The Witcher 2 once again takes form loosely based upon the books of Andrzej Sapkowski, drawing upon its dark and merciless idiosyncrasy to weave a dire environment where humans and nonhumans are looked upon in stark contrast to one another, where each of the planet's inhabitants are imperfect and flawed in some untenable way. Whether its a band of elven warriors going by the name of Scoia'tael (or ""Squirrels"" as their malevolent opposers refer to them) fighting to end the racist remarks of their human counterparts, or the soldiers and politicians seeking to take more and more land and freedoms away from the so-called terrorist elves, everyone carries with them a vengeful agenda that threatens to ruin the very fabric of society and its citizens that only wish to live a normal, common livelihood. It is easy to start to dislike some of the main charecters, but as you learn more about them, you'll start to like them. A definate example would be Roach who'll be your friend (possibly) throughout the plot.Geralt, the feared and exalted monster-slaying mutated human with a knack of getting caught in unfortunate predicaments, finds himself imposed into a dire situation. After participating in a drawn out battle with an army of traitorous soldiers attempting a coup de tat which serves as the games tuetorial, Folest, King of Temeria and Prince of Sodden, is murderd, having been slain by a tall, lion-sized man who bears the traits of a Witcher standing only feet away from where the oblivious Geralt was standing.The mysterious murderer escapes out a nearby window right before the king's guards show up and arrest the silver-haired wolf at the scene of the crime. It is this powerful narrative that has been carried with such fanciful grace over the past two games in The Witcher that has turned it into a sort of a relic among others in its genre. The world, its characters, and the vivid atmosphere have all been fashioned in such spectacular fashion that anyone with even a hint of an eye for natural beauty will find a lot to love in this paramount magnum opus from CD Projekt RED. Utilizing a brand new engine built from the ground up for their newest project, called the RED Engine, The Witcher 2 is no slouch when it comes to spitting out rigs. The game looks phenominal and even stands up to the Crysis3 and StarCitizen in graphical Baws'ness. Many computers will struggle to run this game at high settings, let alone on ultra, which is where this game can blow your eye sockets off. Fortunately, there are a bevy of graphical options to choose from to ensure that your computer is always making the most of where it can perform at. If you have a capable machine, however, it is hard not to get lost in the pure splendor of it all when you are in the middle of the game.Animations flow smoothly, vegetation is fluid and alive, environments seem to stretch on for miles, and characters come alive as they all perform their cyclical routines day in and day out. Crowded cities and large open environments do a great job at establishing a well-realized and heavily detailed world for Geralt to roam around in athough in the later portions of the game it does feel a little sparse.Now the cons:-It has incredibly lousy (though bearable) mouse-clicking combat that requires a good amount of utility to get used to the way Geralt moves around. I'd advise a 360 controller if possible.-The ineptitude of the tutorials given to the player that do little to actually do what they are designed to do.-The questing system does a great job in causing a massive headache, especially when it comes to navigating without a compass; and a polarizing journal system. The story can also be a little too convoluted at times, with characters and locations being introduced on an almost constant basis that it can be difficult to follow if one is not paying close enough attention to it. I like a game which doens't hold your hand, like the old Morrowind quest system. But this feels couterproductive and clunk. To make matters worse. All the menus are aplit up into groups, but they cant be scrolled between, and I envariably found myself clicking random keys to find the inventory or quest log hotkey. Doesn't really matter though. In the end W2 is one of the best PC games out there, and a must play for someone who wants a dark and gritty (As you've probably heard, there is quite a lot of boobs in this game) tale with insane graphics and a great story.9/10			",310,55,10,46,33,3,47

												Performance:Really impressed with how well-made the new engine is. Loads faster(which is kind of surprising because the first game's load times weren't even long), stutters less, and, of course, looks prettier. And I mean much prettier. You don't expect games that look this much better than their prequels to actually perform better than them.The only things about it that I don't like are the differed rendering(alternate form of rendering that only supports [and works] [with] a form of anti-aliasing that has been specifically coded into the game, cancelling out any kind of AA forced on from your graphics control panel. Use SweetFX for AA.), sharpness filter(you'll wanna turn it off in your user config, but make sure to force Anisotrophic Filtering on), and the bloom. The bloom.. I usually am ok with bloom in my games, but I had to turn this game's off. There is just too much of it. For my eyes, anyway.Graphics settings:Many graphics settings available for tweaking. There's a lot you can make changes to that will help the game run better on your rig, if it needs itControls:Controls are greatly improved. Dodging actually works consistently, unlike in the last game. Same with parrying. Same with attacking. I remember instances in the first Witcher where the system sometimes wouldn't let me attack opponents if they were close to me or surrounded me or just didn't let me attack them(while not stunned, etc). When attacking, you use either the left or right mouse button. Either are for heavy or light attacks. Is not like the first Witcher where you select an attack style and click on a foe. The buttons are the styles, so they have to be used/pressed after each attack. Can be combined.They took out the feature that let's you press/hold a button/key to highlight/display whatever in view can be interacted with, as well as the the feature that's you select what you want to interact with the cursor, while you hold/press a button. It's not that big of a deal not having it, but you now have to just run up to something you see, and click on it to do whatever with it.Gameplay:Am a few hours into the game, but can say it's very much like the first. Only, better.Combat is same, but more engaging. Also kinda harder(but I was playing on Dark/Insane difficulty.). You can meditate anywhere(no fireplaces/characters needed) that wouldn't be considered dangerous(out of battle, not in the presence of enemies). Inside or outside.So far, the choice system is still here. I've been in situations in the game where I could, as an example, stop a crime or let it follow through. There are also sub-choices, which can sometimes be made after main choices have been made. Good/bad/etc ones are available.EDIT:Overall:Have since spent more hours playing the game and am enjoying it. The story is very much still that of The Witcher's, and the gameplay is very fun. Good combat, and there more options for interacting with characters you encounter than there were in last Witcher game.The game feels like it was made on PC, which is awesome. Same as the last game. Same level of detail in the enviornments, great graphics, and doesn't feel like some technically-constrained console port.""coughs"" Skyrim ""coughs"" Fallout			",84,5,0,4,0,0,0

												This is a good RPG with some really impressive graphical and visual effects. Especially the lighting effects looks astonishing. The story is mature and rather complex, but I couldn't really appreciate it as much as others have done. Maybe it was because I haven't played the first game and therefore missed out on some parts of the overall story and the lore. Either way I thought it was a little bit too confusing at times, especially when the facial expressions and character animations wasn't very good.I also thought that the menus could've been better - they often felt slow, unresponsive and very irritating.But the thing that kept me playing was the superb combat! The feeling when you fought against a large number of enemies at the same time and you had to think tactical to survive was really rewarding!Overall, I enjoyed the game but was a little disappointed with the story, mostly because I've heard a lot good things about it. I do recommend the game though, especially if you want to test what your computer is capable of.			",112,40,1,6,7,1,8

Luckily it's worth playing even more times.-Shorter than Witcher 1.-Controller support is a bit wonky.-Creates too many save files! Seriously, I had to clean up 1 GB worth of save files from my PC, and that's only for 2 playthroughs!Highly recommended. Essential purchase. It's on sale now, and at 3$ it's daylight robbery.

												Saved an elf woman.She repaid me with sex.10/10 would save again.Now, speaking seriously, this is a good game. It really is. I didn't play the first one that much - I didn't feel engaged. The world was interesting, but the way it ""felt"" didn't get me and I got a bit boring. But heck, I wanted to play the second one, because I tried it once at a friend's house when it came out and I had good memories lingering about it.So I bought it.And I did good.The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is quite the improvement. Everything feels better executed. The game is more politic-centered, compared to the first one (for what I can tell). Combat is more polished - though it could be better. The world you play in is stunning, full of rich developed characters with whom you may bond - or not. Your choice. After finished the first Act, I found mysfelf desperate for more and more. Good thing is - I received it. More and even more goodness.Flaws? Not many. There are some things that I would have liked to be a tad different. For example:1) Conversations with your pals; sometimes they feel a bit plain. I mean, unlike Mass Effect, for example, where you usually have more possibilities on this matter, here conversations more often fall into some questions regarding the (politic) plot and nothing more. No hanging out or anything like it, for the most part. 2) Final Boss Fight; too damn easy. For real.3) Animations; very few of them. Maybe it's asking too much, but still. And that's all I can think about right now. Minor things that don't really♥♥♥♥♥♥all over the experience at all. The Witcher 2 is, overall, a really great, great game. Story is quite good - with twists and all. Characters are easy to like or hate and the end leaves you hanging at the very edge, gasping for another final adventure - The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. F*ck yeah I am ready for diving into that. Bring it.			",78,10,2,4,2,0,2

												Better than the impressive Witcher. Witcher 2 improves the dialogue and voice acting even further.Excellent story with a lot of depth and complexity to your choices. And your choices really do change the game significantly.A very mature and engrossing RPG.			",35,7,0,6,13,0,9

												Story and characters are so extremly important for a game, if not the most important thing for me personally when playing a Singleplayergame. From this point of view CDPR has done the best job I could ever imagine for an Action-Adventure-RPG. It is my favourite RPG since I played it the first time, maybe until The Witcher 3 will be released.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely amazing... I've been a big RPG fan my whole life, and I feel robed for never have playing the witcher series. This is the first i've played of it, and it is fantastic. I will without a doubt be purchasing The Witcher 3, and future witcher games. This game is a must for any RPG fan... The story, decisions, the gameplay, lore... It's all superb, well crafted, and mature. My only complaint is the difficulty. Playing on hard was dumbfoundingly easy. I was able to defeat the end boss with less than 10 hits. By the end of the game, I was just too powerful. Hopefully The Witcher 3 will be more difficult.edit: MODS! My complaints about difficulty can be solved with modding! Thank the gods that CD Projekt RED allows for modding, the modding community is actually quite amazing (with all witcher games). Another great reason to pick this game up!			",62,6,0,11,6,0,5

It's not very long towards the end, but it leaves you with the feeling of reading a very good book—except that it's beautiful, challenging and your choice does make a difference.I would, however, recommend reading Sapkowski’s books and playing the first game beforehand—this will aid greatly to the pleasure you take in the development of the story and characters.

												The game is awesome, dare to say one of the best rpg i have played in my life,besides i havent play many. :PI dont know if the combat system is better or worse from the 1st one,but its entire different.On one side,on the 1st witcher you can play only with the mouse with many clicks on the enemy, choosing combat style while you can carry 40 health potions like diablo and on the other side on assassins of kings you have to roll all the time in battles -maybe the basic element of combat on witcher 2- ,more usage of quen sign than the 1st and parrying the enemies trying to isolate them in order to kill them with the right sequence -from easier to harder -.If you get accustomed with that you get a spectacular result because combining magic & tactics, Geralt do unbielevable fatality combos presented with amazing cinematic style!Rarely i used potions-because u cant them drink inside the battle-,but instead of them i used all the time oils for both swords.Also here unlike the 1st witcher, you change more often your armor,swords etc...your build.What about journal?Amazing with many info for whatever you want about Geralt and his andventure-monsters,locations,lore-.Crafting/meditation/character/drink potion/ map/world map are all of them in one menu with submenus where i believe appear with the best way it can.Simplified with all info onscreen.Many times in order to kill more easily some enemies you should take guidance from journal/monster knowledge menu which exhibits how to kill more effectively some monsters.For example in order to kill queen enderga you must oil your sword with insecticide  oil, and dont hit her from the front because they have good armor and they are immune to magic,instead roll to side of the queen and hit her.Also when you attacked from many enemies,in any case you must not let them hit you from the back because the damage is 200% more. -can be halfed from skill tree-The same way works if you hit them from the back.Graphically the game is piece of art.Nothing more,nothing less. :PAlso in the game, many times you come on crossroads and you have to choose quickly with which side you go with a price that comes later from the other side where you didnt choose.Yet there are 2-3 missions which are full of stealth and i like it very much.Additional the game has big replayability because of the crossroads i said before.Finishing i would like to see Letho more often in the game.Finally i want to believe that in witcher 3 wild hunt, will have import save from 2 with the right consequences and will have bigger towns from witcher 2.I would like something like Vizima from the 1st.And something almost forgot if your loading times will be terrible big, then delete as many as you can savegames.Maximun 5 saves in order to load quickly as possible.

												This is the only game I've ever played where, upon beating the game, I immediately started a new one and made different choice. The first game I've ever played where I felt I had completely unique experiences each play through, and where my actions ended up having real consequences (ME?). Gameplay is difficult to grasp at first, but you'll eventually get the hang of it. If for some reason you haven't played this game yet, do yourself a favor, and kiss productivity goodbye.

												An improvement over its predecessor in many ways, including gameplay and graphics, but I think it's a step down in terms of story. Just one things start to get interesting, the game is done. It also feels much shorter than the first Witcher, although repeated playthroughs are certainly viable with at least a couple of major branching paths. Overall definitely a solid RPG.

												Wow. What an amazing story. Although Witcher 3 is better in terms of combat and size, Witcher 2 is still holds far superior story and to be honest is more replayable although shorter.You seek to help Geralt the extremely powerful monster hunter recover his memory, and help establish or destroy entire nations and characters. Choice matters more in this game to any other game - THE ENTIRE SECOND HALF OF THE GAME IS DIFFERENT - different map, different characters, depending on the choices you make throughout the story.TLDR:Combat: 6/10Gameplay: 7/10Replayability: 10/10STORY: 10/10Buy this amazing game.

												Bloody Violence, dragons, full frontal nudity and bad language... Wrapped up in gorgeous graphics and a story line that's actually interesting and makes you want to watch the cutscenes. Apparently it supports mods too, which is always a bonus :)I was on the fence about buying this after playing the first Witcher game. I really didn't like the combat system in the original, but I read that it had been reworked and improved. What can I say? I bought it in the sale thinking ""♥♥♥♥ it I'll give it a shot"", and my only regret is that I didn't buy it earlier. The combat system is massively improved. Quite a lot of 3rd person action games should take note, because THIS GAME IS BRILLIANT.If you're undecided about buying the game like I was, stop thinking, and buy it while it's on sale (though I'd have been happy to pay full price if I'd realised how damn good it is).If that doesn't sell it to you, you must be one of these sad freaks who's scared of hearing a bit of colourful language...

												The second installment of Witcher series is beautiful in its own unique way compared to its prequel and sequel. In 2016, the graphics are still pretty although animations may seem a bit clunky. Lack of jumping over obstacles etc. may also annoy some. But in the end, based on visuals, it is still a game that can be played for quite some time into the future.As for context of the game:*spoiler*Using a branching storyline and presenting two scenarios is the most striking selling point of this game. Replayability is pretty high thanks to it which is something lovely if you are highly into the atmosphere of the series. Although atmosphere and immersion is a bit weaker compared to the game's prequel and sequel, the game still presents witcher series' signature atmosphere of morally gray occasions.*spoiler* ",87,22,2,13,7,1,15

												After playing The Witcher: Enhanced Edition prior to this and literally 100-0'ing my enemies most of the time without much challenge apart from some bossfights i downloaded The Witcher 2 and started playing it the same way. Needless to say it slapped me back to the ""Load last save"" screen harder then my mother ever did,and thankfully i taught me a valuable lesson-that they improved on the gameplay,graphics,story,skilltrees and abilities in a vast way but with a drawback that you can't 100-0 your enemies. You still can combo them down with a combination of spells,rolls and attacks,which puts it high on my list of games with good combat-alongside Shadow of Mordor and the ever mentioned Batman Arkham series.Great game,recommend to anyone who didn't play it,though would help a bit if you played the first one to understand the lore behind it a bit more,but not absolutely necessary.

												TL;DL - Game is so good. Combat is awesome. Good RPG element. A tale to be told.7/10Pro+ Awesome sex scene+ Awesome combat+ Awesome character+ Awesome story for main quest+ Awesome crafting mechanic+ Awesome graphicCon- Less sex- Less secondary quest- Less monster hunting- Less fun mini game.- Graphic can be too bright/contrast- Nerf of potion, oil etc. Full Review Second game in The Witcher series from CDPR.You will continue to play as Geralt, a witcher, after the event of the first game.You can tell how much CDPR have put they effort on this game to improve from the first witcher.The graphic is so awesome. Thanks for REDengine from CDPR themselves. It look better then most game these day.The world setting and location fit the world of witcher nicely.Combat have been improve a lot. More fluid and responsive. Really fun to play.Crafting and overall game mechanic is a lot more easier.These are the first few thing you will notice after 15 minutes in the game and you will get addicts to this game right off the bat.The main story of The witcher 2 is more intense, more mature and come with really hard choice to choose.Your decision can affect the whole game story. Make The witcher 2 have lot of replayability. It deserve to play at least twice. The charecters in The witcher 2 is also very interesting. You will learn to love or hate them as the story go. BUT  I rate this game less then The Witcher 1 (I rate first one 8/10).While gameplay and graphic have been improve a lot. The story of the witcher 2 not really appeal to me. (Is it just me that like the story of TW1 then TW2. I don't really like political element in TW2. I think it's a bit too much and I feel like political don't fit well with the witcher story)What really dissappoint me is secondary quest. There is less secondary quest to play in the witcher 2 and none of them is memorable. The monster contract in The witcher 2 is more deeper and harder to complete which I like but there is so little of them. Make it lost the feeling of being the witcher. There is also not much monster in the wild and not much variety.I don't really like the mini game is this one too. Poker dice is hard to read, fist fighting become QTE and arm wrestling is way too easy. There is also no romance card to collect (AKA less sex).The graphic is really good but at time it can be too bright and color and be too contrast. It does look beautiful but sometime it's just too much. Also, This maybe a tiny thing but the graphic and control option have to be adjust outside the game.Potion is one of the most important part in The witcher. In the witcher 2 you can brew potion, crafting and meditating without bonfire BUT you can't drink potion while in combat!! And the duration of potion and other buff have been decrease a lot. I understand that CDPR try to balancing the game since the buff can be to OP (In the witcher 1 potion last many hours depand on what kind while The Witcher 2 last 10 minute). But with duration of potion nerf and need of meditating to drink potion make potion in witcher 2 almost useless. If you prepare and drink your potion first it can go out of effect while in cutscene or conversation and if fight happan immediatly you can't drink potion. I often found that duration is too short and not enought while explore the area. But good thing is you can brew/drink potion anytime and you can upgrade your skill or equipment to make duration longer. I just found it quite annoying to keep drinking potion. Summary The witcher 2 overall is one of the best RPG experiance to have. Beautiful graphic and world setting. Very good combat and game mechanic is easy to understand. Deep story with hard choice to be made and lot of replayability. I may complain in a few thing about The witcher 2 but maybe I adhere to The witcher 1 too much.The witcher 2 is a must play in my opinion.PS : Sorry for my english.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Do yourself a favour and play this before The Witcher 3...... Not because The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt wouldn't work as a standalone game. Actually it does, and it does it very well.I got this game on sale for 2,99€ a few days back. My only problem with this game is that I have already finished The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt before starting this game. Truth be told, these games look much alike. So for a 2011 game The Witcher 2 looks great and feels great. If I had never played The Witcher 3 I would probably consider this one of thegreatest games I have ever played. The story, dialogue, acting, combat - all of it is there and it's good.But here is the problem; none of it is quite as good as with The Witcher 3. If you have never played The Witcher 3 you wouldn't know all the tiny things you're missing when you're playing The Witcher 2. But if you already have, you got to admit that in comparison The Witcher 2 feels rather small, clunky, limiting and occasionally claustrophobically one dimensional. This is not exactly fault of the game itself, but because the sequel happens to be probably the best game ever made.So do yourself a favour and don't do like I did. Don't go straight to The Witcher 3, but play this one (and even the first one if you can stomach the outdated experience) first or it will be very hard to come back. Personally I've found the story itself intriguing and craving more for the world of The Witcher. Right now, being used to the best coming back to something almost as good isn't quite cutting it anymore.I will finish this game eventually, but I wish I had started from here, just because I would've enjoyed it more.Regardless, this game is easily worth the money.

												I have seen a lot of praise for this game especially for the PC platform on forums everywhere on the internet. And I have also seen a lot of this: ""CDProjeKt Red is the only AAA game industry that cares about the PC platform""Well after playing the game this is what I have to say: The Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is a console game.Likes:- Great Cinematics and visuals. Clever use of post-process effects. Makes the graphics look great. Character models are very detailed.- Deep StoryDislikes:- Console style gameplay, all of it, the whole game- Keyboard and mouse controls are irritating. Tried the gamepad, the K+M issues were gone, but the gamepad has its own set of issues, the same issues for which i hate the gamepad in general. Finished the game with the keyboard and mouse except used the gamepad for arm wrestling(lol double meaning there).- You have to use a thing called as medallion to highlight pickup objects. Because it is very hard to see pickup objects manually. And that medallion thingy has got a cooldown. It's also hard to focus on pickup objects because of the player's 'running' to 'idle' state animation.- The minimap and the map wasn't exactly helpful. There will be some objective up a hill but you will end up in a cave directly below it. And the lack of fast travel just made it more irritating. It looks like the game wants me to memorize the directions to each place.- There will be some objectives that are right in front of you but you will have to circle around the entire town to reach that place since the player cannot jump over a fence or jump down to the floor below. This wouldn't have been a problem if it was only needed to be done once but you need to reach that same place again and again multiple times. The lack of fast travel again adds to the frustration.- The 'charm' option in dialogues always succeeds. No point in choosing other options.- Music is average at best. Not great use of sound either.- I hate memorizing stuff that isn't important to me. And the magic powers that the player has are in sign language, just made it more difficult to memorize. If it was English it would have been a bit easier. There were also some sign language puzzles. Who in the world knows sign language? There was a learning curve for me in this game. I don't usually expect a learning curve in a single-player game(after playing lots of games).- Some side missions get FAILED if you leave the area or progress the main story. I thought it was an open world RPG. Can't even finish objectives at my leisure. The game is linear for the most part.- The game wasn't technically impressive for me. There were a lot of loading zones/streaming levels(DOORS). Everything in the distance is either mist/fogged/depth of field blurred out. Basically everything you see in the far distance is of very low quality. And AFAIK there is no zoom functionality. And the third person camera helps hiding a lot of things. And I prefer realistic looking graphics than fantasy graphics even in a fantasy world.- Too many cutscenes. I wanted a game not a movie.- Show off.- Story can be overwhelming. Too many characters to keep track of, and characters are referred to in dialogues very directly some of which you haven't even seen or heard about yet. Poor presentation of story to the player. Ideally this should not be a reason for playing the game again.- Porny stuff doesn't add value to the game. This must have been a 'like' point for most people. People need to understand that this does not add value to the game. It might be needed for storytelling, but Witcher 2's scenes were deliberately inserted to increase player appreciation. If you are interested in such things go watch porn that is available for free on the internet. But don't praise a game because it has porny stuff in it.- On the other hand, the gameplay is completely childish and a kid cannot play this game because it has mature content.- The skill tree isn't very interesting. And you have to meditate to drink potions. Oh! Come onDoubtful:- I must be the only person who found the concept of a 'silver' sword ridiculous.Some useful Statistics:It's been more than 2 years since the release of Witcher 2. So some valid statistics are available. According to Steam achievements atleast 57.1% of players have started playing the game. And 13.8% of players have finished the game. That means only 24.17% players who have started playing the game have actually completed it. Ideally for a good single player game this percentage should be above 33. This probably means that most of the players either quit playing the game or got stuck somewhere indefinitely or they had better games to play or bought it just to watch the porny stuff in it and not to play the game. I hope this gives you enough reason for why this game is not recommended.Verdict : 78/100The Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is a console game.			",98,14,0,5,3,0,5

												This game is a 10/10. The graphical details for the female bosom in this game are absolutely exquisite and it encapsulates the minute detail of real breasts. The passionate scenes inflict many emotions upon the player and it seems as if they are in the action, as the pole stiffens or the sponge gets soaked. This could be attributed to the curves that have been added to each female in this game and for females the masculine body of Geralt. It was disappointing that my character couldn't share such a passionate connection with every single female character, and it detracted from the reality of the game as it could be possible to be with many females outside of the game. I think the name, the Assassins of Kings is well done, but I think it should have a name change to the Assassin of Queens as Geralt silently and lustfully assassinates his prey leaving them in a sedated and satisfied state post-conflict.

(They brought this back on Witcher 3)- No more Witcher styles so you can no longer fight multiple enemies at once but your sword    sometimes hits multiple enemies when they're sticking with each other.- Map is practically useless.- Glitches and Bugs.- Is Geralt that dumb that you have to spend an upgrade point just so he can start throwing       daggers?- Combat system sucks (This was improved in Witcher 3)- Your vigor doesn't replenish while Quen is active- Witcher 1 Main Quest took 30-40 hours this one only take 15-20 hours (Witcher 3 takes 50 hours)- Witcher 1 UI is more intuitive.- You can't sort your items.- CRASHESRIG:Asus Z97 Pro Gamer MOBOi7-4790K @4.5 GHzNoctua NH-D15 CPU Cooler16GB (8x2) 1866 mhz RAMAsus Strix GTX 960 4GBCougar SL600Windows 10 Pro			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love The Witcher and thoroughly enjoyed the original game for its depth, quality narative and pretty much everything else(Besides the combat which was still better than its successors). The Witcher 2 sad to say feels like a mere shadow of what it should have been. Where the first game felt immersive and fun to explore Assassins of Kings felt rigid and tedious. I actually had to force myself to finish it just because it felt so... Well... Not fun. I hate to say that but it's honestly how the game made me feel. Even during parts of the game where big stuff was happening it just felt straight up boring, and it just got worse as the game went on. Another thing I found strange is that pretty much nothing happens in this game. Sure you travel to different places in the world but for the most part nothing big happens at all, and even when stuff does happen it leaves a feeling of wanting more. Wanting more from a game isn't what one should feel while playing and engaging with a ""Story rich RPG"" you should feel like the story is big and mysterious leaving you guessing and wondering what could be next for the character. One last thing that I want to add is that The Witcher 2 is ludacrously short and ended abruptly seemingly out of no-where. I thought I was half way through when the credits started to roll leaving even more to be desired.All in all I realize that I'm being pretty critical but I mean if they were going to screw up the combat they could have at least given us a half way decent story. Oh well, hopefully The Witcher 3 will be better.			",29,2,0,5,0,0,0

												Although it has quite nice graphic, interesting story and various side missions, the combat system and mainly save system totally suck. The handling of fight is unnutural and slow, so you often end up rolling all over the place just to avoid your foes and autosaves are never done when you expect or need them. Also the poor (I mean none...) animations in dialogues are pretty akward... So much wasted potential in something what could be otherwise a fine game.			",71,3,5,7,16,1,31

												Can't really recommed this one. The graphics are ok, but nothing to write home about considering it is supposedly an 'enhanced edition'. Story and lore seem to be dense from what I can tell after roughly two hours.Unfortunately, combat and interaction are breaking this game for me. Combat is extremely clumsy, it basically boils down to button-mashing, where at no point you have real control over your character, but rather mash buttons as fast as humanly possible and see what the game decides to do.Combat animations are basic, very basic, you'll sometimes stun an enemy wielding a shield, and when you strike him see a cut-scene like animation where your character delivers a killing blow to an enemy that does not have a shield.I started the game on 'hard' difficulty, and it took me about 10 minutes to discover how to exploit weaknesses in the AI to a point where I basically go through the fights either with no health loss, the other possible outcome being dying a rather cheesy death due to the no-control combat system.If I had to describe the combat system with one word, I'm sorry to say that word would be 'garbage', it pretty much ruins an otherwise decent game.Interaction is similary painful, there is one interaction key (left mouse), which is also one of your main fighting keys, leading to all sorts of unintentional interactions during combat, especially since the 'hot zones' for interactions are placed badly. This also inhibits game flow, you'll sometimes run towards a ledge, and then have to move around trying to find the interaction zone to actually climb it, there is no fluid 'run up to the ledge and climb it' like you'd expect.Got this very cheap on sale, if I had bought it for full price I'd say it was wasted money.

												I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. I've completed the game four times now, and still have another play through to complete all of the possible outcomes for this game. The combat system takes a little bit of time to adjust to (mostly because you use one weapon for humans and a different weapon for monsters). However, after you get the hang of it, the game's true potential really comes to light. Amazingly developed characters, with a story told in Bardic fashion (by an actual Bard no less -- you meet him in the game). In short, I enjoyed this game so much, that I decided pre-ordering the third installment of this series would be worthwhile. *P.S. If you want to play the whole series, I strongly recommend playing the series in order.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was amazing with a TRULY GREAT STORY. 92/100. Absolute definitely replayability with two major story arcs and many minor ones.It is Skyrim-like with action-RPG elements, but it is definitely not a true open-world game like Skyrim or The Witcher 3. You have pretty large areas for each chapter of the game and it works fantastically with all of the quests. I love the way that quests have multiple ways to resolve them and quests affect each other in a variety of ways. You actually need to listen (all voiced) and read the quest dialogue. This is not click-click-MMO quest type, thankfully!The combat is solid for action RPG but not perfect. I played with both mouse+keyboard and a PS4 controller. I preferred the controller by a long shot but the M+KB was definitely playable and I have seen opinions supporting both.The graphics are astonishing. If you have the card to handle it (r9 290/290x or 780/780ti) you will want to max it out AND edit the .ini file to increase view distances. Pop-in was not present at all when I did this, and distant objects were crisp and lush. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Brilliant bit of RPG. Not overly linear. Your actions do have an impact on the ending. The tutorial stage is a must as it leads you through the main game elements as part of your backstory. While the sword combat is intuitive, the use of Signs is not. The side quests and mini games are an interesting distraction but completing them can make things easier in the long run, especially the armour and weapon schemas.			",82,20,0,17,13,0,22

												The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings picks up a couple of months after where the first game left off. Basically the story continues as Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster slayer, armed to the teeth (with everything an RPG protagonist need), traverses new locations and lands to thin the worlds monster and human population by a number.Almost everything is enhanced, and by almost everything I mean it, although there are some downsides. I'll list a few: Remember the clunky combat? Well not so clunky now, much more fluid, more fast paced and diverse. Better finishers (could be more of them), faster response and a well made mechanic. But the downside is lock-on, takes a while to get around it. I highly recommend playing with a gamepad.The alchemy and spells, haven't changed much, but still have seen much upgrading. Spells feel more powerful and the alchemy list has some new potions. Though inability to drink them mid-combat is unjustified.Meditate or should I say, wait, in Skyrim style, almost everywhere, but not too close to your enemies, duh.These are just some of the biggest additions in gameplay.Let's talk about the visuals. Not many games have been so atmospheric as The Witcher 2. The graphics are beautiful, though some might dislike the saturation in some places. It fits the world beautifuly and shows you great forests, mountains, cities and of course RPG's favorite - dungeons. And all this is accompanied by a great soundtrack, from haunting ambiances to rocking action and beautiful symphonic music.The story. If you have played the first Witcher, then you already know that Geralt is a master at getting into deep trouble. Well, this time around, kings are being killed, and Geralt is framed for killing one (Who saw that coming, right?). So Geralt sets out to find out the truth and clear his name in the process, also clearing out fools who try to stand in his way. Without telling any spoilers, there are many interesting surprises awaiting you, the plot does not feel dull at all.Now listen closely (or read). Choice - this time around it will impact the world and everyone around you heavily. For instance, choose your allegiance and the entire next chapter will be completely different, save for some of the main quests.So, altogether, the Witcher 2 took what was great in the first game and leveled it up to new heights, I highly recommend this game.9/10			",136,29,0,16,12,1,14

I wanted and envisioned my Geralt to give people chances, save people, be the good guy, choose the lesser evil while maintaining a romantic love life. Pretty much most of these things the game allowed me to make out of Geralt.			",101,13,2,13,3,1,10

												One of the best RPG's I have experienced to date. Obviously the most standout thing on the surface is the graphics. While typical RPG's settle for bland and boring the world of The Witcher is colorful and well detailed. What really sells the game is the complex story telling, which features many different plot twists, and your choices actually influence the main storyline. Its not like Mass Effect where your choices don't mean anything to the storyline. Now the gameplay is difficult as long as you select normal or harder. You dont play as an OP badass, you can die after about 4 to 5 hits from about anything unless its a way lower level then you. Combat is hard, and you will need to plan ahead by drink potions before battle and seting up traps because you can drink potions while in battle and there is no health regen. How I would describe the openess of this game is semi-open world. You can travel freely among the land, but after completing enough main story quests you will travel to a new land, unable to go back to where you came from to complete unfinished side quests or anything you left back there. The game does this often so the best way to get everything done is sidequests first. It is a bit annoying to not be able to travel back but The Witcher 3 fixes this problem and is going full open world. Either way this a must buy for RPG fans and suckers for a good story, its a hell of a ride and the game doesnt treat you like an idiot, you will be presented with challenges that will make you s**t a brick. Now all i have to do is wait for The Witcher 3 and my life will be complete.			",102,2,2,3,3,0,0

												The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings picks up a couple of months after where the first game left off. Basically the story continues as Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster slayer, armed to the teeth (with everything an RPG protagonist need), traverses new locations and lands to thin the worlds monster and human population by a number.Almost everything is enhanced, and by almost everything I mean it, although there are some downsides. I'll list a few: Remember the clunky combat? Well not so clunky now, much more fluid, more fast paced and diverse. Better finishers (could be more of them), faster response and a well made mechanic. But the downside is lock-on, takes a while to get around it. I highly recommend playing with a gamepad.The alchemy and spells, haven't changed much, but still have seen much upgrading. Spells feel more powerful and the alchemy list has some new potions. Though inability to drink them mid-combat is unjustified.Meditate or should I say, wait, in Skyrim style, almost everywhere, but not too close to your enemies, duh.These are just some of the biggest additions in gameplay.Let's talk about the visuals. Not many games have been so atmospheric as The Witcher 2. The graphics are beautiful, though some might dislike the saturation in some places. It fits the world beautifuly and shows you great forests, mountains, cities and of course RPG's favorite - dungeons. And all this is accompanied by a great soundtrack, from haunting ambiances to rocking action and beautiful symphonic music.The story. If you have played the first Witcher, then you already know that Geralt is a master at getting into deep trouble. Well, this time around, kings are being killed, and Geralt is framed for killing one (Who saw that coming, right?). So Geralt sets out to find out the truth and clear his name in the process, also clearing out fools who try to stand in his way. Without telling any spoilers, there are many interesting surprises awaiting you, the plot does not feel dull at all.Now listen closely (or read). Choice - this time around it will impact the world and everyone around you heavily. For instance, choose your allegiance and the entire next chapter will be completely different, save for some of the main quests.So, altogether, the Witcher 2 took what was great in the first game and leveled it up to new heights, I highly recommend this game.9/10			",136,29,0,16,12,1,14

												One of the most detailed and perfectly written RPG Action/Adventure games I've ever experienced. Compared to the first Witcher which had its' fair amount of flaws, The Witcher 2 sets the bar high. The amount of material in this is astounding, where I enjoyed this 36 +/- hour tale more than the 200+ hours I've sunk into Skyrim. The story flows perfectly, and you're given certain weighted-choices throughout that steer the story one way or another. Combat is perfectly balanced between strategy and hack n' slash, difficult at times yet remaining challenging, and all the while fun. Plenty of side quests to keep you busy and fill your inventory, while not feeling daunting and like a chore. I can only compare this to the Ocarina of Time/Majora's Mask games, but being on a much more ""mature"" realistic level. I severely recommend, A++			",183,34,1,11,2,1,4

												Wow!!!! If you're a fan of the Mass Effect story structure, or just being able to make choices that matter in a game, then this is the game for you!The story is great, although it may seem a little political at first, it's not the only thing going on but the story continues to get juicier, especially towards the endThe gameplay takes a little getting used to, it may be a little frustrating at first ( I suggest starting in easy mode as you'll want to play this game again anyway) but if you stick with it, all will be clear to you. It is a satisfying and strategic gameplay without being slow or cumbersome like in the first game.All in all, a great story, AMAZING writing, you'll efinitely get more than a few laughs, great and fun gameplay, AND plenty to do in terms of side quests. The game lasts a healthy 29 to 38 hours.Enjoy!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game pretty quickly rose to be one of my favorites, it hit that high mark feeling I had previously had with Mass Effect 2. All the characters, creatures and world are interesting and firmly cemented, there's a great mix of historically based realism to this fantasy world. There are so many decisions and branching storylines, combat tactics and side quests that this game is easy to spend a lot of time exploring, definitely one of those games that got its hooks in me and wouldn't let go until completion. My one minor complaint is that at Regular Difficulty, the combat was mostly a breeze, few encounters offered much challenge, just keep button mashing and you'll slice through hordes of enemies like butter, I'd suggest going to a harder difficulty if you want some challenge!This game was so good, The Witcher 3 is my most anticipated game!

												Probably one of the best games I have ever gotten my hands on. Playing this directly after finishing 'The Witcher' was incredible and allowed me to fully experience the story. CD PROJEKT RED did such a good job on this game it actually made me just sit in awe on multiple occasions. Every area is gorgeous and challenging, and not knowing your way through a conversation could drastically change the tone of the game and the characters you play with. My only regret is that prior to playing the series I had not even heard of the book series. I am currently reading ""Blood of Elves"" after completing ""The Last Wish"" and ""The Sword of Destiny"". So far I have learned more about Geralt than what is depicted in the games, and I cannot wait to complete the series so I can play the whole series through before TW3 comes out. TL;DR  My favorite series of all time so far. Play this.			",259,52,5,35,38,3,55

												This game game is amazing it has a great story, characters, graphics and world. All the quests are unique and you never feel like you are grinding through the same thing. The combat is super layered and tactical but quite dificult on any difficulty but easy (or maybe thats just me). The options in the game you have are amazing and its never your good or a jerk it's always just how you feel something needs to be done if you liked a character or not or which side your siding with that both have equal causes. My few complaints about the game were very small things like how you dont get to assume the neutral witcher path like you could in the first game. Also why cant you jump whats up with that? Luckily I know that at least one of those is being implemented into The Witcher 3 so we got that going for us. But overall fantastic game if you like gritty mature dark fantasy stories or if you just like Game of Thrones but I would give it a 9.7/10 would play again because there are so many branching choices.

												I've played my fair share of RPGs. Both the good, such as KOTOR, and the bad. Yes, I'm looking at you Mass Effect 3. I wouldn't consider myself a hardcore RPG player, but this has to be one of the best games I've ever played.First, the game itself is more of an action game with RPG elements. In this regard, it is a lot like ME, where all combat is realtime, and you aren't going to swing at someone, obviously hit them, and be told you missed, unlike its predecessor (although the first Witcher had miss animations). The gameplay is solid, and not quite like Mass Effect in that you have to keep moving instead of staying in cover. One nice thing is that you can glance at the lower left-hand corner to see the last few attacks and defends with their corrosponding damages.Next, the story is just plain awesome. I can't say much, other than while it was well written, the story is a bit on the shorter side, but no matter, as there are enough areas to explore and quests to finish to keep you playing for a long time.Also, the graphics are gorgeous, especially for 2011. They are, infact, much better than most games today.Finally, I'd say that if there is ANYTHING to complain about with this game, it would be that you cannot edit video settings or controls outside of the launcher. However, this is a minor complaint, and can easily be overlooked.Verdict: This game is a must have. As of the writing of this review, the game is only $4.00. I would gladly pay $40 for a game this well made.PS. For those of you who decide this game is worth the money. CD PROJEKT RED left a little ""surprise"" in the games files, concerning Triss Merigold. Let's just say many of you GUYS out there will probably be pleased with it, if you know what I mean...			",273,23,7,15,15,3,16

												This game is fantastic.  It doesn't treat you like a ♥♥♥♥♥ and constantly remind you what buttons do what.  It treats you like an adult.  There is a mature story here, and choices you are faced with often show you there is no absolute good or evil.  Combat is love or hate, which I love.  This campaign ranks among God of war 1 and 2's campaigns, and MGS 3's campaign as my favorite campaigns.			",91,8,2,6,4,0,6

												I'm not sure why the game's rating is 88. I honestly believe that this game deserves a full 100.Why? The story itself is great! A mix of fantasy and political feud accompanied by a mature plot / narrative will suck you in. The graphics are great, the soundtrack is to die for and the main character is someone who you can empathized with. That's Geralt of Rivia for you.Many say that the gameplay is hard but I beg to differ. This game is NOT like Dark Souls difficulty. It is however, realistic in the sense that you probably would have a hard time beating 3 people instead of 1. The game promotes you to use ALL of your abilities properly and smartly. It may sound difficulty but it isn't. Once you know how you maneuver your character, then you would know exactly what to do.I can't emphasize how much I love this game. Probably one of my top 3 RPGs of all time. PLAY THIS GAME.			",45,8,3,18,13,0,12

												One of the finest RPGs I've played in years, The Witcher 2 is full of memorable moments filled with quirky characters, beautifully crafted cut-scenes and epic battles. Your story is driven by your choice, allowing for dramatic consequences and diverging game paths.This is the game where the visuals alone can win you over. There are times in the game where you'd just have to stop; take in the splendid vistas, and immerse yourself in the organic world of The Witcher. Aside from the awkward combat, and other minor annoyances; one can't be bothered when busy slaying giant kraken, ploughing Triss, brawling, or rescuing elven ♥♥♥♥♥s from burning buildings on maximum graphical settings. Recommended for traditional RPG lovers and for players who have the rig to run it on max ;)			",561,141,28,71,34,9,67

												One of the most amazing RPGs I've ever playedThe combat is well done and challenging; switching between the spells and knowing what blade to use against different enemies keeps you on your toes. The potion crafting system is easy to execute, but it has a slight learning curve in order to understand what you're making and how many of each type. I ran into a few glitches in a quest that allowed me dialogue options, which led to a quest that couldn't be completed. Mods are highly recommended especially since CD Projekt RED even released their own mod to enhance the combat system. Others can be found at nexusmods.com/witcher2 ",186,29,1,9,17,3,17

												Witcher 2. The second installment in 'The Witcher' Series. Great game, great storyline. You continue where you left off in Witcher 1, but you won't be a complete stranger to combat now. It's eased up and loads of combo-ing fun! The game has the ability of picking up your previous choices from Witcher 1, so I *HIGHLY ADVISE* that you get Witcher 1 first, finish it, then start with this. The storyline is deep, loads of choices to be made.In the graphics department, this game nails it. Character models, weapons, terrain and environment, you name it, it looks great!Only problem is, it is heavy on your system. But, you can play on the lower settings. *Little* changes. Like the view distance. In short, it's a great game developed by CD Projekt RED worth the buy.Have fun!			",361,40,6,27,23,0,19

												There is simply no singleplayer RPG experience that comes close to this. If you have a machine that can do it justice, buy this game. Playing the Witcher 1 is not neccessary (and honestly not recommended - it's very dated).It's gorgeous, the combat is active, fun, and difficult, and there's a lot of content here.You cannot experience everything the game has to offer on a single playthrough - the entire game plays out differently based on the many choices you make throughout. My only criticism was that the ending was a little abrupt - I imagined I was 3/4 of the way through when it told me I'd reached the epilogue.5/5, would reccommend to everyone - not just RPG fans, but EVERYONE.

												The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings picks up a couple of months after where the first game left off. Basically the story continues as Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster slayer, armed to the teeth (with everything an RPG protagonist need), traverses new locations and lands to thin the worlds monster and human population by a number.Almost everything is enhanced, and by almost everything I mean it, although there are some downsides. I'll list a few: Remember the clunky combat? Well not so clunky now, much more fluid, more fast paced and diverse. Better finishers (could be more of them), faster response and a well made mechanic. But the downside is lock-on, takes a while to get around it. I highly recommend playing with a gamepad.The alchemy and spells, haven't changed much, but still have seen much upgrading. Spells feel more powerful and the alchemy list has some new potions. Though inability to drink them mid-combat is unjustified.Meditate or should I say, wait, in Skyrim style, almost everywhere, but not too close to your enemies, duh.These are just some of the biggest additions in gameplay.Let's talk about the visuals. Not many games have been so atmospheric as The Witcher 2. The graphics are beautiful, though some might dislike the saturation in some places. It fits the world beautifuly and shows you great forests, mountains, cities and of course RPG's favorite - dungeons. And all this is accompanied by a great soundtrack, from haunting ambiances to rocking action and beautiful symphonic music.The story. If you have played the first Witcher, then you already know that Geralt is a master at getting into deep trouble. Well, this time around, kings are being killed, and Geralt is framed for killing one (Who saw that coming, right?). So Geralt sets out to find out the truth and clear his name in the process, also clearing out fools who try to stand in his way. Without telling any spoilers, there are many interesting surprises awaiting you, the plot does not feel dull at all.Now listen closely (or read). Choice - this time around it will impact the world and everyone around you heavily. For instance, choose your allegiance and the entire next chapter will be completely different, save for some of the main quests.So, altogether, the Witcher 2 took what was great in the first game and leveled it up to new heights, I highly recommend this game.9/10			",136,29,0,16,12,1,14

												One of the most detailed and perfectly written RPG Action/Adventure games I've ever experienced. Compared to the first Witcher which had its' fair amount of flaws, The Witcher 2 sets the bar high. The amount of material in this is astounding, where I enjoyed this 36 +/- hour tale more than the 200+ hours I've sunk into Skyrim. The story flows perfectly, and you're given certain weighted-choices throughout that steer the story one way or another. Combat is perfectly balanced between strategy and hack n' slash, difficult at times yet remaining challenging, and all the while fun. Plenty of side quests to keep you busy and fill your inventory, while not feeling daunting and like a chore. I can only compare this to the Ocarina of Time/Majora's Mask games, but being on a much more ""mature"" realistic level. I severely recommend, A++			",183,34,1,11,2,1,4

												First off, know that The Witcher 2 is not a game that will hold your hand. If you're thinking about purchasing this, know that to get the most out of this game you need to be prepared to fully immerse yourself in the experience and pay attention to what is going in. This an adult, mature and complex game supported by rich lore and stunning visuals. The writing and storytelling is exceptional throughout and the moral ambiguity and choices are second to none. The gameplay, in particular the combat, is an acquired taste but offers a refreshing level of depth and potential for improvisation when compared to games in a similar genre. Sound design and voice acting is also of high quality, with the environments coming to life through impressive visual and audio support and characters each sporting distinct personalities and prejudices.It is also worth mentioning that if you have played the first Witcher game, your choices and gear will be reflected via an imported save in The Witcher 2, however the choices have limited effect and it is not necessary to play the first game to enjoy the second (however you will be at a slight disadvantage in some situations).In my honest opinion the experience as a whole is unparalleled, and The Witcher 2 is easily the most enjoyable and immersive RPG I have played in recent memory. I would also advise reading the books, in particular The Last Wish, Blood of Elves and Time of Contempt as these offer an interesting insight into the protagonist's past. But back to the game, overall I would highly recommend The Witcher 2 to anyone with at least a passing interest in the RPG genre, it is the definition of a complete gaming package with spectacular production values and a lasting impression.

												the witcher was a global phenom that apparently the US wasnt ready for during its original debut in 2007.  having read 5.5 of the original 7 novels i have a better understanding of the story to date, especially having played the first game.  but none of that matters as, introduced in the first game, our hero geralt, has no memory of his past, ie the novels.  either way, the witcher series is about the story of geralt of rivia, a witcher or professional monster hunter, who is dragged into a twisting and turning story of political bull.sh.it that he wants nothing to do with, but unfortunitly cant escape.Unlike the first game of the series, the graphics are far more refined, the story is much more cohesive, complex and inline with what original stories would lead to, and is exactly what CDProjekt were hoping to create with the first game.  not only does choice matter, it is essential to the very core of the game.  every decision has a consequence, whether you see it now or at the end of your journey.  this is the type of game that bioware has wet dreams about but instead sells you a half♥♥♥♥♥copy of.  litteraly the 2nd half of the game takes completely different paths depending on a not so simple choice in the 1st chapter.one of my personal favorite features is ""survivor mode""...dont be fooled, combat can be extremely difficult in this game, but entering the arena is a nice change of pace that will give you some, albiet, over exaggerated practice, but it is a great time killer that will keep you going in the hopes taht you can get your name of the leader board.  highly addictive and extremely punishing to the say the least, especially at higher difficulty levels.sure theres flaws, very few games are without but this is a game, that even if you didnt play the first, will have you from beginning to end leaving you begging for more, and unlike most games that claim to be of the same ilk....*cough* mass effect, there actually is more to do that you can not do because of the decisions that you made the first time around.Buy this game now, especially being 5$ as it will give you some back info to Witcher 3.  p.s. if you can get your hands on teh novels, they are fantastic and really give a detailed backstory on most characters, especially geralt and his close companions.  trust me you wont regret this purchase <3			",237,51,0,38,8,0,5

I didn't know for sure if I should get it or not an than it went on sale and im like screw it why not. And guess what that was oen of the best RPG games i've ever played and are still playing. In my opinion its a mix between Diablo III, World of Warcraft, and Skyrim. It has the best elements of every single RPG game out there put in to one. Not to mention the graphics. The quests are long but very enjoyable and the game itself may last you 50 hours doing all the side quests and the main story and this is for both The Witcher and The Witcher 2 Assassin of Kings. Though each game may take you 50 hours its definately worth it. ",98,8,2,18,16,0,7

Posted: June 22, 2014
												I'm not typically compelled to review games I purchase on Steam, but the Witcher 2 so thoroughly surprised me I had to say something.I had long avoided the Witcher series out of dislike for the apparently cliche main character, but as there was an absence of good RPGs to play this summer I picked them up during the sale on a lark. The first game I played a couple chapters of, but ultimately couldn't get into it; I had played Neverwinter Nights to death earlier in my life, and the similarities of the Aurora engine were just so strong that I found myself burnt out.So I booted up the Witcher 2. I was instantaenously amazed by the graphics, despite the game's age. The visual fidelity worked to support what felt like a living, breathing world, and within the first hour I was already hooked on the story. The characters, while suffering from stiff facial animations, are backed up by well-written dialogue and quality voice-acting. There is a moment early in the game where Geralt re-unites with his companions in an inn and, while the ""party meeting around a table"" is a genre staple, the presentation was so well done I felt like I was in a Lord of the Rings scene.The game's mechanics aren't quite as engrossing as its narrative. The combat is servicable, and feels smooth and well-animated for the most part; targeting hitches, stiff dodging, and difficulty landing magic attacks do weigh down the experience. Likewise, the inventory management and map menus are frustratingly clumsy given their importance to the game. The combat, movement, and interface were all clearly designed for a gamepad, but I found the radial quick-menu lacking in precision; often, I had to resort to the d-pad to navigate, rather than just flicking a stick in the required direction. These quibbles can be just enough to pull you out of the game for a little longer than you'd like, but the environments and the story will always pull you back in. It's not open-world in the sense that Skyrim is; areas have defined (though branching) paths through them. Thankfully they are laid out naturally enough to stop you from feeling like you're on a theme-park ride dictated by arbitrary invisible fences and, while your mileage may vary, I found that the relatively rigid environment was offset by the narrative freedom. You may not be able to go everywhere you can see, but nowhere you go feels empty or lifeless.Lastly, just to address the issue that initially put me off this series; no, there is no character creation. Geralt is Geralt: You can't make him an elf or dwarf, or change his class or gender, or give him a haircut. You can allocate points to swordsmanship, magic, or alchemy, but you'll still always be a Witcher. But as the decisions you make start to shape the world around you, he will very much start to feel like your character, and in ways much more significant than a different name or appearance could provide.To sum it all up: This is a well-polished and engrossing game with a strong narrative, visuals that are both technically and artistically beautiful, and a world so well-realized that even accidentally unequipping your pants for the 20th time can't take away from it. If you think you might have even the slightest interest in trying this game, buy it. You will fall in love. ",149,29,0,18,13,1,21

												Now, you're probably not going to trust this review since I've only got a few hours clocked into the game. But let me be clear: Due to my horrible internet, the game took 2 days to download. My laptop gets a full cardio workout whenever I boot up the game, starts to overheat, and will probably eventually leave burn scars on my legs or the table. But there are: Boobs, great combat, varied environments, believable characters, nudity, lots of monsters, lots of loot, a compelling story, and did I mention the boobs? Sure, it's a big download, but you will definitely not be disappointed. One of my friends saw me playing this, and he instantly claimed that Skyrim was better. I had to kill the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a silver sword, since only a monster could've said those awful, awful words.  ",32,2,0,12,2,0,4

												An improvement over the first game, although not in all areas.The game's story and characters are a continuation and improvement of the great work from the first game. Geralt's circle of friends have even more of a role to play this time around and join him more often. The game also goes into a lot more detail about The Wild Hunt and Geralt's past. In terms of quests, it does feel like there are a lot less but the ones that are there are more interesting and more involved. The final monster contract, though, features some incredibly dumb puzzle-solving and there are a few quests that you cannot complete unless you keep objects from earlier chapters, such as getting stuck with a dumb tattoo. Pro-tip: if you get the tattoo and don't like it, immediately get the stuff required to remove it.In terms of graphics, it's obviously an improvement. Characters and the voice acting are much more unique and diverse; no more reusing the same handful of models/voices over and over (although a little of that remains, usually with people you can't really talk to). The lighting is appaling though. I spent most of the first chapter fidling with the brightness controls because, either, every dungeon or night was clear as day (who needs Cat?!) or every day time scene or interior was overly dark (brunette Triss). The world also feels much smaller then the first game (although obviously more detailed), and ridiculously small compared to something like Skyrim (or even DAI). This seems to be the the trade-off for prettier graphics.The interface is horrible, at least for someone using the 360 controller. You have to access the main menu to get to things like your journal, level up, map, etc, and then it spits you back into the game world afterwards. Annoying if you want to keep accessing those pages. For example, a common one is looking up info on a monster. For some unknown bloody reason it's split into two areas, there is (a little) info on the bestiary page of the journal and also (the important info) hidden on the ""knowledge"" page hidden within the ""attributes"" page hidden within the character development screen! Inventory management is also a pain due to unnecessary difficulty of trying to figure out what you currently have selected. Button prompts are missing on certain screens (most noticeably on the poker screen - it's Y to select dice, you're welcome). The quick menu/radial wheel also leaves something to be desired. You can tell it's the devs first time creating something with controller support. Although it's hard to forgive the fact they haven't addressed these problems in the years since release. The game also creates a new save each time you save, leaving you with literally hundreds of saves and slowing down the game! Also, the game constantly updates quest info, character bios, etc. with interesting writings by Dandelion, yet it is an absolute chore to constantly go back into the menu and scan every entry, slowly scrolling down to the bottom, to see if the last thing entered is something new. It's interesting writing that feels like it goes to waste. Perhaps an option to press a button, say the ""BACK"" button, to quickly jump to the new bit of info would be nice. And, finally, for those using a controller you are forced to take everything when looting. Which leads to a lot of unneccesary inventory management.The combat is improved, you do feel (at times) like a badass swordsman. But it does often feel like you're just substituting the silly combos of the first game for silly combat rolls and waiting for counters (unlockable ""Ripostes""). Once again it feels like certain areas of the game aren't worth the effort. Traps didn't seem particularly useful, since enemies either avoid them or interupt your placement just as often as they take damage from one. Bombs and daggers often seem to do less than you'd expect and are easy to miss with. Generally, they're there to spam if groups threaten to overwhelm you. I found the signs to be disappointing as well. I barely used anything besides Quen (and that barely survives a hit). Ignii seemed to do very little damage. Aard was good for little more than blowing down brick walls. Yrden did help a lot early on, chiefly in a boss fight and with some big, tough, charging enemies but I barely used it past the first chapter. I think part of this has do with the way character development is handled. You have 3 main branches: 1 for swords, 1 for signs, 1 for alchemy. and I think this split is unnecessary and annoying. You are given so few perks in the game you'll only be able to master one branch (which leaves almost nothing for the others). This leaves a rather one note Geralt (who is supposed to be a well-rounded master Witcher). I think it'd be better to have mixed branches with perks from all the Witcher disciplines (sword/sign/alchemy). Maybe name/design them around the three Witcher schools: Wolf, Viper, Griffon. Then no matter where you go you'll have to chance to be well-rounded and dabble in all areas, yet still have a ton of choice.So, despite its flaws (which I hope are addressed in the third game), I recommend the game. It's a great story with great characters and has a lot of interesting choices for you to make, just expect the odd frustration or disappointment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sure I may feel like quitting when I roll into a group of 5 people during insane mode and I'm forced to restart the entire game, but I know I'll come back to it. The story is compelling, the characters are memorable, and they throw in enough small references to the books to keep you looking for more.			",137,28,1,17,8,3,13

												The Witcher 2 is by far THE best game I've played since TESV:Skyrim.  I've had this game sitting in my library for a long time, mainly because every time I attempted the game I played the Tutorial (tutorials never seem like a bad idea) and I'd be turned off by it instantly.  But again and again, I'd hear people talk about what a great game this was online, and so I finally forced myself to put a couple hours in before setting it down.  And I'm damn glad I did.  I can't believe it has taken me this long but I'm ten hours into a save and loving every second of it.The game is your classic RPG, melee and magic, but with one large difference: the choices you make actually matter.  I'm not talking Skyrim, where if you do this quest you get this item, or that quest you get that item, but rather on a vast scale, where events will unfold completely differently based on what you say or do.  Combine that with amazing graphics; maps that are intriguing, stimulating to explore, and visually stunning; characters that you can actually connect with and understand; and a complex story that has kept me craving more like each new Game of Thrones episode.My biggest problem with the game is that it has some clunky, unintuitive menus, but after an hour or so you'll understand it to the point that it's barable.  I still have some trouble navigating it, but whatever.The game is absolutely one of the most unique and awesome games I have played.  To those wondering, you can play this game without playing the first one.  It's not necessary as TW2 does a very good job of keeping a self-contained story.  Do yourself a favor: stop reading this review and buy this damn game.  It's the one you've wanted to play your entire life without knowing it.			",348,65,13,50,40,2,45

												The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is an excellent RPG that shows just how far Polish developers can stretch 10 million dollars. The game is gorgeous, challenging, and engaging. There is a lot to like about the Witcher 2 but I’m most pleased with how it doesn’t treat you like an idiot. Puzzles and quests can require a lot of in game research to solve and the game never holds your hand. When everything comes together you really feel accomplished.There is a whole lot to love about this highly replayable game. Get it.While you don’t need to have played the original game to understand Witcher 2 you can import saved games from the original game (which affects your starting equipment as well as a few other things). You can download some saved games below.http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/180/?  ",380,53,11,47,48,1,97

												This game takes you on a journey of never ending fun and excitement. It's not just the usual ""go to the dungeon and clear it out"" sort of game it's more of an ""Go to the dungeon, get materials to defeat and epic monster that you will battle soon... and oh! While you're at it defeat the boss"" kind of game. I'm sure you will never get bored. The story and gameplay of this game is great, especially how they can make the antagonists really hateful and protagonists loveable, also decions somewhat matter you do not get any rewards though your choices will have its consequences. Once you think that you are over with the game you're probably wrong because you haven't explored ""everything"" yet. This is game is great that's all I can say 10/10			",94,9,0,13,5,0,3

												A must play for any RPG fan.The Witcher game series is what you get when fans of a great novel series come together and create a game based on the novels.  The game worlds have so much lore and detail.More games should be created from top notch novels.CD Projekt Red always does a great job at adding all kinds of improvements to the game after release as well.Pros: Drastically enhanced combat system from the previous installment of The Witcher. Causality: Different choices you make at points in the game can have a major impact on your immediate and future experience playing through the story. Able to create your own Witcher fighting style by selecting different abilities from 4 categories (Swordman, Magic, Training, and Alchemy). Tons of things for the player to do/explore that stray from the main quest line. Improves on just about every aspect of the game series.Cons: Sometimes preparing the right potion / oil for a specific monster can be tricky as you can no longer meditate in combat.

												10/10 This game is a huge step forward from the first and it is B-E-A-Utiful.This game blew my mind in graphics. It has that style where it looks so real that it can't be real. The Combat isn't just RMB RMB LMB, it requires tactics, planning ahead, observation, and dodging which keeps the combat entertaining. The Witcher 2 takes place where our favorite witcher, Geralt of Rivia, left off. I highly recommend playing the first one. It carries over weapons, armor, and depends on how you look at it, the signs (You actually have to find them in the first Witcher). The finishers are putting a cherry on top of a already perfect ice cream sunday. The few moments of stealth in this game are fun a challenging. Now this isn't a 'Dark Souls' so it is possible to beat, ha ha, but it was still rough on normal. I almost played this game twice in a row until I realized I needed to finish things before end of summer :p.Absolutely fantastic game. Highly recommend playing the first one before this one.

												This is the second adventure of Geralt of Rivia, and it really is a magnificent sequel and a darn good RPG.What are the biggest changes between this and Witcher 1? Well, first there's the visuals - everything's gorgeous now, and Zoltan no longer has a bizarre unfocused look in his eyes that makes him seem permanently stoned. I spent a ton of time just panning the camera around taking in all the scenery, and I was only playing this on LOW settings. Control-wise, the combat system has been revamped. It's still occasionally clunky when it comes to switching between Witcher signs/bombs/traps, but this awkwardness eventually goes away after a few hours of play. Overall, everything feels more natural (when played with a controller) and skill-based than the clicky combat of the first game. The different stances are out and now it's action-orientated, and you've got to roll around a lot and dodge blows with precision. The game is tough at first because Geralt starts as a weakling compared to his foes, and the in-game tutorial does a pretty crap job of explaining the combat, so try the game out on Easy or Normal difficulty first until you get the hang of things and level up Geralt to non-weakling status. (Use the Quen sign as much as possible and try specializing in Swordmaster skills like roll and block if you're having trouble in the beginning.) Normal difficult in the Witcher 2 = hard difficulty in a lot of other games, so be aware.And then there's the story. The plot in Witcher 1 occasionally seemed like it was rehashing the most memorable of Geralt's adventures from the novels with some odd discrepancies; ie: Triss' personality was more like Yennefer's than anything else. Witcher 2 fixes this by making the characters more in line with their book counterparts and crafting a story that is very political and seems like a natural extension of the books rather than a ""best of"" compilation. The kings of the Northern Kingdoms are being killed by assailants from a forgotten Witcher school, and much of Chapters 2 and 3 focus on the importance of the Pontar Valley, an area that borders the more notable kingdoms in Geralt's world. A lot of names are dropped and places referenced, which can be confusing to newbies that haven't read the books or played the first game, so referring to the in-menu Journal is a must. Lore fanatics will eat this up; impatient players perhaps not as much.As long as you've got time and patience, the Witcher 2 will eat up many, many hours of your life. Best of all, this is one of the few games I know of that's really worth replaying - a critical decision at the end of Chapter 1 will COMPLETELY change Chapters 2 and 3 for you. Lengthy RPGs are usually low on the replay list for me...but I'm planning on a completely new playthrough on Hard difficulty just to check out Iorveth's path, so that's saying something.

												If you don't have this game yet for some reason GET IT! This was my first witcher game and good god did it get me addicted into the universe. This is one of (if not) my favorite RPG game of all time, it is a gloriously optimized game, and a gorgeous one at that. CD Projekt Red clearly cares about its fanbase and deserves nothing less then full support.			",67,5,2,7,4,0,3

												I got this game for the price of a coffee and a dognut. 17 hours later, after finishing the game, I feel like I bought the Mona Lisa, or a Rembrandt.This is not a game, this is a work of art. It's an experience which floods all your senses, keeps you on your toes and has you wanting more and more all the way until the credits roll and beyond. And the best part is you get to shape it the way you want. There's no good or bad in this game, it's just choice and consequences and believe me, your choices actually matter. Some of them, you might not even notice the effect (but it's there) while others completely change how future events unfold.Still, this is a game, and a game needs proper gameplay to support the whole thing. Thankfully, this game nailed it. Combat is very fluid and quite strategic. It's more than just mindless button mash. I played it on easy because I don't play games for the challenge anymore, rather for the experience, yet I encountered enough challenging situations.Do I recommend this game? Definitely! I can't recommend it enough. Even if you're not into RPGs, heck, even if you're not into fantasy games in general, you should definitely give this one a try. You will not regret it.

												I came to this one extremely late, and it's a shame, because it has quickly become one of my favorite RPGs. While the combat feels clunky, and for some reason the game chugged on my upper mid-range hardware, I cannot deny just how engrossing the game is. It has a strange way of pulling me into it's world in a way that few other games can. I actually felt like what I did had some sort of weight and importance in the game's world at large. I found myself becoming infuriated with how certain characters acted, and how much their actions would make my goal harder to attain. And the frustrating combat bits (I can name two boss battles off the top of my head that are just a slog) are so dwarfed by how well the story is told that I pushed through in that sitting, just to see what story was to follow. This is of course opposed to my usual strategy of trying twice, dying twice, throwing my controller out the window and coming back when I could buy a new one.All in all, Witcher 2 is an experience that I'm extremely grateful to have had, and I absolutely cannot wait to play the next installment.

												Now that I've finally gotten a chance to finish it, my prediction from many months ago turned out to be true: it's the strongest competition I've found for Bastion for GOTY 2011 (edit: since displaced by To the Moon, but still in my top three). Yeah, I know it's the end of 2012. I'm a little behind.The presentation of everything is excellent. It all looks and sounds great, and a lot of thought went into the way the world is presented to you and how you interact with things. I didn't feel quite the surprise of some of the delayed consequences of decisions made like in the first game, but they matter just as much for a different reason this time around. The game is a bit shorter, but depending on what you say and do, a huge amount of it changes completely, not just a little bit of dialog here and there or the ending cutscene like some games. You have a major effect on the world, for better or worse.			",499,202,15,84,46,6,86

												I have spent a better part of 90 hours on this game and I love absolutely everything about it. So much has been improved since the first game, I dont even know where to begin. Pros:Beautiful world everywhere you turn. Seemless combat when you level up.Amazing story that follows so well from the first game.Vast amount of improvements from the first game. Lore is everywhere and when you think you have ran out of things to do, someone else runs for your helpCons;The story though deep, seems to end fast.The map size is misleading for the few towns you actually vist.Overall I can say that I loved every minute of this game, I can say without a doubt that I am very excited with The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves open world RPG and is a fan of the series.

												After some tinkering, I finally got it to where the game feels fluid and I don't get motion sick.I used FC2 (which admittedly, I don't like the whole package as there's some balancing issues, but the base game animations feel clunky and irritate the living hell out of me)and FOV1.1I've always heard people say that the choices matter in this game, but I was thinking more along the lines of Skyrim or another open world RPG. No, they don't even compare, the choices you make in the Witcher can change the outcome of your game entirely. I've just finished my first playthrough and am eager to  jump back in for another to see what happens when I make different choices.You'll be pulling your hair out with some of the choices you made and glad you made others.For someone that does not like politics, similar to Geralt, I enjoyed this game very much.The Witcher is the political fanaticism version of Lord of the Rings, story is everything.

But the engine lacks optimization, regarding the virtual quality the game has offered.游戏剧情在第一章结束的时候会有两个分支，可以重玩。At the end of chapter one, there will be two branches, that player could try another branch after finished the game.

												10/10 This game is a huge step forward from the first and it is B-E-A-Utiful.This game blew my mind in graphics. It has that style where it looks so real that it can't be real. The Combat isn't just RMB RMB LMB, it requires tactics, planning ahead, observation, and dodging which keeps the combat entertaining. The Witcher 2 takes place where our favorite witcher, Geralt of Rivia, left off. I highly recommend playing the first one. It carries over weapons, armor, and depends on how you look at it, the signs (You actually have to find them in the first Witcher). The finishers are putting a cherry on top of a already perfect ice cream sunday. The few moments of stealth in this game are fun a challenging. Now this isn't a 'Dark Souls' so it is possible to beat, ha ha, but it was still rough on normal. I almost played this game twice in a row until I realized I needed to finish things before end of summer :p.Absolutely fantastic game. Highly recommend playing the first one before this one.

												Unforgiving combat that emphasize strategy over button-mashing; unforgettable characters who are morally ambiguous in very human ways; and player choices that actually matter, makes The Witcher 2 a fantastic role-playing experience.The Enhanced Edition has fixed some of the balancing issues from the first release and filled in some of the story, helping the overall pacing and to bridge the three acts together in a smoother way.Fresh players might be helped by the new tutorial at the start of the game, as this is a game that has some old-school sensibilities in that it kind of assumes that you've read the game manual.

												This game is just a delight from start to finish. This kind of mature, thoughtful, and immersive RPG really boots the Elder Scrolls series into a bin and kicks it down a steep incline. The story has so many nuances to it, the combat is satisfying, and you really get involved in Geralt's dilemmas and especially the world. And, to top it all off, in-game decisions that ACTUALLY MATTER. And  most don't have a clear good/bad choice, which again sets Witcher 2 apart from most RPGS; you aren't a straight good guy or a straight evil guy, you're just a guy, albiet a white-haired guy with super magic powers, sorting through multiple shades of grey. I love and can remember almost all of the characters from this game, and theres such a great array of emotion in the game: laughter, excitement, misery, and sheer honest to god wonder. This mostly comes from the gorgeously designed environments. If this game was a woman, she'd be way out of my league. So yeah, if you have even the slightest interest in RPGs, this is a must-buy. And if you're already an RPG enthusiast looking for something a little more mature and thoughtful than Skyrim, this is even more of a must-buy.Roll on Witcher 3!			",111,15,1,16,7,2,6

When I bought this game, I straight played it on DARK mode and did a 2nd run on INSANE mode which was really INSANE in some part of the game.

												First off way way way way too many cutscenes. Be prepared for a lot of cutscenes leading to loading screens followed by another cutscene. Graphics are a +, lots of lovely textures in this game and a cool art style to boot.Casting magic spells in the middle of a sword fight is fun but unfortunately the spells and magic feel dull. The ai can be stupidly difficult at times and then extremely dumb.Not a fan of the contrast the main character has with the people and world around him. He seems out of place but not in a cool way. Overall an enjoyable and occasionally challenging RPG.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An RPG where there is no illusion of choice and decisions can affect what side of a conflict you will see for the next 6 hours.  Combat is challenging and engaging. Geralt can very easily be overwhelmed if you approach a fight brashly and without forethought. Lots of replayability to see how the different decisions can pan out and to beat the game on it's hardest difficulty of ""insane"" where a single death is GAME OVER and you have to start from the beginning of the game.

												One of the best RPGs I've played (One of 2011's best games period). A deep, involved story with branching paths (for example, chapter 2 is completely different based on your decisions in chapter 1), great voicework and music, incredible visuals, and solid combat. By the end of the prologue I was invested in the story and characters and it just got better from there. Highly recommended.			",303,53,11,28,18,1,45

												I know the book series, so I was intrigued by the games. I liked the first Witcher game so I went straight for the third one and I've totally fallen for it. Buuut, the third game's story has many references to the second game and here starts the plight. I mean for me this game was the worst way to spend 2euros on sale. The graphics are nice, the story is more than enjoyable, familiar character brought back some good memories of the book and then... then, there's the player interface, the combat system, the sign casting, those bloody QTEs - all of these feel well cumbersome, like some kind of warm up for the Witcher3. I know, hardcore gamers might start b*tching about me whining and that game is just challenging. Well yeah, it is a frustration challenge of totally unenjoyable cumbersome gameplay. And I am so glad I managed through it on easy difficulty, so I could start a replay of Witcher3 on deathmarch. Oh, that being said, the save system is sh*te as well.  I spared Letho in the end and I have the manual (and automatic) save file with him at the end, but somehow, that save is not visible for the third game, ugh. And I am not replaying this game, ugh .Nevertheless, I am recommending the game (with a sour face, mind you). Just get it on a price discount.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I came to this one extremely late, and it's a shame, because it has quickly become one of my favorite RPGs. While the combat feels clunky, and for some reason the game chugged on my upper mid-range hardware, I cannot deny just how engrossing the game is. It has a strange way of pulling me into it's world in a way that few other games can. I actually felt like what I did had some sort of weight and importance in the game's world at large. I found myself becoming infuriated with how certain characters acted, and how much their actions would make my goal harder to attain. And the frustrating combat bits (I can name two boss battles off the top of my head that are just a slog) are so dwarfed by how well the story is told that I pushed through in that sitting, just to see what story was to follow. This is of course opposed to my usual strategy of trying twice, dying twice, throwing my controller out the window and coming back when I could buy a new one.All in all, Witcher 2 is an experience that I'm extremely grateful to have had, and I absolutely cannot wait to play the next installment.

												When I first tried out this game, I was overwhelmed by the combat mechanics and UI. I had a bad first impression and didn't try it out again for a long time. Having read some great reviews by others, I decided it was worth giving a second chance. I cranked up the difficulty to hard (now I want to try Dark) and finished my first playthrough yesterday. It was a lot of fun! I misjudged the game and found that while there are some learning curves to become good at group combat, this is a game that can stand out next to other RPG series like The Elder Scrolls, Fable, and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.I can't and won't directly compare this game to Skyrim, because I feel they inhabit different subgenres. Skyrim is more about the open world, exploration, and freedom of action, while The Witcher 2 excels at storytelling, well-scripted combat encounters, boss fights, and living the life of a monster-hunter.The only thing I wish was different about The Witcher 2 is even more monster contracts. There is just something exciting about fighting with silver sword and using alchemy to brew the right potions and oils for the task at hand. I can't wait until The Witcher 3!If you enjoy games like Skyrim, Fable, or KOTOR, give this game a try!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2 is one of the best fantasy epics I've played for a while. Dark writing that will compel you to push forth and delve into the story; going so far as to consume your days! And then, in the final moments of the game, the narrative will have you begging for more, making you wish the game was longer--or that Witcher 3 would come sooner! (P.S. The game is over 20 hours long, yet I wanted more. Yes, the story is that gripping) The game also treats you with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ maturity, CDProjekt Red doesn't ♥♥♥♥♥ out here, the game contains a lot of sex--and it's magnificent; especially when other game developers don't have the balls to go there, or when they do, they often don't have the balls to see it through to the end. Sufficed to say, all those who haven't played the previous game (of which I am one) will,  at-first, find themselves lost. The game will try to get you up to speed, however you'll feel very lost at the beginning of the game. But soon you'll be caught up in a web of conspiricy and intrigue that, when the jarring moments of exposition pretaining to the first game come, it will do little to sour your mood, and soon, you'll be back into the fray of the story. Also, choices, choices that bloody matter! Do you know how refreshing that is? Yes? Then jump on in!The gameplay is burtal and unforgiving if you are unready--plus the saving system isn't very... lenient with you. So if you screw  up and you haven't saved, oh boy you're in hot water! Enemies will challenge you, hoards of them can be just as effective as a boss. Which, to mention the bosses, yeah, they're hard too! Especially the last. However, I'm just speaking from my own experience here, it will greatly vary by user ability and game difficulty. (I can imagine that, after playing this bloody romp on normal and dying a couple of times, that on hard it's a bloody nightmare.) The presentation of the game isn't too shabby either, bearing in mind it's been 2 years from release, it couldn't look any better; sure in some areas texture can appear flat or certain other graphical annoyances may appear, however it will do little to deter you from playing! Character models are detailed to the level that you would expect. Glitches are minimal--although some may make themselves apparent. The game has a highly fine level of polish that will be apparent as you play through the wonderful game; the craftmanship that has gone into this game is insane, CDProjektRed are masters of making video games, so you're in safe hands.Convinced yet? I should bloody hope so. If this game is on sale and you're reading this, I can only ask why? Why are you wasting you time? This is such a great game that any [reasonable] cost is well worth it! Especially on your nice fancy PC rig. So, stop reading and add this game to your collection now! You won't regret a single moment, a single dime, that you'll have poured into this game.

												This game is tied with Skyrim as being the best game(s) I have ever played. ""Beautiful"", is not even close to describing the look, sound, and feel of this game. The graphics and scenary are matched perfectly with the orchestra and soundtrack that barrage you from start to finish. You will feel as if you're in another world, and another time. This game makes you not just escape into the world, but the story truly drives the entire gameplay and turns you into the Witcher. Where every action and choice you make has a consequence and alters the story, you will without a doubt find this game breathtaking and providing you with countless hours of gameplay, and amazing replayability, where one different choice, can take you on an entirely separate journey.

												I need a good ♥♥♥♥ing tutorial for witcher 2 because there is barly is one; they don't even tell you the god damn controls. You can't even change your key bindings or any useful settings in game. The only settings you can change in-game are brightness levels change invert y axis or x axis (Stuff like that). You have to close the game and change the settings before you start the game with a ♥♥♥♥ing launcher. ♥♥♥♥ing hell. However still a good game and I see what makes it an amazing game; but perpare yourself to do some research and look up some guides before you start. The game is amazing when you know what the ♥♥♥♥ you have been doing and can be fun. But newcomers like me are hanged like fishing wire around our neck and were trying figure out how to cut the wire with the scssiors in our hand. It just needs a proper ♥♥♥♥ing tutorial and this game wouldn't have much hate, but still a ♥♥♥♥ing amazing game. Would you buy it, yes; but read a guide first. What the serious ♥♥♥♥. This game is a amazing, but needs a ♥♥♥♥ing better tutorial. So knock yourself out; but read a tutorial online first.			",103,8,0,4,5,2,9

												A very good game if you enjoy deep story telling and fun combat. The game is very difficult especially if you think you can just go into combat spamming quick attack. Combat instead is very tactical, you must prepare ahead of time with potions and knowledge then use dodging, parrying, signs and light and heavy attacks to defeat your foes. There are three leveling paths that will decide your play style.Overall the game is very good and an enjoyable experience desite the crap saving and loading screen after you die. I would recomend this to any RPG fan.			",84,3,0,25,9,0,11

												The Witcher 2 can be summed up as being everything that Dragon Age 2 failed to be. It's storyline is great, the dialogue is awesome, the characters are likeable and memorable, the sex scenes are mature (with uncesored frontal nude and all), and the graphics are gorgeous (and you might need a seven page configuration guide AND a third party application in order to make it run decently on a GTX550ti like mine). But the ""It's Toasted"" of the game is it's combat system. It's hard, and if you jump head on into fights you're going to die almost always. The mechanics are good and your character is very resourceful, so as long as you're not caught off guard you always stand a good chance.			",280,61,2,43,19,4,46

												The Witcher 2, this game is as good an RPG as it is compared to lots of other RPG games.First of all, the sight to see in this game is marvelous, some might get mad at me for rating games on its graphics, but its graphics is worth more than a part of the 'realistic' games out there, both the scenes and the gameplay. Even having it on low quality has its charm too.Gameplay, I had troubles in combat the first time I tried it out on the tutorial section, it's so tricky to use, but you get used to it soon or later, and will able to use it to the max. The interface is minimalistic and the inventory is well made. One thing I love about the inventory is the fact that we're able to sort it according to weight multiplying to the amount the item has, very useful for inventory weight based games (which a lot doesn't have this feature). Crafting, enhancing, and trading is also well balanced.The story, I haven't advanced that much in the game, but the plot is interesting indeed. Aside from the main story there are also lots of other quests to play through.ConclusionBeautiful Hack & Slash RPG Game, well balanced gameplay features and interesting story to follow.

												Now that I've finally gotten a chance to finish it, my prediction from many months ago turned out to be true: it's the strongest competition I've found for Bastion for GOTY 2011 (edit: since displaced by To the Moon, but still in my top three). Yeah, I know it's the end of 2012. I'm a little behind.The presentation of everything is excellent. It all looks and sounds great, and a lot of thought went into the way the world is presented to you and how you interact with things. I didn't feel quite the surprise of some of the delayed consequences of decisions made like in the first game, but they matter just as much for a different reason this time around. The game is a bit shorter, but depending on what you say and do, a huge amount of it changes completely, not just a little bit of dialog here and there or the ending cutscene like some games. You have a major effect on the world, for better or worse.			",499,202,15,84,46,6,86

Lore is everywhere and when you think you have ran out of things to do, someone else runs for your helpCons;The story though deep, seems to end fast.The map size is misleading for the few towns you actually vist.Overall I can say that I loved every minute of this game, I can say without a doubt that I am very excited with The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves open world RPG and is a fan of the series.

												After some tinkering, I finally got it to where the game feels fluid and I don't get motion sick.I used FC2 (which admittedly, I don't like the whole package as there's some balancing issues, but the base game animations feel clunky and irritate the living hell out of me)and FOV1.1I've always heard people say that the choices matter in this game, but I was thinking more along the lines of Skyrim or another open world RPG. No, they don't even compare, the choices you make in the Witcher can change the outcome of your game entirely. I've just finished my first playthrough and am eager to  jump back in for another to see what happens when I make different choices.You'll be pulling your hair out with some of the choices you made and glad you made others.For someone that does not like politics, similar to Geralt, I enjoyed this game very much.The Witcher is the political fanaticism version of Lord of the Rings, story is everything.

												剧情很紧凑，但流程比较短。The story is decent, but quite short. it takes around 10 hours or two days for me to finish the walkthrough.游戏的画面很不错，氛围营造的很好，就是优化有点烂。The graphic of the witcher 2 is fantastic, presenting a vivid medieval witcher world. But the engine lacks optimization, regarding the virtual quality the game has offered.游戏剧情在第一章结束的时候会有两个分支，可以重玩。At the end of chapter one, there will be two branches, that player could try another branch after finished the game.

												If you like (J)RPG's with combat like Batman / Demon/Dark Souls, this game might be a good choice. Great game, great story, superb followup for the first Witcher, challenging combat (especially with full combat rebalance mod), modsupport, SDK, lots of bonusses, free DLC (It's always free unless we talk about expansion) The story also has 16 different endings, based on choices you made. check out www.thewitcher.comGreat game, it's worth it.9/10			",80,4,0,5,12,1,0

												Good. 10/10 The sheer amount of choices you have that actually affect the smaller and larger parts of the story is amazing. Also, for a game that came out 3 years ago (minus a few clipping issues with his hair) looks pretty damn good. Has the ability to be modded, although no steam workshop. Which is okay I suppose. just messy.			",232,48,2,69,33,2,53

												While I didn't manage to complete Witcher 1 (after ~17hrs of gameplay) due to issues I have with the combat system, Witcher 2 is on a completely different level. Even though it was released in 2011, the revamped Enhanced Edition puts the game's graphics on par with current games. As I stepped into the beautiful fantasy world, I was quickly drawn to the lovable characters (with reappearances from W1) and interesting story that at multiple turns forces you to make decisions that have drastic consequences on following events.One of the most important choices you have to make is towards the end of Chapter 1, thereby splitting the game into 2 major fractions each with its own development. Therefore, I highly recommend playing W2 twice. Doing so will allow you to earn steam achievements from both fractions and also to make more informed choices when making the gamesave transfer (/quick decision recap if you lose the gamesaves) for The Witcher 3 (HYYPPPPEEEEEE!!!!!). My first playthrough was 20 hrs, and a second should be much shorter with the option to skip most cutscenes prior to that decision.While there are many positives about the game such as its beautiful graphics, good voice-acting, a larger variety of character models (much needed upgrade from W1) etc, there are some things I didn't like too. For example, I felt that the door/ area transition is pretty clunky, especially when fighting around an opened door and your character moves to the next room when he gets too close. Also, there is a significant lag time after an enemy/ monster is defeated and issuing the next action, such as picking up loot, opening doors, or climbing cliffs.Other than the above-mentioned negatives, which are actually quite reminiscent of old RPGs, the game is really good and a must-play before Witcher 3. I would recommend skipping W1 and start with this title instead.9.5/10Edit (after 2nd playthrough): The game autosaves A LOT and the gamesaves are LARGE. For those wishing to play the game twice, remember to clear your gamesaves or at a certain point a well known bug will occur and cause the game to keep crashing. It will even crash when you restart and select 'load' in the main menu. Other than this, my 2nd playthough while selecting the other fraction was still very enjoyable, as Chapter 2 was very very different.			",62,8,1,8,1,0,1

												Easily one of the best RPGs in recent memory. It's difficult, very well written, and what makes it truly unique in my eyes is that it's believable. It's fantasy, sure, but there isn't and overabundance of things happening that are TOO fantasy. RPGs these days aren't that believeable and are more a playground, which is great. But this game is some fresh air for those looking for a spectacular story and gameplay. I originally played the ported version for the 360 which isn't nearly as good as PC obviously but still played the balls out of it. 100% recommend.

												This game is good, no doubt, but it suffers so much that at times its not enjoyable. The combat is very clunky and at times just doesn't work right and theres very little differentiation in how to defeat enemies besides block/parry/dodge/spam. Theres almost nothing to do with all of the crafting items that you get, items from merchants are way too overpriced, armor except for the chest pieces are virtually the same things The voice acting is super off in some parts and is pretty bad at times. The bosses are by far the absolute dogshit wrost boss fights I have ever encoutered in a video game. The first fight with the Kingslayer is unfair and boring, the fight with the Draug is monotonous and dumb because he'll spam a ranged attack over and over, and the fight with the dragon is literally just a roll back->roll forward->attack->repeat. The signs except for Quen, Igni, and Yren (or however you spell it) are absolutely useless in my opinion. The skill tree is far too big for such a short game, as I ended up being around level 35 when I beat the game. The potion system is very poorly done, because on your first playthrough you have no idea what is going to be up ahead, and therefore you don't know what potions to have used and probably die as a result.Despite all the negatives, the game also does have its good parts as well. The soundtrack is very well done, it has beautiful tunes, but they're overused at times and I probably didn't even hear half of them. The graphics are beautiful for the time, even though I wasn't able to run it on max settings it still looked good and held a very stable FPS. There's a good story, but it is easy to get lost quickly if you don't pay attention or didn't play the first game (like me). I do like that they added a toxicity to the potions so you can't just chug everything at once and become a sterioded mess.Overall, I'd have to give it a 6/10. I have high hopes for The Witcher 3 whenever I get to playing it, but I'd say to skip out on this entry on the series unless you're looking for backstory.			",134,16,1,8,4,1,2

												Not to bad, the graphics are insane when cranked up, it's like watching a movie...but the game play could use a little work, it will force you to stop doing certain tasks to do something else, then make you make you go back....and again, and again. But the story line is great, the action is great, i love the sword play. It's a pretty fun game, but i was hoping for of a skyrim type game where you are free to make your own choices, but that's not the case here. I still recommend it as it is a fairly high quality game with a lot of action and fantastic graphics.			",259,73,7,25,24,1,23

												The Witcher 2, this game is as good an RPG as it is compared to lots of other RPG games.First of all, the sight to see in this game is marvelous, some might get mad at me for rating games on its graphics, but its graphics is worth more than a part of the 'realistic' games out there, both the scenes and the gameplay. Even having it on low quality has its charm too.Gameplay, I had troubles in combat the first time I tried it out on the tutorial section, it's so tricky to use, but you get used to it soon or later, and will able to use it to the max. The interface is minimalistic and the inventory is well made. One thing I love about the inventory is the fact that we're able to sort it according to weight multiplying to the amount the item has, very useful for inventory weight based games (which a lot doesn't have this feature). Crafting, enhancing, and trading is also well balanced.The story, I haven't advanced that much in the game, but the plot is interesting indeed. Aside from the main story there are also lots of other quests to play through.ConclusionBeautiful Hack & Slash RPG Game, well balanced gameplay features and interesting story to follow.

												I know the book series, so I was intrigued by the games. I liked the first Witcher game so I went straight for the third one and I've totally fallen for it. Buuut, the third game's story has many references to the second game and here starts the plight. I mean for me this game was the worst way to spend 2euros on sale. The graphics are nice, the story is more than enjoyable, familiar character brought back some good memories of the book and then... then, there's the player interface, the combat system, the sign casting, those bloody QTEs - all of these feel well cumbersome, like some kind of warm up for the Witcher3. I know, hardcore gamers might start b*tching about me whining and that game is just challenging. Well yeah, it is a frustration challenge of totally unenjoyable cumbersome gameplay. And I am so glad I managed through it on easy difficulty, so I could start a replay of Witcher3 on deathmarch. Oh, that being said, the save system is sh*te as well.  I spared Letho in the end and I have the manual (and automatic) save file with him at the end, but somehow, that save is not visible for the third game, ugh. And I am not replaying this game, ugh .Nevertheless, I am recommending the game (with a sour face, mind you). Just get it on a price discount.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very interesting game. Story is sophisticated and combat makes you feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥while challanging you. There is a lack of customization for combat but thats actually a good thing. The develoapers maneged to improve one combat style very well instead of doing 3 or 4 that lack. The combat is basically a mix of traps, throwable weapons, potions, spells, and simple but never boring sword fighting. On easier diffuculty you only have to worry about doing one or 2 of those things right, but on harder difficultys you need to pay attention to all of them because you will need them. You can craft everything that you will need for combat using simple mix of ingrediants from the world. The story is very mature. If you are interested political conflicts that are dealt with in old fashioned ways than this is the game for you. Characters are all very well put and you will never forget a face in the game. The main character is a bad♥♥♥♥♥ filled with chivelary type of guy but never feeling like he was just made to save the world he has his own problems and he wouldnt mind puting saving the world aside. Overall the game is a piece of gold. a must for any fan of RPGs or well made single player stories. ",85,7,1,10,6,0,7

												Granted I haven't played the original Witcher due to the combat system in it, Witcher 2 is a lot better than its predecessor. The continuation of ""multiple"" paths in the story line to effect the overall outcome continues and with the well expected conclusion of the trilogy coming out soon, it's even funner now to replay through it again and relive the adventure.The storyline is intriguing and while some actions are locked in place, the overall feeling that you can change the environment is there. Most of the characters have advanced back storys that help add to them to make them feel more than just a single random person throwing quests at you and you don't have to kill the trolls!The combat style supports a miriad of different techniques such as support caster builds, ranged assassin builds, stealth attacks, straight out melee sluggers, and of course the balanced approach for all skill sets. The only thing really missing is the fact you still cannot use a dedicated ranged weapon such as a crossbow or longbow. While I am a fan of swordsmanship, there have been times when having a crossbow would of been a godsend.The gameplay mechanics are smooth and 99% of the time, balanced and fair. It's rare that I find a glitched area or a zone that results in a reset as in some games such as Fallout where you can get stuck on a cliff or stuck in mid-air while jumping. Visual appearances are, even on lower settings very eye-catching and the developers did a very good job in making sure that the game looks as good as it plays.Overall score: 8/10+ Good storyline and solid character builds+ Balanced combat styles that are both unique and worth using+ You can actually for the most part, stealth through the game if you really want a challenge+ Both routes can be set to a good or bad ending instead of fixed- Combat can be unforgiving when barrel rollingDefinetly would recommend this game to anyone who has played and enjoyed Skyrim, Assassins Creed, previous Witcher title, Tomb Raider, Fallout. Worth the time it takes to play and definetly worth playing through four times (both good endings, and both bad endings)			",140,3,0,18,10,2,41

												It is an amazing game with an amazing story. I highly recommend the use of a controller for this one, unlike the first game. The battle mechanic is also an improvement and more streamlined than the original. The world is pretty open with plenty of sidequests, while at the same time having a strong linear structure to it. This fact has its pros and cons. The pro being that the story is incredibly strong and compelling, so the player should never lose interest (even when sidequesting). The con being that the game tends to be shorter than its predecessor (about 10 hours shorter for me) and the explorative breath of the game is simply not as large as the original. The mix of open world & strong linear story elements that the original had was simply more well-rounded compared to this sequel. Nevertheless, The Witcher 2 is an excellent game.For those who might be wondering whether playing the first game is a must before this one, the answer is: Yes. There is a meta-plot in this series, which leads up to the third game. And the meta-plot begins its origins and explanations in the original game. The second game also simply doesn't introduce the main characters or explain them all that well to newcomers. While you can read up on the info in the game's interior journal logs, it does not make up for not playing through the original game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I didn't like the first Witcher, but this one fixed a lot of the issues I had back then.  Better combat, better inventory, better story telling, better everything.  Also, a great lead in to The Witcher 3, which is the best RPG ever made, period.  This one is worth $20, but often goes on sale.  The Witcher 3 is worth $500, but only sells for $60 if its not on sale.    Get them both.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Granted I haven't played the original Witcher due to the combat system in it, Witcher 2 is a lot better than its predecessor. The continuation of ""multiple"" paths in the story line to effect the overall outcome continues and with the well expected conclusion of the trilogy coming out soon, it's even funner now to replay through it again and relive the adventure.The storyline is intriguing and while some actions are locked in place, the overall feeling that you can change the environment is there. Most of the characters have advanced back storys that help add to them to make them feel more than just a single random person throwing quests at you and you don't have to kill the trolls!The combat style supports a miriad of different techniques such as support caster builds, ranged assassin builds, stealth attacks, straight out melee sluggers, and of course the balanced approach for all skill sets. The only thing really missing is the fact you still cannot use a dedicated ranged weapon such as a crossbow or longbow. While I am a fan of swordsmanship, there have been times when having a crossbow would of been a godsend.The gameplay mechanics are smooth and 99% of the time, balanced and fair. It's rare that I find a glitched area or a zone that results in a reset as in some games such as Fallout where you can get stuck on a cliff or stuck in mid-air while jumping. Visual appearances are, even on lower settings very eye-catching and the developers did a very good job in making sure that the game looks as good as it plays.Overall score: 8/10+ Good storyline and solid character builds+ Balanced combat styles that are both unique and worth using+ You can actually for the most part, stealth through the game if you really want a challenge+ Both routes can be set to a good or bad ending instead of fixed- Combat can be unforgiving when barrel rollingDefinetly would recommend this game to anyone who has played and enjoyed Skyrim, Assassins Creed, previous Witcher title, Tomb Raider, Fallout. Worth the time it takes to play and definetly worth playing through four times (both good endings, and both bad endings)			",140,3,0,18,10,2,41

												I used to only play elder scrolls games when it came to RPG's, but this game changed that. Saw it on sale here on steam so i thought hey, why not. I ended up playing about 20 hours over the span of 2 days (no life lol), and i don't regret it. The lore is just fascinating. I liked it to the point i bought the first one and im downloading it right now.The fact that you're the one building the story and your actions will mould what will happen at the end makes it even better, it means you can play it more than once, and explore different possibilities and endings.I already can't wait for Witcher 3.I 100% recommend this game, truly amazing.

												A superb RPG for the ages. A definite must-play for any fan of the genre. I preordered this months before its release date and I remember not sleeping at all during that night. I was too excited to sleep.I sat there and watched the download counter crawl along as my modem diligently retrieved the files from Steam's servers at an agonizingly slow rate (for me).The point of this long-winded introduction? To illustrate the fact that this is one of few games that I can safely say I enjoyed the HELL out of.  At the time it was 50 bucks very well-spent and nowadays, 4 bucks? You would be crazy not to buy it unless you hate RPG's or are a simplistic cretin.			",132,15,1,24,14,0,29

												Witcher 2. The second installment in 'The Witcher' Series. Great game, great storyline. You continue where you left off in Witcher 1, but you won't be a complete stranger to combat now. It's eased up and loads of combo-ing fun! The game has the ability of picking up your previous choices from Witcher 1, so I *HIGHLY ADVISE* that you get Witcher 1 first, finish it, then start with this. The storyline is deep, loads of choices to be made.In the graphics department, this game nails it. Character models, weapons, terrain and environment, you name it, it looks great!Only problem is, it is heavy on your system. But, you can play on the lower settings. *Little* changes. Like the view distance. In short, it's a great game developed by CD Projekt RED worth the buy.Have fun!			",361,40,6,27,23,0,19

I didnt enjoy the tutorial, i felt it could have been implimented a lot better, but when the ""real"" game starts it becomes way less daunting and incredibly awesome.Only had one issue with the game:•I had to disable in game v-sync to remove mouse lag.

												I'm not sure why the game's rating is 88. I honestly believe that this game deserves a full 100.Why? The story itself is great! A mix of fantasy and political feud accompanied by a mature plot / narrative will suck you in. The graphics are great, the soundtrack is to die for and the main character is someone who you can empathized with. That's Geralt of Rivia for you.Many say that the gameplay is hard but I beg to differ. This game is NOT like Dark Souls difficulty. It is however, realistic in the sense that you probably would have a hard time beating 3 people instead of 1. The game promotes you to use ALL of your abilities properly and smartly. It may sound difficulty but it isn't. Once you know how you maneuver your character, then you would know exactly what to do.I can't emphasize how much I love this game. Probably one of my top 3 RPGs of all time. PLAY THIS GAME.			",45,8,3,18,13,0,12

I was expecting a lot more of the 'final boss' when you fight with him, but it's was a good ending, you can choose between kill him or let him go.The last cutscene [after credits and final cutscene] made me crave for Witcher 3 and the comeback of Roche and Foltest's daughter. I was expecting 'freeroam' in this game, i mean, you couldn't travel between kingdoms and♥♥♥♥♥♥ just in-town, it dissapointed me but it isn't priority. Go to the blacksmith, buy things, craft them and buy 'blueprints' were something that really got me in this game.The art style of this game, just for this you need to buy this game. It's so good I repeat. Definetly a MUST BUY if you're craving for a good game. First single player game i really enjoy in a while.CDProjekt you're in the good path9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best RPG i have ever played. Right up there with TES Morrowind when it first came out. Combat can be challenging at times and you will have to learn by trial&error at certain points like cutscenes where at the end enemies start hacking away at you and geralt cant move or evade before he has his sword drawn. But story, depth of gameplay and the amazing graphics make up for minor flaws. Finished the game in about 40 hours on ""Dark"" difficulty but the game have several ways to progress and at least one major branchout where your choice even effects where the whole second chapter of the game takes place, so the game has alot of replayability.

												The Witcher 2 and The Witcher might be the best modern RPG ever made on the PC.  No DRM.  Free, significant DLC.  All bugs hve been cleaned out.  If you don't have it, you owe it to yourself to get it.  Don't miss the first one, either.  I might just buy that one again just so I don't ever have to mess with DVD's.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't recommend this game enough.  While it's far from perfect, it's such a rich world and an absolute blast to play.The combat controls are very clunky.Traps, Lures and to a lesser extend Bombs are useless.The mini games are terrible.  (Dice Poker and fist fighting)The menus and HUD aren't great.But even with these little issues, the game is so much fun.  The best part of the game is the world.  Living, breathing, brutal, really brutal world.  Most of the characters are great too.  You get to meet some really interesting character along the way.Geralt is a great main character and such a boss.  Definitely worth playing just for him.  Well play for Geralt but also play for all the sexy times.  So much sex.			",229,80,5,28,23,5,28

												As of now (2/28/13) This is the best RPG of the current decade. Good flowing combat, gorgeous visuals, good characters with great depth, and meaningful decision making make this a must play for RPG fans.  Add the wonderful alchemy system, and the brutal difficulty level you can set for yourself and it this is a game that will keep you entertianed and challenged for a good chunk of time.

												I think by now there's plenty out there discussing what's in the game and what the graphics are like etc so I don't think it's worth going into that here. For whatever it's worth, I'll just say here how it felt overall and suggestions for things you could try to improve your experience.I played through twice to explore both branches and I think that's enough for me. I don't feel that it's a game I'd play thrice. Combat was sometimes annoying and unresponsive: fights where both swords are needed suffer in particular because swapping between the two takes too long. YMMV but I felt that the boss fights were harder than in the first game and while I'm not going to complain about intrinsic difficulty, when they are compounded by extrinsic factors then overall that's not good at all.Also, I recommend taking up GOG's offer of DRM-free free backup copy because savegame loading is so much faster on that version.  When you might die a lot, it is really frustrating having to wait for the list of savegames to appear and then for the save to load - which might take a full minute or two (it certainly feels that long). Not sure but the GOG version also feels smoother and faster than the Steam version.Overall a great game but in my opinion unplayable unless using a gamepad/xbox360 controller because the control scheme makes for some awkward keyboard key mapping. Even though the Witcher games series began on PC, the control scheme of Witcher 2 feels like they targeted consoles and then ported it back to PC. Let me state now that for all intents and purposes I'm essentially a PC gamer exclusively so I do know my way around my keyboard and mouse. The only time I would use a controller would be if I was playing with friends on a console - yet when I picked up a controller for Witcher 2, the controls felt immediately natural.While I'm not a prude I'm glad they dispensed with the whole collectible ""sex-cards"" gimmick for Witcher 2. I felt they were immature and childish. As a completionist, I did endeavour to unlock them all in one of my Witcher 1 playthroughs but only for the sake of completionism - it was a chore, nothing more. It would have subtracted nothing from my enjoyment of the game if the feature had been absent. The Witcher games are not unique in falling foul of the immature and childish - i.e. sex as a ""reward"", which is an unrealistic and shallow depiction of relationships. But objectifying the act with those in-game collectible cards was even more silly.CDProjektRED has got be my favourite developer. I'm really looking forward to Witcher 3 to see how the story ends... but even that will just be a warm up for Cyberpunk 2077. I'm so getting the collectors edition of that if I can.If it sounds like I have a lot of complaints about this game then maybe it's because I had higher expectations than the game ultimately delivered. Then again I loved the Mass Effect games even though they were more linear but also felt deeper somehow. Maybe I'd hoped W2 would've been deeper.			",67,39,2,16,8,2,27

												One of the best RPGs I've ever played. The storyline changes based on your decisions. That in all would not be very impressive. The great thing is that they are not your Mass Effect type ""good/neutral/evil""-decisions but real nailbiters.The atmosphere is dark and dirty and everything is distrustful. You become suspicious of everybody which does not really help with making easy decisions. Do you help the elf or your companion? The complete second act will chance with that decision.The quests are interesting, the gameplay smooth, the combat-system works great and is just fun.The character customization is a little boring - but it did not bother me all that much.If you are into hardcore RPG: Play the first Witcher first (it's loooong and has some really bad gamedesign and the controls... what were they thinking?! - but it's worth it) - you can import your savegame into Witcher 2 and the story continues seamlessly.

												This game is a must if you declaring yourself as an RPG fan. I recommend to play the first game too to have better understanding about the story of this game and have a better item in the start of the second game. Oh and the frist game is really great too despite slooooww prologue and a little weird combat. And I personally prefer witcher 1 story rather than the second.Allright first, the story of this game is really awesome. You are Geralt of Rivia. A professional monster slayer that slay monsters for golds. But because of the circumstances you become the personal bodyguard of Temerian King. But because of being too close to the king, like a dog and his master, you are being accused with a crime that you never commit. And here we go the quest to clear your name, or you want to pursue other cause rather than just clearing your name? That's your callThis is a game where choices are really impactful in overall your gaming experience. Your experience will be different from the others depend on what you choose in the game. Even the side quests if you do them in different order, the result conseuqence would be dramatically different too. And the result is not instantly occur after the choice you made. You have to continue your progress to see the how the event unfold to see consequences of your previous choice. So you may think carefully about what would it become before choose rather than just load before the choice and know every consequence it will made.I have to mention too, this game has moral ambiguity, nothing is really good and nothing is really evil. There are no best option with everyone win and peace come to the land with people become loving and understanding each other. Only choices with the good thing and bad thing of their consequences. This game will question how is your moral stand. Just like a real world where people relatively have different standard of what is right and what is wrong. And their different point of view can lead into a bigger clash between others.The gameplay now, well it has some learning curve and dying is not uncommon in this game. Maybe you will died, a lot, in this game despite you are a witcher that possesses superhuman speed and reflex, able to drink potions that would instantly kill a common human, having a silver sword, some magic, and white hair and such. Yes you have those ability, if not you will not able to stand against a dosens of trained soldier afterall, but you are still a mortal. You need to think, prepare, analyze how the enemies' attack pattern, know when is the best to roll dodge or block the attack, utilizing your sign (magic), and also using your items like bombs, potions, and traps. Especially potions. It is not skyrim where potion is not really important at all and you can pause and drink it in the middle of combat. You need to drink before the combat and potion is not some ""guarantee way to win"" or anything like that. It helps, a lot, but the result still heavily depends on how you play. Always remember, a witcher without potions is just a half of the witcher (or whatever it is, I forgot the exact quote)It is a game where you will feel being treated as an adult, the story, the gampelay, the sex (This game has the best sex scene in my entire experience of gaming. MASS EFFECT DIDN'T GIVE US PROPER BOOBIES !!) but some minor issue like tutorial section that don't tell what exactly to do (That mutate ability section, many players stoped playing because they can't figure out the tutorial) inability to change the keybinding, some visual bug. But neverthless, nothing is perfect right?So my score for this game is 9.0 out of 10. A must have if you want a mature, dark, and solid RPG experience with challenging combat that will make kids cry because it's too difficult for them. I suggest you who like this game to play this game at least 2 playthrough to know every story it has. Oh yeah don't forget it has some boobies too. Yeah boobies for the win !!			",37,11,3,4,1,0,1

Brilliant pacing, intrigueing points and actually makes you think hard about possible consequences. Gameplay is satisfying, more challenging then other games of nowadays. Alot of effort was put in it, and the replay value is good cause if you pick a differant side at certain points in the game the story changes entirely.Pretty much a must-have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2 is an epic, mature and tough RPG. I never played the Witcher 1 and just watched some youtube summary, so at the beginning I was a little confused about all characters and the big picture of the story. The moment I found my way into the Witcher universe the story became thrilling with all its twists and choices. The characters have detailed looks, personality and  a nice voice-acting.  Release was in 2011, but the graphics are still impressive and suit the rough medieval european fantasy atmosphere very well. The gamepaly is quite challenging: If you don´t prepare your fights or analyze your opponents to adapt your tactics, you will lose hard even on normal difficulty level. You will come across various beasts and human enemies, which will be cut down with either your silver or steel sword. The use of different magic signs and the skill tree are just the start of the game mechanics. You can uprade your swords, create potions and craft new weapons and armors with the trophies from  fallen enemies.  Maybe the mouse controls could be a little more precise and the 3rd act is quite short compared to act 1 and 2. I really enjoyed the game and I´m looking forward to The Witcher 3. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Astronomically better than the first game. If you're interested in storyline, then I'd suggest reading a plot summary of the first game. The Witcher 1 is incredible considering how good the story is and how large the world is, given the very small budget used to create it, but I would not play it again. Aside from that, the Witcher 1's decisions have such a minor impact on the Witcher 2 that there's no reason to load up a save.The combat mechanics in this game are some of my favorite swordplay mechanics. It's very challenging--particularly on Insane or Dark, where one wrong move in a boss fight, or even in a fight against a large number of mooks, has a good chance of killing you. Insane is truly insane; it's very difficult and when your character dies, the game is over. Your saves are locked. Try again. Don't play it until you've finished the game on another difficulty--there's a high chance you won't survive past the first few levels and will have to play them again. I have been on the final boss fight in insane twice and messed up both times--so many hours lost.The game's graphics are also incredible and it functionally has two different storylines that are intertwined and based on a very important decision early in the game. You really have to play the game twice to get a full picture of what's going on geopolitically around your character--and it's fascinating.The Witcher 2 also maintains the Witcher's morally ambiguous choices. There aren't very many clearly ""good"" or ""evil"" choices; you are forced to choose between the options on the basis of the consequences.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2 is a continuation and a tremendously improved game released by CDPR 3 years after the first Witcher game. The game has everything improved from the Witcher 1. To see all the improvement, from the gameplay to the storytelling, I would recommend playing the Witcher 1 first. This is gonna be another TL;DR review from me:1/ Story: The story continues after the final battle in Witcher 1, Geralt now lives with Triss, still suffering from amnesia. The Witcher 2 continues using the amnesia plot to reinvigorate the story, which creates amazing plot twists and storytelling method. The quest's story, if I am not mistaken from the Witcher 1, continued to be narrated by Dandelion. The story in Witcher 2 has two paths: Iorverth's, the commander of the Elves rebel Scoia'tael and Vernon Roche's, the commander of the Blue Stripes and loyal soldier to King Foltest. Geral will travel with either of the two to find the Kingslayer, Letho to clear Geralt's name and discovers a bigger plot twist. However, for me, the story could have been made a little longer :( The game was so great that I wanted more.Choices DO MATTER A LOT IN THIS GAME. If you have played Witcher 1, you will see some of your choices impact in the Witcher 2, though not that much.The World in The Witcher 2 has a lot of things you can do, which is great, from barber shop, bookshop, inns, swordsmiths, armor shop, potion ingredient shops, a lot :3 you can definitely spend hours in the world without getting bored! But!!!! As with any Witcher game, Money is a huge problem =_= . 2/ Weapons and Armors: The Witcher 2 delivers a massive improvement from the Witcher 1, with new and improved crafting items for weapons and armors. A huge lot of new armors that have different cool look on Geralt of Rivia :3 This is one of the best things I loved to see after Witcher 1. New blade oils, new runes to add to your weapons, and also new enchantments for the armors. Definitely a massive improvement!3/ Combat: A huge difference from the Witcher 1, the combat has beeen improved by CDPR to be more realistic and more dynamic and active. The players can now dodge, swing the swords in light or heavy attacks whenever they want to, making it less.... awkward in the Witcher 1. The new daggers and bombs, together with the critical effect from the weapons and the Signs, do create a perfect combat stimulation for the players. 4/ Leveling up and Meditation: The game offers 3 different branch of playstyles: Mutant - Alchemist, Combat, Magic and 1 basic obligatory initial branch, although the players can actually get all 3 different playstyles in one playthrough ! Each skill can be upgraded twice, having new effects and improvement, creating a variety of playstyle for each player. Meditation system can now be done in most places, a great improvement from the campfire meditation system in The Witcher 1. The game still keeps the traditional Alchemy - Resting - Character leveling up options in Meditation, however, if I am not mistaken, The Witcher 1 allowed the player to drink the potions whenever they want to, but the Witcher 2 only allows that during meditation. 5/ Game saves: The game can import the saves from The Witcher 1, which includes your Armor and your best weapons $_$ Which is a major boosting start for the Witcher 2. I really like the fact that they do import your choices in the first game as well. Some characters from the previous game will recognize you on the way. However, the Witcher 2 suffers from the problem of having too many saves (auto-saves from quests) and unable to delete them easily. Which is a problem, since the players will have to delete them manually, one by one. This is a problem continuing from the Witcher 1. 6/ Mini-games: The Witcher 2 re-introduced Dice Poker - still the same from the Witcher 1, though brutally harder and more difficult, as if the opponents are geniuses with huge luck in poker game - always get the upper hands of probability; Bare hand Fighting - now a quick timing game; and Arm-Wresting - a super hard game that will make you reload every time just to win it, especially in the final Numa arm wrestling match, you gotta try to win it first try, without accusing him of anything to get 15% damage perk, this is something not many people know. But, in overall, the Witcher 2 is a major success and a great game, a must-have in any Witcher fan's collection. Having played this game really hyped me up for the Witcher 3 game, I hope to see what impact my choices in The Witcher 2 will have on The Witcher 3 so much.  The OVERALL SCORE , to me, is 9.5/10 (-0.5 because of the money problem and also because of the mini games and the saves). However, I gave that -0.5 because those problems are trivial and still can be handled , though not with ease. And also for one IMPORTANT THING: THERE IS NO NEW GAME + IN THIS GAME, which you won't get to taste much of your two sweet swords in the end game..... #sadI finished the game on Hard first playthrough. Definitely a great but brutal experience when it comes to combat ! :3 but that's how the game should be played for me.			",129,17,2,20,6,0,9

												Oh This game is smth new, some time ago I saw a review, the author said it was too complicated for him to play,especially combat. So what I want to say, that don't trust anyone, Witcher game is better project, than Skyrim (not in open spaces) and assassin's creed!Every mission is unic and never repeted again in the games (not the poker=) ), every town have it's own problem and it's landscape, as I said never repeated again!So in conclusion: If you have free money or money you would spend on games, this game is the right choice!!!

												This game is fantastic.  It doesn't treat you like a ♥♥♥♥♥ and constantly remind you what buttons do what.  It treats you like an adult.  There is a mature story here, and choices you are faced with often show you there is no absolute good or evil.  Combat is love or hate, which I love.  This campaign ranks among God of war 1 and 2's campaigns, and MGS 3's campaign as my favorite campaigns.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Apart from some early Bioware titles, i have never been quite so hooked to a game series as i have been to the first two Witcher titles. Immersion is what gives this series, in my humble opinion, the edge over its contemporaries. By not being open world, the Assassins of Kings can focus primarily on its compelling central story line. Open worlds provide you with 'options' but risk not being able to make you care enough about any one thing. The most recent Elder Scrolls for example have had pretty lacklustre main storylines. Other games such as Kingdom of Amalur fall into the trap of giving the player too many, and repetitive tasks.In other words the Witcher 2 plays a very nice balance between freedom and narrative.The world and its lore is incredible and worth immersing yourself in, BUT, if you don't read the Sapkowski novels or play the previous game you risk becoming bewildered quickly. Crafting, levelling, gear accumulation, are all satisfying and add a lot to the depth.There are alternative story paths you will only get to see by playing multiple times, meaning there is great replay value in this; you get to see the result of your choices, either from the first game, or in an early chapter of this game, in what happens later on. for the RPG fan this is very satisfying. No environments are recycled a la Dragon Age 2.So, any caveats with this game?Yes, Combat. it's not such a black and white case of poor combat in the way that Dragon Age 2 was, but, it can be very frustrating. A lot of the time what you really crave is a good duel, one on one (or one versus two) swordfight. Ocasionally, you will have extremely satisfying and rewarding fights with parrying, dodging, the whole shebang. But most of the time especially in the early game it's hard to survive without spamming the 'roll' key, the result being that Geralt launches himself to and fro like a lunatic. With parrying fairly ineffectual before you level up damage reduction and with many enemies invulnerable from the front, you will be reduced to rolling behind them and slashing he/she/they/it from behind. It can feel disappointing when the game forces you to win by these unsatisfying means.However, combat can still look a treat, like the rest of the game, and this is no reason not to buy such a well executed game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a wonderful game continuing the story of Geralt of Rivia. My favourite aspect of the game is how wholesome and real the characters feel. Never have I laughed out loud so much playing a game, and that is thanks to some of the amazing quotes from Geralt and co. I would even say playing the game through to completion the second time is better than the first, because I made completely different decisions to my first run through, and i discovered completely different parts of the story I hadn't seen first time though. This game is all about choice, and your choices and past greatly affect the outcomes of the story, even more so than the previous installment in the series. Another aspect I really liked was that I could link my saved game from the previous Witcher game to this one, so that the important decisions I made in the last game carried over into this one - sometimes my past haunted me! The combat has greatly improved in this installment and I enjoy nothing more the running and killing some beastie of bandit with the wonderful sound as my blade cuts a few organs. The game can also be quite complex, juggling potions, oils, armour upgrades, traps and magic as well as Geralt's swords, which I only properly appreciated on the second run through on a higher difficulty, where you really have to use them all. The decisions in the game are really difficult, it can be really hard to tell who are the liars and who are telling the truth - on many occasions I got caught out. Hence playing it twice through makes it all the more interesting! Overall, a colourful, wonderful, beautiful game that makes me want to read the books it is based on, at least to see if my decisions were the ones Geralt actually makes!			",60,7,3,14,12,0,11

												if you ever thought that fairytales and fantasy creatures are just for kids then you didnt have the chance to take a glimpse of the world of the witcher where power corrupted politics meet dangerous bloodthirsty creatures.The witcher is an rpg game franchise with characters based on short story collections that later became a saga of novels writen by a polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski.Cd projekt red is the team that took this fantasy world into the pc.The story is about a witcher named geralt of rivia.Witchers are mercenaries,hunters of mythical beasts hired even by kings.In the second part of the saga, the kings of the north are slayed by mercenaries and one of them in front of geralt who is accused of the murder as he was found alone with the dead body of the king.The tale starts as he is trying to clear his name by finding and killing the murderer.                   The visual design of the game is plus moderate compared to 2014 games as when it was published was on the top of the rpg games.The lanscapes, the cities, the alleys, models everything on it made me feel as i was part of a graphic novel, living, breathing in it.The game as a whole made me explore every alley of it remembering every path of the map by heart. It resembles the fable saga in a significantly darker tone in a cruel world with nudity and teriffying creatures.                   It worked in general on high frames except the third act where i found it drop at 15-20 frames.It is still a heavy game.Ι also want to point that there is no support for 2560-1080 screens.I used the flawless widescreen app to play it on full screen.                  It took me 35 hours to clear the game but without some sidequests that i missed as it was my original first gameplay, so i think that it provides  38-40 hours of playtime. Surviving in this world depends not only on your sword skills nor your magic skills but as a combinbation of everything that is provided. I discovered that on the hard way as i died again and again on the first hours. I saw the game-over screen many times, the loading screen is the fastest i have ever seen and after finishing the evil within it was like paradise. Runes ,enchantments,oils,poisons,potions traps everything are essential for survival. I found myself using everythimg on my disposal for the first time.Υou dont play a witcher ,the game is made to make you feel that you are one and acting as one .The inventory menu needs some improvement though. Magic is just for support dont expect to make a mage character. Αs for the sword fight, is immersive but with some problems when it comes to multi-fights.       Closing this review i want to add that choices does matter on this one and depending on what you choose, you affect politics and play different quests.So it provides different gameplay build everytime.Plus you can import your witcher 1 save and depending on your inventory and your story path you acquire some swords and coins on your witcher 2 start and in a few occusions it affects the game but dont except really big changes.Have fun !!!mediun to high hardware :sapphire r9 280x toxicintel celeron G1620  2,70 ghz6gb ramsandisk  ultra ii ssd 120gb sata3lg 29um65-prunning on windows 8.1maxxed out+     1)  wonderful visuals even compared to 2014 games+     2)  resourceful  type of combat +     3)  choice-consequences system+     4)  great videos and multiple ways of storytelling-      1) the story doesnt feel adequate enough, needs more depth-      2) doesnt support ultrawide screens			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very good game if you enjoy deep story telling and fun combat. The game is very difficult especially if you think you can just go into combat spamming quick attack. Combat instead is very tactical, you must prepare ahead of time with potions and knowledge then use dodging, parrying, signs and light and heavy attacks to defeat your foes. There are three leveling paths that will decide your play style.Overall the game is very good and an enjoyable experience desite the crap saving and loading screen after you die.

												This is probably my weakest recommendation for a game to date. The story is this game's saving grace. It has kept me interested with plenty of intrigue, likable characters, well written dialouge, and real consequences for choices. However the gameplay is trash. I have never felt like a witcher once while playing this game. Unless witchers go through all those mutations and years of training made them experts at kiting enemies, taking one swing then rolling away. The challenge of enemies in the first witcher came from not understanding them, you could then take time to study them and learn how to defeat them. In this the challenge never seems genuine. The game doesn't reward hard work, learning your enemies weakness, then exploiting it; it only rewards patience. Do you have the patience to slowly chip away at this boss or that group of enemies while kiting them around the area? Watch a LP or a let's Watch if you don't want to have to supress the urge to uninstall the game. Once again, the story parts of this game are phenomenal A+, gameplay gets a D-.			",119,17,1,17,4,2,6

												The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is a fantastic, epic spanning RPG, worthy of any PC Gamer’s eye.  Although the game is not without its fair share of technical blemishes Witcher 2 delivers a powerful punch to the player from the moment they click “Play”.  The atmosphere delivered in this title is very engrossing, and as such, Witcher 2 is able to pull the player in and never let go.  The graphics are superb, the art direction is creative and eye catching, and the writing is well delivered, never failing to entrench the player within the game’s vigorously delivered atmosphere.  Although challenging, The Witcher 2 is quite rewarding, delivering an experience like none other.  Most modern RPGs provide the player with two extremes, either absolutely satanic, or non-arguably angelic, and while these games tout their “you write your own story” technique, they fail in delivery.  This is where the Witcher 2 absolutely nails it.  I highly recommend this title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Brilliant bit of RPG. Not overly linear. Your actions do have an impact on the ending. The tutorial stage is a must as it leads you through the main game elements as part of your backstory. While the sword combat is intuitive, the use of Signs is not. The side quests and mini games are an interesting distraction but completing them can make things easier in the long run, especially the armour and weapon schemas.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was amazing with a TRULY GREAT STORY. 92/100. Absolute definitely replayability with two major story arcs and many minor ones.It is Skyrim-like with action-RPG elements, but it is definitely not a true open-world game like Skyrim or The Witcher 3. You have pretty large areas for each chapter of the game and it works fantastically with all of the quests. I love the way that quests have multiple ways to resolve them and quests affect each other in a variety of ways. You actually need to listen (all voiced) and read the quest dialogue. This is not click-click-MMO quest type, thankfully!The combat is solid for action RPG but not perfect. I played with both mouse+keyboard and a PS4 controller. I preferred the controller by a long shot but the M+KB was definitely playable and I have seen opinions supporting both.The graphics are astonishing. If you have the card to handle it (r9 290/290x or 780/780ti) you will want to max it out AND edit the .ini file to increase view distances. Pop-in was not present at all when I did this, and distant objects were crisp and lush. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off way way way way too many cutscenes. Be prepared for a lot of cutscenes leading to loading screens followed by another cutscene. Graphics are a +, lots of lovely textures in this game and a cool art style to boot.Casting magic spells in the middle of a sword fight is fun but unfortunately the spells and magic feel dull. The ai can be stupidly difficult at times and then extremely dumb.Not a fan of the contrast the main character has with the people and world around him. He seems out of place but not in a cool way. Overall an enjoyable and occasionally challenging RPG.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gameplay: Combat is extremely well done, allowing for various different approaches in each situation. Similarly, conversations  always have interesting dialogue trees.Story: The story is akin to that of the 'A Song of Ice and Fire' book series, rich, incredibly detailed and expertly written.Graphics: The graphics in this game are amazing, they really bring the world and its various inhabitants to life and help to deeply immerse you.Sound: Most, if not all of the sound effects sound like something out of a high-quality fantasy movie, such as Lord of the Rings and dialogue is also spoken by clearly skilled actors.Re-playability: There are many different choices throughout the game and multiple playthroughs are required to experience all of the consequences.

												Much of what I said in my review of the first Witcher game will still apply here.  That being said, you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't start with the first game.  But, that's my opinion and it is subjective.Once again we find ourselves in the boots of the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia.  They are much shinier and detailed than before. Also, I think my pants are tighter.The story is still amazing, the characters are life like and reek of complexity.  I found myself, on more than one occasion, staring at my screen trying to make a decision that I knew was going to effect everything going forward.  The Npc's in the towns and so forth could use more material. I get it, you're upset you got syphilis from a ♥♥♥♥♥, but I don't need to hear it everytime I run past you.While the areas you are adventuring in are not massive, after running back and forth 5 or 6 times it feels rather large.The world looks great, from lush forests to open fields, towering mountains, bloody battlegrounds and dirty ♥♥♥♥♥houses.All the different characters style and facial construction from the first game have been updated and I feel it better shows their personalities. Oh, and hairstyles, you have a few choices.  I tried them all, but Geralt's standard Witcher cut fits best.I found the music to be buggy at times and kind of hang on the same three notes over and over.  A quick f5 then f9 solved the issue. I can overlook this issue because the soundtrack fits the game world so well.I don't feel as though the sex and violence overshadows the development of the story at all.  In fact, I think it fits well and was executed just fine.  It's a violent time and people like to get laid, it happens.Combat has been somewhat redone to be more fluid and enjoyable, still very clicky, but in more of a mash kind of way.  I don't dislike it at all.  Dodging and rolling around just feels better than the first game. And although I didn't use a single bomb or trap after the tutorial, having them equipped in quickslots(called pockets, heh) allows you to use them quickly. It seems like a nice touch. The changes to how potions and meditation work feels well thought out as well.  Not being able to use pots during a fight puts it on the players to be prepared for the road ahead.  But, you can meditate pretty much anywhere you want(unlike the first game where you needed a campfire).Now it's time for me to continue my chase of the Wild Hunt.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A gritty, sophisticated, and intelligent adventure RPG.I'm not usually into the genre, but this grabbed me, and held my attantion, and still does. The Witcher 2 throws you right into the heart of momentous events that have gravity, and you're instantly made an integral part of the game from the very start.I felt drawn into the Witcher world, and involved in a way that I don't often experience with games.The game is also unforgiving. It's not infuriating, at least I didn't think so, but it's demanding in that you actually need to use combat tactics in real time.You have to dodge and evade attacks, block, parry, and riposte. Dangerous/malicious forest creatures can kill you quite easily if you try a hack-and-slash approach. You have to put some forethought into the items you take along.It's also a visually stimulating game. The design is oh so intricate!...The only downside to this amazing game is that it's quite demanding in terms of hardware.At the time of posting this review, I'm running it on an end of 2009 model laptop, with one of the core2 duo chips from just prior to the i-series release. It barely meets specs.It's still very playable, but far from seamless. Other than a good processor, you'll need a decent graphic card. I have an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4650 1GB, and it runs.It's hard to find that out if you're trawling through forums and query-posts, but it runs. Laptop version too, so less powerful.One of the more engaging games I've played for a good while now, and complete fun. A joy to play and to look at, 9/10.(Only for the high hardware requirements meaning you really need a top end system to bring out it's full potential.)Well worth it, especially at steam's almost obscenely cheap discount-sale price!

												This is a mature dark fantasy game with rich lore and adult themes. The first game had a rhythm-based combat system where you would click the attack button in time to perform successive attacks in sequence. This game drops that and goes for a more traditional combat system that utilizes slow-heavy attacks and light-fast attacks. Both games are forerunners in combat animation but there's a certain meatiness to the combat in The Witcher 2, you can really feel the blows that land on your opponents. It takes about 40 hours to get through one playthrough of the story, but the large choices that you have to make throughout the story have lasting consequences in shaping the world and lend heavy replay value to this game. The only thing that would make this game more interesting to me is if the developers put time into designing an investigation system into the game, which makes you dig into the lore of the world a bit more in order to solve problems.

												Well, in comparison to DA i think it's a bit linear and short. I finished the game in 35 hours and I wasn't rushing, finished almost all of the side quests too.To be honest I'm a bit disappointed... First chapter was okay, and the krayen fight awesome. But you know what? That was the only difficult fight in the game. Then the second chapter felt very rushed with little sidequests and no balance between these. The last chapter was the shortest and none of the fights were dificcult or had a momentum building up to them.The crafting system was a joke. I think I sold most of the things I got. There was no lore regarding alchemy, as one would expect, and even potions were just a mattar of putting what you had in your backpack together. None of the potions made you want to look for ingredients, I didn't feel like a witcher.I wish the GDs had put as much thought in the whole gamming and world system as they put in all the unecessary sex scenes.That is all.6.5/10  ",19,12,0,10,0,0,0

												Now, you're probably not going to trust this review since I've only got a few hours clocked into the game. But let me be clear: Due to my horrible internet, the game took 2 days to download. My laptop gets a full cardio workout whenever I boot up the game, starts to overheat, and will probably eventually leave burn scars on my legs or the table. But there are: Boobs, great combat, varied environments, believable characters, nudity, lots of monsters, lots of loot, a compelling story, and did I mention the boobs? Sure, it's a big download, but you will definitely not be disappointed. One of my friends saw me playing this, and he instantly claimed that Skyrim was better.

												Witcher 2 is all about good history and music, epic ambience and awesome graphics.I'd seen several comparisons with Skyrim and those are not accurate since we're comparing a game which history is driven by chapters (Witcher) with an Open World one (Skyrim). If you play the game NOT expecting a open world game it will be fun enough :)Although the graphics are outstanding, currently it doesnt demands a top video card (NVIDIA GTS 450 here) and I could play the game with HIGH settings and customized it  just not enabling Ubersampling. My fps was over 40 all game long.The game can be hard as hell some times, you certainly need to master combat if you want to suceed. I'm totally recommending this game... unless you heart can't handle a pretty good adventure (with nude ladies everywhere - me gusta!)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is truly a master piece. It's writing is superb, the combat is fun, the graphics are gorgeous and the world let's you immerse.The Witcher 2 is finally a game, that doesn't just throw a quest arrow in your face. You can't finish the game by exclusively looking at the mini-map (I'm looking at you, Skyrim). No, you need to do your research on monsters and events, talk to people and draw you own conclusions, solve a few riddles, learn about the lore to give the correct answers in dialogues.If you are interested, I recommend you suffer through the first game. Yes, the combat controls suck but the story is worth it. I also enjoyed the books quite a lot. There is a whole new universe to discover.It is also a game that is not for the faint of heart.♥♥♥♥♥♥ murder, betrayal, frequent cursing are often occurring themes that make this a title suited for a mature audience.Overall, this is an RPG you shouldn't miss.

												Probably the most underrated CRPG out there. This game is a gemstone that stands as an example to traditional role playing game developing companies like Bethesda and Bioware. It's been developed by a Polish game company named CDProjekt with no desire to be a part of today's competitive capitalist game industry. A lot of time and effort was spent in creating this game as it's a well polished, very original rpg unlike many unripe games we see today. It takes place in a fantasy world where three northern kingdoms, Temeria, Redenia, Kaedwen (and previously Aedirn) deal with internal turmoils as a mysterious assassin begins to collect crowned heads as in south, expantionist Nilfgaardian Empire stands ready. Also, a resistance guerilla force including non-humans called Scoi'tel emerges to fight for the oppressed and the protagonist, Geralt of Rivia finds himself in the middle of the conflict.The atmosphere of the environments are truly amazing thanks to stunning visuals and beautiful background soundtrack. Instead of wandering through one vast geographical area like the one in Skyrim, The Witcher 2 takes place in 3 different regions and the player allowed and encouraged to explore each one in all three chapters, Temerian village of Flotsam next to a swamp-forest, Dwarven city of Vergen on top of the Blue Mountains and finally the ancient city of Loc Muinne, now in ruins.The game's combat system is rather old-school and takes time to get used to it. Once getting familiar with it however, you will see how fun it is. You carry two swords, a steel one for humanoids and a silver one for monsters. Gerald posseses 5 magical abilites called 'Signs' allowing you to stun, ignite, trap, convert enemies along with providing protection. Alchemy system allows you to craft potions and swords oils giving you various advantages, but you need to use them ""before"" the battle, not during! As Geralt finishes quests, contracts and kills monsters he levels up, providing skill points to spend in TW2's vast skill tree. Since you cannot unlock all nodes in the skill tree, you need to customize your character in Magic, Melee and Alchemy.To sum up, if you call yourself a rpg person, you should definetly play this game. The first game of the installement is said to be very problematic but no worries, you can start of the series directly with TW2 as i did. The lore and role playing elements are well thought and captivating, encouraging you to do more than one playthroughs. It's a very cheap game for its quality. Have fun and remember, you never trust sorceresses ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow!!!! If you're a fan of the Mass Effect story structure, or just being able to make choices that matter in a game, then this is the game for you!The story is great, although it may seem a little political at first, it's not the only thing going on but the story continues to get juicier, especially towards the endThe gameplay takes a little getting used to, it may be a little frustrating at first ( I suggest starting in easy mode as you'll want to play this game again anyway) but if you stick with it, all will be clear to you. It is a satisfying and strategic gameplay without being slow or cumbersome like in the first game.All in all, a great story, AMAZING writing, you'll efinitely get more than a few laughs, great and fun gameplay, AND plenty to do in terms of side quests. The game lasts a healthy 29 to 38 hours.Enjoy!!			",137,11,3,12,3,0,1

												By far one of the best RPGs I have played in a while.  The story is very captivating and the graphics are exceptionally pleasing.  (I won't mention all the other eye candy here) The almost seamless transitions between indoor / outdoor / caverns is very nice.  The only drawback I would list to this game, is that the world is not ""open"" enough.  True you can go do just about anything you want during a certain time in a chapter, but once you move on past that chapter, you can't go back to a previously visited area.  Aside from that, I love the aspect that many of your decisions change the course of the game, and you can play it differently each time, with differing outcomes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are many game series I came late into, and the second installment is usually a good indicator of what the development team behind a series is like in regards to how they feel about their game. The console oriented approach of CDPR may have raised some eyebrows back when it was new information, and with catastrapohes such as Dragon Age 2 it's understandable to be apprehensive of what is generally seen as a focus on console in order to create more mass appeal and thus sell more copies, regardless of the quality of the game. People first assumed this was the case with CDPR and The Witcher 2, that the devs of a deep (if mechanically lacking) RPG based on a niche series of stories by a Polish author based on Slavic mythology had sold out to push more copies and make more money.Whilst that goal is pretty much universal across game developers and companies in general, you need only play the Witcher 2 for a few minutes to see for yourself that it is not what drove the developers to make the game they did.It cannot be said that The Witcher 2 is not flawed, it has difficulty with basic things such as inventory management being time-consuming and non-combat movement being janky, and numerous geometry issues in certain areas across the game. Where the game is successful however, is in it's design of location, character, story and monsters that make it interesting, and the brutal conviction with which it conveys to you all of this that makes it a game that is all to easy to get completely enthralled in, with plenty to do and plenty more ways to do them.

												One of my favorite RPG games of all time!With the much anticipated Witcher 3 I decided it was time to buy this one and play it as you can import your W2 save file into the W3. As far as this game goes, it is challenging but quite fun, with your choices actually having an impact on the game and leading you to different places and quests that you wouldn't have be able to do had you made a different choice really leads you wanting to play it again to see what would have happened. It does take a bit to get used to with setting traps and using various signs but once you get the hang of it, it quickly becomes second nature to you. I went through it on DARK mode, not for the feint of heart btw, and it was incredibly hard but really enjoyable with trying to craft the special sets of gear that you can get to make it so you don't die in two hits. The game itself is very beautiful, engaging, and sexy with plenty to do and explore, had sex with a succubus 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Seriously, this game is incredible. There are almost no issues with it.Pros:+ Massive, and I mean MASSIVE game world+ Because it's based on a series of equally brilliant novels, the story and the depth of the world could go toe-to-toe with LotR, and it makes TES look like Minecraft+ Smooth gameplay, very fluid controls and combat+ Incredible graphics+ Runs perfect frame-rates, provided you have the sufficient hardware, and almost never crashes (Windows 8 has some issues though)+ Literally hundreds of hours of quests and side-missions+ Brilliant animation and voice acting+ More like an RPG than a lot of RPGs, even though this technically isn't an RPG; combinations of spells, weapons, traps, and allies make it feel almot as if Geralt isn't a pre-set character.+ Soundtrack is mesmerising and very fittingCons:- Menus and inventory a little clunky- Map needs some work- Can have random difficulty spikes, and times where you have absolutely no idea how to progress with very little help from the gameBuy this game. Just do it. You will not regret it.			",145,16,0,15,9,1,4

												The Witcher 2 has very comprehensive story and deep combat system. The game's difficulty levels allow the player to decide just how deep the combat gets. You should definitely consider playing the game on easy, as it is only in the later chapters do you begin to understand the mechanics.Only down side, is that you won't be able to play this with a mouse & keyboard in any meaningful way. I'd highly suggest using a controler.8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: July 13, 2014
												Overview: The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is a fantasy RPG set in a medieval landscape.  The player controls Geralt of Rivia as he trys to uncover the truth behind the events that take place in the beginning of the game.  An expansive story awaits and is effected by the player's actions.  The choices you make really will effect the outcome of events.  Pros: A great and detailed story.  The story is definitely the best aspect of this game.  There are a lot of important characters throughout the game who will shape events as they unfold.  Content.  There is a lot of content here.  Each area has a few side quests in addition to the main story quests.  Even if you just stick to the main quests, the story will take you around 30 hours.  Crafting is also available and can take a considerable amount of time.  If you want a break from the main game, an arena area is available with leaderboards.Cons:Crafting.  Don't bother trying to craft that really awesome armor set the vendor is selling.  For one, you will probably never get the money to even buy all the recipes.  If you do manage that, it can be quite time consuming to gather all the leather.  Each armor set comes with a sword recipe for your regular and silver sword.  The swords are the worst part of this crafted set.  They are really awesome for the current area, but require you to have the complete set equiped to use.  Each time you move to a new area in the game, the previous armor set recipes become unavailable.  So, if you spent time just crafting the swords and move to the next area, all that time and resources are now gone.  Crafting armor pieces can be pointless as better or equivalent items can be found by simply thoroughly exploring the area or gambling with random NPCs.  Other than potions and enhancements, crafting is just a waste of time.Combat.  Although Geralt has access to a few spells in addition to swords, the combat is rather simple.  You can easily play the entire game just slashing as fast as you can and dodging away.  You can parry your opponent by waiting for them to attack, but this locks your character in place and is not advisable when taking on multiple opponents.  Since basically every fight has you facing multiple opponents, parrying can leave you open.  Story Presentation.  The story is pretty good, but sometimes it is not presented very well.  The player mainly controls Geralt but at times will very briefly control a side character.  This can happen at random times and can be better handled by just showing a cut scene.Tech Issues.  The audio in the game is all over the place.  Sometimes character dialog will be very loud and other times a wisper.  I also did not care for the narrator's voice when transitioning to new areas.  When I had a lot of saves the game would continually crash when trying to load.  Level Design.  The world consist of mainly tight corridors with very little open space.  It would have been nice to have more room to roam around.Conclusion:The Witcher 2 presents a great story in a not so great way.  The levels feel claustrophobic, the combat can be very simple, and the crafting can be pointless.  If you put that aside, this is still a pretty good game.  There is a deep story here that can be guided by the player.  If you haven't played a serious RPG in awhile and are looking for something decent, play this.Score: 8.1 / 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game in the first place just to get the full story before Witcher 3... Man, if I knew it was that good, I would buy a powerful PC on its release date. This is by far the best RPG that I've ever played. Till now, I thought that Dragon Age I was good, but in comparison it was just a child play. Witcher 2 is a masterpiece that remains an AAA game, even in 2016. Buy it, complete it and build an altar. Score 9/10pros:- the story progresses based on your choices (2 variants of Act II and 16 combinations for the ending)- graphics (WOW!) and cinematics- combat - gamepad support and possibility to disable QTE- interesting characters - Roche, Letho- dialogs and voice acting (for Polish  - it is sublime)- interesting quests- scalecons:- relatively uninteresting Act III- some puzzles with candles/fires/runes- lots of useless equipment (e.g. swords that are worth nothing - you get multiple good ones almost at once)- by careless alhemy, you can use up one of the rare items used for finishing a side-quest			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher is one of my favourite game series of all time and CD Projekt Red somehow managed to make an even better game than the first, keeping true to the books the game is based on the games takes you through a very mature, unique, fun and challenging experience that IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. However most of the difficulty in Witcher 2 comes from the very steep learning curve similar to the first game. The many branching storylines that unfold based on the players choice also give a huge amount of replayablity to the game, the branches aren't minor choices they are major and greatly affect how the rest of the game plays out.If you were a fan of the first game I would defiantly get this by the way. This game gets a 10/10 from me it was amazing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Buy This Game Now! It is amazing, from start to finish. It’s a lot better than The Witcher 1, but also more linear and quite a bit shorter. I conquered it in 20.5 hours on a mixture of easy and normal difficulty. The graphics are stunning, and the story/plot does a superb job at drawing you into the fantasy universe. The characters are all very interesting and most of them get their personalities and backstories developed as you battle your way through the acts/chapters. It’s ending sets up for a sequel but ensures that you’re satisfied by clearing up and explaining almost every major mystery. The Witcher 2: 9.0 / 10.0			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had originally played “The Witcher 2” on the X360 and now replaying it again in anticipation of “The Witcher 3”. I got to say after coming out in 2011 it still holds up. Here’s the skinny:•	It has incredible visuals with the environment, character/enemy designs and textures being incredible eye-catchers that will have you wanting to play on the highest settings you can get.•	If you love RPGs you will love this game. It is not as large as Skyrim but because of that the details are much finer and better. It has extensive level up systems, crafting, equipment and combat varieties that I believe are essential in RPG gameplay.•	The combat overall is strategic, if you try to brute force your way it may take you several deaths and tries to progress. You will need to make use of all resources•	The story is incredible with your different choices in game that will results in a variety of endings for this game. But to see if our choices will have true impact we will have to wait for “The Witcher 3” to come out and see if our imported “Witcher 2” files will do any impact on the story or just carry over character upgrades.•	It is dense with content and will give you a considerable amount of hours of entertainment.This game with its dense gameplay, in-depth story and incredible visuals and it fun factor earn it a 10/10.  A game that is truly worth buying and increases my anticipation and excitement for the Witcher 3” and the conclusion to Geralt’s masterfully made adventure from CD Project Red. ",74,28,0,22,3,0,1

												So I originally bought this game back in 2011 when it came out. Suffered through the many patches and changes and even noticed the missions that were removed.  I recently bought it on steam(for those wanting to use a trainer I tried a fling 3.3 and it works currently) when it was on sale just to have a steam copy. I've completed it more times than I can remember and still think its an awesome game.Tech side: Don't even begin to believe the scaled down recommended specs given. Here's a link to a detailed bench test from 2011-12 that will give you an idea of what this game really needs: http://www.techspot.com/review/405-the-witcher-2-performance/page3.htmlI've played this on many different system configurations and can tell you that if you want to max the game and card settings you will need some serious hardware. My current setup (2 gigabyte g1 970's in SLI, 4930 Hex Core see profile to see rest) has been tested w/ all game settings maxed(including ubersampling) and all Nvidia settings maxed. Here's the results:2D 1080p avg 110-120fps            3D 1080p avg 40-55 fps       4k(3860x2160 for correct aspect ratio) 35-45 fpsPlaying at 4k does look beautiful but the 3D is one of the best I have ever seen. In 3D there is so much depth and occasional pop that it really sets the bar for 3D gaming. There's still occasional ghosting but its pretty minor. I imagine a single GTX960-970 will give favorable 2D 1080P experience but you will need some kind of dual gpu if you want to max it all. It is a DX9  game but possibly one of the best looking ones when maxed although if you lower the gamma it still has a bit of a 'cartoon' look but there's still a lot of detail in most textures.The game itself: It's not a true open world but each level or area is pretty expansive. It is a linear story but there are many, many choices to be made and some will impact immediately while other consequences only  occur later. I forget exactly how many different endings there are but I've experienced about 5 or 6. It can be a fun world to explore. This game does have many similarities to game of thrones so fans of those books/shows may enjoy it. And on that note, this is NOT a game for young children.I totally recommend this game to anyone who likes RPG's, even more so if you want a great 3d experience or 4k. It's a game that technology is still catching up to and has considerable replay factors.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An extremely engrossing action RPG with great combat and a detailed, lived in world. Well written branching dialogue, a game not afraid to block out massive sections of the game due to your choices - your actions drastically shape the game. A dark and gritty, mature, intelligent production. Well worth a look			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fanstastic altough it feels short. The controls are really clunky feeling at first for M&K at first so if you have a controler i'd try that if you have lots of trouble with contols  (i only use M&K for i don't own a controller and once i get used to it M&K were great just a little shaky at first). The story is fantastic (i'd highly reccemend the 1st game too because you have plot decitions and a few item carry overs like in mass effect). i've enjoyed the story so much that this is a game that i will definitly replay thourgh (somthing i don't do often) to see what happens if i side with the bluestripes rather then sco'itel Combat is difficult. Learn your signs early on and what they do it well help a lot. Set traps use everything at your disposial. You have to plan out the battle before or during the fight elst you will die a lot i have died countless times to the same boss and group of monsters cause i was not prepared. biggest tip i can give you guys is when all else fails dodgeroll like a manic till an opening presents itself (usally a well placed yerdan ar a good arrd sign) i would reccemend the two skill points per level mod when playing this so that you have more options per level but don't come ommensly OP.Thanks for reading this is pobably one of the best games i've ever played			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent mature RPG with great story, fine combat system, lovable characters, amazing engine with ""sweet bugs"" and beautiful graphics, epic music, interesting choises, and awesome gameplay.Now, I love this game, but something is left to be desired in terms of that epic true old school parts that adorn the orginal Witcher. Although it is awesome game, I somehow feel that developers concentrated more on engine and technical stuff, than they did one story and choises like in the original one. But nevertheless, you should not miss this game. Go buy it, now...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the second adventure of Geralt of Rivia, and it really is a magnificent sequel and a darn good RPG.What are the biggest changes between this and Witcher 1? Well, first there's the visuals - everything's gorgeous now, and Zoltan no longer has a bizarre unfocused look in his eyes that makes him seem permanently stoned. I spent a ton of time just panning the camera around taking in all the scenery, and I was only playing this on LOW settings. Control-wise, the combat system has been revamped. It's still occasionally clunky when it comes to switching between Witcher signs/bombs/traps, but this awkwardness eventually goes away after a few hours of play. Overall, everything feels more natural (when played with a controller) and skill-based than the clicky combat of the first game. The different stances are out and now it's action-orientated, and you've got to roll around a lot and dodge blows with precision. The game is tough at first because Geralt starts as a weakling compared to his foes, and the in-game tutorial does a pretty crap job of explaining the combat, so try the game out on Easy or Normal difficulty first until you get the hang of things and level up Geralt to non-weakling status. (Use the Quen sign as much as possible and try specializing in Swordmaster skills like roll and block if you're having trouble in the beginning.) Normal difficult in the Witcher 2 = hard difficulty in a lot of other games, so be aware.And then there's the story. The plot in Witcher 1 occasionally seemed like it was rehashing the most memorable of Geralt's adventures from the novels with some odd discrepancies; ie: Triss' personality was more like Yennefer's than anything else. Witcher 2 fixes this by making the characters more in line with their book counterparts and crafting a story that is very political and seems like a natural extension of the books rather than a ""best of"" compilation. The kings of the Northern Kingdoms are being killed by assailants from a forgotten Witcher school, and much of Chapters 2 and 3 focus on the importance of the Pontar Valley, an area that borders the more notable kingdoms in Geralt's world. A lot of names are dropped and places referenced, which can be confusing to newbies that haven't read the books or played the first game, so referring to the in-menu Journal is a must. Lore fanatics will eat this up; impatient players perhaps not as much.As long as you've got time and patience, the Witcher 2 will eat up many, many hours of your life. Best of all, this is one of the few games I know of that's really worth replaying - a critical decision at the end of Chapter 1 will COMPLETELY change Chapters 2 and 3 for you. Lengthy RPGs are usually low on the replay list for me...but I'm planning on a completely new playthrough on Hard difficulty just to check out Iorveth's path, so that's saying something.

												Definitely an improvement on the first in most respects, however, combat can be a little spam-y and rather easy, and the game feels much shorter with a lot less to explore.  The engine is more up to date, again holding up well, and the choice options really allow unique gameplay for everyone.  Still as good as the first game, and again one of my favourite games.

												Witcher 2 is an RPG like no other that caters to the most mature and serious players in the genre. With absolutely zero hand holding and possibly the best cinematic storytelling I've ever seen, the game provides an experience like no other. When you play this game, you will never see halos or devil horns telling you whether the decisions you make are ""good"" or ""evil"". The game simply presents choices and consequences, so it is ultimately up to the player to decide what path they decide to take, and quite often the the lines between what is right and wrong can become muddled and even downright inconclusive to the player, making for some extremely thought-provoking scenarios and questlines. This is bolstered by the fact that the game has dozens of major choices throughout that, with each, will have a significant impact on the story, making for so many ways to play through the game.As I mentioned, the game will almost never hold your hand. This means you will not have waypoints all over your screen telling you exactly where to go constantly. Often times, when undertaking quests, you will need to read over your journal or revisit certain characters to obtain information on where to go or what to do next, and use your intuition along the way. This type of approach gives almost the whole game the feeling of a challenge, rather than just a mundane routine. This along with other things can easily put off several people from this game who are looking for a more casual experience, as it is definitely a game for people who like to think and analyze. Possibly the biggest offput for some people may be the tutorial that the game starts off with, as it is quite bad. Getting used to the combat and inventory systems(which is also not the best at times) can be difficult, but if you can overcome that you are in for an amazing experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played the pirated version back when it was released. Back when most computers couldn't run it properly (Crysis anyone?), and just absolutely had to buy it, because CD Projekt deserved my money from the start.The game looks great, has very good voice acting, that adds a lot of immersion. The story is obviously fantastic if you kept up with W1. The battle system is opposite of that of Witcher 3, which decided to make things as simple as possible. This one had some cumbersome mechanics, like resting to use potions and buffs, and a unbalanced damage multiplier, I.E dudes are able to one shot you constantly and you have to rely on Quen more than ever.It has different endings, that affect W3 strongly, bosses were fun to fight. It could've been longer, but CD was a fairly small team back then, and we can say that they more than made up content-wise, with W3!Must play for RPG fans. I had a ton of fun raging through Insane mode.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A witcher is a non-human race, Which was originated mainly to slaughter monsters. at the first glance you might encounter a difficulty with the Combat Tactics which don't resemble Witcher 1, But very soon you will find it much easier. The game depicts a siege atmosphere, Starting with the death of Foltest to the siege of Vergen.The game will give you a sophisticated choices, You can Intimidate , Persuade people even when they are not compelled to do so, yet you will need to upgrade your signs.Intuitively the Hostility between Human and Elf race is monstrous, yet it relieves the Human's heinous supremacy, no holds barred. Basically you will have to choose whether you follow Human race or Elf race. Humans will soon relinquish their love, see why Iorveth so eagerly liked to parade about his fancy murders. Withcer's saga has a surprise narratives, Starting with The Death of Foltest to Kingslayer's pursuit to the vanquish of sovereigns.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are stealth elements, such as turning off Torches to sneak past guards, so they wont see you! The tutorial sucks♥♥♥♥♥ but aside from that, the game is AMAZING!

Although the combat is much more complex than in the first iteration and the graphics are great, the second installment in the series really feels like a console port when it comes to the controls (PC gamer here). It took a while to get used to the movements.The game in itself is great if too scripted compared to the first game or Skyrim, for example - you can only take certain paths to your objective, can't even jump on a bridge or in the water if not on the right ""spot"" - and this takes out a lot of the fun, at least for me.I was also quiet disappoited with the elements taken out from the first game, like:- no potion drinking during combat - this made use of potions almost pointless, as most of the time I needed to reload because I died in the first run. So I preferred to have lots of bombs and long-range weapons on me. In the first game, I could drink potions just fine if I had enough distance between me and the enemy - as to not take a beating while drinking.- meditation impossible if in an enemy area. I had to leave combat in order to meditate, as you can only meditate in neutral / friendly places. Really frustrating, especially if I didn't know what type / how many enemies were to jump me.- I loved the idea of a fire needed for meditating / potion brewing in the first game, it made sense. It made me carry flints all the time, and look for fireplaces in order to meditate. Sometimes monsters jumped me when coming out of meditation but hey I was a witcher, right :).The game would've been perfect for me if the above elements from the first game would've been implemented here as well. I'm about to finish this game in a few hours, and then go on to the Wild Hunt. Can't wait to see how Geralt's story ends :).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best RPG's I have experienced to date. Obviously the most standout thing on the surface is the graphics. While typical RPG's settle for bland and boring the world of The Witcher is colorful and well detailed. What really sells the game is the complex story telling, which features many different plot twists, and your choices actually influence the main storyline. Its not like Mass Effect where your choices don't mean anything to the storyline. Now the gameplay is difficult as long as you select normal or harder. You dont play as an OP badass, you can die after about 4 to 5 hits from about anything unless its a way lower level then you. Combat is hard, and you will need to plan ahead by drink potions before battle and seting up traps because you can drink potions while in battle and there is no health regen. How I would describe the openess of this game is semi-open world. You can travel freely among the land, but after completing enough main story quests you will travel to a new land, unable to go back to where you came from to complete unfinished side quests or anything you left back there. The game does this often so the best way to get everything done is sidequests first. It is a bit annoying to not be able to travel back but The Witcher 3 fixes this problem and is going full open world. Either way this a must buy for RPG fans and suckers for a good story, its a hell of a ride and the game doesnt treat you like an idiot, you will be presented with challenges that will make you s**t a brick. Now all i have to do is wait for The Witcher 3 and my life will be complete.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is a fantastic, epic spanning RPG, worthy of any PC Gamer’s eye.  Although the game is not without its fair share of technical blemishes Witcher 2 delivers a powerful punch to the player from the moment they click “Play”.  The atmosphere delivered in this title is very engrossing, and as such, Witcher 2 is able to pull the player in and never let go.  The graphics are superb, the art direction is creative and eye catching, and the writing is well delivered, never failing to entrench the player within the game’s vigorously delivered atmosphere.  Although challenging, The Witcher 2 is quite rewarding, delivering an experience like none other.  Most modern RPGs provide the player with two extremes, either absolutely satanic, or non-arguably angelic, and while these games tout their “you write your own story” technique, they fail in delivery.  This is where the Witcher 2 absolutely nails it.  I highly recommend this title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really think this is on the ""Top 5 best RPG's ever made"" list.CD Project is one of the best pro PC gaming developer out there and they delivered on a master piece with this title.both the first game and this one are excellent mature RPG's, with a well thought out ""grey"" world in which choices really matter, and leads to different experiences in the game (altough this second game is better then the first one). its a challenging gameplay with a rich world / zones and also a big replay value. a very long game too, you will definitly get a very high ""content per a buck"" ratio.seriously, if you are an RPG lover like i am, you gotta own it. i bought it for a 60$ pre order and its well worth it at that price.

												An alarming amount of work went into this game to make it one of the most captivating experiences of the year. The world feels alive and rich with activity. As you wander beautiful, but melancholy forests you'll hear wildlife twitter about you. Drunken guards make racial slurs at you as you walk by. You may see a couple of men accosting the local ♥♥♥♥♥. This game is packed with incindental detail, the sound effects are surprisingly good, and the voice acting is superb. The Witcher 2 forces you to take its mature subject matter very seriously. From racial intolerance to♥♥♥♥♥♥to incest, you will deal with a broad range of topics not intended for children. My one gripe is the combat. In my opinion it's improved since the first game, but it's far from perfect. Dodge rolls and cheap deaths abound. The visuals are wickedly stunning, but the optimization isn't great. So unless you have a beastly machine expect to run at mid-high settings. Gorgeous and macabre, this game is prime. 9/10			",323,46,3,29,12,2,21

Brilliant pacing, intrigueing points and actually makes you think hard about possible consequences. Gameplay is satisfying, more challenging then other games of nowadays. Alot of effort was put in it, and the replay value is good cause if you pick a differant side at certain points in the game the story changes entirely.Pretty much a must-have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent mature RPG with great story, fine combat system, lovable characters, amazing engine with ""sweet bugs"" and beautiful graphics, epic music, interesting choises, and awesome gameplay.Now, I love this game, but something is left to be desired in terms of that epic true old school parts that adorn the orginal Witcher. Although it is awesome game, I somehow feel that developers concentrated more on engine and technical stuff, than they did one story and choises like in the original one. But nevertheless, you should not miss this game. Go buy it, now...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has got to be the first game I actually felt like my choices made a difference in the story. Sure, the story must end somewhat the same for all players due to the imminent sequel but the middle of the game, the journey seems to change to players. Talking to others who played it and hearing which missions they have done because of it, I feel like playing it again just so I can go and play to see what I missed out on. I loved the ambiguity of it. I was always left wondering if I was doing the right thing or not and that is important. The world and characters are not black and white. It is mature, with lots of nudity, swearing and violence but it never felt forced, everything moved at a natural pace and thats very welcome. Even the side mission/quests dont feel like they deviate from the main storyline, something that I always felt lots of games do wrong (Example: Mr. Freeze waiting hours for Batman while he goes♥♥♥♥♥♥around beating up thugs and looking for riddler trophies around Arkham city, for instance).I ended up reading some of the books while on vacation away from my PC and it was really great getting to know more of the characters and it definitively made me rethink some of my choices. If there are any complaints to the game, is that the tutorial is its worst enemy. What a chore for someone that had no experience with the game mechanics but after that, it was a delight in game design. Also, playing this game as an intro to the Witcher series, it gave me no idea who some characters where and why I should care for them. Something that the first game might have shown but I got around to it by reading the books, which by the way, are an excellent companion. CDProject Red made an excellent adaptation of the world in the game. The Witcher series might not have been on my radar but The Witcher 3 is now my most anticipated game in a long while. If any of this sounds good to you, GO PLAY IT. NOW.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Definitely an improvement on the first in most respects, however, combat can be a little spam-y and rather easy, and the game feels much shorter with a lot less to explore.  The engine is more up to date, again holding up well, and the choice options really allow unique gameplay for everyone.  Still as good as the first game, and again one of my favourite games.

												Amazing Game! This game has it all, a compelling story, humorous dialogue, beautiful graphics and solid combat. The only negative I have for it is that it seems too easy after the first act, and most enemies are easily beaten by the same old attacks. That being said, there are a few fights I really had to think to win, Karayan....(kept stupidly rushing in) and Operator of course.  But combat aside, the world is genuinely fun to explore. Nearly every crate/shelf/log has items for you to grab up. The sidequests are fun and actually tie in somewhat with the main story, mostly in the form of background information on characters or places. Nearly every choice you make matters down the line, from completeing a monster quest, saving materials, or chosing npcs to side with will all come to a head eventually. I could go on, but I'm sure you get the point. For how much it costs I'd say this game is a steal, and definitely worth buying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

No need to play the first game, its nicely wrapped up for you in a five minute video. FYI beware of the sex scenes :P, nudity does happen in the game and it shows you actually having sex, so try not to play with your parents around if your near a point in the story. Also you will need a good rig/comp to play on high. Don't even try running the game on Ultra unless you have mulitiple GPU's (Graphics card) and ram and a good processor.

												Honestly I'm very happy on the witcher 2, it has so many improvements from the first game. On the other the story ending seems extremely rushed, a 4th act would have made this from a great game to an instant classic.The story continue to be amazing however the use of ""ploughing"" nagged me something awfull.The Combat is by far the best of all 3 games, being challeging and so bloody rewarding that forced me to change style multiple times in the game in order to become just that little bit more effective which makes it even more rewarding when beating each challenge that geralt faces. The first and epsecially the third games don´t do this to nearly as great an effect imo.The alchemy system is not nearly as good imo with potions and especially oil lasting way to short cause of a bloody upgrade tree, I will take my Aard, Igni and the Quen upgrades thank you.Grachics are still extremely good even 4 years down the line however it seems that cd-red took of bit more than they could chew with quite the few grapichs glitches even in the ""enhanced edition"" Which just leaves me with my biggest complaint! Since I don´t want to spoil the story I will just say the ending(s) feel super rushed and it´s just one gaint infodump that leads up to a gaint war that in the witcher 3 isn´t played up nearly as much making it super anti-climatic. Also as I said the game really could have gone with a 4th act as the games ending again feels aprupt.Note: This game is quite a bit shorter than the witcher 1 and 3 as seen here:Witcher 1: 50 hours (50% of sidequests)Witcher 2: 30 hours (about 60-70% sidequests)Witcher 3: 200 hours long if you do every little thing.

												Seriously, this game is incredible. There are almost no issues with it.Pros:+ Massive, and I mean MASSIVE game world+ Because it's based on a series of equally brilliant novels, the story and the depth of the world could go toe-to-toe with LotR, and it makes TES look like Minecraft+ Smooth gameplay, very fluid controls and combat+ Incredible graphics+ Runs perfect frame-rates, provided you have the sufficient hardware, and almost never crashes (Windows 8 has some issues though)+ Literally hundreds of hours of quests and side-missions+ Brilliant animation and voice acting+ More like an RPG than a lot of RPGs, even though this technically isn't an RPG; combinations of spells, weapons, traps, and allies make it feel almot as if Geralt isn't a pre-set character.+ Soundtrack is mesmerising and very fittingCons:- Menus and inventory a little clunky- Map needs some work- Can have random difficulty spikes, and times where you have absolutely no idea how to progress with very little help from the gameBuy this game. Just do it. You will not regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite simply the greatest Action-RPG ever made, while the first witcher had what I personally felt to be a slightly clunky combat system, the 2nd one perfects the blend of fast paced action with strategic combat involving the use of Traps, bombs, throwing weapons, Potions. Signs (magic) and finally swordplay. With the free update to the enhanced edition now is a better then ever time to pick up this game.			",106,19,0,27,13,0,29

												This game takes you on a journey of never ending fun and excitement. It's not just the usual ""go to the dungeon and clear it out"" sort of game it's more of an ""Go to the dungeon, get materials to defeat and epic monster that you will battle soon... and oh! While you're at it defeat the boss"" kind of game. I'm sure you will never get bored. The story and gameplay of this game is great, especially how they can make the antagonists really hateful and protagonists loveable, also decions somewhat matter you do not get any rewards though your choices will have its consequences. Once you think that you are over with the game you're probably wrong because you haven't explored ""everything"" yet. This is game is great that's all I can say 10/10			",94,9,0,13,5,0,3

												I'm writing this recommendation because The Witcher 3  : WILD HUNT will be coming soon. Storyline : IMO much better than SkyrimCombat : Really good as you need to be aware of everything and time it right and also the choices of which strategy is the best for certain situation makes it even more unique. When I bought this game, I straight played it on DARK mode and did a 2nd run on INSANE mode which was really INSANE in some part of the game. So my view of combats gameplay is solely base on those 2 levels of difficulty.A must have game for sure.easy 10/10  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is perfectly made.  The controls with mouse and keyboard feel amazing, much better than with a controller.  The graphics are amazing also.  Most importnatly, this game has the best story of any game I've ever played, with mutliple beginnings and endings.  10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												BIG RECOMMENDATION!If you like real time action RPG fantasy games that is. One of the few non open-world games I've truly enjoyed from start to finish.Piecewise linear world, fairly big levels though, and a linear storyline you have to follow, but you can follow at your own pace, and it has enough side quests to keep from being monotonous. It is not open world, but it almost feels openworld. At the current pricepoint it is a steal, and easily shames most $59.99 new releases focused on the console market. This was a PC game first, and a console game second, meaning us PC gamers got an intelligent game with excellent keyboard mouse controls.There are two divergent and exclusive middle-game quest lines, so you have to replay pretty much the whole game at least once to see it all and do it all. I am going to take the time to go back and complete the second line.The quickplay arena mode is fun for practice and when you want some quick hack and slash, which you can abandon and walk away from when dinner is ready to come out of the oven.Personal quirk: one thing kept breaking the immersion for me: the voice actor for your character (Geralt) is the same voice actor who played Cal in Independence War 2, a game I have replayed at least six times; so everytime he speaks I think I am in space blasting spaceships, not in a forest hunting evil creatures and gathering herbs...I dearly hope they develop a sequel someday... HOLY CRAP, just went to duckduckgo.com and there is a Witcher 3 coming Spring 2015, and open world too  YEA!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While The Witcher 2 is a fun game, it takes a bit of time to find the enjoyment in it. It's unique combat made me dislike it at first, but eventually I came back to it and finished the game. I went on to start another playthrough too. It becomes a very rewarding game, much like dark souls in the way that you feel a sense of accomplishment in defeating your enemies, and with the difficult turned up it can be a challenging game. Even on easy difficulty it can be challenging for newcomers. With the price so low, it is still worth buying given that even though it is about 3 years old it still looks good and is fun to play. I can't wait for The Witcher 3 to come out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
