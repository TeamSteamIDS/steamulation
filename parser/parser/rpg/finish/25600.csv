												Eschalon series is a turn-based role-playing game series with astounding graphics and sound. Unfortunately gameplay is a bit slow, even for an ultima-like game. Doing almost anything in this game is fun but one thing: Walking. And there's a lot of walking. Walking through forests, walking through beaches, walking through deserts... and even more walking. The game has interesting dungeons and towns, filled with many secrets and details, unfortunately other locations are there just to be walked through. That is why I would rate this game as decent: It's a very enjoyable RPG, except for tedious walking through wilderness.			",390,117,27,79,52,1,87

 “Aha! A back entrance to the infamous dark tower! And better yet, the door appears to be slightly ajar as if it were not properly closed the last time someone used it. It seems this is my lucky day. Riches here I come!”  Eschalon: Book 1 represents a classic rpg experience with a turn-based combat system and great love for detail. In addition it provides a decent character development system and well-done soundtrack for the depicted locations. The only shortcoming of this game is the relatively slow-paced gameplay.  Trivia: The developers of the Eschalon series kept this project a secret for a long time, believing most game developers release too much information about their products, spoiling the game when you eventually play it. Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements. Chronology: Eschalon: Book 3 (PC)Classic turn-based role-playing game(Fantasy) – 2014 Link to Steam review for Eschalon: Book 3.

												In a nutshell, Eschalon is a standard 2D single-character fantasy western RPG. (""western RPG"" here means ""opposite of JRPG"")Eschalon is solid. It's not exemplary, it's not bad. It's the kind of game that would metascore in the 70-75 bracket, filled with games that are worth your time if you're a fan of the genre.The story is cliche; save the world by finding the macguffins and slaying the big bad. That doesn't necessarily make it bad. It's not memorable, but it works.For the most part, combat in Eschalon is a game of numbers and dice. I played a magick user, and for the first half of the game, all I had was a basic single-target spell. The outcome of a battle essentially boiled down to how many times I could cast it with what mana I had, how many turns it took the enemy to close to attack range (which is melee for most enemies), and how many hits both of us could survive. Later on, I got a few area-effect spells, which added a small layer of strategy, though numbers and dice were still the dominant factor.The first half of the game was extremely tedious as a magick user. Mana regen is very slow to start, though you can build for quick regen after a few level ups if you eschew everything else. There is a rest function that causes time to pass more quickly, but it can still take as long as a minute to fill back up. Health regen works the same way, and I have to imagine it's just as tedious for melee-centered characters.Basically, playing Eschalon Book 1 felt like playing a much, MUCH smaller Elder Scrolls game. That's just me though; your mileage may (and probably will) vary.THE VERDICT: Eschalon is a solid RPG that will entertain an RPG fan for about 20 hours. It's not the best game out there, but it's not the worst either.			",99,23,0,61,14,2,31

												Finishing this game took me 34 hours. Was that good time? Definitely yes, I spent a great time with that. But that doesn't mean that every player will like it as I do. First of all, you must be real RPG fan, and what is most important, you must be old-school gamer. Because this game is true old-school RPG with very poor animations and weak graphics (as for today). But if you're ok with that, you will like it. It has good story, turn based combat and high difficulty level.VERDICT:If you're old-school RPG fan, this is what you need.If you're modern RPG fan but you want to try something classic, this is good choice.If you're not a fan either of RPG and old-school, you shouldn't even read this, that might harm you.Like this review?

												Playing this trilogy for the second time through. While not graphically superior to any RPG of late, this game franchise has one of the most involved story lines you could ever ask for. Seriously deep character development are coupled with a world that you will completely get lost in. The story will take you through a lifetime of betrayal, friendships and evil that will leave you speechless. Any fan of RPG's will be right at home here with a D&D style interface, Ultima style spell books and some of the most memorable adventures I have personally ever been a part of. Every second of this game drips with pure love from the developer whom I can only assume is an even bigger nerd than I am :)			",480,96,36,70,69,1,58

												Eschalon is being marketed as an old-school role-playing game inspired by the classics. This is an adequate description of the game, but unfortunately the game does not succeed in adequately copying all the good qualities of the classics that it is inspired by. The game does have it's strengths for sure. Character creation is very detailed and let's you create the character you want to play by choosing such things as race, class, skills, the region where the character grew up and the character's religion (or lack thereof) and all of these choices make a difference. Another strength is in how the turn-based system works. When you move or perform any action time flows. When you don't time stands still. This means that the game can have as high or low a pace as you want it to have at any given moment and that it moves seamlessly from a high to a low pace and vice versa. There is no waiting, e.g. for enemies to complete their turn, and you can also take as much time as you need to think before acting.The game has a reasonable amount of optional side-quests, different items to find and different regions to explore. The graphics are nothing special, but entirely adequate. The music is quite good. So far, it all sounds pretty good.Where does the game fail, then? Unfortunately it fails at the most important thing for this kind of game. Combat! What is wrong with it? It doesn't require any skill. You control a single character with a rather limited repertoire of combat actions, mainly slashing/bashing, shooting, or burning the enemies, The same is true for the enemies. This would be okay in a Diablo-like action RPG where the fun and the challenge comes from the high pace. But for a turn-based RPG this is not adequate, combats should require some strategic thinking and since here they don't fighting enemies becomes a dull routine matter. Since much of the game, like with most RPG's, consists of fighting this is clearly no good.All in all, Eschalon is an old-school turn-based RPG with a couple of good qualities which is unfortunately dragged down by dull combat. I wouldn't really want to call it a bad game, but there are plenty of better games in the genre (although Eschalon beats many of these games in some respects, only not where it really matters) that I would recommend over this one.

												(Before I get going, I'll say that Book 2 is much improved and although I'm only a few hours in, I can probably recommend Book 2. Writing is more polished, graphics feel fresher, and controls feel more responsive. Book 1 isn't necessary to play or understand the story of Book 2.)Slow paced and feels more like a shallow copy of old school CRPGs (hey, that *looks old-fashioned*, or, nobody does *that* in RPGs anymore, let's put that into Eschalon) rather than capturing the deep magic that made old school CRPGs worth reviving (as in ""why did they do that, and does it still make sense? If so, let's put it in and modernize it just a bit""). Don't get me wrong, I like turn-based (Western) CRPGs, love Spiderweb Games (Exile through Avadon even), and I even fire up one of the top roguelikes now and then (Nethack, ADOM, dwarf fortress, Cataclysm DDA, etc.), and Eschalon Book 1 falls flat by comparison. I've played Ultima 4-8, Wasteland, Fallout 1-2, Baldur's Gate, Arcanum, and I've probably played other awesome turn-based overhead CRPGs that I can't remember. I'm sure I've played some clunkers too, but I felt I had to put up this negative review if only b/c I cannot figure out why so many people seem to like this game enough to recommend others play it--the hype for this game, from ""pro"" reviews and players, makes me wonder how many of those even played a quarter of the games I listed up top.Eschalon Book 1 is a passable timesink, but do yourself a favor and fire up an actual classic or one of the better old-school-style titles this side of 1999. Even if it's cheap, there's still your time to consider--a playthrough takes about 20-40 hours depending on how OCD you get on doing quests and leveling up, and much of that will be spent slowly walking your single toon around obstacles since there's no click-move.As for the plot, it's pretty straightforward w/o any real interesting twists, the writing is passable, but there's no real drama, tension, or even humor. There's *some* sure, but most of it is rather flat and just something to check the box.Now, nobody ever came out and said this was a ""love letter"" to old-school CRPGs, but much of the marketing kept hyping up it's old-school-ness. To that I respond: 1) actual old CRPGs did it better, 2) some of those old CRPGs are still playable now, 3) newer CRPGs in old-school-style have also done it better.If you read this and still played the game, no problem, even if you found you liked it enough to at least *want* to play it *a second time* (how many Yes-recommenders honestly think they'd *want* to play a second time? That's not even *actually* playing it twice, but just *thinking* about it?). I'm not saying I know all for everybody. If you played it and didn't like it, then at least know you've not gone crazy considering how many reviews recommend it. If you have yet to play it, seriously, track down and play the other names I've dropped first, then maybe you can at least be so busy putting in the hours into those that you won't even have to think about Eschalon.

												Its not a bad game. Somewhat older graphics and style of gameplay. It seemed very simplified game at first but later it becomes harder as you start to travel further from the begining. I realized later after constantly dying often that this wasnt so simple of a game. Some creatures are extremely hard to kill, and the trick of running to edge of the map to heal on the other side of the next map, is what I mostly did to try and survive. (that and to save often) Its a worthy game in my opinion and I enjoyed very much. Just waiting for the next version to come out on steam.			",67,16,0,52,8,0,48

												This game is truly fantastic.  It is quite a bit difficult when you are first starting out and don't really know what to do or what is good, but after you warm up to the game, you learn it has a deep meta surrounding optimizing your character and that just building your character can be as fun as playing the game itself.The game features turn based movement and combat, as seen in many roguelikes, although this game itself is not a roguelike.  It's got great randomly generated treasure always keeping you in suspense for what might be in the next loot bag.  There is also a wide diversity of enemies, even among the many melee-oriented enemies in the game, there are frequently variations such as enemies that inflict diseases or poison with their attacks.The story is pretty good, and it's told to you through conversations with the various NPCs.  Learning about the world and its lore is pretty fascinating and there is enough of it to keep you wanting more all the way until the end of the game.There are lots of things to do in the game, like crafting potions with alchemy, enchanting your equipment, tons of sidequests, secret rooms to find, locks to pick, traps to disarm, and crimes to commit.  It's very reminiscent of the great Ultima games, but updated with modern technology.  This game is a must have for any old school RPG fans.			",552,249,6,141,40,4,103

												If you like old school single character RPGs than Eschalon is exactly what you're looking for.  It's 2-D slightly skewed perspective is reminiscent of the later Ultima games, while the character development is more on par with a Baldur's Gate game, allowing you to choose which skills and spells to improve as you level.  The story is simple but effective, and you consistantly feel there is a purpose to your actions, propeling you on to the next area or quest.   It's simple old school fun in an RPG, and it works.  Eschalon Books I and II  provide hours of entertaining gameplay and are recommended for anyone looking for that early 90's feel from an RPG.			",234,56,2,116,42,4,119

												Be warned! If you're a fan of casual RPGs, this one is not for you. It's an epic quest of XP grinding, min-maxing and filling your inventory with alchemical ingerients. Therefore I'm going to give this one a thumbs down.There's some pen-and-paper retro charm to Eschalon that makes it worthwhile to people who really love turn based and number-driven adventures with no dedicated run buttons. You have to rest for eight hours to regain mana in order to kill a single bumble bee. If that's your thing, who am I to judge?			",291,199,6,52,37,5,59

												Oldschool RPG with the amnesia and restore-the-kingdom plot you've come to expect. Very functional, if a bit hard in places. I'll admit I save-scummed treasure chests since loot is random. The game manual / help doesn't really educate you very well on how skills work.Almost a little rouge-like in difficulty, esp. early game when you have no healing potions and dont know how to make them much less make actual money. Self-buff magic is really the best choice for spell casting as attack spells scale up in mana costs too much but are necessary for melee-penalizing foes.The game graphics are pleasing enough, and the music is enjoyable and makes for especially good settings in a few places. Text dialogue and area descriptions are very rich as well, which definately helps.$15 is about right in price I suppose, but getting on sale is nice. This isn't a modern-day RPG and the difficulty and lack of transparency in the game system shows that pretty well. Not for the RPG dabbler.EDIT: I have changed my review from Yes to No on the premise that it obfuscates its mechanics too much and and is legitimately unpleasantly difficult in the beginning of the game because of it where mis-progression and lack of information can cause major problems.  For example, the shield use skill gives no benefit beyond the first point (which removes an unskilled use penalty), yet the skill can have many points dumped into it like every other skill which gives a scaling benefit.  This should absolutely NEVER happen in a game.			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

												In spite of what it tries to say, it is not an old-school RPG, and it is the furthest thing from fun.  A dumbed-down grindfest in a vaguely Roguelike style that relies upon forcing players to min-max in order to be ""hard"".  Every monster is essentially the same melee brute AI, and every fight the same repeated ad infinitum.  The barrels in town are more likely to randomly have plate mail armor than the chest behind the traps in the last dungeon you completed, and low-level goblins drop better stuff than high-level minotaurs, because treasure is rubber-banded, but enemies, bizarrely, are not.  I cannot recommend this game for anyone - there are simply too many other good RPGs out there.Go play Avernum or Avadon or one of those actual old-school games getting updated and re-released over Steam, instead.  Those had clever and subtle systems.  This game mimics without understanding what made the classics classic.			",499,328,6,193,169,6,191

												This is one of those games that was designed to look like retro RPG's. That should explain the cheesy graphics. As far as the puzzles go, they are mediocre at best. The game itself has an ok storyline and is somewhat muddled in its explanation of how things evolved to this. Not bad for a retro looker though. Some things that will pisss alot of people off are:1. The rate of character level up does not seem to make a difference in terms of your damage factor. There are a lot of stats you can enhance and it does not seem to make a major difference even when you have leveled several times.2. The abilities that you can enhance your character with suffer from the same mentioned previously.3. Monsters are ALWAYS vastly over whelming for you to fight and will make you more aware of the previously mentioned complaints regarding character devlopment.4. THE DEVS DO NOT ALLOW CHEATING. THERE ARE NO CHEATS AVAILABLE AT ALL. NONE. You can't even edit a file to cheat. There are a few links to trainers that do not work. So if you have a desire to cheat, like some people do, you are out crap out of luck. This is guaranteed to pisss off many people and the DEV'S have stated they DO NOT CARE, so be forewarned. This, of course, applies to all three of the Eschalon games (1,2, and 3). I am one of those people who like to cheat occasionally and I don't need the whiney anti cheat community to tell me what I need, nor do I appreciate DEV'S who don't care about it either. Tired of this cry baby anti cheat coommunity. If you don't like to cheat, then don't cheat. Plain English, but don't make it impossible for people to do it in game or you are going to lose quite a few sales. This alone has caused me to refuse any purchases form these DEV'S until they change.In summary, this was not a bad game at all. It was nothing revolutionary either, but still not bad. I did manage to beat it without cheats, but it pisssed me off that the DEV's pulled this crap.  If you don't like being forced to play without cheats, don't buy the follow up games, because you can not cheat in them either.GAME TIPS: Make monsters chase you to any border and then stand and fight. I usually run around the map and get 4-5 to follow me.If they beat you up badly simply walk through the border to enter a screen refresh and then camp until you are healed. Monsters will never follow you, but instead wait for you over the border. Walk back over the border and they will still be there with the same damage you gave them before. When camping, count to 4 seconds by watching the time of day clock and then stop the campng. Then redo it again by hitting the camp button. This will prevent the game from spawning monsters on you while you camp. If you over extend your welcome while camping, the game spawns powerful monsters to wear you down again so count 4 seconds on the time of day clock and then stop. Re camp until health is filled and then save the game. When you restart you will have all your health again. SAVE SAVE SAVE. That should help alot, of course the easiest way to help you is reccommend you ignore this game and buy something way better, and believe me there are WAY better games. It wouldn't surprise me if the game DEV's release a patch that disallows these exploits too, lol.			",260,62,2,81,10,0,9

												It's a very nice, turn-based, old-school RPG.Please note: I myself am not a big fan of turn-based games, but you barely notice the turn system.Gameplay: You are some hero who wakes up and doesn't remember his past. (Definitely haven't seen that before.)You will embark on many quests and journeys across the very troubled lands of Thaemoor. The game is open-world, but if you don't follow the storyline, it can be much harder. It's not a very frightening game, but I found my whole playthrough a little unnerving, because of the setting.My favorite part of this game is the level of interaction with other NPCs. You can practically kill every NPC you see, (You can even kill the king) so long as you're skilled enough to defend yourself. I even looted a quest NPC's house. (I found a really awesome sword in his closet.) Unfortunately, he died in the incident, and the quest will forever remain in my quest log.Being a rogue is really fun and compliments the ways you can interact with NPCs, in my opinion. You can pick locks, break into houses, sneak around in the night, and loot stuff. Just don't get caught, or the town guard will go after you! I highly recommend once you understand the game enough, you try out the rogue.The only real bummer is that this game has a rather expansive character development system, but the replay value is low because you're just going to go down almost the exact same path you did last time if you want to get anywhere. It would be nice if there was more option for the player when it came to progression.			",55,1,0,15,7,0,14

												If there was a time when you felt that the Ultima series were the best RPGs on the market, chances are you'll like this game.  Eschalon has a world full of things to kill and places to explore, a rich history and plenty of quests to complete.  There are multiple endings, moral choices, and random loot drops.  The character creation system allows for a wide range of playing styles, since it's based on attributes and skills- you can essentially multiclass all you want.  In fact, having a wide range of skills will make you most effective in the end.  Perhaps that's one weakness to Book 1- going without magic or without martial skill just doesn't work out.  You have to mix them to reach your highest potential.  In Book 2 it's less of a problem.I enjoyed the plot, found the combat to be fair (though there are a few things you can do to stack the odds overwhelmingly in your favor), and the dungeons to be interesting.  I highly recommend this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game, but not great.Pros:-Story (not particularly original, but well-written and gives it a very classic RPG feel)-Graphics (nothing to say here. If you like this art style, Eschalon is great)-Concept (old-school single player RPG, and done well)-Dungeon/World design (dungeons, traps, etc. Everything I love)Cons (really just the one):-Combat. Unless you're a mage, you have one option: attack. And since (it seems, anyway) there's no ""speed"" system like in Angband or similar roguelikes, that means that once an enemy sees you, if you can't beat it you just run to the edge of the map and it follows you until you escape, and then you camp and either move on or try again. I feel like this is a symptom of the ""one character, not party"" game play, and don't see how the developer could have worked around this.Conclusion:Worth six bucks. If I could only get one old-school RPG though, I'd probably go with Avernum: Escape from the Pit. That said, I am happy with Eschalon and plan to buy the second and thirds when I get to them.

												A punishing game for those not indoctrinated on the misery of old-school roleplaying games. With every skill and attribute deriving a half-dozen statistics, some careful planning is needed to survive the opening game, and that strategy will need to be tweaked the entire time to survive into the late game. Unfortunately, not all skills being equal, this leads to a fairly narrow band of effective strategies. Does not reward player creativity, despite its apparent depth of customization.

												I've been playing Eschalon for the good part of an year. It's one of those ""actual"" CRPGs where mechanics actually did require you to think and invest time in proper attributes and playstyles, not expecting any handholding like kids get in teen/console rpgs these days. Now, I just finished the main story and felt the same as when I put a good book down after reading its last word.Loved the music, the engine and exploration, above all. I still don't have Book II, but sure as hell it's on my wishlist now.This game comes from before the current golden age of CRPGs and was one of the few that brought me back hope to the niche market of classic-styled, thought-out, pen-n-paper inspired role playing games, along with the Spiderweb Games and Knights of the Chalice.Estive jogando Eschalon por quase um ano. É um daqueles CRPGs ""reais"" onde a mecânica e regras realmente te forçam a pensar e investir tempo em atributos adequados e no seu estilo de jogo, sem segurar sua mão como a criançada espera dos RPGs de adolescentes / consoles de hoje. Agora, acabei de terminar a história principal e foi uma sensação semelhante à de por de lado um bom livro depois de ler a sua última palavra.Adorei a música, a engine e acima de tudo, a exploração. Eu ainda não tenho o Book II, mas com certeza está na minha lista agora.Este jogo vem de antes da atual ""era de ouro"" dos CRPGs e foi um dos poucos que me trouxe de volta a esperança para o jogos mais regrados no estilo RPG de mesa clássico , juntamente com os jogos da Spiderweb e o Knights of the Chalice.

The whole series is great, but I warn you, you will be disappointed at the end of book 3 (or even at the beginning of it when you make some bad choices).But I really recommend this book, it's a great game!
