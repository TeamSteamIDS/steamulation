												If you are the sort of gamer who enjoys trudging across various maps for an hour straight searching for rare herbs just so you can make enough healing potions to get through a difficult boss fight then this is the game for you (luckily I am exactly that sort of gamer, but I realize not everyone enjoys such things).So, yeah, this is pretty much the perfect sequel. It keeps the original Drakensang's awesome stat and combat system, but improves on nearly everything else: much better writing, dialog, and production values (including class specific quests ala ""Dragon Age: Origins""), much fewer trash mobs (fighting is less frequent in this game compared to the first, but much more difficult and better thought out when it happens), and (perhaps best of all) a new fast travel system that prevents your having to run everywhere like in the first game. Plus, it's technically a prequel, so if you only play one Drakensang (and you should if you enjoy RPGs at all) it should be this one.			",214,85,2,68,14,0,27

												All the Drakensang games (Drakensang, River of Time and Phileasson's Secret) are excellent, good old fashioned stats-based RPG's. Imagine the gameplay of Neverwinter Nights but with vastly superior graphics and gameplay. Loads of class choices, loads of abilities to improve, you can spend your adventure points (xp) on these as you get them not just when you level up. You have to find trainers to get new skills and spend your adventure points to learn these too. Skills are based on combinations of related stats, and it can seem a bit confusing at first, but common sense can see you through it. There can be a lot of running about and movement can feel a little slow but there are fast travel points on the maps, most of which are not huge anyway. Based on the pen and paper rules of The Dark Eye system (and not button-mashing action rpg hack and slashers) these games are well worth checking out if you're a fan of proper role players made the way they should be.

												What a fantastic rpg!! there are no achievements or cards......just good gameplay and story. It makes you want to play the game for the game. I really like the controls for movement, you can point and click or take full control, very similar to World of Warcraft. In battles you can pause (turnbase style) or just go full action. I am also a fan of The Dark Eye ruleset, if you hover over or right click on anything it gives an explaination, so it is easy to learn. There is alot crafting and upgrades, tons of collectable items and weapons, and you cant go 10 feet without a chest or barrell full of stuff. Add mine to the list of positive reviews.

												A solid RPG experience.  A deep, party oriented combat system and large list of craftable objects add depth to a well presented story and environment.  Quests often have multiple paths to resolution giving you some choice in how you want to complete them.  Well worth the price of admission, a real steal if you get it on one of the Steam sales.

												This game suprised me. Bought it on sale for cheap because I was jonesing for an rpg, and thought this was worth a few bucks to waste a few hours. But it really turned out to be an excellent party based rpg along the lines of DA:O, NWN, etc. It is on the lighter side, not nearly as gritty or 'mature' as DA:O, but a good old fantasy rpg with swashbuckling heros and mustache twisting villains. Graphics are descent / good (considering it is several years old), but a bit cartoonish. The story is kinda meh, just a reason to do one quest after another, but good enough. There is a descent crafting system, and deep character leveling system. However, there are no real in-game context clues for some of the attributes (what they do, how they interact with other attributes, etc), and as this is a german import, it is easy to forget that we all get used to what is basically the same D&D based ruleset for RPGS. Unfortunately, the game has no manual. I spent a little time googling player guides or wikis to figure out a few unknowns and the game became much more intutive. On the negative side, the voice acting is for the most part (in English at least) MUHFUHORRIFIC. Didn't stop me from enjoying the game, but made it a bit campy. Also, the pausible real time combat turns are slower than you are used to, which makes certain actions (like spell casting) a bit problematic until you get the feel of it. Not necessarily a negative, it can even be a positive,  you just have to learn the proper tactics. All in all a game worth playing if you are a party based rpg fan.			",67,10,0,21,0,0,6

												2009's European import CRPG ""Drakensang"" was the kind of game I like to call a ""slow burn"" title. By that, I mean it started out moderately fun and as time went by I found it to be more and more compelling and addictive the longer I continued to play it. While it didn't have the non-linearity of Dragon Age or the visual fidelity of Germany's own Risen, Drakensang did have something very few RPGs seem to want to include nowadays: Complex rules and challenging tactical combat. It was these inclusions to the rapidly aging CRPG formula that kept me glued to my monitor long enough to go through the game three times and eventually led me to track down its sequel, the much improved and brilliantly written ""River of Time"".Though River of Time is actually a prequel it's hard to believe it when you look at how much of the game has been changed for the better. With the English translation cleaned up (No more confusing 1W numbers instead of 1D), the game's combat being better balanced in the early levels, the experience points doled out in larger chunks and the story paced much slower than the previous game it's hard to really find fault with what Radon Labs has done here. The original Drakensang was one of the best CRPGs I had played in the past five years and besides a few tweaks and more variety in the locations/quests/monsters you encountered I didn't see much wrong with it. The characters were memorable, the combat was fantastic and the rules were the perfect antidote to the watered down 3rd edition D&D I had grown sick and tired of.Yet Radon Labs managed to somehow shave some extra fat off of this already slender game and dress it up even prettier than it already was.For those who enjoyed the original Drakensang there is really no reason why you would dislike the sequel. Much of its shortcomings (Such as fighting stereotypical low-level beasts like rats and wolves nonstop in the early levels) have been dealt with and what you're left with in this prequel is a much cleaner, more refined CRPG. The only drawback that I noticed was that the game seems to put a much tighter rein on leveling since even after my 2nd trip whereupon I used an FAQ to maximize my experience gains I was still unable to get past level 12. This was slightly disappointing when you consider that the first game let you leap all the way to level 17 before the last boss fight was even unlocked.I also noticed that the economy seemed a bit out of whack since even though my characters were swimming in gold ducats I still had to spend hours selectively buying and selling things just to get the equipment that I needed to survive. This constant obsessing over money and equipment caught up to me in the end after I completed a quest that opened up a 999 ducat helmet that I couldn't afford no matter what I sold or traded. It irked me that I couldn't buy it and left me bitter as I went on to the game's final area 728 ducats short of being able to afford it.Overall however, River of Time is considerably better than its predecessor and the only faults you'll find with it are, as I've said, small gripes that can be easily ignored.To make up for these small missteps River of Time manages to give you a little bit of non-linearity in your adventure, something the first game completely lacked. Though this non-linearity is basically just a couple optional boss fights and a hunting reserve with a few quests tucked away within it, it's still nice to see that Radon Labs was listening to the fans when they cried out for some optional ""challenge"" areas.As a matter of fact one of those challenging optional areas is so hard that it contains the best CRPG boss fight I've seen since the battle with Kangax in Baldur's Gate 2. Not to spoil the surprise, but if you find yourself in an underwater temple and you've just solved a floor tile puzzle to open a door you had better make sure you've bought or found end game equipment because you're going to need it. The amount of micro-managing and aggro-distribution I had to do in the boss fight below that temple nearly drove me insane			",101,22,7,54,1,0,2

												8.8/10 - Most overlooked game ever!It feels good to find a gem like this once in a while. Not tons of reviews or attention but it should have got some! In an age of MMORPG games, this game stayed hidden. Single player only, but the maps and story are awesome. I can't stop playing this one. Some of the best locations, graphics and city detail I have seen in this genre. The combat style is different than you would expect for a game such as this. If there was a more active combat system for this game it would have been legendary. Overall, I will keep adding some hours to this game and look to finish it. It appears the main storyline can be completed in about 20 hours.I'd pay the $20. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

												Sequel to the fun, but not all that great RPG Drakensang.Unlike the first game, this one is actually good all around. They seem to have figured out what went wrong with their first foray in to RPG territory, and fixed it right up. The combat has been improved, although its still basic PnP rules, the story is actually interesting, and stays consistent, unlike the first one, and its just much better constructed.If you like RPGs, and want one very similar to the oldschool PnP style games, ( NWN/NWN2, KotOR/2 ), then you'd be foolish to not pick up River of Time at its asking price, its everything I was hoping Dragon Age 2 would be, except much cheaper.

Review for Drakensang: The River of TimePros Gameplay: The game is very interesting i would even say it was a hidden gem because i hadn't heard about it at all, world felt real in it's own right, everything felt smooth and was very interesting till the very end.Story:  It was very interesting, there where times when it felt like meh but this game has choices, you can decide what you do who you save or with whom you side which gives this game replay value which is very good, Main story was interesting because you were left in dark for very long time and i didn't know what will happen who is who and so on it was very interesting, Side quests were very good, they were interesting didn't repeat and were worth searching and completing. Skills:  I liked how i learn new skill, you need to find trainer and learn from them and 1 trainer can't teach everything for you so there are several ( blacksmith, Guard captain, Healer etc.) only thing with leveling up that was meh was that for example to improve magic spells all i have to do i spend points in character screen.ConsTechnical:  Loading time was awful for me in all big locations because if i had to reload ( i died, wanted to try something) it was long, don't get me wrong it wasn't THAT long but while playing this game i reloaded hundred times and in total that's a lot. Also i never knew when and where to go which resulted in going against too hard enemies and reloading to previous save-file and try to beat him several times and returning after a while.DecisionGame is worth playing in fact if you have it in your library and haven't played it you should at least try it if you liked games like Dragon Age it may feel a bit similar in certain times, even with it's little flaws it's a true hidden gem and must play if you own it.8 out of 10 ",356,99,12,46,22,7,42

												I want to note that this is a game that has been stuck in licensing hell, the company that made it went under, and the english version has existed, but not been available outside the benelux area for several years, which is a damn shame. I imported the game back then because i liked drakensang 1, so disregard my lack of playing hours.Drakensang is a role playing series not unlike neverwinter nights 2 or dragon age. you control 4 characters, use a real time with pause combat system, and progress linearly. It is a prequel to drakensang 1, and you kinda should play this first.The combat is directly imported from the PnP rpg it is based on, and honestly kinda complicated. It pseudo-uses levels as a stat capping limiter, and a beginner might be tempted to ""multi-class"" and spread their numbers out. Dont do that. All forms of combat have validity, but there are trap options, and summons are bonkers good. It is sort of based on a runequest-like system, but with multiple d20 rolls based on different stats.The setting (Dark eye/Aventuria) is pretty much a paint by numbers fantasy setting, with very little originality, but it has been very popular in germany for a very long time and thanks to decades of german autism it is pretty much the most detailed role playing setting there is.The story isn't the most original, but it provides for some options to roleplay, is very light hearted in tone, although less generic than in the first game.If you are the kind of person to like PnP-based, RtwPause combat systems, give this one a try, it is fun. If you have played drakensang 1, this game is better, but shorter.If you liked this game and is for some reason reading this review and havent played drakensang 1 yet, only do so if you liked the COMBAT of this game.

												Drakensang: The River of Time is a fantastic, confusing, extremely hard but fun game!  I had no idea what weapons and armor were good, so I'd just equip my party with the most valuable weapons because if weapon A was 10 gold, and weapon B was 50 gold, weapon B must be 5x better than weapon A!  This strategy mostly worked for me... though I died a lot.  The story was entertaining and easy to follow.  The design was great and I never got bored playing it.  If you like Dragon Age type games, or RPG's in general, give this a go!  You'll be happy you did!   I give this game 4 out of 5 Whitestars.			",194,28,5,26,31,0,37

												Disclaimer: I have always wanted to get into the Dark Eye stuff and while I have the Arkania trilogy on my wishlist, this game serves as my entry into this sprawling fantasy universe.That being said, I am really loving this game! I can see why they say that TDE is just as popular if not more so than D&D over in Germany (where it orginally hails from). The depth of the lore alone is quite amazing, but I also really respect the attention to detail in making the subject matter truly their own in such a bloated market (ie fantasy fiction).Drakensang: Rivers of Time is the 2010 prequel to the original Drakensang (2008). For anyone familiar with that particular title - Ardo, Cano and Forgrimm play a central role in RoT as well. You play a nameless adventurer who earns in the anals of history alongside these three heroes.What appeals to me most about this game is that, despite being a relatively modern game, it lacks the constant hand-holding of so many other current gen RPGs - which, to me, only ever translates to a plus! Game also features some great voice work and a pretty interesting plot. As with any good RPG you're given a large open world to explore at your leisure with plenty of side quests and other tasks to keep one busy when not pursuing the main quest line, as well.

												It started really well and I really began to enjoy this game, then the awful combat system kicked in during critical times, which can be a real pain.  Though I like the pause and ensuing tactical planning elements, it does not always work.  For example, I could be hit by ranged weapons and despite having high level ranged combat, I could not fire back despite pause, select targeting, etc.  I could set the attack up and... waited...  and... waited...  Nothing happened, all the while I was getting hit until my party was decimated by three low level dwarfs with crossbows.  No matter what I did or where I stood I could not fire back, yet they were in clear line of sight and within range.  Whether or not I was being a numpty, I don't know - it just seemed to spoil what is a good game from being a great game.  This could be so much better if not for the occasional cumbersome combat system.  Still, it really is a gem and has all the elements of what an RPG should be - character interaction, crafting, freedom in character builds, weapons, armour, etc.Also, another gripe (for me at least) is that I would have liked to have seen a greater variety of spells for magic users.  I guess we can't have it all.Post Sciptum:  I have now completed this and the expansion, Phileason's Secret, and despite the earlier niggles, once I got used to the combat system idiosynchrasies, this really is an absolute gem.  I just hope they release more DLC, or even better, a mod maker.  I absolutely loved the game and got very attached to my characters!			",21,7,0,26,0,0,1

												Drakensang the River of TIme is a pretty decent roleplaying game. It has a fair amount of content, charming visuals and a large number of ways to customize your party members. It has crafting, a bunch of side quest, a reasonable amount of areas to explore, speech checks, a bunch of companions, a ton of items and etc etc. Overall it delivers what your would expect from a party based roleplaying game such as this. I had a fair bit of fun with it even though i would not say that the game is amazing in any single area it still comes together into a rpg which i would recommend fans of the genre to check it out.There are some thing though that i believe could have been done better. I was not familar with the dark eye ruleset before i started playing the game and i often found myself having to resort to google to understand what was going on. There are some tooltips that for the most part manages to teach the basic stuff but the game could have done a much better job in introducing the ruleset to players new to it. I am also not in love with the ruleset in general or the skills available in the game. I would have prefered there to be a larger amount of skills/spells, especially for melee characters. This would also have served to force the player to be a bit more active in combat. Personally i found the combat to be a bit too slow for my taste and i would have prefered it to be a bit faster and there to be a few more options available. Another thing that i believe could be improved is the games story. The side quest are for the most part alright and delivers what you would expet them to do. The world is also interesting and portrayed in a nice way. But the main story takes a very long while to get going and even then it does not really go anywhere. It jumps around a lot and no plotline or character get enough time to actually develop into something that you care about. It really feels like wasted potential and it made the last ten or so hours of the game considerable less enjoyable than they could have been.The game is also very dice-rolley. Some may love this but it slows down the game quie a bit when you have to successfully bandage up all you teammaters after a fight and etc etc. I would also prefer to be able to fast travel everywhere instead of only being able to do that at certain spots.I do not wish to sound too negative about the game but since i did for the most part enjoy it. But it did not live up to the very high expectation that i had of the game after playing it for a couple of hours. The game took me around 30 hour to complete and i had a fair amount of side quest remaining.			",554,123,25,77,58,3,64

												I have not encountered any startup bugs.  The game plays like a very wonky version of Dragon Age Origins.  The graphics are very cartoony, at some points they appear to be cell shaded.  Overall, if you like D and D games, this is similar to the many clones out there.			",312,53,8,50,29,1,51

												The death throes of a company trying desperately to recapture the Baldur's Gate era of CRPG development somehow resulted in one final fantastic creation. Sail around, go questing, befriend a badger and kill evil gods. Plus, almost some of the voice acting is good!It's not based on DnD at all, so it may confuse you at first. Bear with it and discover a hidden gem of CRPG gaming!			",565,260,11,121,74,5,145

												Drakensang is one of the games I enjoyed playing when I got hook to RPG. The game do its best to put you into the story not just play the game. It makes you care about your character and your party members. DROT is prequel of the first Drakensang RPG, so, if you want to get to know the girl in the opening cut scene you might need to purchase the first Drakensang game. Pros+ Difficulty setting plus lots of character classes. Replay value.+ Story isn't boring. It doesn't reveal who are you gonna face until your almost at the end.+ Simple Combat. Enable you to strategies not just spam skills.+ Old games looks good one new PCsCons- Not that openworld compare to current European or Western RPG (I am from South East Asia) out today.

												A very good RPG game. Like Drakensang, this is a party-based RPG with tactical elements. Meaning you'll want to give orders to each character to make it through battles. The graphics are very nice (I believe better than Drakensang, but that could have been my imagination). The story was good, the music was good as well. A nice atmosphere for exploring.  Like the game before it, the game suffers from poor optimization, due to the game engine. It doesn't use much of your GPU or CPU processing power, and framerates can drop down into the 30s and 40s. This seems to be a problem with several of these related games by this developer. However, if you want a fun RPG with a good amount to do, this is a good one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Drakensang: The River of Time, turned out to be a beautiful and fun game to play, surprisingly! It is not a well-known game and I happen to stumble upon it while I was searching for new Fantasy/RPG's to play. I love the atmosphere of the game, the music is beautiful, the story and voice-acting good enough. The graphics are outdated, but the levels are lovely/colorful/cute and everything else makes up for it.You should try this game if you like:- Strategy/turn-based games- Fantasy/RPG's- D&D- Creating your own character, editing his/her skills and your party member's skills/characters as well- Dragon Age: Origins (gameplay feels similar)- Exploring, buying/selling gear from merchants- Loot, loot, lootIt is important that you understand the game's rules, you have to put effort in that and read a lot about it. I had to get used to the gameplay, the D&D-ish elements. I love playing D&D in 'real life' so I didn't mind :)I bought the first game of this series (Drakensang: The Dark Eye) yesterday, after finishing The River of Time in about 42 hours (I couldn't stop playing). So that says it all, I'd say ;)			",53,20,0,12,3,0,1

												This game is basically a singleplayer mmo, the quality of the world is old school mmorpg but has some nice singleplayer elements to it like voice acting, companions and an interesting story. I love these type of singleplayer games but to be honest i would rather play other, better games before playing this one. This game is alot like neverwinter nights 2 so if you liked that game you will probably like this too!			",289,87,6,51,22,2,44

You goddam better, they always have better storylines than your cliche young angsty hero with spiky hair saves the world that have cursed JRPGS. This game sticks you an a group of adventurers  on a quest to recover a crown stolen by a legendary theif. You fight tons of different enemies and the character sheet lets you make any type of hero you choose. This game is also beautiful, i have some screenshots of really neat scenery and fights.

												Classic RPG, you will have to think about how you build your characters.  The rule systems are functional for a new player, but so deep that a veteran can still research and learn some new tricks.  I would recommend reading up on how the armor system works, and how wounds work before creating a character.  Overall the game has a strong main story and enough side quests to keep it interesting.  I love what computers have done for RPG's!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A prequel to Drakensang; The Dark Eye and much better game.  It feels like they took all of the community complaints about the first one and improved most of the issues.The game is based off the German pen and paper RPG with deep character skillsets that can be daunting at first look.This is a story driven linear RPG.  Gather a group of followers, battle evil and grind dungeons.  Quick travel, paused combat, excellent interface, deep character skill customization and solid art.Voice acting is a tad cheesy but that is typical of Euro RPG's translated for an English audience.  Picked this up for $5 duing the current sale and am pleased.			",415,129,23,92,115,5,130

												This RPG is similar to others like Oblivion, Skyrim, The Witcher, and parts of it bring to mind the LOTR and Avatar movies, so nothing in it is particularly original. There is lots of exploring to do and it has a detailed crafting system which I find simpler and more fun than the one in Skyrim. The usual skills are there to improve, eg the ""plant lore"" skill will let your character pick better plants so as to make better potions using the ""alchemy"" skill, etc.  (On screen everything looks like a better version of the old The Guild games - medieval, organised and northern european.)Best of all, you can have a squad of up to four unique characters whom you equip and manage separately. Combat looks good and is made easy to manage by the game pausing automatically before the fights start so you can equip and prepare your squad and assign each of them to different targets, pausing as the fight progresses to adjust things. This makes for easy to manage battles.The graphics aren't cutting-edge, but the village environments are sunny and pleasant with lots of lively npcs around and the dungeons are creepy and atmospheric. The game has no obvious bugs or annoyances. In short, it is a very good, fun, game. Why isn't it better known?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: February 16, 2014
												Preface-Now this game creates an old-school pen and paper-campaign-feeling not with dudes saving the universe but a group of adventurers travelling down a river. It plays in the world of German pen and paper-RPG ""The Dark Eye"" back in the cozy days when the writers weren't all Earthdawn ft. Voldemort. It captures the saturday night gaming sessions of my youth rather well.Since game's now on steam I got it again - that's why I don't have that many hours clocked yet.Mood-Game is leisurely paced and feels mostly light-hearted compared to the dark and mature settings of the witcher or dragon age though there is also betrayal and murder. More an escapist fantasy into a heroic age so to speak. ""The grass was greener, the light was brighter.."" Morals reflect this as the party plays ""lawful-chaotic good"" in most cases. No Geralt-choosing-the-lesser-evil-moments this time around.Gameplay-Combat is real-time with pause not unlike dragon age but with the camera closer to the characters. Camera control is complicated - best use wasd for steering the character and the mouse with right button pressed for camera control. Battles are won by selecting the right actions and positioning your troups rather than overpowered inventory. Beside the magical gear items mostly reflect medieval equipment from the TDE rulebook.Your chars earn adventure points to spend on esoteric skills like ""seducing"", ""herbalism"", ""treat wounds"" and so on. The game will check those in dialogues same as race or profession (=archetype).There is also item crafting -blacksmithing, bowyer, alchemy.You can only create the first character from scratch from 22 archetypes like pirate, soldier or battlemage.Story-It's technically a prequel. The old adventurer guys you met last time around are still young and you find out why they became big buddies.Compared to Drakensang 1-Compared to the last time things improved. More waypoints, still some but less backtracking. No cheesy world saving this time. Less linear. Seriously part one can be skipped.River of time has a mostly fixed party to play due to story reasons.Compared to German Retail Version-Lacks the detailed 76p.-manual for the complicated ruleset and I think that's really lazy, DTP. So-so translation and voice-over quality.TL;DRClassical somewhat cliched but tasty and solid roleplaying experience. Pretty lighting and love of detail like the thoughtfully created medieval town add to immersion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Woud suggest playing this befor dark eye (only called drakensang on steam)The main story is kinda lame, most of the main quest is hunting down the same unintresting dude...the intresting part is the interaction with companions and some fun mini quests and overall intresting lore. Woud totaly suggest skipping some part btw like the hunting loge (reservation) the story is rly basic boring and thers simply loads of empy areas with some monsters..nothing intresting...no good loot etcTheres alot of empty pointless spaces in the game but thankfully theres a fast travel system...theres big parts that dont got more then some flowers some monsters and some generic loot (aka totaly pointless)Woud suggest to use a guide to find all the quests that pop up after evry chapter...can be kinda anoying running around the same city lots of times and only finding 1 quest that maby rewards a few ducats...that is if you feel the need to complete evry quest. ( no real need)The combat system is rly slow and when your in a combat heavy place i woud allmost suggest puting on the TV and simply let it for the most part fight it out itself...if you got good build and buffs you wont need to do more then auto attack and evry combat round takes 3-5?sec and both your guys and the enemys can miss for a few turns...so if the fight aint hard no point caring to mutch...its kinda like hybrid off worst part about dragonage and worst part of baldurs gate together xD...it woud be fine if the combat rounds was 1sec but yea...Werry complex skill system.I do like the game but the skill system makes it really unacceseable. The main stats sets your max skill level/spell level you can reatch (stat+3). Spells also use main stats sometimes by rolling a 20die agenst the stat and taking the result and reduce the effect by that..etcD (damage) is a 6dieMost skills are rather pointless. Bows/crossbows are bad..yes a unskilled bower can come close to dmg to a skilled fighter with high str with a spell but the problem is the parry system. When you wielding bow or crossbow all ""smart"" enemys will attack that char and he only uses evasion to defend with agenst enemys and if you doint highly focus on it you will prob be between 10-12 witch will lead to attacks succeed to a high agree agenst you. Yes with spells and some items you can get high evasion, but your parry will still be higher and melee damage will still be higher for the most part. Only reason to have bows is to make enemys stuck in a place and shoot from afar...but this can be done with spells aswell and game is to easy to care.Only really important non combat skills is arcane lore so you can identify some of the loot you get and picklock (can also be done by spell but woud suggest agenst becuse you get the spell in the mid game not early) can get you extra loot. Pickpocket can be used aswell but 99% of evryone will drop crap 0.9% will drop usefull things thats prob worse that what you alrdy got.If you build a really bad char then plant lore can be usefull becuse you will need to use alot of pots. Animal lore can be usefull (theres a pice of armor that you can only crate by having it, tho i never used it). Crafting skills you shoud have on your boat char that you dont bring along for combat. No reason to have crafting on any other...theres i think 2-3mini quests that reqest crafting but the reward is minimal and you can simply bring your crafter for those.Social skills give you a few choises when intreacting with ppl and will sometimes lead to more loot or allmost needed for some small quests..becuse combat is easy you can lev it on your party memebers but hardly needed...haveing 5-10 in haggle and use the haggle(ring?) makes stuff easyer to buy early in the game.Cash is easy to get, theres plenty of spots you can farm monsters and some crafted gear can be sold for 40-60d ea going plant lore and alchemy to try making money was a misstake i gotta say...ALOT of time wasted and the pots dont sell for that mutch.perseption simpy shows you traps and becuse traps are pointless to care about (in combat your dudes will run into them if you dont disarm within 1sec witch you cant) and the damage is low and exept 2 places(that i can think off) all traps is out of combat aka simply heal when someone accidently run into a trap. Dwarfnose is good becuse it reveals like 3-5? places in the whole game but still decent to take.survival simply shows plant on minimap (good if u want to go plant lore) and i think animals...pointlesstraps are pointless if you got a decent party...sure if all your dudes totaly blows traps can be usefull..but honeslt shoud not be neededWillpower is good becuse it reduce the ammont of wounds you get so if your armor reduce the main part of the damage you dont have to spam heal to remove all those woundstreat poison can be usefull if noone in your grp got the spell for it (no need for more then a few skill points to increase suceed % tho)treat wounds is usefull the begining/mid game becuse you dont have spells to remove the after death effect or high ammounts of wounds but when you got those spells its pritty pointless...takes to long to use in combatsneak is good for like 2? quests or something i dident do one of them and the other can be done with 6-7 sneaking and both are optinal and hardly needed. Sneak otherwise is pointless if you dont have high on all your chars so you can effectivly sneak past monsters (and xp, loot etc)1h+shield is better for low str players (no reason going 2h becuse u will need between 14-18str to not gain negative effect using them) overall exept a few exeptions the best gear is buable in the first town so simply run around and look at what you think looks nice and build your chars around that.1h+shield gives abit more defense and 2h (for high str users) gives abit more damage...staves..some give usefull buffs for mainly casters but i woud prob suggest agenst it..if you want 2h on a caster use spears becuse mortal blowbtw 13/3 meens at str 13 you will gain no negative effect and evry 3 str after that you will gain 1 bonus damage so a 19str char will gain +2dmgspells..Fastness of body is OP...you can simply cast that spell (increase armor) and maby a attribute buff then put on plate armor and you got crazy high armor..balm of healing is good in combat but request using non metal armorclarum purum is usefull to remove posions...otherwise most of the spells aint that good if you dont wish to rebuff evry sec in combat..fandango of fireflies is good effect but only 20sec lasting and takes about 5-10sec to cast so if you want it on the 2 that takes damage you cant do anything else in combat...Duplicatus double is decent at high levels (last 100+sec atleast) but only selfbuffMove as lightning is ok but last to short..even at high skill i never got it to last longer then 60sec and most of the time between 30-45damage spells is simply waste of EA better use melee damage and save it for the need of healing spells.Only attribute skill i woud care about is str...increase melee dmg, parry & attack (maby by minimal ammount) but still better then the others.skeletarius is a must on 1 charHaving atleast 1 caster is kinda needed (to cast heal and remove poision) but the others can be plated warriors. skeletarius is a must on 1 char..he allmost did more damage then my warriors and had better sruvivabilityso theres alot of bad choises rly with the skill system and in the end simply focus on melee damage and parry & hp is the way to gobtw woud suggest using offensive/defensive combat early to get better stats but later its bad becuse you want ED for skills..defensive combat can still be ok (you will prob not parry evry combat round)To add..only reason this game got more play time then the first is becuse i was totaly unsure of how to paly the game when i palyed this so remade chars plenty of times and did alot of not needed crap and in the dark eye one i skip alot			",122,40,0,92,10,0,33
