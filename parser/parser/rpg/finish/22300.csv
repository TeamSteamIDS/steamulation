												Don't lie. You're reading these reviews to build your hype for Fallout 4 for some reason. It's okay, I am too.EDIT 11/10/2015: You know what day it is right? Like, why are you reading this?P.S. Because I'm getting messages and comments from people saying ""Can I play this on Win 7???"" I'm just gonna list out the fixes required to make sure it runs just like it would on Vista (but better because you know, you're running 7 for a reason).1. Crash/Freezing issue at random points in the game:     -Run the game at least once    -Go here ( C:\Users\[Username]\Documents\My Games\Fallout3\Fallout.ini )    -Press ""Ctrl+F"" type (without quotation marks) ""bUseThreadedAI""    -Should read ""bUseThreadedAI=0"", change the 0 to 1 (if this line isn't there, add it anywhere in the      block of lines above the [Display] category of the file)    -(This next line shouldn't be in your file already but do a quick Ctrl+F to make sure, if it is change      it accordingly)    -Directly underneath ""bUseThreadedAI=1"", write ""iNumHWThreads=2"". If it's already there, just      change whatever value it is to ""2"".    Save & Exit2. Radio Music Stuttering     Preface: Now even with this fix in place, I still find occasional bouts where either music will not                  play from my Pip-Boy or the stuttering will return in a certain area for some odd reason.                  This is just a general fix that will help alleviate stuttering for ~95% of your game time.    -Download MADFilter      ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/maddxshow/files/MAD%20Filter/MADFilter%201.0.0.3/ )    -Extract ""MADFilter.ax"", ""register.bat"" and ""unregister.bat"" file to ( C:\Windows\SysWOW64 for      64-bit OS's or C:\Windows\system for 32-bit OS's)    -Once you've extracted the files to your directory, run the register.bat that is currently in your      SysWOW64 or system folder.    -Just to make sure you did the work correctly, download ""InstalledCodec""      ( http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/installedcodec.zip ), extract the zip and run the .exe once extracted    -Look for ""MAD Transform Filter"" and make sure it's installed. THEN, find ""Fraunhofer IIS MPEG      Layer-3 Codec"" in the utility. Right click it and select ""Disable Selected Items""    Run the game and on your pip-boy radio, select Galaxy News radio and listen to see if the     stuttering is still there. If it is, then you should go back and check which directory you pasted     the MADFilter file into and check InstalledCodec to ensure the MAD filter is installed and enabled     and then make sure the Fraunhofer codec is DISABLED. If this didn't work, there is a conflict     within your codecs and you may have another MP3 Codec installed and working on top of your     MAD Filter. I'd check InstalledCodec and see what may be conflicting.    Credit to GoldenShadow for helping me fix this years ago     ( http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=844931 )3. Random Crashes and Freezing fix AFTER the Fallout.ini fix:    This little guy over at Nexus may have a fix for you. If you're still crashing and freezing and have     no clue why, try downloading his d3d9.dll file and insert it into your game's source directory.    Download link: ( http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/18900/? )    (If you're in the same boat as myself and still have random crashes, freezes and all sorts of odd     mishaps in your game and you've done all of the fixes listed above, I'm afraid I have no other help     considering I've dug pretty far to find some other fixes and nothing has really helped. Best to just     Quicksave (F5 by default) as often as possible)P.P.S. Edited for Win 8 & 8.1 compatibility fixes (The following is provided thanks to the very generous blue_light1554)1. Basically, if your computer has two cores, you have to follow French Girls' steps for only ""1. Crash/Freezing issue at random points in the game:""2. Save the modified notepad text and exit.3. Then you put compatibility mode: Windows XP Service Pack 3You do that for ""Fallout 3 Launcher"" and the application named ""Fallout 3"".(...\Steam\Steamapps\Common\Fallout 3)4. Then visit this website: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/pc/DownloadClientThis will make you download a missing client required to make Fallout 3 work.5. When you've done all that, you right click on the Fallout 3 application and do ""Run as Administrator""6. It should work!7. I'm not an expert so if you have questions or it didn't work for you, go see the website shown here:  http://help.bethsoft.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9977 Maybe you'll find something else useful.EDIT 11/6/2013: I just upgrade from Win 7 to Win 10 and I can confirm Fallout 3 runs fine on the same exact system I did an entire playthrough on. Loaded it up and ran around a bit and it played just like it did on 7.			",239,28,4,20,7,0,13

Fallout 3 isn't just a game, It's an experience.Wow, since I'am getting so many thumbs up, I feel I should write something useful about this game and why I personally recommend it.+ One big continuous open world. Loading screens appear only when entering major cities or buildings.+ Very atmospheric and immersive world to explore.+ Every NPC’s are really living in that world. They follow their own daily routine from morning to night. You’ll meet them, talk to them and even remember their names.+ Good writing and a touching story. It is fun to talk to NPC’s and trying out different dialogue options to see the outcome.+ Freedom in almost every aspect. A quest can be completed in many ways. You can almost kill anybody you meet (even an entire town). You can be a good guy, a bad guy or have a mix of both. You can play as an action game or you can play stealthily. You can choose to play in 1st person or 3rd person. You can roam anywhere you want but….+ Enemies don’t scale.  So if you wander off to the wrong area during early levels, you will die easily.+ Many types of interesting enemies. Some are scary.+ Graphics.+ Voice acting.+ VATS+ Mods. A lot of them.+ Galaxy News Radio and...+ Three Dogs.+- Progression system and level cap (max level 30). The progression system is fun and addictive (with a lot of useful perks to choose) but I personally prefer Elder Scroll’s progression system where you get better at what you use. This way you can shape your preferred character with more flexibility and can even change your play style anytime. That’s why it is not a negative, it’s something that I have a mixed feeling.+- Dynamic day & night cycle. This game has day and night cycle but it is purely for cosmetic effect and doesn’t change or affect gameplay.- A.I’s are stupid sometimes, especially if you play stealthily.- Stealth gameplay could be better. Most area design doesn’t encourage stealth gameplay. No non-lethal option either.- Crafting options are very few. (Mods fixes this) - No iron sight aiming in 1st person. (Mods fixes this)			",77,8,4,9,2,1,5

Immersive & stimulating // Recommended for marathon gamers looking to get lost in a worldThis review is based on a purely vanilla playthrough.+ RPG & levelling elements; fairly standard in practice, but work well and mesh perfectly with the feel of the game+ Myriad available perks add enormous flexibility to a player's role+ Karma system is a lot of fun to play around with, and also goes a long way to showcase the consequences of one's actions+ Combat is fairly run-of-the-mill for an RPG FPS; certainly not fast-paced, but is implemented in a way that rewards planning and preparedeness+ V.A.T. system functions well-beyond a simple gimmick; functional to the point of being vital in its proper use, intensely fun, and sensationally cinematic (save for one minor scruple, outlined below)+ Environment, while graphically aged, is nonetheless incredibly detailed; there are always interesting things to find off the beaten path, and the player is encouraged in (and often rewarded for) exploring+ Map is expansive and populated with secrets and locations to visit+ Voice-acting is largely excellent, with only a few minor characters standing out as being less than exemplary in vocal quality+ Side-missions are well-detailed, fun & interesting to complete; the rewards for doing so can sometimes be extraordinary+ Plot moves forward at a pace set by the player, and is interesting to see through to the conclusion; writing ranges from passable to excellent, and never strays from the game's established charm+ Total freedom in the way problems are solved and obstables overcome+ Extremely, stupidly mod-friendly (via third-party applications - I recommend NexusMod, personally)+ Modular damage, for both the player and encountered enemies, is very well-implemented; damage to certain areas of the body will hurt perfomance appropriately, further emphasizing a sense of immersion+ Boasts a seemingly unending variety of items and weaponry; the hoarding game is real- Oddly enough, this game uses GFWL, but is easily bypassed (simply by exiting out); this won't be counted thrice against the game (as GFWL, in this case, appears bafflingly neutered), but it does pop up, so it should be mentioned- Camera can sometimes prove buggy and unreliable during V.A.T. kills- Character models and animations are below-average in presentation (easily remedied via third-party mods, of course)- There seems to be a bug where GFWL asks for a nonexistent product key; this is easily bypassed by simply exiding GFWL within the running gameLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit ",195,26,1,22,22,0,22

												The first ""Fallout"" game that I ever played. Got it on sale on Steam about a year after it came out (09').  I had no friends that had this game and I knew little to nothing about the story/gameplay etc. other then what Steam listed.  I love RPG games w/FPS elements, Deus Ex being another. Fallout 3 does a great job of letting you go at your own pace and shows what an open world environment can really feel like.  How the game starts  is fun too, seeing parts of your childhood. As the time comes when you leave your vault for first time the games says ""You have a main mission to do but what's that place over there..."".  It was impossible to see every thing even the first few time you play thru the game and I was always finding new places, people, missions, and weapons.  On top of all that there are 5 DLCs that add more areas to visit (""The Pitt"" and ""Broken Steel"" being my Fav) and help fill out the game even better then most other games I've played.  Most of my playthroughs still take as much as 100+ hours if you take time to visit most/all places as well as do all missions possible for you.  One last thing is this game has a fantastic modding community that can spice up the game and fix/improve just about any area you could think of in this game from, graphics/terrain to weapons/NPCs.  A must have game for RPG/FPS lovers.***9/10***			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is not just The elder scrolls with guns. Fallout 3 is a very easy game to immerse yourself into. I even find it difficult to be an evil character because of all the hard choices you can make in this game. Decisions can effect this game greatly for example there is a choice to blow up a town with a nuke. Karma is truly a b*tch in this game. It also does a good job at giving you that 1950's vibe. And especially the post-apocalyptic survivalist feeling. The exploration in the game is amazing with so many places to explore I have played this game for over 4 years and I dont think I have even covered the entire Capital Wasteland. The graphics could be better and there are a few bugs here and there but overall this game is completely worth buying you will not be disappointed. And remember ""War. War Never Changes.""

ULTIMATE Fallout 3 Setup & Mod guide Windows 10, 8 & 7 
A Guide for Fallout 3 - Game of the Year Edition
By: BenWah

			The best setup guide for Fallout 3!		


(Follow this guide in order to successfully play Fallout 3 on your Windows 7 & above)After getting this game to work properly on my windows 8, it still stands out to be the 'better' (in my opinion) fallout game for this generation of gamers. No disrespect to Fallout: New Vegas but i feel that game focuses mainly on survival and a 'western' setting rather than a true 'post-apocalyptic' like you see in Fallout 3.Mods make this game so much better, but however much more dangerous and unstable so install mods wisely. My advice? install small things like the street light mod and also install FOSE in order to get those working of couse and after maybe a couple of days of playing Fallout 3 with one simple mod gradually expand outward to big & better mods. Be careful though most mods require the DLC so get the DLC to the game ASAP (Which isn't a bad thing of course gives your system more 'breathing' room, but that's just my point of view).If you want a true wasteland expereince install the F03 Wanderers Edition from the Nexus to get the LOL! 'hardcore' mode that F:NV had but Fallout 3 didn't there is a ton of exploration to do in Fallout 3 (quicksave often) from the wasteland itself to the underbelly of the creepy, and dark subway systems. There is so much to do and so little time to do it.The companions in this game aren't really all that great they charge into a heated battle with a 99% chance of dying depending upon who you are fighting (ironically i perfer F:NV compainon system as they are 'smarter' than the ones in Fallout 3)By the end of the day Fallout 3 still stands as my personal  'post-apocalyptic' game to date, So if you want to explore the  harsh wasteland armed with an assault rifle and a whiskey bottle then this game is for you!

												When Fallout 3 was announced in 2004, not everyone was happy to hear that Bethesda would be the development studio to bring the Wasteland to life. The franchise's most hardcore fans were up in arms when they found out that their beloved Fallout was being turned into a first-person role-playing game, abandoning the originals' isometric perspective and ""dumbing it down"" for consoles. Plenty of folks complained that the game would just end up being ""Oblivion with guns"" (of course, some would argue that that's not exactly a bad thing, as 2006's Elder Scrolls title was one of that year's finest RPGs). I can safely say that while Fallout 3 bears an uncanny resemblance to Oblivion in some ways, but it's also a far superior game in many others.In the year 2077, nuclear war ravaged the world and forced a segment of the human race (well, the lucky ones anyway) underground to live out their days in massive Vaults that could protect them from the radiation-spawned terrors lurking outside in the Wasteland. Although the first two games in the Fallout series took place on the West Coast, Fallout 3 is set in the greater Washington D.C. area. Naturally, this means you'll see plenty of familiar landmarks, from the Washington Monument to the White House. You may be saddened to see that the famed Tidal Basin cherry blossoms don't bloom during a nuclear winter.Some 200 years after this nuclear holocaust, your character is born inside of one of these subterranean sanctuaries. The game actually kicks off after a brief prologue, with your character being forced out of the safety of your mother's womb into the hands of your waiting father. You'll take this time to name yourself and complete a ""projection"" of what you'll look like when you grow to adulthood, at which point your father's face will finally come into view. It's an interesting way to handle character creation, as well as show off the game's unique approach to presentation and customization.Before leaving the safety of the Vault for the horrors of the world outside, you'll need to determine what sort of character you'll be and how you'll approach the game. This begins when you find a book called ""You're S.P.E.C.I.A.L.,"" which teaches you about the most basic level of character creation. This is where you'll set your core attributes that will determine your Strength, Perception, Endurance, and so on. These attributes remain largely the same as you progress through the game, although you'll have the rare chance to alter them with perks, equipment, or good old-fashioned drugs. Once you've set your core attributes, you'll need to take a test to determine which skills your character is most adept at using. Like Oblivion, you'll have just over a dozen skills that you can excel in, with three of those being marked as tag skills. After taking the Generalized Occupational Aptitude Test (G.O.A.T.), you'll learn which skills you're best-suited to using, although it should be noted that you can choose your own destiny and fight against the establishment that's telling you how to live your life by choosing the skills you want to focus on. The test is actually more of a psychological profile than an actual test, with your answers determining where your strengths lie. While Fallout 3 could technically be called a first-person shooter, those looking for a Call of Duty 4-style experience will likely be disappointed. It's possible to run 'n gun your way through the game, but the FPS controls just aren't quite up to snuff. Thankfully this is alright since you've got the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (VATS) to help you in combat. Utilizing VATS stops the action and allows you to target individual body parts, which are presented with the percentage chance that you have of successfully hitting them. You'll likely spend the majority of your time in combat using VATS, occasionally finishing off your foes in real-time when you run out of the action points that fuels VATS.One area in which Fallout 3 doesn't resemble Oblivion is in its leveling system. While Oblivion rewarded you for doing specific things throughout the course of the game, here you'll only be able to upgrade your skills by earning experience points. These can be gained by doing everything from killing enemies and completing quests to winning speech challenges and successfully hacking computer terminals. There were times when I missed the ability to focus on improving a particular skill, although not having to spend hours practicing our sneaking skills just to gain a level or two was actually quite liberating.While there are plenty of memorable characters and places throughout the game, the real star of the show is the massive, wide-open environment. It's incredibly easy to get distracted from the main quest, and that's part of the fun, as you'll find yourself getting sucked into one side quest after another as your explore the Wasteland. Of course, this can lead to moments when you'll need to spend an inordinate amount of time walking from one location to the next, as you can't use the game's fast-travel system if you haven't visited your target location at least once. There are times when it feels like a bit of a grind, though at least you'll stumble upon plenty of cool locations during your travels. Given that it uses the same Gamebryo engine that powered Oblivion, it's probably not surprising to learn that Fallout 3 is a helluva great-looking game. Sure, the characters still look a bit weird while they're talking, and you'll likely notice some draw distance issues no matter which version you play, but this is still one of the most visually impressive games of 2008. The PC version looks particularly nice, especially since it runs at a smooth and steady 60 frames per second with only occasional dips. Fallout 3 is an admirable achievement for Bethesda. It’s a game that provides action, adventure, exploration, interaction and excitement in a beautifully realised Armageddon that provides so many unexpected moments, but somehow manages to remain consistent and believable.

It has all the right elements: post-apocaliptic world, set in a parallel time, great GREAT atmosphere, weapon costumisation, great story, decisions affect the gameplay, best SOUNDTRACK in a game EVER, great voice acting, V.A.T.S. system and Liam Neeson.Seriously this is one of my favourite games and I highly recommned it.

YouTube™ Video: Fallout 3 ON WINDOWS 10 FIXED (New game crash) 

			Views: 17,277		

			This is everything I had to do in order to play fallout 3 on my PC. It took me awhile to fix the issue but hopefully this help.		

IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS 10, THEN CLICK ABOVE AND USE THIS TUTORIAL WORKS!I have Windows 10 and I bought this game yesterday. At first the game kept crashing when I click ""New Game"". I found out that the reason why the game wasn't compatible is because of the pixels- and ""things"".So I went on YouTube for some tutorials-cause I already wasted five dollars and I was tired of seeing people complain about this game. This tutorial actually works! All you need to do is change the compatibility on two files, download a patch, and copy and paste the files onto Fallout. It's really simple and quick so that you're able to play!Edit (3/11/17) - I just realized that it doesn't change the amount of time played, so it won't give you the achievements and such :/			",1,1,0,2,1,0,0

												I got this game through trading and it's the best thing I've bought using digital keys.This is the only game I know in existence (aside from FALLOUT: NEW VEGAS of course) that gives you the ability to talk a loser out of shooting you, make said loser feel guilty about their life choices AND extort the poor sap while you're at it. This game showed me that there are indeed other ways to solve your problems aside from shooting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the face... namely getting everything that person owns along with interest and then leaving them to rot in the nuclear wastelands of Washington DC.10/10			",11,2,0,2,0,0,0

												Amazing game, I originally played this on the PS3 when it first came out. Was pretty good but graphics sucked because I was broke at the time and playing it on a 19 inch CRT (like the ones you used to have in your bedroom in the 90's). So when I bought this on a steam sale for like $5 or something. I decided I would play it right. I then spent the next 2 days, modding the heck out of it with Nexus Mod's. Oh my I made this 6 year old game look fricking goergous. Much prettier then even Skyrim. It was one of the most immersive game's I had ever played. (One of the mods I used launched it in a weird way so steam never recorded my time playing it which is why it says iv only played it for 5 minutes). I seriously recomend picking this up in a steam sale, and take your time modding it. Then get a good solid uninterupted weekend, Lots of nice cold water and some snacks. And just sit there and play the crap out of it for that awsome weekend. It's that type of game.			",107,6,3,14,8,0,12

												I am going to start this review with controversy. Of the Fallout series I think Fallout 3 is the best of them. Now before you start flaming me over the fact your prefer Fallout: New Vegas or Fallout 1 for instance, let me try and explain this.Fallout 1 & 2 remain good classics, that must be played by any fan of the later Fallouts, if only for the feel of it for the moment. The first Fallouts had the best incentive to go away from the safety of community, because either your vault or your tribe was in danger - both of them showing much of Fallout world. However, that said although I enjoy pixelated games... they are pixalated games and some of the tactic options are for the time excellent, but now outdated.Fallout 3's incentive to travel is a bit odd. You must basically because you are thrown out and you are supposed to set out on your family member that walked out on you (before you go 'What?!', sorry I won't spoil more). This incentive is rather... odd. However, than comes Fallout 3 itself. Although opinions aside about the radio jockey - a controversy in the community - the added old school music and now stunning graphics make the Fallout world come to live. Although some errors in cannon can be found, most quests are excellent and tie into the world itself. Also allowing free roaming like the old game, but now the road itself is just as interresting - something Fallout 1 & 2 were less able do due to technical reasons (random encounters based on luck (or unluck)).The main quest can be ended in much shorter time than I played in it, heck I have several lives, but I also have but one expansion. Still if you focus on only the mainquest than you are doing it wrong. Go out and explore and feel like an adventurer in a dismal post-apocolyptic world.			",16,8,0,12,4,1,3

												A DAY IN THE WORLD OF FALLOUT 3As you open the door out of Moriarty’s Saloon into the broken-down city of Megaton, the sun blinds you, reminding the inhabitants of the Wasteland of the power of radiation. You walk down the rickety old stairs and into the heart of the town. People greet you as you pass, and you can almost smell their respect for you, as you have shown your resolve many times by defending their lives. Your laser rifle bounces on your Vault-Tec armored jumpsuit, and your trusty 32. Caliber pistol hangs at your side. As you are about to leave the rundown town, a tall man in a hat and sheriff’s badge approaches you. He tells you of a group of Super-Mutants that has attacked a nearby village. He offers 700 caps for you to eradicate them, a handsome reward. You pull out your Pip-Boy on your arm, and mark the destination on your map. You nod your thanks to the sheriff, and set out, your loyal dog at your side. The doors out of the city open, and the strong smell of death and smoke fills your nostrils. You resist the urge to guzzle your bottle of whisky in your pack, knowing that you will need the ability to perceive all you can in the battle ahead.               As you reach the war-torn village, you hear the cries of the Mutants and the screams of the people, as they flee in terror. A Super Mutant notices you, and grabbing his club, he runs at you, yelling murderous threats. You calmly take out your rifle, aim, and blow his head off his shoulders. You feel the acidic blood spray your skin as the giant topples to the ground in a heap. You walk over to the corpse and feel his pockets for stray caps. None. You grunt, drawing your pistol and shooting the arm off an incoming Super-Mutant. He falls to his knees, yelling guttural cries at you. You walk over to him and, brandishing your brass knuckles, punch him in the face so hard that you feel his bones break. As his limp body crumples to the ground, you see who you came here for. Over twelve feet tall, brandishing an assault rifle and nail-board, clad in Kevlar armor was the chieftain, the Super-Mutant Brute. He roars, firing round after round at you, as you try to find cover. As the bullets pierce the bunker that you hide behind, you ready a bottlecap mine. As you hear the gun click and the cursing stop, you know that the creature is reloading his weapon. You quickly stand up, and diving for cover, throw the highly explosive mine at his feet. Too preoccupied with filling his gun with more rounds, he doesn’t seem to notice it. You aim your pistol at his feet, thinking to blow the mine where he stands. The Brute lets out a raucous laugh, reaches down, and picking up the bottlecap mine, he hurls it at you. Your vision blurs in a burst of light, and searing pain covers your entire body. Your eyes burn and you can only see a hazy sight of a hulking creature walk over to you. It raises a large object, and brings it down on your head in a flash of bright light, then, everything goes dark.Fallout 3 is a gritty, atmospheric, open-world RPG that has you exploring a post-apocalyptic wasteland crawling with both friendly and combative inhabitants. With a cast of interesting and unforgettable characters, along with the most unique locations to explore, and a deep and brutal combat system to bind it all together, the world of Fallout is a masterpiece. With its immersive sound and visual design, you will soon start to feel the effects of radiation on your body as you enter the world Fallout 3. Welcome to the Wasteland.			",59,0,1,8,4,0,1

												This game is easily one of my favorite games of all time, just everything about it I love. Bethesda really nails the whole post-apocalyptic feeling, because everything just feels empty and deserted. These days the game looks pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and even back in 2008 when I first played this game, I didn't think it looked that impressive (Dem Mods though). I admit that I'm a little spoiled by New Vegas, so the mechanics in FO3 don't feel quite as good as they do in New Vegas, but using VATS and the gameplay itself is excellent. I enjoyed all the songs in the game, but I really wish they would have added more, especially with all the DLC this game has. The karma system is something I feel all RPG's should have and while some of the decisions you make don't really affect things as a whole, it's still nice to have multiple choices to the quests you do. Audio as a whole is excellent (as stated with the music) but it just feels limited with the amount of the voice actors and the songs on the radio, the quality is definitely there though. I honestly could keep going on why I love this game so much and there is a lot of stuff I haven't even seen yet (DLC and Mods) but there is one big issue that makes me question this version in particular. On Windows 7, this game would crash at least every hour for me and sometimes it would be even worse. You would think with a game as popular as FO3, that Bethesda would at least fix something as big as this is, but they haven't. I have played this on Xbox 360 before and it maybe crashed 1 or 2 times (it's pretty sad when the console version of your game, performs better than the far superior PC). If you can deal with the technical issues, then you're in for one of the best RPG's of all time, up there with games like Mass Effect 2, Dragon Age: Origins, Skyrim, and KOTOR. Regardless of any of the negative things I said about FO3, I think one of the most important aspects of any game is fun and if I can sit and enjoy a game for extended play sessions for weeks and keep coming back to it after I already beat it before, well I think that's what every game should strive for.10/10 A Masterpiece			",226,32,1,22,10,1,17

												Personal Rating: Loved it.Classic Rating: ★★★★★I rushed a bit on finale because I wanted to see how it would end, but enjoyed most of its side quests and explored almost every inch of the places I traveled to.The post-apocalyptic atmosphere and OST[archive.org] are amazing, you are free to behave the way you like (and take its consequences), explore the wasteland as much as you like and become the lone wanderer.Played on Windows Seven x64 without too many problems, only some random crashes here and there - this guide covers all of the possible issues and proposes a solution for every one of them.Would play it again and I feel like recommending it 100%.

												A wonderful game - given 9/10 almost perfect. I found this game to very enjoyable. Unlike many of our games today. This one felt much more immersive. Despite having older graphics and sometimes glitchy gameplay. The story and moral choices are touching and make you almost geninually care about finding your dad. Gameplay wise it is very well rounded. Unlike Fallout NV combat is much more simple. Seeing as how there is simply one type of ammo. Then you shoot said ammo. Nothing else. But NV boasted more guns and more mods for guns. But if you want a much better made game Fallout 3 is probably a better choice. It really works well on immersion. It lacks the painful abundance of loading screens in NV. While the wasteland around you almost feels fearful. Seeing as how you can run into raiders/mutants/dogs/bears/and basiclly anything else. If you are looking for a memorable game. This is probably it. HOWEVER one problem I noticed was that there was a point that one will reach in the game. Where finding supplies become basiclly an after thought. Seeing as how I soon had stocked up 400+ ""rare"" MC cells. This impairs it but not totally killing it. If you had to buy either NV or 3. Choose 3 <----------- half loaf 3 confirmed			",34,0,0,5,4,0,0

												Fallout 3, what a game this is, as it was the FIRST 3D game of the series, Bethesda stept up it games and created this masterpiece of as game. I've played this game since it was released back in 2008, at first, seeing I was only young took a large amount of time to get the ♥♥♥♥ out of the Vault becuase I was a retard but when I did (Eventually) Fallout 3 almost instantaniously made my Top 5 and when I mean instantaniously, I mean after around 3 Missions. I played this on XBOX at first and I rounded up around 2.500+ hours of roaming the Wasteland as a level 30+, seeing the End of the game it was a HUGE hit to the heart and it was suddenly then I realized this Is the sort of game genre I like, and since then I have become one of the biggest fan of these games and now that Fallout 4 is announced I can't wait to say what a magical show it will bring as the MOST hyped game of this year. Thanks Bethesda.Rating: 11/10			",95,4,4,8,14,0,3

												UPDATED REVIEW:Fallout 3 is one of my favorite games of all time and my favorite fallout game. While I have put in more hours in new vegas (which is an equally awesome game) I have far more fond memories of fallout 3.I highly reccomend getting the GOTY edition as you will save more money on the DLC's. While fallout 3 might not be perfect, (it has a few issues here and there) its a great post apocolyptic roleplaying game. So go buy it already!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(Don't focus too much on the negative reviews because it's mainly about a number of people that don't know how to search up a simple tutorial or a guide on how to fix the optimization issue) The main reason why I started to play Fallout 3 is because of hype for Fallout 4. I'm waiting for so long and it's getting on my nerves quite frankly. But, at some time when I was playing, this idea got off of my mind and I actually had one of the most fun that I ever had during my playtime. The gameplay feels right, the pip-boy is a great feature, the soundtrack and the music has to be one of the best to date, and the story is amazing. If you like RPGs and open-world games, this is totally a must buy. But the debate comes upon everyone every once in a while about, which Fallout game is better. Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 3? Well, I couldn't decide so I just bought both of them. But if you want to look at the open world aspect and the terrain, Fallout 3 is a lot better. The empty wasteland of Fallout New Vegas just seemed a little boring, only seeing something interesting in your path every now and again. It might be a little trouble first playing it because of the compatibilitie issues, but once you've fixed that, you'll have fun. PS: What are you doing reading my review?! Go play Fallout 4 right now!			",95,17,9,11,5,2,4

												War; war never changes...I love this game, before I didnt understand why fallout fans said ""fallout 3 is better than new vegas"" and always thought they were ""cridics"". So one day I added steam funds and thought, I have the funds to buy whatever I wanted, so I bought this game to see if the fallout ""critics"" were lieing or telling the truth. After hours of playing the game, and beating it, I was like ""Holy sh*t, this is the best game ever!"" I loved it from the beggining from the end, the begginging has a toutching story that fallout new vegas didnt have, and also the ending was more impacted at the end than fallout new vegas, jezz, I soud like a fallout ""critic"".

												Played more than 75 hours, loved every minute of it. If you haven't bought this game yet and you have some money left, BUY it! Wow! wow! wow! wait! I don't recommend that you buy Fallout 3 standard edition, because I regret that I bought the standard edition. So listen to me: DON'T BUY the STANDARD EDITION, but do BUY the GAME OF THE YEAR EDITION. The main reason is that all dlc's are worth it and it'll cost you more when you buy the standard edition. My second reason is that some mods do require all dlc's. I hope this will help people and that they don't buy the standard editon but the GOTY edition.My rating for this game is: 9/10  ",26,3,0,9,2,0,0

The game is great, but I don't believe it should be on Steam if a majority of modern computers are going to have trouble running it.			",132,28,1,16,18,1,20

FALLOUT 3 GAME REVIEWIntroductionWhen I was younger, I played this game on XBOX (those were dark days) and failed to even reach megaton (The first place you come to in the open world after what is essentially a tutorial level). Got fallout new vegas on steam soon after I got a gaming PC. I loved it. I loved skyrim too so i decided to replay fallout 3 to see if i was just an idiot when i was younger. SPOILER. i was.It has a few issues with windows 7, and multiple monitors but more or less all bug fixes can be found here[pcgamingwiki.com]. nexus mod manager has loads of bug fixes and graphical upgrades for those who wan't them. If you are just interested in how good I thing this game is, and not why it is, then skip to the conclusion. but i urge you to read the whole thing to make up your own mindNegativesHere are a few things that are wrong with this game.1.No Patch or bug fix for windows 7this game has been about for ages. but it refuses to work with modern operating systems. bethesda could get so many more sales if they just released a patch. they could just release some user created patch's as an update. it wouldn't even take much time or money. This is (in my opinion) their best game and its going into a state of ruin. if the modding community was not there to support it. it wouldn't even be playable.2.Games for windows liveOk so it's not as bad as uplay or god forbid, origin, but its still irritating. not to mention the fact that it has cause numorous bugs and save corruptions/wipes in many games. many games now are having this tumor surgically removed but not this one. you can patch it out using mods and nexus mod manager but this should have been done as a patch by bethesda. Again, bethesda's best game is being dragged down by the lack of a simple patch, that not only would increase the sales and plays of the game but be cheap and cost virtually no time at all. 3.When  Your father dies  so your dad has this big project that is called project purity and it basically produces purified water from dirty water. and these bad guys called the enclave want it so they can infect it with a virus and wipe out all humans and other species who have even slightly mutated  since the war 200 years ago. and at the controll panel they ask your dad to activate it so he locks the door and floods it with radiation. one question. WHY???. at this point in the game i had full power armor (T51-B arguably the best model in the game) and ton of alien weaponry (from motehrship zeta). and he only killed some general guy and a foot soldier. i killed more men just getting here! his death was unneccisary and it really feels like its shoe-horned in to give the player a reason to hate the enclave.4.The endingThe ending is complete rubbish. you have a choice to sacrifice yourself or tell either your mutant side-kick (if you have him) who won't actually die or some random brotherhood of steel woman to sacrifice themselves instead. i have a number of problems with this, the first being that if you chose to let them die, you die anyway, with no explination. the game simpley fades away and starts narating your life and all the stuff you have done. no explination given at all. its like they just ran out of time and said ""well people will only choose to sacrifice themselves right? ... right? ... RIGHT?"". not to mention the fact taht you only die because you need to enter the room your dad filled with radiation for no good reason!  THIS MAKES THE BROKEN STEEL DLC  PRETTY MUCH REQUIRED - thats all im saying without using spoilers  becasue it increases level cap and removes the crappy ending. as well as giving a flimsy explination as to why you 'died' even if you didn't sacrifice yourself.PositivesBut that's just the negatives, here are some positives:1.It is bethesda's best gameif you like skyrim. its that but with technology instead of magic and guns. lots and lots of guns.2.It is scary.not the jump scare kind of way. this game is atmospherically scary. when you are trekking through the abandoned, dark gloomy subway tunnels hearing the muffeled movement of the ghoulified remains of humans all around you. it getts pretty tense. afetr a while of straight playing you become slightly desensitised to the fear. but it's really good while it lasts and if you get the point lookout DLC then it does (when you travel to point lookout anyway) become really scarry again. 3.The story is amazingThe story, despite its faults, is really good. it becomes really immersive and the choices you have to make are sometimes really moraly grey. for instance i had a choice between killing this man who was routed to the spot for decades, unable to move, with little conversation and immense boredom. while having his insides torn slowly from his body by a tree that had grown around him. or speeding up the recovery of the wasteland. and improving life for everyone. it was a really difficult choice but I had to choose improving everyones life over his.4.World Designthe world is teeming with secrets and, while it may not be very large, requires quite a lot of exploration to find everything. random encounters make thsi all the more intresting also.ConclusionIn conclusion, I think Fallout 3 is an excellent game. it may have its issues, but most can be fixed by getting the DLC and user created mod's.It is by far bethesda's greatest game and the best in the fallout franchise. it is lore is rich and immersive and the music is some of the best i have heard (in terms of actually songs that include vocals and are in the game as radio tracks or jukebox records. not background music). The lack of achievements is saddening. I would really like to 100% this game, but alass it seems bethesda did little more than shove this game on steam without continuued support or additional features. a shame really.If I was to give an arbitrary score to this game it would be around 8/10, losing a point purely for its lack of achievements, a few story plot holes and its inability to work on most windows 7 (and 8) PC's. overall its a great game and i completely recromend it over fallout: new vegas. or any game for that matter. just make sure you get the broken steel DLC and point lookout if you want to keep the scary atmosphere going.

EARLY REVIEW - EXPECT A MORE THOUROGH REVIEW LATER.This game is fantastic. The reason a lot of people are downvoting it is because it's hard to get working. I managed to fix it in about 15 minutes using steps 1 and 2 on this guide: https://steamcommunity.com/app/22370/discussions/0/828937546147175081/Don't skip step 2. It says optional but it really isn't. Ironically that means you have to update hen completely remove Games for Windows LIVE.Aside from all this, I'm quite early in the game, but I'm enjoying myself alot. I played New Vegas first, which I will say is somewhat better than Fallout 3 in most ways, but Fallout 4 is at about the same level as Fallout 3, just in a different way. And hey, if it doesn't work, just do a Steam Refund, cause they exist now.			",127,21,1,7,12,0,5

												Fallout 3 requires to be played in Windows XP service pack (3) Compatibility mode if you are running Windows 7 and above. It also requires Windows LIVE installed. I have tested the game and so far I did not encounter any crashing, I will update review as I go along and if I find any issues I will post them here.After following bethesda's guide to get fallout 3 working on Windows 10, I got the game to work.

												Though it is REALLY, REALLY, REALLY (ad nauseam) bad/horrible/crappy/steaming pile of bull dookie that Bethesda won't patch to make this work with Windows 7/8.x/10, and remove the now abondoned Games for Window Live (a.k.a. GFWL)..though there is a GFWL patch from Microsoft, and there are guides (both here on Steam, and around the net) to get it to run on newer OS's. To get it to run on new er OS's:http://steamcommunity.com/app/22370/discussions/0/828937546147175081/There is also the mod Tale of Two Wastelands, it converts Fallout 3 to the Fallout: New Vegas Engine, and you can travel between both wastelands!http://taleoftwowastelands.com/This game is incredibly awesome. I can't say enough about it and is one that I come back and play again regularly. The main story is not all that long really, but that ins't the meat of the game.. exploration and all the side quests are.Edit to add, I have WAY more hours in game than what it shows I have... not sure why but that is, but I actually have closer to triple the listed hours... just noticed that, wonder why the hours count is so far off....

There are configuration changes found online that might help some, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to always work.

												Fallout 3 is an amazing game I spent at least 200 hours on, the price of 10 euro is 100% worth it and is one my most reccomended games of all time! People who have windows 7/8/10 CANNOT install and play the game straight away (like many of the 'Reviews' mentioned) but there are guides on youtube that fix this problem and is incredibly easy to do. i was 13 when i first started playing this game and wasnt at all 'in the know' about complicated Computer stuff and overall wasnt very 'techy' and was able to do the fix on youtube that took me about an hour, if i was able to do it, anyone can. This Review was less about the game (which I highly reccommend), but more for to let people know about the many, easy guides on youtube to help you get going in the game and to not let the below Reviews/comments turn you off buying this game.Hope This Helped!

												Fallout 3 is a stellar game whose value has not diminished by the years that have passed. The game is tailored to your choices and personal playstyle, has an enormous and incredibly detailed map with endless exploration, a great main plot and plenty of meaningful and deep side quests, realistic AI and cities, more lore than you can handle, and is worth hundreds of hours of playtime. The game is an RPG, adventure, horror, FPS, survival, and open-world game rolled into post-apocalyptic masterpiece. 9.5/10			",51,7,0,8,5,0,3

												I thought i should rewrite my review, since my old one is.. well old, and horrible, so here we go! This game is probably the most unique game i've ever played, its a open world RPG much like The Elder Scrolls games, but Fallout has much more, such as radiation poisining, cripable limbs, better atmosphere and more realisim. The story begins with your birth, and in a quick pace progresses to the most important moments of your childhood, such as the time you get your Pipboy 3000. You live in Vault 101, a place made to keep its citizens alive during the nuclear war that happened on the surface. But, Vault 101's doors never opened after the nuclear war. Everybody was to repopulate and die in Vault 101, nobody was to leave and nobody was to enter. But of course you got out because.. who would want to live in a scary vault filled with people for the rest of your life? After your childhood ""dream"" ends you are awakened by alarms, you are very confused. Your best friend tells you that your father left Vault 101. You decide to leave Vault 101, as it is no longer safe, creatures from the outside have poured in because of your father opening the Vault door. When going outside of the vault, you can already feel the atmosphere, how amazing it is. In the distance you see cities, and of course, The wastelands. Now you should be ready to feel the awesomeness of the game, the quests. In Fallout 3, there are many ways to finish quests. Lets say you need to get past a door, but you need a key to open the door. You could always pick pocket the person who owns the key, but depending on your skill level, he will notice, and start to kill you. You could also blow his brains out, easiest way to do it. But whatever you do, it will impact the future of your game. If you were bad throughout the game, and killed lots of innocent people, your Karma will go down. But if you do good things, your Karma will stay at a neutral level, or gain. Everytime you level up, you can choose a perk you would like to advance in, and you will get a certain amount of skill points to upgrade your stats. Also, theres a neat aiming system called VATs, its really hard to explain what it actually does, but you could always YouTube it.Graphics: 8/10 (they are good, but not even close to newer games)Sound: 9/10Gameplay: 9.5/10			",253,43,7,35,17,3,23

												The quests and atmosphere are where this game shines. It's staggering how nearly every character you meet has an interesting story to tell considering how large the game world is, and, especially for first time players, the ruins of D.C. provide a fun mix of rubble, raiders, and scenic views to keep you occupied as you traverse from one mysterious tick on your compass to another. Just like so many other Bethesda games, the main questline isn't very interersting compared to the other quests scattered throughout the world, and you'll find yourself putting it off until later over and over. Oh, and blowing the heads off raiders is super satisfying.			",49,3,0,7,2,1,2

												I've been bored to tears by every western RPG I've played... until this one. I had a really memorable time with Fallout 3. I was really amazed by how much freedom the game gives you. The story, soundtrack, level progression, locations, all of them add up to a really wonderful experience.The only downsides to this game is that it requires a fanmade patch to run on Windows 10. Also, for some reason the game never integrated properly with the Steam client on my PC, probably due to GFWL. So I never had access to the Steam overlay as I played, and it never counted my hours played. Despite the hour count you see above, I actually played this for dozens and dozens of hours.

												This Game is Skyrim With Guns. What's not to love? Fallout 3 is one of my favorite games, This is why1: Nice to Bad computers: I have a 1gb low end pc.  But Fallout 3 plays with little lag, A average 29-30 fps.2: Karma: I love how you can choose to be a Good guy or Bad guy.Overall rating 9/10 Very goodRecommended? Yes, But not to gaming pc's, Fallout doesn't have a good time keeping the game stable on Very expensive quad core Windows 7's. lelPerfect Christmas Gift? Umm.. If they dont have a super pc, Then yes, Fallout will make a great gift.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well if you havent heard of Fallout 3 yet, you've missed quite a lot.It's a fun, giant open world filled with lore, humor, items, weaponry, bandits, ammunation and death. I must admit, I enjoyed Fallout: New Vegas more than this game but that doesn't mean the Fallout 3 is not a great game. Hell, it's one hell of a good game! The gameplay is really fun, using VATS or just sniping the badguys, looting their bodies afterwards. If you want you can also take a loyal (but sometimes annoying) companion with you so your journey on this hell bent wasteland is not so bad and not so lonely. You can also switch between first and third-person if you like while in the background some smooth 20th century music is playing as you sneak towards and pickpocket your typical bandit, headshot that supermutant from 100m away or feed the ghouls some lead with the minigun you just found.Fallout 3 provides a lot of fun gameplay and a world you can delve into.

If you are using a shiny pan, 375.Combine the crumbs, melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on.Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter.For the batter:.Make sure everything is at room temperature.Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this.Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition.Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours.Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight.Release the sides of the springform.Eat.			",18,3,0,3,4,0,2

TLDR VERDICTThough dated, Fallout 3s good writing and survivalist atmosphere more than makes up for the technical and visual issues. A good 100+ hour world to get lost in, and would recommend DLCs too.FULL REVIEW BELOW“Man had succeeded in destroying the world – but war, war never changes” – Ron PearlmanThe year is 2277 and it has been 200 years since the Great War that consumed the Earth in nuclear fire and radiation. You are a resident of Vault 101, one of many underground shelters built before the war. The door to Vault 101 slides open for the first time in 200 years, and you emerge into the ruins of Washington D.C, now known as The Capital Wasteland.This review is written from the perspective of a fan of RPGs and story-driven games, who hasn’t played any other Fallout games.GAMEPLAY AND DESIGNFallout 3 is a massive open world sandbox RPG that can be played from a first or third-person perspective. You are thrust into the world and given a goal, but it is up to you to decide how long you want to take to reach it. The Capital Wasteland is a harsh and sprawling land that lets you go wherever you want, whenever you want. The map is absolutely huge, consisting of downtown DC and all of its surrounding areas ranging from sewers to suburbs. The absolutely huge amount of approaches to the land can be overwhelming for some players. You may struggle with knowing where to start, especially given the fact the game offers very little direction. Just doing quests would probably only uncover a quarter to a third of the entire map, so players that prefer independent exploration and spontaneous discovery will get a lot of more value vs. someone who follows the quest markers.The progression system is fair and you start to feel more powerful over the course of the game, however by the end if you play your stats right you can literally have a jack of all trades, master of all character. Being able to cap every single stat on one character can eliminate some replay ability meaning the only reason to start another character would be alternative morality choices. On the other hand, it does eliminate the annoying factor of not being able to see what’s behind that door because I’m one point too short in this specific stat for people who don’t have time for 5 different playthroughs. Enemy difficulty adapts to your character level rather than the areas. This means that no matter where you go, the enemies will always be at your level. This is good as it keeps the combat fresh and evolving all the way to the very end, but bad because you can't stomp early game areas. It also allows players to explore freely at any point in the game without the risk of being suddenly disintegrated by some level 30 mob and losing 3 hours of progress because you forgot to save. I really like the way the game handles the exploration and looting systems. You can fast travel back to any area you’ve discovered. This sparks the age old argument of immersion vs. quality of life, but hey, you’re not forced to use it. As you work your way through the game you slowly progress from picking up as much useless crap as you can carry to analysing the environment and cherry picking the most relevant and valuable stuff. For example, I didn’t see the point in lugging around a motorcycle gas tank until I found out you can build a flaming sword out of them and began hunting for them. I hoarded seemingly useless scrap metal until it paid off because it turned out some guy in a city was willing to pay for it to fix some pipes. I felt a wasteland junk expert by the end, as my approach to every new room became systematically rummaging through filing cabinets and desks for valuables that extend beyond money vs. not money.STORY AND NARRATIVEFallout 3s story is essentially structured into the main quest, side quests and DLC quests.  The main quest itself is a pretty mediocre story about finding your dad. It has its moments, but ultimately just serves to give the game a beginning and end. The middle portion, you will spend getting lost in the sometimes great, sometimes bad and sometimes plain weird side quests. The side quests are few in number (given the games size) and you won’t see 4 or 5 people with floating question marks on their heads asking you to fetch 12 bear asses. The role play aspect plays a big role in these side quests, allowing you to morally be the second coming of Christ, a boring stoic neutral dude, or Lucifer himself. This can cause quests to branch a few different ways (your stats can come into play during conversations too) but ultimately it usually ends up resulting to being good or evil. The excellent DLC packs definitely present a lot more ambiguous choices where you really have to think about things beyond being good or evil. Every DLC adds something to the game both story and gameplay wise, and I whole heartedly recommend getting them all (or the Ultimate Edition) if you can.The other side of the story telling is more subtle than speaking to townsfolk and being explicitly told what’s going on. A lot of the locations in the game contain stories that you figure out, rather than being told. For example, I entered a motel room with a bunch of long dead skeletons, some guns and pre-war cash laying around. Some people would just loot the joint and move on, and that’s fine. Other people will look around and realise through the way the bodies and guns are positioned and seeing the pre-war money was leading back to a briefcase in the middle of the room, that a standoff after a bank heist took place in this room over 200 years ago. Bethesda put a lot of TLC and work into deliberately laying places out this way. It’s not just a random composition, there is a reason why everything is the way it is. You may think it’s a shame that so much work was put into things most players would miss, but I prefer the think that the fact that so many players miss it makes it much more special for the players that catch it.The voiceover work can be a bit hit and miss, with the stand out performances being Ron Pearlman’s narration and Liam Neeson as your dad. Everything else is ok, or sometimes outright embarrassing, but I suppose that’s fair enough given the sheer amount of people there are to converse with. Your character isn’t voice acted, which of course gives a lot more freedom to the writers regarding conversation options. The writing is the real star of the show in this game. The game also offers a couple interesting radio stations to listen to whilst you roam the wastes, but in a game as long as this you will run into a lot of recurring dialogue and music that unfortunately gets old fast.GRAPHICS AND PERFORAMANCEFallout 3 was released in 2008 and it shows. It is by no means an ugly game and the scale of the world definitely makes up for the lack of eye candy.  The scale of the world also results in lots and lots of bugs. Some can be game breaking (albeit rarely) and others are just irritating or sometimes humorous. Ultimately I would say it’s worth powering through them to play the game. The game also has some major stability issues, especially on newer hardware. For instance I was having issues because for some reason this game was having issues with an OS newer than Vista and a processor with more than two cores. Almost everyone falls under that blanket these days and although these have easy fixes they are still annoying to deal with. The game used to have GFWL but thankfully it’s been removed. I would normally mitigate the ugliness of older games with mods, but I had issues with those here as well. Your mileage may vary, but I couldn’t go over 8-10 mods without constant crashing and FPS drops. In depth complicated mods are also much more annoying to install than something like Skyrim so I had to settle for more minor visual and quality of life changes.			",232,42,9,16,14,4,29

												Fallout 3 is a post-apocalyptic open world RPG that has decent graphics for its age and is a blast to play! It has a great story, plenty of side quests, and endless replayability. The V.A.T.S. fighting system is pretty cool, which is a good thing because free aim is horrible. I've played this for many more hours than are recorded by Steam, when I actually was able to play it on Windows 7. I've had to use Nexus mods to get it to run on Windows 10 with very little crashes. Highly recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fallout 3 goes on to be one of my most favorite games ever made. Bethesda reached it's full potential in this game and it's 5 things of additional content. The story alone was amazing, and the side quests, characters, DLC's all drove the story further. The exploration of the world can award you with items like the Ailen Firelance and the Experiemental MIRV. I may not be able to play the game on my PC and see mods that drive this game even further like Cube Experiemental but I have done everything and seen everrything available in the Xbox 360 version of the game. Overall I rate this game a 10/10 because it nails everything that a roleplayer would want in this Post- apacoliptic RPG named Fallout 3. (Can't wait for the release of Fallout 4)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, once again I haven't done the DLC (with the exception of Operation: Anchorage, which I liked; as a matter of fact, I haven't done the final ending choice for the main game because I'm waiting on Broken Steel), but I feel I've done enough to get the essential experience, as usual. Anyway, I'm going to do something different this time around and review this one twice, once as a game and once as a Fallout game, because THERE'S a contentious issue.As a game: It's a bit clunky, and the mechanics are often broken, but the story, atmosphere, characters, and immersion completely make up for it in a way that I've never seen before and almost didn't think possible. It was Yahtzee Croshaw that once said, ""Immersion can save the life of a bad game, and inversely, a lack of immersion can be a dogshit bullet right between the eyes."" I wouldn't call Fallout 3 a bad game, per se, but the flaws are clearly there. The weapon degredation isn't entirely necessary, as you'll run out of ammo far sooner than your gun will break, and there really aren't enough non-combat options for...anything, except getting bosses to stop being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Overall, though, it completely sucked me in, and I highly recommend it to anyone who can handle what is probably the first game I've played that truly deserves an 'M' for Mature (as opposed to WHEE SHOOTY SHOOTY EXPLOSION).As a Fallout game: Let's start off with the good. With only one exception I can think of (the T-51b not being 'powered,' which I immediately created a mod to fix), it fits in with the lore perfectly, so no complaint there. In addition, it builds on the Fallout universe in a way that makes it seem even more truly alive, and does a lot with what already existed. I like what they did with Mr. Handys, Deathclaws, Harold's story, Fallout's trademark crazy people who'll start a cult over anything, the music (good God, I LOVE what they've done with the music), and several other elements. As for the bad, or what is popularly concieved as disowning it from the franchise: well, the tone is definitely shifted, into a more desperate, lonely experience, but people often forget how often that was often present in the first Fallout, too, what with the Glow, the invasion of Necropolis, the whole Boneyard situation, etc. Secondly, the gameplay is obviously completely different. It's certainly necessary for this particular game, but was it necessary for a new Fallout game? Countering a question with a question, is it really that different? You can still target individual parts of enemies, increase skills and earn perks, the SPECIAL system is still thankfully there, and you can get companions to help you out. Despite the 3D gameplay, this is still the same Fallout world with the same Fallout situations that you solve in the same Fallout ways. Yes, it is a Fallout game. I personally would put it below Fallout 1, but above Fallout 2. If you're an original Fallout fan, I recommend it even more.No, you want a game that seemingly will deviate to a large extent from the originals, look no further than Fallout 4...P.S. I find it interesting how Dogmeat shifted to a tank, instead of the ally who knocks enemies down so that you can get 95% criticals to their eyes. No complaints on the new version, though.

												Honestly there isnt really much purpose to getting this game anymore since the game of the year edition was released. I bought it because it was on sale for like 2 bucks and regretted it later when I had to pay for all the DLC. The biggest problem with this release is it is buggy. It will not work on windows 8 or above, but If you look around online you can find numerous ways for you to be able to run the game by editing the files. Even after that expect occasional crashes. Other than that, this is easily the greatest game I have ever played. I have played it at least over 100 hours (I used the Fallout Script Extender so it wont actually log my hours on steam) and Where I usually lose interest in games after my second or third playthrough I have done at least 15 playthroughs of this game. This game allows you to1. Destroy the US government2. Nuke a developing city (or not but the explosion is pretty)3. Enslave people4. Find your dad5. Kill basically anyone (except for a very small number of essential characters)6. Join forces with a bunch of people.7. Roam a sizable game world at your own pace and do what you want. You can be a♥♥♥♥♥♥or you can be a saint, and the effects of your actions are felt.With the DLC you can1. Fight the chinese in a military simulation2. Be a slave in pittsburg3. Continue after the games ending and keep fighting the US government.4. Go to some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ island with nothing really there and a short, pointless quest.5. Get abducted by aliensThere is no reason not to buy this game. This game is the greatest fallout game in the series. Better than the originals, better than New Vegas, and still better than  Fallout 4. Also, you can get alot of mods for the game to customize your experience to your taste. I recommend 1.Enclave Improvement Project- Lets you join a group called the enclave you couldnt join in the main quest. 2. Sydney Follower mod- When you meet sydney in game, you will know why you need her as your follower.3.Ultimate Amata Follower mod- Amata is cool, and this is a good idea.4. Essential Followers- I dont know why the devs of this game want the followers to die. Get this and they wont. All of these mods are available on Nexus, a modding webside (its trustworthy, so you dont need to worry when you creat an account).			",124,5,0,17,9,0,19

												One of the Best Games I've ever played!Fallout 3 is my first Fallout game and I'm hooked into the series. Fallout 3 is great for FPS or RPG fans. This game has a great mix of Shooting, Exploring, and Story. Its so fun to discover new locations while leveling up and getting useful loot. I personally think the story is good, though the ending can be better. The best part of the game to me is building your character the way you want, there is no wrong way to pick your skills, just get what you wantIts definitly worth the price. If you plan on playing through this game, you HAVE to get the Broken Steal DLC. Read up on it, its a must have. Great value for your money with Fallout 3Only a few complaints, crashes are pretty common and the Frames aren't always smooth. But my issues within the actual game is the level cap of 30, and mediocre combat. None are gamebreaking to me, still a great experience(8/10) Classic game with minor issues, I highly recommend Fallout 3 to RPG and FPS players.			",83,3,0,4,5,0,1

												This is one of the greatest games I've ever played.  The game world is huge, and there are tons of places to explore and things to see.  It's hard to put into words how tightly the elements of character, setting, and plot are woven together.  Discovering what has happened to humanity after the nuclear apocalypse is fantastically entertaining.  The controls are very easy to get used to, and what first looks like a complex inventory\status menu turns out to be quite simple and logical once you get the hang of it.  The choices you make have observable consequences, and you will more than likely develop real feelings toward some of the characters you meet, unless your heart is made of stone.  Regardless, exploring post-apocalyptic DC is a fantastic experience I would recommend to anyone.I purchased the game and all DLC for $7.24 and have played around 63 hours as of this edit.  This is a 10/10 game for sure.			",44,3,0,6,7,0,2

												Honestly there isnt really much purpose to getting this game anymore since the game of the year edition was released. I bought it because it was on sale for like 2 bucks and regretted it later when I had to pay for all the DLC. The biggest problem with this release is it is buggy. It will not work on windows 8 or above, but If you look around online you can find numerous ways for you to be able to run the game by editing the files. Even after that expect occasional crashes. Other than that, this is easily the greatest game I have ever played. I have played it at least over 100 hours (I used the Fallout Script Extender so it wont actually log my hours on steam) and Where I usually lose interest in games after my second or third playthrough I have done at least 15 playthroughs of this game. This game allows you to1. Destroy the US government2. Nuke a developing city (or not but the explosion is pretty)3. Enslave people4. Find your dad5. Kill basically anyone (except for a very small number of essential characters)6. Join forces with a bunch of people.7. Roam a sizable game world at your own pace and do what you want. You can be a♥♥♥♥♥♥or you can be a saint, and the effects of your actions are felt.With the DLC you can1. Fight the chinese in a military simulation2. Be a slave in pittsburg3. Continue after the games ending and keep fighting the US government.4. Go to some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ island with nothing really there and a short, pointless quest.5. Get abducted by aliensThere is no reason not to buy this game. This game is the greatest fallout game in the series. Better than the originals, better than New Vegas, and still better than  Fallout 4. Also, you can get alot of mods for the game to customize your experience to your taste. I recommend 1.Enclave Improvement Project- Lets you join a group called the enclave you couldnt join in the main quest. 2. Sydney Follower mod- When you meet sydney in game, you will know why you need her as your follower.3.Ultimate Amata Follower mod- Amata is cool, and this is a good idea.4. Essential Followers- I dont know why the devs of this game want the followers to die. Get this and they wont. All of these mods are available on Nexus, a modding webside (its trustworthy, so you dont need to worry when you creat an account).			",124,5,0,17,9,0,19

												If you search a game to feel lying in a post-nuclear, chaotic and anarchic world, this game is yours. Or if you want an Oblivion or Skyrim with fire weapons, this game is yours too. Although the map isn't as big as Skyirm, it was a big one when it was released, and it has a lot of details that makes worth to spend time exploring it all.The history is great, and not only this major one. There are little histories inside the big one, details or personal messages of past wastelanders that immerses you even more inside the wasteland.The characters are great too.You can find evil persons, good persons, weird ones, etc... the world is still alive.  Dialogues are great and there many ways to bring a conversation. Also it has benefits if you choose certain options, so it's interesting to repeat to see how many possibilites are there. Also has dark humour and easter eggs. It's an open world, so you don't have to go just by one way, you can go wherever you want.The only bad thing i would say is that maybe there isn't much variety of weapons, specially on the melee field. Also the karma system is a little overbalanced, it's hard to be evil. Also, the level cap its at 20, but that is solved if you buy the DLC Broken Steel, which raises it to 30.9/10			",89,26,6,13,23,3,34

												Like many of Bethesda's games, this is a masterpiece to say the least. The storyline is very engaging; you will get familiar with a lot of different characters, with thousands of different dialogue options, which also varies depending on your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points, perks, and level of your skills. There is an abundance of weapons, and interesting items such as ""bobbleheads"" that you can find in various places to permanently increase your character's efficiency. I have lost count of how many different replays I've had on this game, and every single time it gets better. Now, I can't cram all of the amazing things about this game into a single review. It might be because I am too lazy, or because there is a character limit. However, I vivaciously encourage you to buy this one.			",217,20,7,12,19,0,4

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine  WAR, WAR NEVER CHANGES Fallout 3 is a game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks and is the third game in the Fallout franchise originally developed and published by Interplay. This is the first game in the series to go fully 3D from it's original top-down perspective and takes a more action orientation whilst still keeping the PRG elements from the first Fallout gamesI personally never liked the first Fallout games being Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics (which are on my GOG account) and I have only played so far with those games but with Fallout 3, I'm already hooked on the series. Its a perfect mix of RPG elements and FPS shooting, where its not complicated and fun to level upYou really get involved in the world and get into a routine of how to play, and the best part about it is, everyone's way to play the game will be different with the tons of options and choices you have offered to youThere are a few flaws, but nothing I think is game breaking. The framerate will drop at times, and crashes aren't uncommon. But the only thing I don't like about the actual games is the level cap. After level 30, I don't get as motivated to explore and do side questsAnd you will have a hell of a job trying to get this running on Windows 10, Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 7 but thankfully there are many tutorials to help you fix the compatibility issue Fallout 3 has with Windows 7 and up, just be careful when purchasingOverall though, Fallout 3 changed my views on the Fallout series and I can't wait to play the two other Fallout games being Fallout New Vegas and the recent installment by Bethesda being Fallout 4! RECOMMENDED :)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't mind my hours here, I played on a modded version of the fallout which ment I had to have fose running (fallout luncher with modifications) Altough I have played this game on my PS3 console it was great fun to re-visit this game while it was on sale.It normally takes you 10 hours to complete the story with the main quest only, right ? *spoilers incoming*Well as I wanted to do some quests I started with the book of wasteland. On one of the ending quests we had to find ourselves in the ""ship"" city, which I had to walk to and you'll never guess what happened. I was walking by the pump rooms so I decided to go in, I killed a bunch of mutants and found some tapes, when I read them, my dad quest completed itself and it told me to go to vault 108. This skipped preatty much all of the finding bit and got me straight to the ending quests. I was rather dissapointed because it only took me like 5 hours to complete the game and if I ever wanted to do any sidequests, either I would have to load in the old save or start a new game.Overall I played fallout nv before and I have to say this is the better game, they both are perfectly fine and fun, but fallout nv took more of a ""newbie"" approach because the quests tell you exacly what to do and lead you exacly to the point, in fallout 3 oh no; its not as simple as that you have to do some searching around.Overall this game is amazing and i encourage people to do sidequests and not only the main story because you will be kind dissapointed with the lenght.

												ENGLISH VERSION FOLLOWS AFTER GREEK.Γράφω αυτό το review, όχι για το παιχνίδι αλλά για να ενθαρρύνω όποιον σκέφτεται να το πάρει αλλά φοβάται οτι δεν θα τρέχει σε win 10. Το αγόρασα προχθές σε win 10 και ενώ όπως λογικά λέει και στην κεντρική σελίδα δεν θα έπρεπε να τρέχει, μόλις έκανα διπλό κλικ για να ξεκινήσει, τα windows αυτόματα κατέβασαν το gfwl αρχείο (games for windows live) και εγώ απλά το εγκατέστησα. Απο κει και ύστερα το παιχνίδι τρέχει νερό χωρίς να χρειάζεται να ανοίγετε το gfwl. Όσον αφορά στο παιχνίδι τώρα, σίγουρα θα τα σπάει όπως και το New Vegas!This isn't a review about the game itself but my personal experience about it not being optimized for windows 10. After i downloaded it, i double clicked on the shortcut to run the game. Windows 10 informed me that this game isn't compatible with my current windows version and automatically downloaded gfwl.exe file. I just installed that file and since then the game works perfectly without modding anything at all. I hope i helped you clear any doubts about purchasing this great game!			",52,15,0,14,1,0,1

												Personally this is my favourite game in the Fallout series as it covers and explains everything about the storyline. Sadly though i wasnt able to experience the second game of the franchise. I rarely found any bugs or glitches with this game and has replayability since you are always trying to discover new locations, characters, or enemies and go back and find little secrets hidden within the game or just to simply find things you havnt seen since you last played. Although even with this ther can tend to be small tiny glitches such as main characters your supposed to follow getting stuck in walls which makes you have to start from your recent save, but this rarely happens anyway. Even when you complete the storyline you can still explore these wastelands to find new side quest which are generally killing someone or just getting specific items. Bethesda really did a good job at making this brilliant game, Personally i would rate it 8/10 and would recommend it.			",19,0,0,4,3,1,1

												By far, one of the best fallout games i have ever played. The Exploration, VATS, the quests all work together in a fine game. I do however have some problems with the game, like how in the main questline, you cant really side with the enclave, so you have to join the brotherhood. Another thing is the lack of ADS (aim down sights). In total, A very good game if you are starting out in the fallout series, but You will probably have to configure the game to your PC so you can run it, Don't Worry, there are Youtube videos for windows 8 and 10.      9/10 game			",57,2,0,12,4,0,0

												I don't care what most people say - this game is so much better than New Vegas (not that I mind New Vegas all that much either). Why is it so much better? It's so creatively done; everything has this humorous quality to it; there are quaint little extra touches to be found everywhere. It's just so gloriously satisfying to be immersed in this world that has been so painstakingly put together just for your entertainment. The amusing little side stories that you uncover in this game can be quite hilarious (if you are anything at all like me then you can't stop yourself from snooping every email on every working terminal you happen to pass by). The characters can be so amusingly ridiculous at times that you just want to shoot them or worse yet set them loose in the desert to see how badly they fare. And some of the missions are just... Well, completely surprising. They can leave you scratching your head and wondering what the hell you should do, which way should you go? And I really love that! I never thought a game could be like that. And yet this one is. It will always be my absolute favourite.			",64,17,2,8,5,0,3

Posted: September 11, 2015
												Hi there! This game is Fallout 3, a post-apocalyptic game from the wonderful developers of Bethesda Softworks. This game is over 6 years old, but despite the short main story in the game, there's still a good amount of content to go about. The game world is open, the Capital Wasteland is inhabited by many things, some friendly but most things you'll meet are going to want to tear you apart and use your skull for decorating. But how about the DLC? Well I'll tell you. The only DLC that I have currently is called ""Operation Anchorage"", the story of the DLC is that in broad strokes you're helping fight the Red Chinese in the American Reconquest of Alaska, it gives you an insight into how a soldier lived before the Great War, daily putting his life at stake for the greater good of America, and the defense against Communism! You also need a DLC to continue playing after you continue the main storyline though... I don't know, I don't mind myself, but of course the DLC also gives you an expansion to the story, which I won't really go into, because it would spoil some... Things... Let's keep it at that, I guess you may have already had it spoiled anyways but I wouldn't wanna be the person that does it.Beware though, multiple people are complaining about the game being unstable on Windows 7 and even more so on 10 I've only had it crash twice, one being because I messed with the game files... I only had one glitch as well, and it wasn't gamebreaking.Questions I'd like to ask myself if I had no idea about Fallout:Q: Why wouldn't I buy Fallout 1 and 2 or Tactics first?A: You can do that, but the three first games are different to 3 and New Vegas in the sense that it's isometric top-down view in those games. There are also major graphical glitches on some system, but they should be fixable with an unofficial patch somewhere I believe... In comparison to newer Fallout games, which can be played either as 3rd person, or 1st person, I personally play as 1st person because it's more immersive.Q: Is there/what is the levelcap of Fallout 3 without any DLC and does DLC make a difference for the levelcap?A: In comparison to Fallout New Vegas where the levelcap can be 50 with all the DLC (30 without any at all) Fallout 3 only has a levelcap of 20, however this can be raised to 30 if you have the Broken Steel DLC, which is also the name of the DLC that allows you to play on after the end of the main Story.Q: What are the main differences between Fallout 3 and New Vegas?A: There's a number of them, mainly the factions system that they included in New Vegas, and also the removal of percentage chance to have a successful special dialogue option in favor for the more simple ""Have X amount of points in Y skill, and you will be successful in this special dialogue."" There are mods however, that allow you to switch it back I believe. Also that Fallout 3 by default has a color filter that makes everything look greener, whereas in New Vegas it makes the game look more orange-yellowy. There is a mod to turn this off called Fellout for both games, and I highly recommend it as I like being able to see specific colors instead of them being tinted either green or yellow. The locations are also vastly different as Fallout 3 takes place in the bombed ruins of Washington D.C and New Vegas takes place in the Mojave desert at Las Vegas (New Vegas in the game, surprise surprise) also the ability to disguise onself as a faction is New Vegas... It's something I don't really use but it can definitely be helpful in some situations, like when you don't wanna cause a shootout, and need to stay stealthy. This has been my review for Fallout 3 and I hope you liked it, patient reader. At first I thought I would just adress that the game is far from unplayable with Windows 7/10 as some people claim that it is, but it may vary from system to system I suppose.Thank you for reading, and I hope I convinced you somewhere along the way to buy Fallout 3.

												Great look/style great story, but almost not playable. glitches like you wouldn't believe. I gave it a fare shot played it back in the day on XP but apparently completed a mission before accepting it. then accepted it and could not progress. Also multiple glitches were couldn't eliminate enemies because they were to close to a wall. Multiple map glitches getting stuck. If you play this game make sure to have multiple copies of your save files and save frequently. If you are using windows 7 or 8 you will need to find and patch in your own direct X 9 DLL file. steam nor the creators of fallout offer any support.			",162,38,2,10,7,2,8

												Fallout3 is an game that every gamer should play it atleast once.Sure its buggy and it got lots of stuff wrong its still super addictive and fun.There are a lot of things bethesda did wrong.One of them is ending.First of all ending sucked(atleast for me) and second after the ending you can't go back to where you were and keep playing the game.Its really really dumb.Why the ♥♥♥♥ not?!?!!??!Also game got level cap.Seriously?!?!? Level Cap?Maximum level is 30.Oh come on Bethesda.Most fun thing about RPG's is the when you are in low level's enemies come kick your♥♥♥♥♥and you level up more and more to get your revenge.Thats one of the main things that makes rpg games.You have to be powerfull than anything.But thanks to PC Master Race we can mod it and upgrade the level cap.Another thing bad about level cap is that you can get 10 level more....If you buy the dlc.The game is also buggy.I haven't come across any game breaking bugs (atleast on the game's main story) but there are some.The game also has an unique mechanic called ""V.A.T.S"" where you can use it to select body parts of the enemies.It ll save your♥♥♥♥♥A LOT.Other thing's that makes fallout 3 unique is its envoirments its well designed.One annoying thing about them is you ll come across boarded door's a lot.Enemies are well designed and surprizely i haven't seen one ai problem with them.But followers oh boy the followers.If you enter your home to go to sleep they ll block your way and only way around is to use cheats.Oh yeah that reminded me another thing that is wrong with game.Fallout 3 followers can die.What the ♥♥♥♥? seriously?!?!.Good thing is that you can fix this problem with mods.Modding community is large and really helpfull.They ll give you a hand.I give this game 7/10 (acceptable).For more fallout 3 head over to ig-just kidding.♥♥♥♥ those guys.Thanks for reading my review. :)			",98,20,3,18,6,1,11

												I didn't know what to expect when I heard the game known as Fallout. I remember my friends talking about Fallout 4, one of the lastest games in the series. I thought the concept of Fallout was astounding. Since I couldn't afford Fallout 4 at that time, I bought Fallout 3 to still enjoy the experience. May I be the first the say that I truely enjoyed this game and I never regretted buying this game. In my opinion, this is a masterpiece since this game actually got me into the franchise. Would I recommend getting this game? Yes, if you are new to Fallout and wanting to get into the series, even at a affordable price! Pros: If you are new to the Fallout series, get this game. It's not really my choice to tell you what Fallout game you should get to get into the franchise. For instance, you could probably get New Vegas or Fallout 4 if so, but this could be another choice to get into the series. One pro is that there is such a variety a choices that make a great impact on the game. This is a true RPG for creating your ideal character.Cons: I did meet some odd experiences so been cautioned when buying this game. The game is not compatable for Windows 7 and up, only for Windows Vista or below, however, this is an easy fix when researching how to configure Fallout 3 to Windows 7 and up. So it shouldn't be complex. On the side of that, I did experience some crashes eventually, but I'm assuming it was my computer since my computer has medium specs for gaming.For Pros and Cons, they're pretty even, I would recommend anyone getting into the Fallout series with this. Whether you want it or not, I still enjoyed it, thanks Bethesda! :)			",22,2,0,6,3,0,1

Posted: July 21, 2014
												Good day once again close friends and strangers of the vast and dangerous internets, I have returned for another review. This time, of Fallout 3. Shall we get started?To start, I have to say I don't think I've ever experienced a more enjoyable character customisation than the one found in this game. It was full of humour and interesting choices (and said interesting choices often lead to more humour) and this theme continues throughout the duration of the game. Some notable choices include the chace to explode one of the only decent cities in the game, and the opportunity to commit genocide (that's going to remain without context; I don't want to spoil it for you). I honestly can't wait to jump back in and get back to making choices. CHOICES!!!!!!There's plenty of content in this game. In most of my reviews I mention that there's a need for extra content, or so much of the same type of content that it got stale but, much like the story of goldilocks, this bed was just right (How can a bed be too soft?!) I liked how the game was riddled with locked doors that could only be opened if you had a certain science or lock picking skillThe storyline was admirable, but not incredible. It basically consisted of ""You're dad's gone missing, go find 'im"" and then turns into ""Genocide, yes or no?"" However, I really did like the way the environment and various notes and computers could tell their own story and add depth to the game. Not enough games do this. The last of which that I've played was Mass Effect and before that, Skyrim (Both of these score a 10/10, btw)(Although, Mass Effect loses points for not publishing the third one on Steam) Often enough, reading journal entries could reveal more about what was actually going on in the environment. For example, in one particular moment, test chambers had dead mutated humans and, upon walking into these rooms, you could discover that they still contain radiation. This in itself mightn’t reveal much, but reading some journal entries shows who was responsible for these deaths (I shall say no more.)Now to mechanics. This game was built by Bethesda, so I thought I should mention that I noticed some similar mechanics in both of the games. However, obviously because this game is set in a post apocalyptic Washington D.C and not Viking Tamriel (And I'm not just saying that because of the helmets) There were some different and welcome variations between the two. For staters, the skill trees were far different. I actually liked the one in Fallout slightly (SLIIIIIIIGHTLY) better, although I can't really figure out why. However, I didn't really like how the currency in the game (Bottle caps) Were difficult to come by without performing getting bad karma (And I really wanted the good ending.) I honestly can't remember if I bought anything at all in this game. I just horded my caps until the end (Although, at times I wished I'd repaired my combat shotgun or purchased some health kits) For most weapons (All the weapons? I don't know, I didn't try them all out) There weren't any scopes, which made aiming excessively difficult. There was a cool system that allowed you to target a specific part of the body of your enemy and gave you a percentage chance of you hitting it. This was a great idea, but it was performed badly. A still, unaware target, regardless of the distance, should have a high percentage of hit. This wasn't always the case. Even a target standing 12 cm from your face only had a 95% chance of hit (SERIOUSLY, CHARACTER. DO YOU HAVE TOUURETTES?!) I would've disregarded this mechanic entirely except for the bonus critical chance it offers. The art style was good. I liked the way everything, even the towns, looked so make-shift and finding American monuments completely exploded was somewhat satisfying (I'm getting arrested for saying that, huh?) The graphics were decent, especially considering when this game was created.All right, let us summarise. Character customisation: GoodContent: ExcellentMechanics: SatisfactoryArt style: GoodI'm just about done. Final verdict- 8.3131932524020387829/10Thanks for reading.			",54,9,0,7,3,0,2

												Fallout 3 for me is  the best fallout i know new vegas has a lot of more things but im really sentimental with fallout 3 and for personal reasons i prefer fallout 3 1 becase i want to be the best father ever to my daughter when I grow up and fallout 3 you have your father in game and half of the game is you looking for him in the wasteland  even that you have your son in fallout 4 he is old when you leave that ice box and fallout 4 may have a lot of good things but in my opinion it just have destroyed the logic of fallout it simply desconfiguereted the game to make it more lucrative it looks more an action game rather than an RPG 2 I started playing fallout last year fallout 4 already have been lauched but i decided to start by 3 I was felling empty i was in a bad period of my life and when I searched about fallout I became really exited about playing fallout them when i started playing I filliled my emptness I started liking jazz and i was playing trumpet i was about to give up when i started playing fallout 3 i was so exited to play fallout 3 's musics that is the best musics i ever heard and then I started to feel beter i entered the fallout phase of my life 3 THE BEST GAME INTRO even being a 2008 game 4 Best history Please if you thinking of buying this game please do it and I hope you enjoy it as much as I doPS: I HAVE WINDOWS 10 AND IT WORKED IF not work please DOWNLOAD FSE (FALLOUT SCRIPT EXTENDER) with this will work and you'll enjoy this Magnficent game the best I've ever played untill now THANKS BETHESDA for making your incredible games Like Fallout and Elder Scrolls even Elder Scrolls being medieval			",16,3,0,16,4,0,11

												best Fallout ever.A greate mixing RPG and FPS elements, beautiful and balanced open world, a lot of interesting quests, locations, characters and dialogues. Beautiful shooting and VATS system make this game look better than some of the FPS. During the survey of an open world, you get a lot of experience  (not a game-XP) and it makes the game feels like IRL. It is very important for the RPGs. There is too many things to do besides the main quest, you can even forgot about it.			",107,7,3,7,3,0,4

												This might be the best FPS I've ever played. The mixture of old-timey aesthetic and limitless freedom makes it the analysis of limitless choice that I wanted BioShock to be. Wish I'd bought the expansions when I got the vanilla game though- they're practically required.Also, this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥ and a half to run on Windows 7 and later. It just isn't optimized for the modern computer, so be careful when you buy it. You might have to do a lot of fidgeting to get the durn thing to work. Almost lost the ability to play completely when I upgraded to Windows 10 I tell you hwat.			",64,7,0,6,2,0,5

												Fallout 3 is one of the best ARPG ever made. And yes, is better then fallout 4! As a gamer what is important, is the fun you have with the game not the graphics, fallout 3 is really fun and a very well made game, and is by far more fun to play then fallout 4. In my personal opinion this game is better then fallout 4 and a bit worst then New Vegas. If you love Action RPGs this is a ""most play"" game for you. I will try to explain the diference between all 3 games. Fallout 3 overall is better then fallout 4 except in the graphics. And fallout 3 overall is a bit worst then New Vegas except in the story, I think the fallout 3 story is better then New Vegas Story. Warning this game work in windows 7,8 and 10 unlike many people say, but you need to change some graphic card settings and also compatibility settings like any old game. I have windows 10 and i played the entire game without crashes.			",153,9,2,13,5,2,9

												I really really really don't want to do this but I gotta give it thumbs down.Don't get me wrong I love the Bethesda games, especially the old ones but really? Not working on Win 7 and 8? No excuse. Most people use Win 7 and it was released only a year before Win 7. So if Bethesda wanted Fallout 3 to have a shelf life of more than one year, they should have patched it. Yes there are fixes and workarounds but they only work occasionally and are frequently too complex for a dumbass like me (a dumbass who would buy a game that doesn't work with his OS).Which brings us to two questions.1) Why has this not been patched?2) Why is it on Steam if most people can not play it? And I am pretty sure that there is one answer for both questions; ""Money and Laziness"". Unfortunate as this and ESO have made me start to wonder, 3) Is Bethesda going to start being like EA (and by ""EA"" I mean ""Cashcowing and not fixing problems and releasing low quality games"")?And I think that the answer is a sad ""Yes."" And I think it has for some time.The game is decent though.			",20,1,0,7,3,0,6

												A lot of games make a big deal out of player choice, but few in recent memory offer so many intricate, meaningful ways of approaching any given situation. You fulfill or dash the spiritual hopes of an idyllic society, side with slavers or their slaves, and decide the fate of more than one city over the course of your postapocalyptic journey through the Washington, DC wasteland. Your actions have far-reaching consequences that affect not just the world around you but also the way you play, and it's this freedom that makes Fallout 3 worth playing--and replaying. It's deep and mesmerizing, and though not as staggeringly broad as the developer's previous games, it's more focused and vividly realized.Welcome to the wasteland.Welcome to the wasteland.This focus is obvious from the first hour of the game, in which character creation and story exposition are beautifully woven together. It's an introduction best experienced on your own rather than described in detail here, but it does set up Fallout 3's framework: It's the year 2277, and you and your father are residents of Vault 101, one of many such constructs that shelter the earth's population from the dangers of postnuclear destruction. When dad escapes the vault without so much as a goodbye, you go off in search of him, only to find yourself snagged in a political and scientific tug of war that lets you change the course of the future. As you make your way through the decaying remnants of the District and its surrounding areas (you'll visit Arlington, Chevy Chase, and other suburban locales), you encounter passive-aggressive ghouls, a bumbling scientist, and an old Fallout friend named Harold who has, well, a lot on his mind. Another highlight is a diminutive collective of Lord of the Flies-esque refugees who reluctantly welcome you into their society, assuming that you play your cards right.The city is also one of Fallout 3's stars. It's a somber world out there, in which a crumbling Washington Monument stands watch over murky green puddles and lurching beasts called mirelurks. You'll discover new quests and characters while exploring, of course, but traversing the city is rewarding on its own, whether you decide to explore the back rooms of a cola factory or approach the heavily guarded steps of the Capitol building. In fact, though occasional silly asides and amusing dialogue provide some humorous respite, it's more serious than previous Fallout games. It even occasionally feels a bit stiff and sterile, thus diminishing the sense of emotional connection that would give some late-game decisions more poignancy. Additionally, the franchise's black humor is present but not nearly as prevalent, though Fallout 3 is still keenly aware of its roots. The haughty pseudogovernment called the Enclave and the freedom fighters known as the Brotherhood of Steel are still powerful forces, and the main story centers around concepts and objectives that Fallout purists will be familiar with.Although some of that trademark Bethesda brittleness hangs in the air, the mature dialogue (it's a bit unnerving but wholly authentic the first time you hear 8-year-olds muttering expletives) and pockets of backstory make for a compelling trek. There are more tidbits than you could possibly discover on a single play-through. For example, a skill perk (more on these later) will enable you to extract information from a lady of the evening, information that in turn sheds new light on a few characters--and lets you complete a story quest in an unexpected way. A mission to find a self-realized android may initiate a fascinating look at a futuristic Underground Railroad, but a little side gossiping might let you lie your way to quest completion. There aren't as many quests as you may expect, but their complexity can be astonishing. Just be sure to explore them fully before pushing the story forward: Once it ends, the game is over, which means that you'll need to revert to an earlier saved game if you intend to explore once you finishe the main quest.Thus choices are ruled only by your own sense of propriety and the impending results. For every ""bad"" decision you make (break into someone's room, sacrifice a soldier to save your own hide), your karma goes down; if you do something ""good"" (find a home for an orphan, give water to a beggar), your karma goes up. These situations trigger more consequences: Dialogue choices open up, others close off, and your reputation will delight some while antagonizing others. For example, a mutant with a heart of gold will join you as a party member, but only if your karma is high enough, whereas a brigand requires you to be on the heartless side. Even in the last moments of the game, you are making important choices that will be recounted to you during the ending scene, similar to the endings in the previous Fallout games. There are loads of different ending sequences depending on how you completed various quests, and the way they are patched together into a cohesive epilogue is pretty clever.Fallout 3 remains true to the series’ character development system, using a similar system of attributes, skills, and perks, including the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system from previous games for your attributes, such as strength, perception, and endurance. From there, you can specialize in a number of skills, from heavy weapons and lock-picking to item repairing and terminal hacking. You will further invest in these skills each time you level, and you'll also choose an additional perk. Perks offer a number of varied enhancements that can be both incredibly helpful and a bit creepy. You could go for the ladykiller perk, which opens up dialogue options with some women and makes others easier to slay. Or the cannibal perk, which lets you feed off of fallen enemies to regain health at the risk of grossing out anyone who glimpses this particularly nasty habit. Not all of them are so dramatic, but they're important aspects of character development that can create fascinating new options.The VATS system makes for some awesome-looking battles.The VATS system makes for some awesome-looking battles.Although you can play from an odd-looking third-person perspective (your avatar looks like he or she is skating over the terrain), Fallout 3 is best played from a first-person view. Where combat is concerned, you will play much of the game as if it is a first-person shooter, though awkwardly slow movement and camera speeds mean that you'll never confuse it for a true FPS. Armed with any number of ranged and melee weapons, you can bash and shoot attacking dogs and random raiders in a traditional manner. Yet even with its slight clunkiness, combat is satisfying. Shotguns (including the awesome sawed-off variant) have a lot of oomph, plasma rifles leave behind a nice pile of goo, and hammering a mutant's head with the giant and cumbersome supersledge feels momentously brutal. Just be prepared to maintain these implements of death: Weapons and armor will gradually lose effectiveness and need repairing. You can take them to a specialist for fixing, but you can also repair them yourself, as long as you have another of the same item. It's heartbreaking to break a favored weapon while fending off supermutants, but it reinforces the notion that everything you do in Fallout 3, even shooting your laser pistol, has consequences. No matter what platform you own, you should play Fallout 3, which overcomes its issues by offering a deep and involving journey through a world that's hard to forget. It has more in common with Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series than with previous Fallout games, but that is by no means a bad thing. In fact, Fallout 3 is leaner and meaner than Bethesda's previous efforts, less expansive but more intense, while still offering immense replay value and quite a few thrills along the way.

												While nothing at all like the original Fallout games, I'm glad it didn't try to be. Bethesda took the route of making their own game set in the Fallout universe, and it paid off in spades.The Capitol Wasteland is one of my favourite settings in any open-world game yet. If you want a good Western RPG check it out. While New Vegas is more robust, Fallout 3 has a more concise story, and a much more fleshed out world to explore.			",239,31,8,28,15,3,36

 First Thoughts ""This game looks a little weird""(=)""The art style and direction is pretty awesome though""(+)""Lots of easily added mods""(+)""Atmosphere is amazing!""(+)""What day is it...?""(+++) Review Fallout 3 has to be one of the best Open World RPGs I've ever played and has to be one of my favorite games. Now I know what you're thinking and before you say anything about how long I've played, but I owned the game on xbox before rebuying it because it's just that great of a game. This game has one of the best post apocolyptic setting and style I've ever seen.The game play is obviously like any RPG made by Bethesda. You can really get a feel for your character and have relativly nice control over who they are, even if it's all put on a morality system that sometimes can be a little off. The situations you're put into have multiple outcomes and ways of going about them and the game gives you a sizeable amount of freedom without giving you everything. The combat and weapon variety is awesome, even if some weapons are better than others. If you are really committed to having your character be a certain way, you have all the freedom to do it and the tools available. It really is a game where you can get a feel for how you want to do something. And the large modding community this game had gives this game even more replay value because mods can add so much more to this game.Now there will always be obvious problems in these games. While the game is mostly great, you will experience your occasional bug but that is pretty standard with Bethesda RPGs. And the fact that when you try and zoom in with a weapon, it just ZOOMS in was a pretty bad choice(which I'm glad can be fixed with mods and that Bethesda later chose to change for Fallout: NV). Also that third person was also a little weird. While I'm sure some people may have enjoyed it, I usually stayed with first person. I think this could've been fixed if you had more control over where your character was located(I.E. To the right, left or centered). The game is also EXTREMELY easy if you're a thief. You actually have to force yourself into not being successful because it's too easy to be successful in this game. But all and all, I recommend this game to EVERYONE who even has a slight interest in trying it because it's an experience that isn't worth missing out on.  Also get The Pitt. BEST DLC FOR THIS GAME EVVVVVEEEEERRRRR	  Final Verdict: 9.5/10	  ",358,98,6,50,33,5,36

												(contains spoilers)when i first played fallout 3, i played for an entire weekend. sure it has bugs and quirks, but it's engrossing and immersive. and sure, i could patch it to fix the bugs, but in the hundred or more hours i've played it (not just on steam) i couldn't be bothered. this is one game which allows you to do the following things (spoilers): go on a peyote trip to infiltrate a cult, and subsequently settle a 200 year old blood feud between a mutated congressman and a disembodied brain. get abducted by aliens and violently commandeer their ship with the help of a 70 year old child, a cowboy, a samurai, a US army medic, and one dead astrnaut. break your legs and irradiate yourself... for SCIENCE! lead a communist rebellion that goes about exactly the way of the trotskyites'. enter into the simulation of an idyllic 50's picket fence neighborhood and torture people at the behest of a mad scientist disguised as a little girl. helping Liam Neeson water the collective lawns of every dead person in the united states, and during all of this, i honestly couldn't tell you where anything had changed along the ride, because i was still systematically painting walls red with an arsenal of weapons just varied enough to be interesting, and not so varied as to bog itself down. is it perfect? no, not even close. but the full DLC pack is $20 on steam and i guaruntee you will never get the same amount of joy for 20 bucks at an arcade, even a Live Arcadein a Boxwit an ""X"" on itrudding buy this thing! it will ruin your life for the better.

												Hey there pal! I see that you're a bit too poor to be able to afford a 800 dollar gaming rig to play Bethesda's new Fallout 4! That's quite unfortunate, but you aren't alone! Me, and pretty much 96% of everyone else on Earth can't either!So sit back, and enjoy Fallout 3, and mabye Fallout 4 when you get off your lazy♥♥♥♥♥and start to work for a living. But the issue there? Well you see sport, By the time you're actually getting an income of cash, You're gonna be all grown up! And adults sure do love their relationships, and before you know it a beautiful woman will come to you, and she's gonna live with you! Aha! So you've accumulated enough dough to buy Fallout 4, and it's 2025 by now, Not so fast champ! That lady-friend of yours is going to want to spend it on designer clothes! Try again another time! Aha, so you're back and ready to buy the game now pal? Well you already have bills to pay, now two mouths to feed now that you've gone and done the dirty deed! No fallout 4 for you, Infact, get back to work you slave! Oh what's that? Russia and the U.S are threatening one another? It's been quite some time since Fallout 4 came out, and it looks like nuclear war is about to brew! Short luck pal, The only fallout you're gonna get now is the real one!TLDR: If you're poor you cant afford Fallout 4.			",104,12,0,9,5,0,3

												""War War never changes...""It is with these words began the first shots of the game Fallout 3. Coming in 2008, she was struck by the many people who have played this game. Many people like this game, and some to this day tramping in the mud. But the one and the other can be understood. In the first case, the game is very addictive, and was not the best in the second graph.The game itself looked in 2008 ... not that ugly .. but the graphics clearly pumped up, because of the sight on the console market. For some, the game itself has a lot of innovations and not cut back on their old quality, which subsequently changed much. Among the innovations, I want to see ""V.A.T.S."" mode. This mode allows you to stop time, and choose the course, in which the protagonist (hero) will shoot or beat. This is a very raznoobraznyvaet gameplay, though points are required for it. The game is given ""Pip-Boy 3000"" personal kompyuter.V general, let's move on to the pros and cons.Pros:-Raznoobrazny Gameplay.-Plot.-Novovvedeniya.-Imennye Series chips.Minuses:A curve animation.-Graphic arts.Conclusion: The game is really good at that moment.Poetomu, I put the game 9.7 / 10.

												The game is pretty good.  Story-wise... not so much. The original Fallout is way better in that regard. But in any other aspect is a superior game and quite fun. I played this with a vista PC, so I had no problems as people with newer PCs. Still I had a few crashes, very few. By the way, is really desirable to get the Broken Steel DLC. It allows you to keep playing after the end of the regular Fallout. It is a must if you like to do everything in a game. Or skip this one and get the GOTY edition that is complete. It´s a dystopian world, be a saint, be an evil-doer, shot your way all across the wasteland. At the end you'll always find the path that suit your personality. Just don't get too attached to any person, you might need to kill him or her later. And maybe you'll enjoy that after all.All in all is a great gaming experience.			",47,23,0,21,5,0,31

												I'm honestly not sure why this game is on Steam. Sure it's a great game but what the hell it's broken. If you have windows 8 and in some cases of Windows 7 this game is gonna need a hell lot of fixing when you download it. Like you buy it thinking it's through Steam, everything is easy through steam but not this game. A game that's gonna need you to surf the Web for 3 hours just trying to find a solution to how to fix it should be taken off till the developers fix their game. I spent 3 hours trying to fix it, GOT THE LUANCHER TO WORK, oh but wait, now you gotta find a way to fix starting a new game. Decided to redownload the game so I can spend another 3 hours trying to fix it. I'm glad I got this on a sale for 3 dollars. Buggs me I even paid 3 dollars for a game that can't run.

												I first played this game when it came out for xbox and I can honestly say it is the best game I have ever played in my life.  I originally paid 50 bucks when it came out for xbox but i purchased this pc version for about 6 bucks.  the best money ever spent.Where else can you use a nuke to blow up a whole city and get paid for it with bottle caps and a free deluxe apartment? I have literally spent hundreds of hours playing and havent finished the game yet because of all the different things you can do.I absolutely love the fact that the voice of father is one of my favorite actors of all time.  awesome!!!!!I regret that i didnt buy the game of the year version for the extra content, but i think im gonna buy it anyway because it costs twice as much just to buy the downloadable content so youre better off rebuying the game in the game of the year version.The game does play on windows 7 64 bit fine but does crash on and off.  The game is still worth it to play though because the crashes happen only every so often.			",191,8,0,14,1,0,0

												Ok so I was playing Fallout 3 on PS3 24/7 until I mastered it. It was on the summer holidays last year and I spent the whole summer mastering the game . I found everything that there is in it . Damn nostalgia striked when I hear Three Dog on the radio saying ""THIS IS THREE DOG , AUUUU AND YOU ARE LISTENING TO GALAXY NEWS RADIO"" . Damn. So I was playing it for 18 hours straight and I finished the game. My goal now is to master it all over again on the PC. But I got to admit. Console version is♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to the PC version of the game. FPS , graphics everything looks better on the PC. And + there are no problems like game quits for no reason or freezes after playing for several hours. That happened to the PS3 version a lot and it's broken so I am glad they fixed that on the PC version. The game offers you over 100 hours of gameplay and I am looking forward to buy the DLC's so I can expand it even more. It's just sad *SPOILER ALERT* when you die at the end of the game, but you don't if you own the DLC called Broken Steel. Fear, courage,adventure,shooter almost everything is mixed up in this game. It's one of the best games that exists and I recommend it to everyone out there. FOR  ALL APOCALYPSE FANS -----> ""COURAGE TODAY, VICTORY TOMORROW !""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While it may seem appealing and you may enjoy it, if you try Fallout 1 and 2, or even New Vegas, this game will pale in comparison, especially when you notice that by all accounts the game lacks an ending if you don't shell out 5 bucks for the dlc that extends the story.At the end of the day, if you're looking into getting this game, I can only point you to Fallout New Vegas and pray you listen.

												I would have recommended the game if it actually worked! If you have Windows 10 like I do, you have to mess with the coding in order to play the damn game. Oh and did I mention that the entire game freezes and crashes after playing it for 6 minutes? Well yeah. That's what freaking happening! Every time. I want my damn money back steam! If you have managed to get it to work, great. But I'm not going to download random crap extra on my pc just to be able to play for 6 minutes before it crashes.			",26,1,0,2,0,0,1

												Quite possibly the best RPG ever made; Fallout 3 does what other sandbox RPG games attempt to do; create an enormous open world mixed with an immersive story and interesting characters. Decided to be good or bad, the world is filled with interesting quests that wont let you stop playing. The biggest draw is exploration; how Washington DC looks after a large scale nuclear war, visiting new markers on your map and fighting off enemies or helping random civilians. I was skeptical at first, Fallout 3 takes a bit to get going, but once youre committed Fallout 3 will not disappoint. I promise you that.			",519,76,8,42,34,3,71

												Fallout 3, is probaly one of the best RPG's i have ever played, but it's not for everyone, this game is hard to get into, you need to put some hours into the game before it starts to get fun, not only that the game might not be your typical run and gun FPS. i would say as a warning for people with Windows 7/8/8.1, that game has alot of problems, since it was for Windows XP, there are game bugs, most of whom can be fixed. But why is Fallout 3 good? Fallout 3 is a prime exampel of an RPG done right, the game is filled with to the brim with Story, not only that, but there is so much to explore in fallout 3, the music in Fallout 3 fits so perfect with the theme of the game, the gameplay is hard as ♥♥♥♥ but, but fun as ♥♥♥♥, the game is just fun, this is a must buy for RPG lovers9,5/10			",281,58,6,14,20,5,27

Even though this game may show its age (It is from 2008 after all) and may have bugs/incompatibility this is still a fantastic RPG, inside and out. If you are a graphics snob like me I highly suggest you install some graphical tweaks from Fallout Nexus, they revive the game and make it look like it was straight out of 2015. There is so much to be said about this game but I would rather have you experience it for your self, its $10 on the store and honestly I would pick up this game again and again if I could.

												Fallout 3 is a sandbox RPG from the people who brought you Oblivion, and like Oblivion, it has ups and downs. The ups are decent graphics, good balance and gameplay, decent voice acting and quests, while the downs are crashes and graphical errors, horrible animations, weak level perks, and to be honest? Not much replayability. Yeah you can choose different outcomes for quests, or wield different weapons, but attention isn't given enough to the different styles (melee, ranged, unarmed) to warrant playing out different characters.But this is just my opinion. I still say this is a fantastic game despite its flaws, and worth buying. The encounters, both scripted and unscripted, are fun, plain and simple. There's plenty to explore and amusing scenarios to play over and over quickly via the quicksave and quickload, which is instant, unlike other games. The AI is decent, funny, and makes for interesting scenarios. As a standalone game it's worth the investment, just dont expect perfection. 8/10			",257,74,5,20,26,3,26

												I was happy to discover this game only very recently, after the release of Fallout 4. I wanted to try the  two prior releases first since they are only $10 each, BEFORE spending big $$ on the newest game.  I am really happy I did.  Fallout 3 was loads of fun and I am now starting into Fallout: New Vegas next... and chances are I will be weak and get Fallout 4 in a couple of weeks even at $60 :(I see many recent complaints about this game not working in Windows 10, well that is partially true by default, however, with a little searching on the web, you can easily get this game to work in Windows 10 just fine.  The guide link at the bottom was the best one I found that covers every issue with Fallout 3 and any newer version of Windows.  Primarily step 6 did the trick for me (which links to an unofficial patch that really does fix everything for you) and I played the game until the end without a single crash.

												The best game ever made. Really gives you that post-apocolyptic dead world feeling. It has real landmarks such as the Capitol Building and The Washington Monument. They are all destroyed and taken over by mutants. There are 4 DLCs for this game, they all add heaps of new worlds/weapons/armour/items. 100/10			",77,7,2,6,2,2,3

												Except with the downside of it not being compatible with Windows 8 it is possibly one of the best games of all time. New Vegas may have polished what Fallout 3 lacked but Fallout 3 has such a different and unique atmosphere from NV. I will not give any spoilers as to what happens during the game in this review so don't worry. The game really does capture you from the start and transport you all the way to the end which is amazingly well done. You will begin to feel for the characters that you encounter and if they so happen to die you'll actually care unlike some other games. The gameplay is obviously from a FPS perspective and it is an new feature added that wasn't in the previous games. The open world element to the game is suited to the game and exploration is encouraged throughout it. The graphics may seem slightly dated but that is hardly noticable when you immerse yourself in this expansive world of post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Overall I give this game a 8.5/10 an amazing game that revived the franchise.			",186,13,3,25,17,0,28

 Daddy issues. Fallout 3 is daddy issues the game. Fallout 3 is a great game. The base game is fluent, fun and glitchy as hell (In a great, not ♥♥♥♥ing the game way) which is brilliant. The story of Fallout 3 is simple, but great at the same time and the DLC increase this in great leagues while also mostly not linking to the main story, excluding the story extending DLC, however the mods extend this futher. The modding community of Bethesda games are among the greatest, if not the greatest. Although, as it is with most Bethesda games, once everything is done, there is nothing to keep you interested, this is the one problem I can see with this game in the aspect of gameplay. If you've come from console onto PC and are thinking of getting this game again, get it. Just the mods alone can increase the fun you can get out of Fallout ten fold, so just the mods alone are worth it, I'd recommend this game to basically anyone, from people just starting on PC and veterans alike.   -Englishman 8/10 ",102,6,0,11,4,0,6

												Fallout 3 is a sandbox RPG from the people who brought you Oblivion, and like Oblivion, it has ups and downs. The ups are decent graphics, good balance and gameplay, decent voice acting and quests, while the downs are crashes and graphical errors, horrible animations, weak level perks, and to be honest? Not much replayability. Yeah you can choose different outcomes for quests, or wield different weapons, but attention isn't given enough to the different styles (melee, ranged, unarmed) to warrant playing out different characters.But this is just my opinion. I still say this is a fantastic game despite its flaws, and worth buying. The encounters, both scripted and unscripted, are fun, plain and simple. There's plenty to explore and amusing scenarios to play over and over quickly via the quicksave and quickload, which is instant, unlike other games. The AI is decent, funny, and makes for interesting scenarios. As a standalone game it's worth the investment, just dont expect perfection. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was the first fallout game I ever played (I played it a little bit after it came out) and it was  amazing, But right when I shot that Radroach it crashed,Aafter I loaded the game again I shot the Radroach again and it crashed, So I told my dad and he looked up the problem he had to do a little messing around with the files, then the one of the most amazing experiences of my life happened I walked out of that vault and it was AMAZING from then on I had a great time and had great experiences except I had to get used to crashing alot, In the end I loved it, The problem is that Bethesda HATES updating the Fallout series and I dont know why, In the end (again) I recommend this game, But since almost every PC gamer has a windows 7 and higher they will have to know how to mess with the files. (I DO NOT trust those community downloads nomatter where they come from)			",97,12,1,7,16,2,2

												I was happy to discover this game only very recently, after the release of Fallout 4. I wanted to try the  two prior releases first since they are only $10 each, BEFORE spending big $$ on the newest game.  I am really happy I did.  Fallout 3 was loads of fun and I am now starting into Fallout: New Vegas next... and chances are I will be weak and get Fallout 4 in a couple of weeks even at $60 :(I see many recent complaints about this game not working in Windows 10, well that is partially true by default, however, with a little searching on the web, you can easily get this game to work in Windows 10 just fine.  The guide link at the bottom was the best one I found that covers every issue with Fallout 3 and any newer version of Windows.  Primarily step 6 did the trick for me (which links to an unofficial patch that really does fix everything for you) and I played the game until the end without a single crash.

 WARNING THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS Fallout 3 has to be in my top 5 games of all time, It has such a amazing story and gameplay. Huge variety of weapons and the map is massive, You will never run out of missions or places to explore. Basicly you wonder a awesome wasteland listening to great 30's and 40's music. Starting with old wornout rifles and revolvers working your way up to lazer rifles and plasma casters, And starting with old dusty coats and a jumpsuit from when you were in a vault to beast power armor 'Some with tesla coils on them'... There is so many ways to play this game. You could be a good Samaritan and help everybody out and people would recognize that.. Or you could be the opposite of that and not help people.. Kill innocent's. and people would recognize that also.Overall score:Story ~ 9/10 'Will keep you interested, Alot of thought'Graphics ~ 6.5/10 'They aren't bad just nothing to brag about'Physics ~ 5/10 'Just your average grade, You can pick up items though'Replayability ~ 10/10 'I could play this game again no questions asked, I've finished it probably 10 times' p.s. Liam Neeson is your father  ",290,29,15,30,41,0,39

												Fallout 3 was a great game when it was new, and thanks to the power of mods, this game is just as good today (2015). Mods have updated the visuals, effects, and content of the game to feel like it's brand new.Everywhere you go, there is a town or person that needs to be saved, and you are that person who can save everyone... or not. While this game doesn't offer as much freedom of choice that New Vegas offers, Fallout 3 gives you many opportunities to feel like a hero in various ways. Newer games tend to throw side-quests at you so you can get detoured for hours doing a lot of them. Fallout 3's story progresses in a very linear fashion, and while there are many sidequests that you can partake in, you often have to go out of your way to find and solve these quests. You can very realistically go from the beginning to end of this game without doing one sidequest. It's not a bad thing, but it does make this game less immersive than more recent games of this type.If you've never played Fallout 3 before, this is definitely one worth playing as it set the bar for other amazing games in the genre.8/10 ""Great""			",97,38,1,24,4,3,12

												If you think you should get this game because you played through Fallout 4 let me remind you that this game is a whole different expirience then Fallout 4 is. In this game you have ammo shortages, weapon and armour durability and a level cap. This game is tough and punishing on your first playthrough and is the real Fallout expirience.If you are getting this game because you want to play this game before Fallout 4 these games are not at all connected. You can play through Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 and still consider them completely separate games.Truly, if you want to play Fallout 4 play Fallout 4. If you want to play Fallout 3, play Fallout 3.

												Fallout 3 top Half Life 2 as my most favorite game of all time, that's because the immersion and the feeling of presence (even before VR) set the bar to the highest levels, not even the beautiful and artistic Witcher 3 can do that for me, technology and prettiness, does not do the trick, is something else, the way that character freedom, quests and stories are combined in a Sandbox RPG.I really hope that Fallout 4 makes me go to a higher level of immersion, just in time to be maybe the last most impressive game before consumer VR explodes.

												After finally finishing Fallout 3 (which my hours aren't actually recorded on Steam which annoys me), I feel like now I can finally write a review about how I feel for this game:In the beginning, I felt like I was going to get bored of this game cause I didn't enjoy the Vault 101 part a lot. But after a while, I enjoyed the game a lot.The game's difficult, it has a nice atmosphere, the story's great and the characters are pretty good in terms of personality. Hell, I even got scared sh*tless when I was encountering some enemies in the night and inside some buildings.However, I do think that the main story was a bit short but I found it enjoyable nonetheless. I get it that you can continue your story with the Broken Steel DLC but I don't really have it, that's why it was short for me. And as for the notice, yes. It's not optimized for Windows 7 and later since it wasn't working at the beginning, but after watching a guide of how to make it work on Youtube, it took me like a few minutes to make it work. Not a very big deal.Overall, Fallout 3 is not my favorite Fallout game but it's surely one of my favorite games. I can fully recommend this game. And if you have a potato PC like I do, then don't worry. The game was running with like 30 FPS and I had a nice time.P.S.: That f*cking behemoth in the beginning, though. I wasn't expecting that at all. ;-; Also, I can't believe there's a weapon called ""Fat man"" lol.			",23,4,0,5,0,0,1

Well the beginning is amusingly ridiculous when they act with you like with infant and literally, but it made me laugh and it is really nice to see power armor animated in full 3D model.The gameplay is pretty much like Oblivion, it is pretty obvious that is from the same creators.If you dont mind it you can play it. If you dont like oblivion style gaming, you can still play old 1 or 2 if you didnt played it yet.But what I really cant swallow is the ending, which is pretty linear and very ""hero"" like. And hero like I mean stupid as hell.I would push the NO recommend button just because of that lame and corny ending, but luckily you can go ahead and download mod alternate ending, or just forget the main line and just enjoy those few side quests which are pretty fun.And for the first start, the best option is always set inteligence to 9 and google info about bobbleheads.Oh and if you'll meet Uncle Leo send him regards by me!

-Quick Review-Fallout 3 is large open world FPS-RPG which takes the narrative of ""what would happen if there had been a nuclear exchange in the 1940's and the citizens of the United States was trying to struggle with the after math of a nuclear exchange"". Developed by everyone's favorite open world developers Bethesda Game Studios and released in 2008.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Welcome to Vaunt 101, while there aren't any Vault Hunters searching for it (Ha, Borderlands cross over review joke) there are quite a number of treasures to be found within this vault. The Vault was designed to house and take care of it's inhabitants in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust.You spend a good chunk of time learning about vaunt 101, meeting the other citizens, and growing up. Literally, you start as a baby being born in vault 101, then as you grow up you learn more about core mechanics within the Fallout 3 game, ethics, V.A.T.S., S.P.E.C.I.A.L., combat, and more!The games story really doesn't start until your father suddenly disappears and you go searching for him! I won't spoil anything else about the story, but it does go on for quite a while, as you would expect and hope for in a Bethesda game!*Hardware: ""Notice: Fallout 3 is not optimized for Windows 7 and later"" EHHHHHHHhhhhhhhh..... My brother and I had to tinker with the files and do some trouble shooting to get it to work on my windows 7 computer in 2015. Then I directly transferred the game data to my new Windows 10 Computer Rig.I can say we got it to work, however I cannot say for certain if any changes were made that would allow you to simply download from steam and get the game working. I can say that right now with the changes we made it works on windows 7 and 10.


One of these things is not like the other!

Gameplay: Wheeeew, where to start? Lets start with the simple first: Fallout 3 controls like a FPS, I trust 99% of the people reading this review understand what direction to point the gun and click to KA-BOOM. (If you don't, I'll just file that under ""troll"")Next to explain V.A.T.S., the game probably will do a better job of explaining it, but V.A.T.S. stand for ""Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System"", and will allow you to pause the game, and take aim for you at a specific part of an enemy. But hitting your target is based on percentages, so if you shoot at point blank and have a 99% chance of hitting your target, there's always that 1% chance you'll miss.Since my luck is terrible, I tend to try to avoid using VATS, but over stream someone pointed out I could use them for explosive weapons and grenades, since I particularly STINK at hitting my target when I'm throwing a grande.Next we move on to S.P.E.C.I.A.L.! S.P.E.C.I.A.L. is an acronym for the primary attributes in Fallout3. They stand for: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck. (This is pretty standard for RPG's, so I'm going to move on, but if you need a better explanation, feel free to leave a comment!)All the other qualities of the game can be broken down into the ""par for the course"" as far as RPG's and Open World games are concerned. Expect a lot of exploration, expect gear with different perks, expect optimization strategies online; explaining where to go and how to play.Something I didn't expect was: Fallout 3 is hard! I fancy myself an average skilled gamer (I play medium difficulty with ease normally), I'm constantly eating Stimpack for breakfast while I play (Stimpack = healing item). I've sunk a crazy amount of caps (that's the currency by the way) into hoarding Stimpacks, I'm like a doctor or someone doing illegal drug related stuff.Achievements: At this time there aren't any steam achievements for Fallout3, this may change someday, depending on if Bethesda decides to add achievements. (They have achievements for Skyrim, and Fallout4, but those were available at launch.)

Price: Fallout3 is priced at $9.99, the Game of the Year Edition is priced at $19.99. You'll get more mileage (almost literally, ha!) out of your game by purchasing the the Game of the Year Edition. Over twitch someone suggested I play through the DLC to get power armor, and it would make the rest of the play through easier.Conclusion: Fallout 3 is to some, what Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is to me; a wonderful game that opened them up to the amazing size and scope a game can actually be. While I will always personally prefer Oblivion, I have enjoyed playing through this game, and can easily recommend it to anyone who's even remotely interested. Fallout 3 is totally worth your time.I recommend this game to anyone whom enjoys a challenge, likes Open World games, mods, enjoys RPG's, isn't intimidated by large open spaces, and has A LOT of free time to explore.Thanks for reading my review!

												let me start off with saying this is my favorite game i have ever played. its not the best ive everplayed its just the fact that you can play this game at anytime you want and have a GREAT time. the combat is fun the story is interesting(alto short and you cant continue your game to finish undone sidequests). alot of the characters are interesting...but some are more bland than wheat on cardboard. once a space ship crashed near me and i found a space gun and sells for the gun scattered around the crash site....so i used the gun to kill everyone in megaton... thats proof of the random fun that can come from this game. final rating 9/10			",45,3,1,13,2,0,3

Maybe there are fixes out there that can be downloaded (I don't know, I haven't checked since I already own the PS3 version), but the fact that it doesn't run as is gets it a thumbs down.

												If you use Windows 7 or another more recent Windows OS, THIS GAME MAY NOT WORK PROPERLY. You will get to the main menu, but be unable to actually play the game. I've spent a good two hours trying different solutions to the problem, but I've had no luck so far. Bethesda has stated that they have no plans to fix this problem. If you have a newer windows OS, I wouldn't bother buying this game unless you dont mind spending quite a long time trying to fix it up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Notice: Fallout 3 is not optimized for Windows 7 and later.""This is an understatement.The game is not functional on Windows 7 or later. It crashes constantly, and there are no reliable workarounds to get it to run for more than a few minutes at a time.Bethesda has abandoned this game, and us with it.Edit:I don't know why people assume I must have played the game on an OS that didn't even exist when the game was released, but allow me to explain:According to Steam, my date of purchase was Jul 2, 2009. That's 20 days before the Win7 RTM, and another three months before Win7 was available to consumers.Yes, I have over 90 hours on record. This is because the game worked when I bought it, and then later stopped working.			",1966,806,50,245,190,18,307

												I could make a joke about this game then say ""10/10"" at the end, but I believe this game deserves more than that.This game is absolutely incredible, anyone who says its anything less of a masterpiece is mentally handicapped.First of all, the area to explore is massive, I have over 200+ hours on it (I played a lot of it while on offline mode, so the hours on my account don't show the full amount) and I still havn't gotten around to looking over all of the areas.Second of all, the quests are amazing. Starting off with the main story, it is incredibly fun. From starting as a kid in the vault to fighting off the Enclave forces alongside a gigantic robot named Liberty Prime, it is a non-stop good time.As for the DLC's, most are equally incredible. Broken Steel, The Pitt, and Point Lookout are all amazing to say the least. While Broken Steel adds onto the main story and raises the level cap, The Pitt and Point Lookout give you entirely new quests and areas to explore, both of which are awesome. To a lesser extent, Operation Anchorage and Mothership Zeta are both somewhat decent addons, but failed to meet my expectations. Operation Anchorage was very short, I finished it in about 2 hours without rushing it, and Mothership Zeta was incredibly repetative and dont even get me started on what it attempted to do to the Lore.Alongside the Main Quests and DLC's, many of the side quests are also fantastic. One that really caught me off guard was a short little quest called ""Oasis"" in which after exploring the dull wasteland, you find yourself in a lush green paradise, where you meet a mutated man-turned-tree named Harold. The story is quite interesting, and depending on which ending you chose, can leave you quite upset.Now lets talk about the graphics. Yes this game is a bit outdated, but I for one think it looks fairly decent, and still hold up to some games today. As for the textures, they are quite flat, but I dont think you will really be paying attention to that while your gunning your way through hordes of Super Mutants and Ghouls.The enemies in this game are also amazing. There are plenty of enemies scattered across the Capitol Wasteland, from little pests like Radroaches and Bloatflies to the incredibly strong Deathclaws and Super Mutant Behemoths, there is little time to sit around a campfire and sing ballads about your fallen comrads before a gang of Raiders come to ruin your good time.These Raiders wont be much trouble however if your properly equiped. This game comes with a bunch of weapons which are all fun to use, such as the Combat Shotgun, the Hunting Rifle, and everyones favourite, the Fat Man. Most of these weapons also come with one or more ""Unique"" variations, which usually grant higher damage or special abilities, all of which are very useful when things start to get a little rough.Lastly, entertainment. I am not stretching this at all, and I dont think what Im about to say will change anytime soon. This game is the best game I have ever played. It is absolutely insane how good this game is. If I could play only 1 game for the rest of my life, it would be this. The story is great, the graphics are good, the area to explore is huge, the enemies are awesome, the replayability is off the charts, and if you ever start to get bored, a quick look over at the Nexus will keep you playing for hours on end. Now that ive said all this, I can honestly say...420/69			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I played Fallout 3 for the first time I was really amazed. The game seemed great and I enjoyed playing it. Of course, when you play a game like this one for some time it is not as interesting as it was.What I like about the game:1. The atmosphere. It is a real fun. You can blow up raiders and supermutants listening to some kind song about love.2. A promising start. At the beginning of the game I felt like there was going to be something epic.3. Hacking, lock-picking, speech. It's great when you can solve your problems this way.4. Using different weapons. In most RPGs you pick some kind of weapon and stick to it. In Fallout 3 I used nearly all weapons because you never know what ammo you're going to find.*** SPOILER ***5. Blowing up Megaton. The quest is stupid, but it is fun, plus you get a better apartment on the top of the tower for doing this.6. Quests. Specially the Vault where you find your father in.What I don't like about the game:1. The ending. It is not epic at all. The final battle is epic, but not the ending. I just wanted to try my new armor and weapons which I got from the final battle, but I could not because the game ended. It's they allowed to continue the game by purchasing The Broken Steel.2. Hacking and science. In my opinion hacking could have been more sophisticated. And science skill is responsible only for hacking.3. Characters and quests. They are great mostly, the bad thing is that no matter what character you are playing you are always treated the same. There are minor differences like Sir, Madam depending on gender, some options depend on your karma and some perks add some options to the dialogs. But that is nothing comparing to the previous games of Fallout where you are treated like and idiot because your intelligence is 1.I would give this game 8/10			",30,1,0,4,0,0,6

												Fallout 3 is absolutely amazing when it comes to story, action, open-world and apocalyptic themes. It really comes out on top as being one of the best RPG-style games of all time. Hours of fun just walking around the ruins of DC. Though being from 2008 (oh wow that's nearly 8 years ago...) it has some bugs due to the size of it, so watch out for those. Other than that it's a solid 10.			",65,10,0,5,6,0,2

												I never played the first two games and that is one of my biggest regrets. I know they are worlds apart but from what I understand the game is true to the first two in spirit.I love Fallout 3 because of the setting and story. There is so much to do and explore; every time you play it something new happens. The RPG elements are really well implemented for an FPS/TPS and it just works. Many weird/funny bugs make this game a very random experience sometimes but overall, this game got me hooked for a long time.			",113,28,0,16,12,1,17

												I really enjoy this game. The content it has and brings is cool. I really like exploring the wasteland and finding things as well as fighting creatures (super mutants, centaurs, deathclaws etc). I really enjoy brawling with behemoths especially when i'm feeling unstoppable and feel that I need a challenge (a few seconds later i find myself flying through the sky because I felt ""unstoppable""). In all fairness the game has tons of stuff for you to do and keeps you occupied for a pretty long time. Ever since running Fose steam has stopped recording my gameplay hours (not that it bothers me but just a heads up).I was able to run the game with no problem even though its states that Fallout 3 isn't optimized for Windows 7 or later.

												What would happpen if the pre-modern times cold war went full-on hot? Fallout 3, minus any survivors of course. This game has such a unique setting and characters that it's hard to compare with any other title, however, it has its own flaws.Pros:-Good story.-Excellent character acting, for an open world that is.-Incredibly well detailed open world. I think that the world looks like as if every meter of it is unique.-Hours of fun.Cons:-Terrible ending, I mean, I do get the ending cinematics, but why would anyone make a game so rich in content and incredibly well detailed scenery and not let the player explore this after the main quest end? I managed to explore only about 30% of the game world before I remembered the ending sucks. And I sure ain't planning on replaying this for the 3rd time.-Bias, sure it's a fantasy post-war game, but the amount of cheesy bias in the storyline specially near the ending with Libery Prime spewing crapware about how democracy is not negotiable or commies must die (In this case blaming China and Russia for anexing Alaska which was actually anexed by fallen UN in the game lol) and the worst of all for the game creator, making the founding fathers of true America tyrants and ""robots"" who want to kill all humanity and act as secret organisation when in reality the Lyions (in the game) and Palladins (in the game) are the actual bad guys who want mutants and all sorts of unhumanly creatures multiplied and over Capital Wasteland (Washington D.C.) to repopulate the Earth.Conclusion:I bought this game on Steam again only for the sake of good old days when games were fun, and replaying Fallout 3 I realised how many things I missed back in the day when I first played this game. Needless to say that if it wasn't for the unique setting, open world characters like in no other game and detail in the terrain, I would of never played this game in the first place, specially with the ending and bias in storyline that surely ruined what could of been the best open world game ever made to this day.So should you buy it? If you've played it, only if on sale, if not then give it a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My review for Fallout 3! (And my Pros/Cons)PROS:Hundreds of hours of epic gameplay in the Capital Wasteland!With DLC's about 50+ hours at least (plus new perks, weapons, enemies, quests, and other stuff)Varied terrain, enemies, weapons, quests, armor, perks, and other itemsCrafting/repair systemGame that is open-worldGraphics are phenomenal for its timeKarma SystemCONS:After completing largely everything in the game its hard to play again (can get sick of playing too much)Graphics need reworking (in my opinion)Some weapons largely have no effect on enemies Pistols in game need to be completely re-worked (e.g. sights, recoil, damage, animations sometimes)Some quests are variations of each otherIf you dont like large games you wont like thisGame might erase your saveThere are certain enemy and graphics glitches that are known to happenOVERALL: This game is revolutionary! I highly recommend this title to every gamer! Even though my CONS outweigh my PROS I still believe this game is still very good but with limited replay. 9/10(Anyone who wants to friend me do so but I might reject your request)			",118,5,1,6,22,1,39

												One of the best games I have ever played. It was a hassle to set it up and get past countless startup bugs but it was worth it. Quests are varied and never boring, and the 50's era vibe it has going to it really enhances the story and atmosphere of the game. Combat could be improved but for what it is as a whole, Fallout 3 is worth your money and time no matter the price which is actually quite low now.P.S : The devs of this game totally nailed the RPG elements. The perks are fun, varied, and can lead to some major decision making outside of quests and simply on your own time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fallout 3 is one of the best games, hands down. Most of my time playing it has been using modded alternate launchers, but I have spent well over 100 hours in-game. You can do whatever you want, it is completely non-linear, etc - pretty much Skyrim as a post-apocalyptic world. Once you have exhausted most of the content in the vanilla game (which will take hundreds of hours, depending on how you play) there are a ton of great mods on the Nexus. Especially for a $10 dollar game, this is one of the best things you could buy on Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												awesome game! not fun to setup on win7 x64 but once you get it going! don't let the optimisation notice stop you, you'll get mad if it doesn't work straight away (took me awhile) but its well worth it if you want to revisit the gamebuy the GOTY edition so you get all the DLC's, they are dayum goodi have way more than 35.8 hours on this game, it took me ages to figure out why steam wouldn't acknowledge i was playing FO3 after it loaded from the launcherif this is happening to you, go to the main steam folder and copy Steam.dll to the main fallout 3 installation folderthis will allow the steam to recgonise the game when running and thus you can use the overlay + record your time now ",156,7,2,23,12,0,21

												I could make a joke about this game then say ""10/10"" at the end, but I believe this game deserves more than that.This game is absolutely incredible, anyone who says its anything less of a masterpiece is mentally handicapped.First of all, the area to explore is massive, I have over 200+ hours on it (I played a lot of it while on offline mode, so the hours on my account don't show the full amount) and I still havn't gotten around to looking over all of the areas.Second of all, the quests are amazing. Starting off with the main story, it is incredibly fun. From starting as a kid in the vault to fighting off the Enclave forces alongside a gigantic robot named Liberty Prime, it is a non-stop good time.As for the DLC's, most are equally incredible. Broken Steel, The Pitt, and Point Lookout are all amazing to say the least. While Broken Steel adds onto the main story and raises the level cap, The Pitt and Point Lookout give you entirely new quests and areas to explore, both of which are awesome. To a lesser extent, Operation Anchorage and Mothership Zeta are both somewhat decent addons, but failed to meet my expectations. Operation Anchorage was very short, I finished it in about 2 hours without rushing it, and Mothership Zeta was incredibly repetative and dont even get me started on what it attempted to do to the Lore.Alongside the Main Quests and DLC's, many of the side quests are also fantastic. One that really caught me off guard was a short little quest called ""Oasis"" in which after exploring the dull wasteland, you find yourself in a lush green paradise, where you meet a mutated man-turned-tree named Harold. The story is quite interesting, and depending on which ending you chose, can leave you quite upset.Now lets talk about the graphics. Yes this game is a bit outdated, but I for one think it looks fairly decent, and still hold up to some games today. As for the textures, they are quite flat, but I dont think you will really be paying attention to that while your gunning your way through hordes of Super Mutants and Ghouls.The enemies in this game are also amazing. There are plenty of enemies scattered across the Capitol Wasteland, from little pests like Radroaches and Bloatflies to the incredibly strong Deathclaws and Super Mutant Behemoths, there is little time to sit around a campfire and sing ballads about your fallen comrads before a gang of Raiders come to ruin your good time.These Raiders wont be much trouble however if your properly equiped. This game comes with a bunch of weapons which are all fun to use, such as the Combat Shotgun, the Hunting Rifle, and everyones favourite, the Fat Man. Most of these weapons also come with one or more ""Unique"" variations, which usually grant higher damage or special abilities, all of which are very useful when things start to get a little rough.Lastly, entertainment. I am not stretching this at all, and I dont think what Im about to say will change anytime soon. This game is the best game I have ever played. It is absolutely insane how good this game is. If I could play only 1 game for the rest of my life, it would be this. The story is great, the graphics are good, the area to explore is huge, the enemies are awesome, the replayability is off the charts, and if you ever start to get bored, a quick look over at the Nexus will keep you playing for hours on end. Now that ive said all this, I can honestly say...420/69			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Amazing main storyline along with many side quests wait for you to explore. By the way, buy Broken Steel DLC if you want this game to be endless.			",10,2,0,2,4,0,3

												As cool as New Vegas is, and despite it being my introduction to the series, this game is much better. Although my game crashes often due to it not being optimized for Windows 7. Despite this, (and quicksaving until the F5 button fades away) the game is fantastic. The wasteland feels much more open than the Mojave Wasteland and it feels like much more time was put into it. Overall, the game is great. 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												People of the wasteland listen! This game was NOT designed for windows 7 OR 8. unfortunatly i run on a windows 8 x64bit operating system so it was extremly difficult to get this game to run. If you do have windows 7 or 8 which most of you will, be ready to spend ALOT of time modding the games codeing and software to get it to work. There is a guide on how to do it here but it is not guaranteed to work.      http://steamcommunity.com/app/22370/discussions/0/864956555011164413/       I wish everyone the best of luck to get this game to run on your operating systems. & if im honest, if you have a PS3 or XBox360, i would recommend purchasing it on those before PC. PC is alot more fun with mods, console commands ECT, but consoles are guaranteed to run it. And also before you all blame the creators its not Bethesda's fault! We must remember this game was released in 2008 before windows 7 so it would have never been possible to update it to run properly for windows 7 or 8.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a must have for science fiction adventurers. It's so easy to get wrapped up in the story. As you gain experience and learn the history of your father, you're pulled deeper and deeper into the story. Exploring and adventuring is great fun. The mods available for the game make all the more fantastic to play!In a perfect world, you should play Fallout and Fallout 2. They provide more history and you can witness how humankind crawls back from the brink of global war. Both of those games are totally engaging, despite the clunky isometric graphics. You don't need to play either of them, but there is nothing quite like exploring ""The Glow"" for the first time.			",76,16,0,12,7,1,14

												Currently on my first computer playthrough, 4th overall, and I still love this game and can't stop. Took a little work to get working on Windows 8, but it was well worth it. There are also many great mods that increase the level cap, add perks, add weapons, and more quests and locations! Buy it! Easily milk over over 50 hours a playthrough. Then do it again!Edit:    In case you haven't played any Bethesda games before, this is a climbing game. I know it doesn't say that anywhere, but trust me. You can climb it, whatever it is.

DLC will almost certainly increase your playtime, not to mention the DLC is GOOD SHIZNIT so please, do yourself a favour and buy this game if you haven't already. as of now, get the GOTY edition if you can			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												...Damn son, they say Fallout New Vegas and Skyrim is better than Fallout 3. If that's the case, they must be beyond awesome. Fallout 3 with Broken Steel, as far as I'm concerned, is one of the best games I've ever played. Bethesda manages to blend the FPS, Open World, and RPG genres very, very, well. Mechanically, it is incredible!PROS:-SHOULDER MOUNTED NUKES-Really awesome original score of ambient, and a selection of music from the 40s.-An incredible and very large world. I'm especially a fan of the DC area.-Interesting way they use RPG elements through their statistic systems of SPECIAL, Perks, and the many skills.-Everything is trying to kill you. But overtime, you can gain this incredible arsenal that makes you feel really awesome.CONS:-Notice I say it's good with BROKEN STEEL DLC. This is because the story is....questionable. Very questionable.-Sometimes the game is simply very jank with it's technicalities. The game just minimizes and I can't go back. Then there is the models in-game. But the latter isn't a big deal if you're not concerned with visuals.What can I say about Fallout 3 that hasn't already been said? 4/5			",18,4,3,4,3,0,2

												Fairly decent base game. The story is fairly linear and choices aren't usually that difficult. It lacks the infinite replayability, factions and moral ambiguity that made New Vegas so good but it's still fun to play. BUT, add DLC and Mods to the mix and this game is fun. Steam shows I only have 7 hours in the game because I primarily launch it with Fallout Script Extender (FOSE). In reality I probably have closer to 90 hours.			",85,11,0,12,7,0,18

												If you haven't played fallout 3 before, You may not know that it's glitchy or pretty damn great. While it is alittle lack luster with it's Aiming system, Most people will just use V.A.T.S. anyway so it's not a big loss. Even if you only want to try it, I would suggest buying the Game of the Year edition, Because while this game isn't for everyone most people will find themselves wanting more of the game. The in-game soundtrack is amazing and while limited the Radio station for Galaxy News Radio is great. Exploring the Capital Wasteland will keep you entertained for a good bit, enless you don't like exploration. Bottom line, You will sink some time into this one. The only reason my hours are low now is, That I played 3 on Xbox and recently obtained New Vegas which I had never played at all, Highly recommend getting both of these amazing games.

												What would happpen if the pre-modern times cold war went full-on hot? Fallout 3, minus any survivors of course. This game has such a unique setting and characters that it's hard to compare with any other title, however, it has its own flaws.Pros:-Good story.-Excellent character acting, for an open world that is.-Incredibly well detailed open world. I think that the world looks like as if every meter of it is unique.-Hours of fun.Cons:-Terrible ending, I mean, I do get the ending cinematics, but why would anyone make a game so rich in content and incredibly well detailed scenery and not let the player explore this after the main quest end? I managed to explore only about 30% of the game world before I remembered the ending sucks. And I sure ain't planning on replaying this for the 3rd time.-Bias, sure it's a fantasy post-war game, but the amount of cheesy bias in the storyline specially near the ending with Libery Prime spewing crapware about how democracy is not negotiable or commies must die (In this case blaming China and Russia for anexing Alaska which was actually anexed by fallen UN in the game lol) and the worst of all for the game creator, making the founding fathers of true America tyrants and ""robots"" who want to kill all humanity and act as secret organisation when in reality the Lyions (in the game) and Palladins (in the game) are the actual bad guys who want mutants and all sorts of unhumanly creatures multiplied and over Capital Wasteland (Washington D.C.) to repopulate the Earth.Conclusion:I bought this game on Steam again only for the sake of good old days when games were fun, and replaying Fallout 3 I realised how many things I missed back in the day when I first played this game. Needless to say that if it wasn't for the unique setting, open world characters like in no other game and detail in the terrain, I would of never played this game in the first place, specially with the ending and bias in storyline that surely ruined what could of been the best open world game ever made to this day.So should you buy it? If you've played it, only if on sale, if not then give it a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fallout 3 is one of the best games, hands down. Most of my time playing it has been using modded alternate launchers, but I have spent well over 100 hours in-game. You can do whatever you want, it is completely non-linear, etc - pretty much Skyrim as a post-apocalyptic world. Once you have exhausted most of the content in the vanilla game (which will take hundreds of hours, depending on how you play) there are a ton of great mods on the Nexus. Especially for a $10 dollar game, this is one of the best things you could buy on Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best games I have ever played. It was a hassle to set it up and get past countless startup bugs but it was worth it. Quests are varied and never boring, and the 50's era vibe it has going to it really enhances the story and atmosphere of the game. Combat could be improved but for what it is as a whole, Fallout 3 is worth your money and time no matter the price which is actually quite low now.P.S : The devs of this game totally nailed the RPG elements. The perks are fun, varied, and can lead to some major decision making outside of quests and simply on your own time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

How to Fix Fallout 3 on Windows 8 + Windows 8.1 (Only!) 
A Guide for Fallout 3
By: Nigel Burke

			A simple way to fix almost always fix Fallout 3 for Windows 8 + Windows 8.1! Now includes how to stop from random freezes and crashes happening!		


Plus, you should disable autosaves, and get CASM (a mod that auto saves every 3-5 minutes, as specified by you)http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/3729/?I tested the game for about an hour, and it worked again. albeit on a different pc, but when I first tried to launch the game it never loaded. it came a far bit and now it works fine - minus the stutters. Now to the review:I think this game is great. I have about 3-4 hundred hours in it on console, and 20 or more on pc (like I said, it crashed a lot) (also, steam says I have 3 hours, but FOSE doesn't keep track of those for steam like NVSE does for Fallout New Vegas). The quests are great. the places are great. progression is pretty good. Bethesda managed to nail the creepy, post apocolyptic atmosphere and at times you may even feel terrified. Combat is great - especially with the bloody mess perk, when all the limbs you shoot off suddenly become red pulps, and bodies explode into red mush. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fallout 3 is one of my favorite all-time games.  It has a solid story line and a seemingly endless number of cool places to explore and interesting quests to complete.  I am intrigued by the general theme of the game and the history surrounding the setting (D.C.) brings it up another notch.  I always found myself wanting to complete just one more quest…			",48,0,0,7,0,0,9

												Currently on my first computer playthrough, 4th overall, and I still love this game and can't stop. Took a little work to get working on Windows 8, but it was well worth it. There are also many great mods that increase the level cap, add perks, add weapons, and more quests and locations! Buy it! Easily milk over over 50 hours a playthrough. Then do it again!Edit:    In case you haven't played any Bethesda games before, this is a climbing game. I know it doesn't say that anywhere, but trust me. You can climb it, whatever it is.

DLC will almost certainly increase your playtime, not to mention the DLC is GOOD SHIZNIT so please, do yourself a favour and buy this game if you haven't already. as of now, get the GOTY edition if you can			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Such a fantastic open-world game! If you're a fan of some of Bethesda's latest works (such as Skyrim), and you enjoy first-person shooters, then I'm sure you will love this game! There is much to see and do in the wasteland, but I recommend picking up the Broken Steel DLC as (potential spoiler)  the game ends and doesn't allow you to continue on open-worlding without the DLC .

												Fallout 3 is absolutely amazing when it comes to story, action, open-world and apocalyptic themes. It really comes out on top as being one of the best RPG-style games of all time. Hours of fun just walking around the ruins of DC. Though being from 2008 (oh wow that's nearly 8 years ago...) it has some bugs due to the size of it, so watch out for those. Other than that it's a solid 10.			",65,10,0,5,6,0,2

												I could make a joke about this game then say ""10/10"" at the end, but I believe this game deserves more than that.This game is absolutely incredible, anyone who says its anything less of a masterpiece is mentally handicapped.First of all, the area to explore is massive, I have over 200+ hours on it (I played a lot of it while on offline mode, so the hours on my account don't show the full amount) and I still havn't gotten around to looking over all of the areas.Second of all, the quests are amazing. Starting off with the main story, it is incredibly fun. From starting as a kid in the vault to fighting off the Enclave forces alongside a gigantic robot named Liberty Prime, it is a non-stop good time.As for the DLC's, most are equally incredible. Broken Steel, The Pitt, and Point Lookout are all amazing to say the least. While Broken Steel adds onto the main story and raises the level cap, The Pitt and Point Lookout give you entirely new quests and areas to explore, both of which are awesome. To a lesser extent, Operation Anchorage and Mothership Zeta are both somewhat decent addons, but failed to meet my expectations. Operation Anchorage was very short, I finished it in about 2 hours without rushing it, and Mothership Zeta was incredibly repetative and dont even get me started on what it attempted to do to the Lore.Alongside the Main Quests and DLC's, many of the side quests are also fantastic. One that really caught me off guard was a short little quest called ""Oasis"" in which after exploring the dull wasteland, you find yourself in a lush green paradise, where you meet a mutated man-turned-tree named Harold. The story is quite interesting, and depending on which ending you chose, can leave you quite upset.Now lets talk about the graphics. Yes this game is a bit outdated, but I for one think it looks fairly decent, and still hold up to some games today. As for the textures, they are quite flat, but I dont think you will really be paying attention to that while your gunning your way through hordes of Super Mutants and Ghouls.The enemies in this game are also amazing. There are plenty of enemies scattered across the Capitol Wasteland, from little pests like Radroaches and Bloatflies to the incredibly strong Deathclaws and Super Mutant Behemoths, there is little time to sit around a campfire and sing ballads about your fallen comrads before a gang of Raiders come to ruin your good time.These Raiders wont be much trouble however if your properly equiped. This game comes with a bunch of weapons which are all fun to use, such as the Combat Shotgun, the Hunting Rifle, and everyones favourite, the Fat Man. Most of these weapons also come with one or more ""Unique"" variations, which usually grant higher damage or special abilities, all of which are very useful when things start to get a little rough.Lastly, entertainment. I am not stretching this at all, and I dont think what Im about to say will change anytime soon. This game is the best game I have ever played. It is absolutely insane how good this game is. If I could play only 1 game for the rest of my life, it would be this. The story is great, the graphics are good, the area to explore is huge, the enemies are awesome, the replayability is off the charts, and if you ever start to get bored, a quick look over at the Nexus will keep you playing for hours on end. Now that ive said all this, I can honestly say...420/69			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I actually have more hours on this one but played it under Windows Live and much older non Steam version... but the game is so good I re-bought it on a Summer Sale. Fallout 3: Atmospheric, visually fascinating and manages to maintain your curiosity at high levels. Can't say I met any NPCs with anything resembling a personailty (with the possible exception of Moira) but that's not uncommon nowadays. Sniping with the dart gun was great fun, but the tube stations got irksome quickly. I don't see what all the fuss about VATS is - to me it just seems like cheating so I never used it. There is a lot here to interest the casual FPS and RPG fan but perhaps not enough to interest the hardcore elements of both factions. The main quest is totally uninspiring and (maybe thankfully) a fair chunk of it can be missed without warning. Plenty to see and do and I finished it 3 times which probably says more than any of the above. Definitely worth a try as *it is my most favorite game of all time!*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Отличная shooter-RPG в антураже постапокалипсиса. Огромный мир, куча дополнительных миссий, достаточно длинная и вразумительная основная сюжетная линия... Графика на те времена очень неплоха была (да, пожалуй, и сейчас будет неплохо смотреться с текстур-паком), хороший саундтрек, интересные диалоги.Из недостатков отмечу только один: сравнительно много просто тупой ходьбы по Пустошам. Пока дойдешь до нужной точки на карте - забудешь зачем шел.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fallout 3 is a fantastic game. But, like all other games, it has its weak points. Lets start with the bad stuff. The game used to constantly freeze and forced me to end the game. It was a huge annoyance. I looked on forums to find a solution and found a simple fix in one of the games files. Thats all the bad about this game. Now for the goods! The game will take over your life. It is so addicting and theres so much to do. Every quest leaves you with choices that really make you think about what you should do. It really makes you think. The combat is really just ok. It has little variation besides vats, which is very useful ( and fun to watch the slow mo kills). Thats about all i can say bout this game. If you have the money, give it a chance, you wont regret it.			",12,0,1,5,1,0,1

The Capital Wasteland is full of interesting characters, good and evil and you will be meeting many of both. Before you start you should head to the nexus and mod this great game, also get the script extender - FOSE. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where do i start? First of all, Its fallout, These games are known for their action-packed, yet emotionally and path focused stories. First of all I'll adress negatives; The game is VERY dark. (this isnt a negative for all people, but for me it is, I like bright colorful scenes, with a more realistic story) Another negative is well, Later on in the story there isnt VERY much to do, although you'll find quests what bothers me is, you'll find a city with 50+ and only 1 or 2 people will give you something to do. Another thing is the ♥♥♥♥ING ACCURACY IN VATS IS AWFUL, IVE BEEN FACE FIRST WITH OVER 500 MOBS WITH A .44 REPEATER ONLY TO MISS, JESUS CHRIST. And lastly in my Cons is Optimization. some people have it worse some people have it ok, luckily i was the Ok side. The game crashes every 4 or so hours and alt-tabbing means you have to restart the entire game. Also controller support is god awful, (THE GAME HAS GWOL CAREFUL!!!)                                                                                                                                                                                                           Where do I start with the good? Jesus christ man this game, the story is godly, the dialouge options are amazing not to mention the way the ending is molded based on your choices. You'll have follows based on karma, exclusive rewards for doing good or bad deeds, it just never ends. The guns go on and on, combat is actually fun, your limbs get crippled and the game is realistic. It isnt some COD♥♥♥♥♥♥where i find ammo on every body i see, I literally need to scavenge and use my rarer rounds (.44, 308 etc) wisley and dont find them off little timmy's body. Not to mention the atmosphere (although i hate dark games) goes INCREDIBLEY WELL. The games characters and factions even put into a proper perspective what happens in such an enviorment, although ill end my review here, please, pick up this game either on a console or a PC (optimization on PC is♥♥♥♥♥♥ but play it, just play it.

												Where do i start? First of all, Its fallout, These games are known for their action-packed, yet emotionally and path focused stories. First of all I'll adress negatives; The game is VERY dark. (this isnt a negative for all people, but for me it is, I like bright colorful scenes, with a more realistic story) Another negative is well, Later on in the story there isnt VERY much to do, although you'll find quests what bothers me is, you'll find a city with 50+ and only 1 or 2 people will give you something to do. Another thing is the ♥♥♥♥ING ACCURACY IN VATS IS AWFUL, IVE BEEN FACE FIRST WITH OVER 500 MOBS WITH A .44 REPEATER ONLY TO MISS, JESUS CHRIST. And lastly in my Cons is Optimization. some people have it worse some people have it ok, luckily i was the Ok side. The game crashes every 4 or so hours and alt-tabbing means you have to restart the entire game. Also controller support is god awful, (THE GAME HAS GWOL CAREFUL!!!)

												Отличная shooter-RPG в антураже постапокалипсиса. Огромный мир, куча дополнительных миссий, достаточно длинная и вразумительная основная сюжетная линия... Графика на те времена очень неплоха была (да, пожалуй, и сейчас будет неплохо смотреться с текстур-паком), хороший саундтрек, интересные диалоги.Из недостатков отмечу только один: сравнительно много просто тупой ходьбы по Пустошам.

												(I'm using FOSE to start it so it only shows 0.1 hours played)Fallout 3 is post-apocalyptic Action RPG where you try to find your dad. I haven't played it through yet because I've been fighting supermutants and stuff. It's a really good game, but there's crashes, freezes and stuff which you might wanna fix. And yeah, compared to the New Vegas, this game's area is more interesting. There's lot of raider camps and other places which are interesting. There's even Bethesda ruins! :DOverall, great game but full of fixing. Capital wasteland is place for you if you love surviving in destroyed city.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you love a game with a post apocalyptic atmosphere, a good storyline, good graphics, and a pretty good AI, then this is the game you have been searching for.the game has a few technical issues, bugs, and not too good of player involvement, but that is common with Bethseda games, as they leave the little issues for moders to fix. Overall, the games story is pretty dark, but throughout the story, I found myself having a laugh with the characters of the game. IF you liked Skyrim, this is a game you'll want, Fallout in general is a similar version of the elder scrolls, hust a deifferent story and environment. the shooter part of the game isn't fantastic, but the story takes all the games issues and covers them with a layer of paint , and makes the paint job look very nice. this game passes with a rating of 7.9, very good.

												This is one of my favorite games ever, i remember when i got New vegas and i played it for a while but after a while it was boring but now i have fallout 3 and it's worth 70 NOK (Norwegian kroner). Fallout 3 hasn't crashed yet for me but New vegas is glitchy as hell. 9.5/10 So good!I also recommend buying the game of the year edition!When i was following the dad i used a shotgun and he used his fists he took less damage than me2Logic4Me			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I bought this game for $2.49+tax and I that means I need at least spent 3 hours on this but I spent over 30 hours on a game that game out 7 years ago! I enjoyed 99% of it and ever time I had to walk to a desination there were raiders, ghouls, muntants creatures and I love it. The only problem is that the ending sucks and I wish that it work with Window 7< but becasue I manuly go the files and change them it made it feel worth it. But Fallout New Vegas is better if you want to mod the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(Note that I have played hours of this game but steam stopped counting the play time once I press play on the launcher.) Fallout 3 is a phenomenal game and I highly recommend playing it for atleast a half hour. it's a pain to get it working on windows 7 and higher, but its worth it. If you know a lot about computers it should take around 10-15 minutes to get working but if you're a computer noob like me it should take around 30-45 minutes to get the game working with no crashes/graphical bugs.Now, lets talk about the game as a whole.Graphics yet outdated add something to it, the atmosphere of the weast land just goes with it.The AI isn't the best but it doesn't hinder the experience much.Bugs/glitches are common in the game but there more funny then anything, such as corpses spazzing out when you kill them. Some screen tearing here in there but nothing to bad, I don't think you would notice it.There is a glitch with the radio that some might have that causes the radions audio to become choppy or studder but this can be fix.Remember, this isn't like a cod game or some crap, this is a shooter that requires skill and smart thinking to get past even the most simple super mutant. This game will test you in the most epic of ways. Buy this game and be sucked into the greatest most deep game ever made. FALLOUT 4 HYPE!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing! This game is all in all 11/10 if that was possible! The only catch is you have to change a few settings for Windows 7 or later and run the game on compatibility mode and on Windows 7 you have to edit some core usage but instead of me explaining how to do this on this review just go to utube and search it up. Try find the one with vault boy holding a TV (thumbnail) the title is 'how to fix crashes for fallout 3 on Windows 7 or later' that's not word for word so just look for something on the lines of that and the thumbnail is vault boy holding a tv. Apart from that this game is amazing for its time (2008) and its graphics on ultra are pretty good for the games age but all in all this is a must have especially if you like fallout 4 this is a good cheap alternative however I have been a fallout fan since the first game so I got all of them!

												If you are looking for a cool open world RPG shooter BUY THIS GAME! This game is so amazing. Fallout 3 takes place in a post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. destroyed by nuclear war. This wasteland has been infected by horribly disgusting radiated creatures and different factions trying to control the wasteland. Fallout 3 is a very special experience. Although before you buy this game I would like to state a few of the negatives. First of all the game has not been optimized for anything newer than Windows XP so if you have Windows 7 or newer you will have to go through this process in order for the game to work. Secondly the game was made nearly 8 years ago so the graphics are kind of bad. Also the animations are clunky and the shooting can feel akward at times. But if you can get past that the game is amazing. The story feels kind of cliche but the beauty of the game. Once you leave get out into the wasteland you can completely ignore the main story and basically do whatever you want. There are interesting locations and fun quests to discover. I don't think it's as good as Skyrim but it's still an amazing RPG experience. I woud give it a 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my favorite FpS.(for right now) This game has a massive map with fun characters such as fawkes and jericho! BUT their are problems such as you have to look up a video on youtube just to get the thing to run correctly!But this game is fun once you get into it.Just put on some headphones turn off the lights and you are imersed INTO a great world where your going to be able to fight,scavenge,trade,Travel,and kill any one you see execpt children! ALSO YOU  CAN NUKE A TOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So what do i give this game Well it is a 97% You will easily put at least 20 to 30 hours minimum. Now their is less content then Fallout 4 trust me i've played it on the PS4. HAS WAY MORE CONTENT BUT this does the JOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fallout 3 is a welcomed addition to the Fallout family, but is not without its flaws.I'll start with the positives: I thoroughly enjoyed scavenging the wastes in search of rare loot, conversing with unique characters, completing challenging quests, and going toe-to-toe with frightening creatures. Fallout 3 is brimming with content, and will surely offer you dozens of hours of enjoyment.Now for the negatives: at the time of writing, Fallout 3 is nearly nine years old, and it really shows in some areas--low resolution textures, odd facial animations, and an overall ""janky"" feel to many of its mechanics. The gun-play feels weak (no iron sights to be found in most weapons), the game as whole is prone to crashes, and the story ending is surprisingly underwhelming.Despite showing some age and sporting a lackluster conclusion, Fallout 3 is great fun. However, I still hold true to the notion that Fallout: New Vegas is the series' pinnacle. Regardless, Fallout 3 offers hours upon hours of entertainment, and I highly recommend picking up a copy.

												My laptop won't even run this, so I have not been able to play it yet. However, a friend of mine screen shared over Skype, and what followed was a lot of fun and even more lag (the fault of Skype as screen sharing does that sometimes.). She tried really hard not to loot anyone because she had a nude mod installed, but eventually gave up because this was five years ago and she figured I would have seen nudity at fifteen. Anyway, she eventually spelled out ""Hello"" in limbs she collected from her victims, and any game that allows for that is pretty much a gem in my eyes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is great! There are tons of quests, lots of areas to explore and various weapons. The only downside there is is that you HAVE to side with the Brotherhood of Steel in the normal storyline. I recommend getting the game of the year edition; I have it for the Xbox 360 and it's way cheaper than to buy every single DLC on it's own. For the creative people among us; the G.E.C.K. is included with the game which allows you to create and edit the landscape, buildings, interiors and you can edit the stats of certain items. It's also extremely easy to create mods, so if you're new to developing this is a nice way to start.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright Fallout 3 is a great game, I have it on console and I love it. Wanted to take it on the go, downloaded it on steam, ""Fallout 3 is not optimized for Windows 7 and later"" no problem its an easy fix. My first problem: game won't launch, solution download this [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5549] it downloads windows live because this game is optimized for Windows Vista. You don't need to do anything with it, just install and you will have the necessary files to RUN fallout 3.My second problem: when I try to start a new game the game crashes, solution go here and download it   [https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ot8tm7szvlnuks/d3d9.dll] Once you have the file downloaded put in the Fallout 3 folder. 1. Open program files(x86)2. Steam3. Steam apps4. Common5. Fallout 3 or Fallout 3 GOTY whichever one you havePlace the d3d9.ll file in the fallout 3 folder.With that the game should be playable. If the game still crashes after trying to start a new game you can TRY this if you have a multi-cored processor. If you don't, I still recommend you try this 1. Launch the game and go to the main menu.2. While it is running, open the task manager and go to the details tab3. Right click on Fallout3.exe and go to properties4. Select compatibility and choose windows vista5. Hit APPLY THEN OK6. Right click on Fallout3.exe again and go to set affinity7. Select 1 cpu not all of them.8. Restart the game and it should workNow if the game works but you are experiencing frequent crashes you can:(WARNING THIS COULD DELETE SAVES I SUGGEST YOU GO TO Documents\My Games\Fallout3\Saves AND COPY AND PASTE ALL SAVES IN A DIFFERENT FOLDER OR ANYWHERE YOU FEEL IS EASY TO ACCESS)1. Open up the Fallout.ini file in: Documents\My Games\Fallout3 2. Find the line: bUseThreadedAI=0 (you can use ctrl+f to find it faster)3. Change it to: bUseThreadedAI=1 4. Add another line after it and insert: iNumHWThreads=2			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fallout 3 is a breath taking game that was unreal at its time. There are many aspects of this game that I liked and few i didnt like about the game.I'll start off listing the positives: + Alot of game play to keep you busy for awhile!+ Great Dialogue, alot of choices to choose your fate.+ High replay value.+ Dynamic leveling system to always keep the game fresh.+ Modding Community will keep you busy for hours and hours.Here are some negatives that come to mind:- Games for Windows Live sucks.- ALT+TAB crashes- Problems with compatibility with newer OS's.- Must buy Broken Steel DLC to extend the ending and to continue playing the game.Overall this is a wonderful game and I strongly recommend it to anyone.My Rating: ★★★★★			",188,19,6,16,17,2,12

My only complaints are that the game was VERY unstable, randomly crashing the first few times that I played it.  However, after running in compibility mode, and tweaking some config files, I got it running.  Also, the ending was somewhat anticlimatic,  but my character died a hero.

												When I first ever saw Fallout 3, was when my sister was playing, and i fell in love with it. Fallout 3 is the game i must say got me into gaming in general, and its sequel ""Fallout New Vegas"" is what got me onto Steam in the first place, Fallout 3 technically gave me more vocabulary to use (Not the profanity) but the more advanced words, in which i knew what alot meant due to FO3 and i was using them while in 5th and 6th grade, its truly wonderful. Now i know it isnt exactly a  Rated for everyone game, but this game got my friends, not only on PSN but in school and so much more, i could have so many conversations just about this and its succeeding game, and so on. Anyways, what i loved about Fallout so much, is that it wasnt just a wasteland game, it was everything from A Nuclear Post-Apocalypse Wasteland to a Zombie Apocalypse to even a monster one. I truly do love this game, as there really is alot too do, and its plot is marvelous, and the fact that it doesnt technically make you do a quest, but gives 100+ more that you must find. Another big thing i love about it, is that it isnt modern, or technically future either, but that its staged in the 40s- 60s, and that theres always a story that backs ups your player, and then customization also. The factions are awesome too, my favorite faction actually, as one of their soldiers faces' is my profile picture, is the Enclave (Enclave Armed Forces) and that i actually would love it if one of the later Fallouts gave you the ability to really join it, and rise through the ranks, like how it was in FO3 with the Brotherhood Of Steel, and in FNV with The N.C.R and Caeser's Legion, but one can only wish and dream for right? Anyways, I totally recommend this to ALL gamers, even those who hate it because it ""Sucks"" in which they only say that, Because they die so quick after leaving Vault 101 and Megaton.  One miore thing, Ive replayed/played this game so much that i know how to beat it's main quest within an hour or two, and the same with all add-ons, thus is why i have Fallout3:Game Of The Year Edition on Ps3, and Regular Fallout 3 in my steam library.

												Whoa boy, radiation up the booty hole.Gameplay:Let's start with positive things, yes? The weapons do a fair amount of damage, Combat Shotgun for the win. Enemy spawn points make sense in the areas they spawn in(Which is actually important!) Most of the time the game has good spots for recovery & healing. Now the bad things, kay? The combat becomes repetitive at times. (Example, in the order it usually goes, depending on location: Raiders, Talon Company Mercs, Super Mutants/Centaurs, Mirelurks, Super Mutants.) Another thing about the Super Mutants, the Super Mutant Master can withstand two direct hits with a Missle Launcher on Normal. I know they're big, but they shouldn't be that OP.Soundtrack:Soundtrack as in the ambient tracks & atmosphere! I loved it, very dark & grimey. Makes you feel like you're absolutely trashed a long with the rest of the world, facing your actual fate. ""Think Fast, Shoot Faster."" is by far my favorite track during battle sequences. And the name really fits with the song itself! Great soundtrack, awesome atmosphere.Story:I like the whole idea of Trying-To-Find-Your-Father-Who-Left-Home type of story, but let's be honest. It's pretty cliché, even for a 2008 game. Didn't stop me from playing though, I liked the progression. Although the pacing of the story was extremely fast & short! I felt the story-telling had potential, but it didn't pro-long the fact that you're from a Vault, stood there for 19 years, that your dad was a top notch scientist. I felt it could have been so much longer.Visuals:Loved the disgusting visuals (That's a complement!), I've always been a sucker for destroyed cities that are covered with radiation. I noticed they went for that ""Irradiated Air"", effect~ Which is an absolutely sexy touch to the game! Radiation for everyone~ The default character face models are kinda meh. It seems as if the player's face is naturally low-res while the NPC faces are buffed to HD. I have found a modification for Fallout 3 to drastically increase the Player's face quality, here it is: http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/19375/?Conclusion:I could understand that the game was made by a different company, due to their different aspects of Fallout, and the fact that it was published in 2008. By all means, this game is actually not that bad. Just a few flaws here & there, but it passes the time with it's scenery & exploration! Definitely a buy.8.2/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Whoa boy, radiation up the booty hole.Gameplay:Let's start with positive things, yes? The weapons do a fair amount of damage, Combat Shotgun for the win. Enemy spawn points make sense in the areas they spawn in(Which is actually important!) Most of the time the game has good spots for recovery & healing. Now the bad things, kay? The combat becomes repetitive at times. (Example, in the order it usually goes, depending on location: Raiders, Talon Company Mercs, Super Mutants/Centaurs, Mirelurks, Super Mutants.) Another thing about the Super Mutants, the Super Mutant Master can withstand two direct hits with a Missle Launcher on Normal. I know they're big, but they shouldn't be that OP.Soundtrack:Soundtrack as in the ambient tracks & atmosphere! I loved it, very dark & grimey. Makes you feel like you're absolutely trashed a long with the rest of the world, facing your actual fate. ""Think Fast, Shoot Faster."" is by far my favorite track during battle sequences. And the name really fits with the song itself! Great soundtrack, awesome atmosphere.Story:I like the whole idea of Trying-To-Find-Your-Father-Who-Left-Home type of story, but let's be honest. It's pretty cliché, even for a 2008 game. Didn't stop me from playing though, I liked the progression. Although the pacing of the story was extremely fast & short! I felt the story-telling had potential, but it didn't pro-long the fact that you're from a Vault, stood there for 19 years, that your dad was a top notch scientist. I felt it could have been so much longer.Visuals:Loved the disgusting visuals (That's a complement!), I've always been a sucker for destroyed cities that are covered with radiation. I noticed they went for that ""Irradiated Air"", effect~ Which is an absolutely sexy touch to the game! Radiation for everyone~ The default character face models are kinda meh. It seems as if the player's face is naturally low-res while the NPC faces are buffed to HD. I have found a modification for Fallout 3 to drastically increase the Player's face quality, here it is: http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/19375/?Conclusion:I could understand that the game was made by a different company, due to their different aspects of Fallout, and the fact that it was published in 2008. By all means, this game is actually not that bad. Just a few flaws here & there, but it passes the time with it's scenery & exploration! Definitely a buy.8.2/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite the hassle to download it for PC due to it not being optimized for anything above Windows XP, but once you fix everything, you'll have a blast. This game is top notch and well worth the money. Sure it's a little old now, but it's very worthwhile if you're new to Bethesda Games or the Fallout series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Eh, it's alright.Seriously though, nothing less to be said about the game that single-handedly revitilized the franchise. Yes, it's different than its predecessors, and not everyone's cup of tea, but it's definitly worthy to stand on its own right - witty, engaging, immersive, fun, addicting, and highly moddable could have you playing Fallout 3 nearly indefinitely.

												First off let me make this perfectly clear, I love this game. It's just far to much work to get it to run on Win8/Win10, but Win7 or below work just fine. To get the game to work you need to go into the game files and change quite a few files to compatablilty mode for both WinXP and WinVista. Great game, poor port.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I know that this has already been said before, but Steam/Valve needs to fix the problems with this game loading up the launcher and then not eing able to load up the actual game itself. I was very looking forward to playing this game especilly since it went on sale, but now i feel that I have wasted $10. Imagine that it wasn't on sale, and so many more eople experienced this same problem. Is there a support number to call or something I can do? I just wanted to load up a game, but it appears to be more difficult than it looks. Please fix this problem, or at least put up a support or refund button somewhere. Thanks for hearing me out.

												Don't get fooled, the 7 minutes I have is not true, it's because of trying to get it to play on Windows 10 caused Steam to not pick up the time I played.Brings back nostalgia when i first played this in 2011 on November on a Black Friday, this is a nice piece to add towards your fallout collection.Gameplay wise it's a clunky like most games for it's time, but it make sit up for it's side quests, characters, and most of all it's Atmosphere. It ties together with Fallout 4, while Fallout 4 has little to do with Fallout 3.I would recommend this game for those who were born from before 1980's to 2012, since gamers within that time frame have experienced games like this, but some never got to play.

												- Get Arefu Expanded Mod- Go to Arefu- Spend 3 hours f*cking around- Wait till night near a sleeping arms dealer- Steal his footlocker and safe key- Beat him to death with a cattle prod (well, unconcious.)- Throw him off the edge of Arefu - Steal all his sh*t- Start quest because he stole something from someone - Wait till next day, never see Crazy Leg Johnny in Arefu again- Think: Who needs him... I have all his sh*t and his caps! wahahahahhaha- Forget about Crazy Leg Johnny- Go do some quests in Arefu (fetch quests.. basically walking around the town for about 2 hours. Yes I did that...) - Find out Crazy Leg Johnny is trying to kill Dogmeat, your pet companion- Knock crazy leg johnny with kill command (he is apparently invincible)- Throw him off the ledge again, altho this time much farther.♥♥♥♥♥off, Johnny!- Screw around with his body while he's unconcious, and try to throw it so far it disappears- Fail miserably- Give up trying to make him disappear- Look for some random tools a guy wants you to find- Give up after 5 minutes- Go do some Moira apocalypse book quests*FAST FORWARD MUCH LATER IN THE DAY*- Feel like you need more mods- Go on Nexus, download everything that looks interesting and fun or anything that looks like ""hey that could add a couple more hours of gameplay to this game.""- End up adding over 300 hours worth of content with guns, armor, quests, safehouses, companions, etc- Spend hours installing 3000 mods- Spend 5 minutes sorting through mods and testing to see if game crashes- Repeat----Real ReviewI reset my entire game and now i have only around 50-100 mods. It runs way better, now. And i've only had 1 crash since.I was in the supermarket with my follower Malcom, he took out a few raiders, and I sat there behind cover firing at them. I eventually killed most of them, but then after I looted them and was in the pharmacy area, more came in. By more, I mean like 50 more. It was insane. I holed up in a room, threw a bottlecap mine, closed the door. Then I jumped over the counter and walked behind one, then he backed up into the mine, and two guys exploded. Leaving me, and Malcom.This game is amazing still even though it's so old.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fallout 3 is an immersive, open-world RPG game. It has to be my favorite, because the storyline is compelling, and there are so many choices in the game. It strikes me as a Borderlands-type game, minus the comic humor and the overrated sexual references. Although I am a fan of first-person shooters, this game has trully earned the #1 spot on the ""Most Amazing Games Ever"" list. I have enjoyed the game, and I hope if any of you seek to get it that you will enjoy it as much as I did. So, get the game, play it, and hope for Fallout 4 my friends!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the game alot with the cool weapons, stuff and many other places you can explore, gain karma or lose karma but who cares about karma, i do but anyways. Theres a glitch for me but i dont care about it....... The glitch is, everytime i see the fridge in megatown my fallout 3 crashes so i just never see that fridge. The game haves so many places to explore, many too loot, make friends and discover new places witch (is like skyrim) is 10 times better and fun...... Witch makes me play fallout3 alot and the good thing is with steam i like it better than my PS3 because i can put money with every kind of money so yea, it makes me happy and it should make YOU happy so SIT IN YOUR CHAIR AND BUY THIS AWESOME GAME WHO EVER DOESNT HAVE FALLOUT 3! NOW!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fallout 3 is a profoundly engrossing role-playing game just waiting to reveal its deep, dark mysteries.Freedom to explore what you want, when you want. Fantastic, intricate quests can be completed in a variety of satisfying ways. VATS combat system results in all sorts of tense and gruesome encounters. Outstanding art design makes for a desolate DC. Rewarding mixture of excitement and atmospheric exploration.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DO NOT BUY FOR WINDOWS 7 OR LATER!!I knew that this game was not 'optimized' for windows 7 but  merely took that performance wise (as in FPS etc.) maybe im just stupid. In fact not being optimized causes the game to crash basically every time you enter a building which is such a shame because  played this a little on xbox 360 and it is AWESOME (thus the thumbs up) so if your still XP or even Vista you are not a gamer until you have played this game, truly awesome they have seriously pulled of the post apocalyptic eery feeling to the point you crap yourself whenever something happens (I know this from playing on xbox) but for Windows 7 big no no, i suggest fallout new vegas which is also very good and basically the same but..new suff! BUY BUY BUY....unless you own windows 7 or later...which i think like..most of the world does..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love Fallout 3. Literally love it. It's so big, there's so much to do, it isn't even funny. It will take you about 100+ hours to do absolutely EVERYTHING. The graphics were a bit outdated, but they still looked good with enough detail in them. But playing in third person just felt weird. It didn't look right. But then again, the game was made to be played in first person and this is where, without a doubt, it succeeded. The VAT system is brilliant and making kills in slow motion looks kickass. The quests were awesome as well, some of them were very memorable even. I loved the quest where you first encounter the super mutant behemoth. Ah the memories... Good times ! Must own ![Rating: 92/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Normally, I prefer to wait until I finish a game to review it, but I'd like to at least make it clear that this version of Fallout 3 is NOT stable. The game repeatedly crashed upon encountering enemies, while trying to load new music to play, or, more unpredictably, from collision detection.I had to run the game in Vista compatability mode, install an unofficial bug-fixing patch, and edit one of the game's .ini files (all in tandem) to get it to run in what I can assume is stable, so if you are that strongly determined to play Fallout 3 on PC, you have to keep in mind that you will be doing these kinds of things to the game's files, and it might not work exactly the same on your hardware. Otherwise, grab the console version of Fallout 3.It's a shame a game that's been quite good so far is brought down by its terrible instabiliy on Windows 7 and higher.==Edit for folks commenting==Seeing as a few people keep reading this as me ""not reading the product description,"" allow me to elaborate. No, this game is not optimized for Windows 7 and later, but yes, you can make it work on a Windows 7, 8, or what have you. I knew this when I bought this. It's just a slight hassle tinkering with it and checking the program to make sure it's stable, and I don't imagine most people have the same patience for that when they could use the same time to get the console version of Fallout 3. I am willing to bet that the average person wouldn't have the same patience to do the three tasks I mentioned in order to get this running stably, thus, I am not recommending on that basis.Don't twist my words or say I'm ""b---ching"" when I'm not, thank you kindly.

												NOTE: I don't enjoy the Fallout series, the only one that looks playable for me is Fallout 4 and thus my opinions will be somewhat negative.    Now, Fallout was originally owned by Interplay. It was originally a top-down exploration type thing. Not even joking. Bethesda then bought the series and developed this... thing. Most gamers will say they love the Fallout series, and thus the reason Fallout 4 is doing so well in sales (plus it's a really good game). Fallout 3 is Skyrim, with guns. Just really weird gunplay mechanics sadly. The story was actually quite good, despite the fact that I don't really like this game. I can't seem to get over it all.    tl;dr Fallout 3 isn't for me, but might be for you. (hence the ""yes"" recommendation)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great RPG. I would Actually get New Vegas.Pros:- runs smoothely(once fixed)- huge world that you can interact with your imaginations limit- Good story(voice acting, great story and lore, true to it's Sci - Fi Nature, etc)Cons:- This game should really be optimized(if not, than remastered with New Vegas at some point)Overall - 8.8/10 - An awesome RPG experience***FIX'S YOU CAN TRY***1. go into the start menu and change how the world renders with antmospheric filtering and world object rendering and launch the game(This actually worked for me, i don't know how).2. launch the game with all you settings done and press ""Ctrl + Alt + Del"" and go into task manager. Right click application to go to processes and look for the process that is highlighted blue. Next, right-click the highlighted process and right-click ""Set Affinity."" Finally, un-check all the boxes except for ""CPU 1 AND CPU 0"" and that's it. Go back into game, but you may have problems going back through fullscreen, so try launching in borderless windows mode.***ALL SOLOUTIONS JUST KEEP THE GAME RUNNING FOR LONGER AND DOES NOT COMPLETELY SOLVE THE PROBLEM NO MATTER WHAT TECHNIQUE YOU USE. SAVE FREQUENTLY!****EDITthere are more techniques and even apps, but try these first. They might work.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ETA: I also play this game on Windows 10 with no problems.  I had to google how to make sure it would run - so go on and make sure you can run it on your particular version of Windows. Update: I just finished the main storyline, and...WOW.  I loved this game.  I'm disappointed, however, that you don't have the option or ability to continue playing the game after you complete the storyline.  I really wanted to be able to explore the world after beating the game.  It's really fun to be able to run all over the map and discover more places.  I wish the game had that ability (Without having to buy the DLC).I got this game on sale after hearing a lot of people talking about how much they loved it.  They warned me, said I would be gripped by it and I received numerous ""RIP your social life"" messages...and they were right.  This game really immerses me to the point that I lose track of time and I'm completely dead to the rest of the real world.  When I purchased this game I didn't know anything about the Fallout games other than it's a post-apocalypse after a nuclear war.  That was it.Enemies in this game range from annoying (dogs and boatflies) to creepy (feral ghouls) to monstrous (super mutant brutes...). I find that I take a lot of sadistic pleasure in wiping out entire clans of raiders, especially once they start calling me names (""only a coward hides!"" yeah? eat my bullets!).  The best part about the game, however, is the level design.  The detail in Washington, DC is really impressive to me.  I've been to DC more times than I can count on both hands and I found myself recognizing places and admiring the attention to detail.  Having been in the metro hundreds of times, I also appreciated the detail in the metro stations, which was also pretty spot on.  Heck, even the sidewalks are pretty accurate.  I really appreciate the graphics.The story is intriguing and the world itself is so deep that I feel I won't be able to complete this game very quickly.  The last game that really grabbed my interest in this way was Half Life 2, which was a purchase well worth my money as well.  I definitely recommend this game to anyone regardless of your tastes in video games.  This one will change you!			",23,5,0,4,4,0,1

												If you have Windows 8 and up, DO NOT get this game. Why? Well for starters, it doesn't run on anything above windows 7. And if you have anything over that, and still want to play fallout 3, let me tell you right now, it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get working.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you're using Windows 8. It will not run. Not even after spending a lot of time with different ""fixes"". You might get it to run for some time, but it will crash ... and crash ... and crash. Instead get Fallout:New Vegas or wait for Fallout 4.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Escape the Vault and face the Wasteland while you are trying to find your father. Your actions will come with rewards and consequences. In the Wasteland you will find many people and creatures, many weapons and items. So, explore the Wasteland and watch yourself, and by the way, if you see a bunch of Deathclaws, use your Fat Man or...run.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played Fallout 3 and beat it. I started a new playthrough using FOSE and tons of mods to make my game look beutiful. Started a 3rd play through with even more mods. Now I have around 200 hours and  own every Fallout game, I also have dedicated a whole shelf to Fallout. Plz send help I don't want to know what will happen when Fallout 4 comes out.

												I can't lie, this is an amazing game. I had it for xbox 360 and it was my #1 most played fame along with new vegas, but it dosen't run on my pc. I can load tons of other games but this on won't seem to work. I ended up refunding it in the end. get this game if your pc can handle it. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite having major setbacks on compatibily (35 minutes trying to get it to start first off) and then trying to get alt + tab to work, this game is a beauty. The graphics stand out for it's time and the gameplay still outshines most modern games in the era. If your like me and decided to buy and/or play Fallout 3 before you get number 4, keep yout hair on because Fallout 4 is going to smash the guidlines right past Fallout 3!			",86,14,2,11,36,0,11

												I do not recommend anyone with Windows 7 or higher to buy this game. For one reason and one reason only, it keeps on freezing and crashing with most people on the internet, and I am one of those victoms. My advise? Dont pick up this game, pick up Fallout: New Vegas. New Vegas can work for Windows 7.Dont get me wrong, Fallout 3 is a great game. But the sole fact that you cant play Fallout 3 on W7 just really disappoints me. I have look up tutorials on how to fix these issues, and I still got those problems. And the main problem is that Bethseda wont fix this, and they are currently not improving on this.If you want to play Fallout 3, just buy it for your PS3 or Xbox 360, grab the Game of the Year while your at it. Yeah, you wont play with mods, but atleast you'll still be playing the game.Edit: 12/9/2014. Recently, I modified my Fallout 3 launcher and game to be compatible for Windows 7, a simple fix. The game runs fine, but I did encountered some lag spikes from time to time, and some freezes there and here (However, I did managed to complete two quests without encountering some freezes. Only time I encountered a freeze was in my Megaton house, which happened two times. The second time happened a few seconds after starting up the game again)But man, the jump to the PC is awesome. There is a lot I can see that I couldnt see in the console ports! I do recommend this game, its pretty fun.			",79,8,1,13,10,2,4

												Think of this game as a ""My First Fallout"". It does a great job of introducing all the basic concepts of the series - the wasteland, vaults, factions, etc. - but is nowhere near as good as the other games in the series. Play this and then play New Vegas and you'll feel the difference. Still a fun game to play, but think of it as a stepping stone towards its superior siblingsPROS- Art style that really captures a post-apocalyptic future by way of '50s Americana- Soundtrack is amazing, featuring a mix of haunting orchestral pieces and catchy old-time swing standards- Does a (mostly) good job of transitioning from isometric turn-based combat system to first-person shooter combat- Story is more cohesive than the one in New Vegas (IMO) and gives you a good excuse for venturing out into the wasteland- Moira Brown and Three Dog are the best characters in the series. I will fight you on thisCONS- All RPG elements have been stripped to the bare minimum to the point where it's more of an action game with some RPG mechanics instead of a true RPG- Player choice is severely limited - you cannot join different groups, you can't really choose a different ending, and the final mission is little more than a corridor shooting gallery- Factions are sad parodies of their former selves- Everything that happens is triggered by your father - you are basically a spectator to his much more interesting story			",63,14,0,15,6,0,11

												I am ready for the wave of argumentative people after they have read what I have to say. Where to start? Before I bring the negatives out, I will say how much I LIKE the game so far! I've never played Fallout 3 until this year, the story is great at the moment, the music is wonderful, I like where it is heading to and the environment is fantastic! Although I like the game, unfortunately I can't enjoy playing it. Don't get me wrong, for an old game it's expected, but the aiming is absolutely terrible. I can only get a clear shot if the person is nearly touching me. My other downfall is the unexpected freezing of the game, at least seven to eight times it has occurred today leaving me frustrated and heavy.I wish I could recommend this game, but I just can't due to the issues on my part.

												Despite having major setbacks on compatibily (35 minutes trying to get it to start first off) and then trying to get alt + tab to work, this game is a beauty. The graphics stand out for it's time and the gameplay still outshines most modern games in the era. If your like me and decided to buy and/or play Fallout 3 before you get number 4, keep yout hair on because Fallout 4 is going to smash the guidlines right past Fallout 3!			",86,14,2,11,36,0,11

												I am ready for the wave of argumentative people after they have read what I have to say. Where to start? Before I bring the negatives out, I will say how much I LIKE the game so far! I've never played Fallout 3 until this year, the story is great at the moment, the music is wonderful, I like where it is heading to and the environment is fantastic! Although I like the game, unfortunately I can't enjoy playing it. Don't get me wrong, for an old game it's expected, but the aiming is absolutely terrible. I can only get a clear shot if the person is nearly touching me. My other downfall is the unexpected freezing of the game, at least seven to eight times it has occurred today leaving me frustrated and heavy.I wish I could recommend this game, but I just can't due to the issues on my part.

												A classic of modern gaming and a game everyone had already played or at least heard about.In the year 2077, the Earth was destroyed by a nuclear war. A company called Vault-Tec started building giant underground shelters several years prior to the war, so that, in case something happens, people can continue living in those safe places. Now, 200 years after the war, you play a young character whose father suddenly left the vault and caused a state of panic in the vault and you decide to leave after him. You open the vault door and step outside into an utterly destroyed and dangerous world, following clues to find your father and find what he's been up to.The world is open, you can go wherever you want from the beginning, and it's filled with a lot of side quests, locations to explore, enemies to kill and corpses to loot.Compared to the previous two Fallout games, this one is a bit different. Not only the game is fully 3D, but it's also set on the east coast, as opposed to the west like before, where everything seems to be much more affected by the bombs and people haven't been able to establish reliable sources of food, water, or even settlements, so most of them live inside creatively built places inside ruins of already existing world objects, while being constantly in danger of raiders, bandits, mutants, and other enemies who are fighting to get food and supplies.Pros:+Open world+Fun and engaging combat system+The world is full of interesting places to explore+There is a crafting system+Some quests are pretty unique and entertainingCons:-Dialogs are kinda binary and shallow.-Some of the ""big"" choices don't seem to matter because no one acknowledges them (*cough* Megaton *cough*)-Levelling system has less depth than in the previous games, and perks aren't that useful since most of them just add points to your skills.-Writing in the game is boring and the story is predictable.Overall, it's definitely a fun game, despite it's flaws. Fallout may have changed, but war, war never changes. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												War. War never changes...Fallout 3 can rightly be called one of the best games of its time.The game in which everything is filled with the spirit of post-nuclear -time .Where are you ready for hours to perform unnecessary line quests for tough arms.Where do you choose what is more valuable to you ... Weapons or 20 bottles of nuclear cola.Where are you ready to explore every nook and cranny in search of caps .Fallout ... Fallout never changes ...10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm playing Fallout 3 after New Vegas and this game made me appreciate every single item found in game,  you can even use the junk as the ammunition of the weapon,crafting system is awesome,the atmosphere was mind blowing and finally I understood how the real wasteland looks like and not the desert,  the only one thing I didn't like was the repair system,  now I can't repair my guns with the weapon kits anymore.  Anyways they are both amazing games and I recommend to start with the New Vegas,  this game will be damn hard for the beginners			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fallout 3 is one of the most exciting games I have played this year. I picked it up during the Steam Summer Sale plus DLC and was not disappointed. The story is amazing, as is the freedom of exploration. Would recommend to anyone who loves games and wants a challenging and freedom granting, yet deeply narrative driven, game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fallout 3's plot summary.Dad killed himself rather than let his broken machine fall into the hands of people trying to fix it. As a result, a water purifier that has no reason to exist released radiation it shouldn't have, thus killing Col Autumn, who had no reason to be there. Later we got through a villiage of children who fdso gah frrzlmpr blaa huygnnl asdf so we could enter vault 87 and recover a GECK, a device which would be better put to use in virtually any possible manner besides the one for which we had aquired it. Then Col Autumn, who shouldn't be alive, but is, captured us with a flash grenade that shouldn't have worked in a place he shouldn't have been able to reach, so he could stop us from fixing the machine he wanted fixed. He then tortured us for a code that didn't matter which we had no reason not to give him. Then, the president, which is a computer for absolutely no reason, set us free to enact his plan which was of benefit to absolutely no one, and then kills himself for no reason whatsoever.At the final battle, everyone in the world has the same goal: Turn on the water purifier. Due to this overwhelming consensus, we were obliged to fight a massive war. Finally, Col Autumn gave his life to stop us from turning on the machine he was trying to turn on. At the end, the Enclave defeated themselves by sabotaging the machine they where trying to activate, causing it to explode even though it shouldn't, and obliging us to enter the purifier and die of radiation that wasn't actually lethal. At least until the DLC retconned our death, making everything Fawkes ever said to you a lie. A ghoul companion refused to enter the chamber, even though ghouls are healed by radiation.It's a fun game otherwise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is an absolute classic. If you have played deus ex or any other bethesda game. I highly recommend you play this game. Lets go over some pros and cons.Pros:-Very atmospheric-Very fun-very good story-Open world-You can do what every you want (there are no boundries of which mission to do. The game does not force you)-There are A LOT of missions-Unlike skyrim there is a karma system. This affects the game a lot.-The ending is DYNAMITE!!!-Cons:-Windows 7 and later must install a program to run fallout (It's free. Dw.)-Graphics can be a little unbearable at times. (This gets 1/2 a mark becuase it's an old game and mods can be installed to make the game look nicer)-No workshop- V.A.T.S mode feels very cheaty sometimes but it's always satasfying.-Regular combat without V.A.TS mode feels dumb and goofy at times (Especially with Melee weapons)Overall Score 8/10. Would highly recommend. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My #1 favorite Bethesda game of all time. I highly reccomend this to absolutely everyone. If it's boring to you after the first playthrough, it has high replay-ability because of mods. The reason that I don't have much time put into it is because I launch the game through a different method. I modded the living sheisse out of this game, and it is more fun and realistic the way I did.10/10, Would blow up megaton again.... Not really, I think that's cruel of people to do, so I've never done so..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Once again Bethesda has really shown us what they're capable of Fallout 3 has a fantastic gameplay and the open world is highly detailed and fun to explore, although the story is not as interesting or strong as the previous Fallout games. Fallout is a third and first person RPG open world game that is set in a post-apocalyptic retro-future world. Fallout 3 takes place in the year 2277, 36 years after the setting of Fallout 2 and 200 years after the nuclear apocalypse that devastated the game's world in a future where international conflicts between the United States and China culminated in a Sino-American war in 2077. In Fallout 3 your decisions always have an effect on the story, for example if you choose to kill this person or let this person live the ending will be different depending on the decisions you make and the people you kill will never respawn so you must make a good choice as each decision has a consequence. After you have finished the main storyline there is many other things to do from a range of different side-missions to exploring the openworld. Overall I give this game a 8/10 the story is not as powerful as the previous Fallout games as everything else is fantastic the story is what needs working on. Still despite having a weak and boring story I still think FO3 is fantastic in terms of openworld and gameplay. If you don't really care too much about the weak and horrible story and you are only getting it for the open world and gameplay features then I suggest you go and get this epic game I am absolutely sure it will blow you away without a doubt!.

												This game is incredible it does work on windows 7 and 8 if you look up the youtube videos on how to fix it it took me a long time to figure out how to get my game to work and if you have tried all the other fixes and it is still not working there is a DLL file that is available for download along with another file that changes something about the game and that makes it work once it is working the game is great i have a 10 year old acer laptop and so long as i dont have tons of other stuff running with it on low graphics it runs with little to no lag			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This RPG is so great I bought it on every console, a retail PC copy and a steam copy. Played it for at least 1000 hours combined. beat it at least 10 times. Great narrative, but the DLC don't add much to the storry. The storry lasts 2 hours if you don't do side quests and fast travel a lot.Good graphics on the console, for its age, also a ton of graphical mods to improve the PC version. A huge modding community at nexus, the game features porn mods, halo mods, even a multiplayer mod.My only real complaint is 100mb save files. So for people who like having man saved games this is huge. I have 10GB in saves.			",556,91,21,51,47,7,79

												Fallout 3 is an extremely deceptively named game. Looking at the title you might expect to find a game that has something in common with the previous Fallout games yet what is actually hidden inside Fallout 3 is not a Fallout game, it is an Oblivion re-skin.Everything is pretty much the same as in Oblivion except it is now even more dated than before, the graphics, the path-finding AI, the inventory system, every piece of tech is horrible outdated and would feel out of place in an indie title.Fallout 3 tries to incorporate some of the features that made the old Fallout games eternal classic but it does so in the same low budget way it does everything else. Skill based dialog is in, but the writing is so atrocious that you actually feel slightly stupider for selecting it. All the names and items are in, Vaults, Nuka-Cola, Super Mutants, etc etc. But Bethesda never bothered to find out anything about them beyond the name, nothing has the same meaning in Fallout 3 that it did in Fallout 1 & 2. Instead Bethesda went for the quick-fix, the instant gratification.The game is even built for reviewers. As you leave the Vault for the first time you will find a ton of people, places and quests in your immediate vicinity and the first 3-4 hours of gameplay is highly content packed. But once you go beyond that starting area things quickly becomes more sparse and it's not uncommon to find a town consisting of 2 quest-givers and a merchant.Fallout 3 is not a Fallout game. It's Oblivion with Super Mutants and Nuka-Colas. Nothing more, nothing less.Buy this if you liked Oblivion but thought it would have been more entertaining with guns. Don't buy this if you expect a Fallout game.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												While the game starts out with excellent premise, the game as a whole I found rather boring, the combat is not entertaining, the main campaign is incredibly dull and there was no incentive to do sidequests. Getting anywhere takes forever and it's not that pretty a game so it can't really distract you, and everything is just grey. No matter where you are it's just grey, I understand that it's a post apocalyptic setting but there was no substance to it.On a lighter note the voice acting was excellent, there was some entertaining levels such as the one in the ""perfect world"" where you are a child who murders everyone, and the different ways to play also changed up the game a bit. But other than those notes I could just not find it entertaining at all.I know it gets rave reviews everywhere but I just could not enjoy whether it was overhyped I'm not sure but it was boring to me.

												Unmistakably a great installment in the loved Fallout Franchise. The only problem is that the game is rendered unplayable due to not being optimized for Windows 7 and above and Betheseda shows no signs of attempting fix the optimisation issues. Don't waste your money on the PC version of the game as it does not work. Buy Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 4 instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To make a lasagna u need : For the tomato meat sauce:2 x 28 oz. cans tomatoes - crushed or whole is best! If you get whole canned tomatoes just crush them in your hands.1-2 tbsp tomato paste (this is my favorite kind!)1 large oniongarlic, garlic, garlic - I always use a ton! I'd say two cloves minimum!1 pound ground beef, preferably lean1 pound Italian sausage - choose whatever spice level you like!dried oreganoItalian seasoningsalt and pepperfresh basil - dried can also be substituted!olive oilKeep in mind that if you can always just cook up some meat and then pour a couple jars of tomato sauce over it, so don't worry about it if you look at the ingredients and wonder what you've gotten yourself into.For the rest of the lasagna:1 package of noodles (should be around a pound in weight) - oven-ready or regular.1 lb. mozzarella1/2 lb. good quality parmesan1 lb. ricotta cheese1 eggdried oregano + basilHardware:large pan to make the sauce in13x9 baking dish - I recommend glasslarge pot for boiling pasta (if not using oven-ready noodles)]Step 2: Making the Meat Sauce, Part OnePrep work and browning the meat!Roughly dice the onion, and mince as much garlic as you want. I used quite a bit as you can see. :DOnce you've got the veggies prepped, film your sauce pan with olive oil. Heat the pan over medium and cook the ground beef and Italian sausage until browned. If a lot of fat seeps out, drain most of it. You need only a few tablespoons of fat to cook the onion and garlic in.Once you've drained the extra fat, throw in the onions and garlic.Stir this around for a few minutes over medium heat until the onions become soft. Then add in a few good pinches of Italian seasoning, a pinch of basil, oregano and salt, and a tablespoon or two of tomato paste.Step 3: Making the Meat Sauce, Part TwoNow, open both cans of tomatoes and dump them in. Mix it around for a moment, and bring to a light boil. Watch out for splatters!Lower the heat to a simmer and cover. Let the sauce simmer for at least a half hour while you do the rest of the prep work.Step 4: Cook (or Don't Cook) Your NoodlesAt this point, if you're using regular lasagna noodles, you'll need to fill a stock pot with water and cook those. I find it's best to cook them for the shortest time listed on the package or a minute or two under so they don't get soggy while the lasagna bakes.Once they're done, rinse them with cold water using a colander and set them aside. Try to separate them a bit so they stick less later.If you're using oven-ready noodles, you can worry about them later. :DStep 5: Prep the Cheese and Finish the SauceOver the years, I've started combining all my cheese at the beginning - it makes for easier assembly!Grab out a couple handfuls of parmesan and mozzarella and put them in a small bowl - this will be for topping the lasagna.Place the ricotta into a large bowl, along with one egg. Add the rest of the parmesan and mozzarella, as well as a couple good pinches of Italian seasoning and basil. Mix this all together with your hands.Once you're all done with the cheese, double check the sauce and adjust the flavors as necessary. You may need to add salt, sugar or more herbs - just keep adding and testing until it's good for you!If you're using fresh basil, chop up a handful and throw it in now. Once the basil is in, stir the sauce well and turn off the heat.Step 6: Assembling!Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F / 200 degrees C.Make sure your cheeses, noodles and sauce are all within easy reach.Ladle just enough sauce to cover the bottom of the pan. Then place noodles on top of the sauce just to cover, slightly overlapping. (If you're using over-ready noodles, follow the box directions) If they're broken, piece them together as much as possible. Spread 1/3 of the cheese mixture over the noodles.Now you'll put more sauce over the cheese and then noodles, more cheese, and then sauce again. You repeat the basic build three times.For the fourth and final level, lay down your cheese mixture and top with the rest of the sauce. Now sprinkle the parmesan and mozzarella you set aside over it.Now bake at 375 F for 40 minutes - if you're using a metal pan, check after 30 and make sure it's not too dark! If it's starting to get dark on top just pull it out. :)Once it's done baking, pull it out and let it sit for a few minutes before cutting into it! Otherwise it will just be hot lasagna lava.Serve it to a bunch of hungry friends and/or family with warm garlic bread and enjoy your hero status. :D ",64,12,1,2,2,0,1

												Windows 7 came out in 2009. The internal differences between that and vista were negligible, but apparently this game is such a hack that it has issues and Bethesda could not even be arsed to fix them within a year of the game's release (despite making content pack after content pack).But that really should be par for the course for the most incompetent developers in PC gaming history. My personal favorite moron moment was the randomly-generated starting dungeon in Daggerfall that was impossible to complete because it didn't randomly generate an exit. At least that game had some redeeming qualities. Fallout 3 does not.It doesn't make a damn bit of sense if you compare it to the other Fallouts, but the game is crap just on its own merits. Like every Bethesda game, the world is pointless and sterile and the quests are poorly written. The fact that it's set in the Fallout world just slaps insult on top of injury.What kind of idiots design an entire town full of annoying as♥♥♥♥♥♥children in a game where you are specifically not allowed to kill children? In a series notable for being able to do things like murder children and become a slaver? This thing is just an embarrassment. Thank goodness I have the old Fallouts from GoG.com before Bethesda acted like whiney babies and removed their games from any DRM-free service. Of course they want to control your access to better games from the past: They can only make their design seem like the incompetent♥♥♥♥♥♥show that it is.0 stars out of five. The fact that it will literally not run on a modern OS is its only redeeming quality. Oh yeah, and the fact that the game's heavy-handed (and obviously poorly written) story kills you at the very game. You won't be tempted to play this turd any more than you have to, provided you are on some kind of ancient, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ operating system needed to play it.Steam gets an additional 0 stars out of five for continuing to sell a game that  will not work on their service. No, a ""not optimized for"" minimum (lack of) responsibility warning is not sufficient. The game *WILL NOT RUN* on windows 8. I don't care what Gabe Newell's burrito-stuffing fat♥♥♥♥♥says about Windows 8; it is fast and very stable. It is unconscionable to continue to sell software that a modern OS cannot run.

												Okay, so I finally finished Fallout 3. And I'm gonna say I'm not amused.It is a cool experiment, — a first person action-RPG Fallout, — but the game overall feels cheesy and shallow, like an early unpolished prototype or like a fangame made by amateurs. And not only in terms of glitches and polishedness, but mostly in terms of variety, scenario, gameplay mechanics, level design, that stuff.Fallout 3 is not *that* Fallout game, it's just wannabe.Won't recommend it.5/10P.S. I should probably still check out New Vegas. It was made by another developer, right?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fallout 3 is... something. I can't really put into words why I don't like it. The graphics are fine by me (somehow), the quests are vibrant and unique, the characters are each of their own, but it just didn't work for me. I thought about if for an hour, after which I figured it out: Fallout 3 is TINY. Now sure, it doesn't look it, but it is. The game map is a tenth the size of Skyrim's, and if it's actually bigger it stil felt small. There are so many locations that the wasteland has the population density of NYC, and it takes about 5 hours from finding an area to figuring out what quest it's used for. There's a quest involving vampires and it took me an hour to find the correct area as their hideout alone, becauase I had a 45 degree area to search and there were 4 locations that fit the bill immediately out the gate. The quests are miniscule in number as well. Once you've completed the story, you've seen half of the major quests and the game doesn't let you keep playing after the main questline is over. God knows why. Every quest that isn't part of the main story is a one-off, no metter how clever. The skill system reflects the rest of the game, in that it is deceptive, and perpetually smaller than it looks. With the right SPECIAL point allocation you can see half of the perks from the very beginning. There is also a wide variety of weapons, but at level 70 you'll be looking at the same guns as at level 1 so that you've seen every gun 1000 times and by that point you've realized how static the gun variety is. In Skyrim, you started the game with 7 weapons and end with over 100, but in Fallout 3 you start with 30 and end with 35. I'm pretty sure that the Enclave has some weapons that aren't unlocked straight out the gate but with some fiddling you can pick those up in hour 6. The majority of the game is in random encounters that are over in a flash.Many of the coolest characters and factions are woefully underdeveloped. The Brotherhood and Enclave don't do jack until the story's endgame, with most others just sitting on their♥♥♥♥♥until their quest begins. Then they stop mattering once their quest is over. A major set of different armors isn't usable until your 2/3rds through the game. The most powerful weapon in the game can be found at any time, and you'll never know if I'm referring to the ray-gun or mini-nuke launcher because they are both instantly available. Skill point allocation is entirely manual, so the bare-knuckle mass murderer can totally put all of his training time and fighting experience into learning laser guns. It doesn't even matter, because the gunplay is just awful. You're expected to use a statistic-based aim-assist instead of the sights, so unless you put points into whatever SPECIAL that ups your VATS-points (they're really poorly defined) you basically can't fight anything.There's a wide variety of different sub-games at play at any given moment, from damage checks to weapon condition to hacking skill (if that's what you're currently doing) but none of them matter beyond a few examples. Every weapon class has one or two weapons which are better than all the others, so once you get enough points into whatever to get it, don't bother.Really, the game is just empty and overfull at the same time. I wouldn't recommend it.			",140,21,1,14,30,0,26

												To note, I know my account says only like  120 minutes but it's because I had to mod it to get it to work.Overal I give the game a 6 out of 10 and here is why.Graphics:The graphics of Fallout 3 are pretty good. The world looks very bleak, desolate and  quite lovely for the theme of Fallout. The problem I have is the random hitching and tearing of  parts of  buildings. Perhaps it was because of my settings not fallout. The other thing I noticed a lot was most of the faces of the normal humans were ugly. Just plain ole ugly, like obvilion ugly.Story:The  story  is awful. SPOILERS DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE GAME.I don't get how the begining and ending  is even good. I don't see how any reasonable person would be like,♥♥♥♥♥♥YOUR FATHER  LEFT? WELL WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO KILL  YOU  BECAUSE OF HIM AND HOW JONAS DIED!!!And when are we going to stop doing the  whole, sacrifice yourself for  the greater good? Almost every game out there has that. Either you destroy everoyne with that virus in the water, you don't  fix the purifier or  you sacrifice yourself for the greater good. I love how there was only 39 rads per second, you could easily buff/rad x  out that but wait, it's a cut scene so yeah. The side quests/changed in the world are rather enjoyable. Such as getting the ghouls into tenpenny tower and many other aspects that I found enjoyable.Leveling system/RPG aspect:The leveling system stays true to Fallout series. You start by making out your character like normal,  as you level you get skill points, get to tag skills and etc. The perks are enjoyable but a lot  of the perks/skills are useless..  I mean you absoultely don't even need bartering skills because caps are almost worthless because you can trade everything for everything. I basically had about 200+ stims  near  early game which means I basically could not die. I do like how the speech skill was worth while to get certain things done anther way.Bugs:This game had an awful a lot of bugs with certain NPCs getting stuck, randomly dying and etc. Not to mention I had to mod the hell out of this game for a steam game and for Windows 7. I know the game is a bit dated but I never ever had to change much for other games that are the same age.Regardless, I suggest getting a few of the game fixing mods.			",148,20,5,22,10,1,12

												 I could not really tell if the game is bad or good, because i simply couldn't start playing it. Be aware people that there is some issues with games with GAME FOR WINDOWS LIVE,  games via steam are unable to play. After spending the afternoon looking on forums following extremily complicated advices, updating, deleting, modificating downloading mods, (gave me an headache) and seeing that the the best result i could get (updating the bloody GFWL) was to open the game windows leading inexorably to the crash of this last one. (and computer system and settings are not in cause, i've also controlled that).The same probleme occure with an other Game For Windows live's game, i also bought, and in forums it was said that the issue would be taking care of and solved for december...So my advice, don't buy any games that worked with GFWL on steam, not until solutions are found...

												This game has NOT aged well; here are the reasons:1. Takes around 1-2 hours to sort out the bugs (including: crashing at start, minimizing at random intervals, crashing when entering rooms, lagging when someone speaks, freezing)2. Downloading the programs and unofficial patches to fix said bugs3. The game was left to rot by bethesda for they are now too busy making DLC for fallout 44. There's a part in the game where you have to battle a lot of mutants (I mean a LOT; mini gunners, hunters and even mutants with smg's) and I thought, well I'm too new to the game so I might as well stick it on very easy... NOPE nothing changed, literally nothing, I restarted the game and restarted my PC, nothing. Sqwat. It took me about 2 hours to get the game working, plus another 1 hour because the bugs came back and then. I got♥♥♥♥♥♥on.5.

												Fallout 3 is great. But if you're running Windows 7 or later, there's a chance this game wont work. There are fixes on the Nexus, and there are ways to change the game's combatibility. But these are not guaranteed fixes. I doubt they'll be an official patch anytime soon, so if you want to play fallout, go buy New Vegas or get this on a console.			",103,18,2,7,12,1,24

												This game has NOT aged well; here are the reasons:1. Takes around 1-2 hours to sort out the bugs (including: crashing at start, minimizing at random intervals, crashing when entering rooms, lagging when someone speaks, freezing)2. Downloading the programs and unofficial patches to fix said bugs3. The game was left to rot by bethesda for they are now too busy making DLC for fallout 44. There's a part in the game where you have to battle a lot of mutants (I mean a LOT; mini gunners, hunters and even mutants with smg's) and I thought, well I'm too new to the game so I might as well stick it on very easy... NOPE nothing changed, literally nothing, I restarted the game and restarted my PC, nothing. Sqwat. It took me about 2 hours to get the game working, plus another 1 hour because the bugs came back and then. I got♥♥♥♥♥♥on.5. Because it uses a installer when you start it, it closes itself to open the game. So basically steam won't track how long you've played for. As I'm writing this, I'll have to copy and paste it back because I only have 8 minutes on it. I'm literally going to have to waste 20 minutes of my life just on the installer, because if I hit play I'll have to restart it.Ok now for the Pros1. VATS is to DIE for, I love it to bits and I can't wait to see it in other games, obviously renamed.2. The plot to it is amazing as well as the story.3. The graphics are brilliant for its time.4.

												Unfortantly this game is completly unplayable as it is. If you plan on playing for more than 10min without it crashing without using mods or going into the games coding and changing stuff. When the crashing occurs: When you first get out the vault, when you open the door to Megaton, and opening random doors that the game has to load the next area. Yes my pc can run this game. I5-3000 series, 4gb of ram, and a 650 ti boost. If youre getting this game and plan to mod it then i recommend it but if youre worried about modding or changing the games coding then dont bother with this game. It's pretty sad that this game has been out for so long and Bethesda hasn't patched their broken game.			",52,1,0,9,2,0,1

												Fallout 3 takes place in the year 2277, 116 years after the setting of Fallout, 36 years after the setting of Fallout 2 and 200 years after the nuclear apocalypse that devastated the game's world, in a future where international conflicts between the United States and China culminated in a Sino-American war in 2077, due to the scarcity of petroleum reserves that ran the economies of both countries. The player character is an inhabitant of Vault 101, a survival shelter designed to protect up to 1,000 humans from the nuclear fallout. When the player character's father disappears under mysterious circumstances, the leader of the Vault initiates martial law and sends security forces after the player, who is forced to escape from the Vault and journey into the ruins of Washington, D.C. to track their father down. Along the way the player is assisted by a number of human survivors and must battle a myriad of enemies that inhabit the area, now known as the ""Capital Wasteland"". Fallout 3 is my all time favorite game I love it. fallout 3 pros are   cool looking guns fun gunplay. cool looking armor fun sidequests cons laggy at spots  main quest is too short not that many side quests  bad gunplay.

												Fallout 3 takes place in the year 2277, 116 years after the setting of Fallout, 36 years after the setting of Fallout 2 and 200 years after the nuclear apocalypse that devastated the game's world, in a future where international conflicts between the United States and China culminated in a Sino-American war in 2077, due to the scarcity of petroleum reserves that ran the economies of both countries. The player character is an inhabitant of Vault 101, a survival shelter designed to protect up to 1,000 humans from the nuclear fallout. When the player character's father disappears under mysterious circumstances, the leader of the Vault initiates martial law and sends security forces after the player, who is forced to escape from the Vault and journey into the ruins of Washington, D.C. to track their father down. Along the way the player is assisted by a number of human survivors and must battle a myriad of enemies that inhabit the area, now known as the ""Capital Wasteland"". Fallout 3 is my all time favorite game I love it. fallout 3 pros are   cool looking guns fun gunplay. cool looking armor fun sidequests cons laggy at spots  main quest is too short not that many side quests  bad gunplay. Overall this is my opinion of fallout 3 9/10			",26,2,0,10,1,0,0

												Will not run on quad cores.I tried Everything in the book to get it to run... Altered the INI, Turned off NET. Framework, Reduced the amount of cores the game uses to 1, Tried running it in windowed mode too... Sucks cause it is a great game and I have the GOTY edition for the 360 But I wanted to install mods and use console commands... You can't do that on the 360.Updated review: Now all you need to do is change a few lines of code

												It's a great game and I've done playthroughs in the past. However, if you're using Windows 7 or 10 it does randomly freeze a lot of the time. Also if you're having trouble starting the game through steam, go to steamfolder and find the falloutlauncher and create a shortcut and drop in on your desktop and run it from there. All in all, good game, but has a lot of issues atm on OS.			",11,5,0,3,2,0,1

												>Played New Vegas first>Didn't really enjoy it cuz of boring intro>Then get this game while On Sale>Play it  >The game has better intro than New Vegas                     >Spend most of my life in the Wasteland than in Real LifeSummary:+ Better Intro than NV, so new players can learn the Lore better+ Multi-solution, you can finish quest the way you like+ You make your own character, also what make them SPECIAL+ Unlike other RPG, you can still use weapons even if your weapon skill is low+ Karma System, one of gameplay mechanic that shouldn't removed from Fallout 4+ V.A.T.S.+ Bloody Mess perk!!            - Bugs. Yeah, every Bethesda games have bugs- 2nd most linear Fallout games- You can be evil in this game, but you can't join the Enclave (an evil corporation)- To fully enjoy the game, you need to get GOTY or at least, get the Broken Steel DLCIs it worth it? => Yes, but for some of you maybe No                               Recomended for: Those who are new to Fallout series, those who can't handle Fallout 4 but still want to play, Those who like Post-Apocalypse, First/Third Person RPG, those who want freedom on doing anythingNot Recomended for: Those who expect Turn-Based Fallout (if you do, get Wasteland instead), those who scared by mutant, ghoul, etc, for those who want Non-Linear RPGWell, Fallout 3 is a good game, just don't compare them to other Fallout games. Also, if you've finished playing this, I recommend getting Fallout: New Vegas next. Don't forget to check my New Vegas review!! xD			",28,9,0,8,1,0,4

												After trying to play this game through several times, I always ended up getting bored because this game was just wasn't enough fun, it was boring. But then, Fallout 4 came out and after playing that through and exploring the world, the new world I thought why not give another try to Fallout 3 and see if it gets me after playing FO4. It did, for some reason I felt like I knew most of the things, I experienced a newer version of the similar systems in Fallout 4 and Fallout 3 didn't seem like an old weird boring game anymore. Of course after playing through Fallout 4 and 3 I realised that 4 is a much better game and it is more suitable for new Fallout players like myself. Now I don't want to say that Fallout 3 is a bad game because it isn't, it is a very fun game.....was a very fun game. Perhaps if I had played Fallout 3 when it came out I would have liked it and I would be a fan of the series, but right now I have to say that I am a fan of Fallout 4, not fallout 3. What I'm trying to say is that if you have never played a fallout game before because you weren't interested or you have played and thought it was boring than perhaps you shouldn't start here, go buy Fallout 4, and if you like it then give this a try.

												This game is one of my favorites of all time, and if you have money left from pre-ordering Fallout 4 (assuming you did so) then I would definitely recommend getting the GOTY edition (I was stupid enough to accidentally buy this, save some money and get the GOTY version) and play it until it comes out. Even with Fallout 4, however, consider this about the game:PROS:-Amazing atmosphere. In post-apocalyptic Washington D.C, you feel the fight for survival at ALL times-Entertaining side-quests that can literally suck you in-Most of the entire game is a pro.CONS:-Woot! Gunna use my Fat Man- ♥♥♥♥ THE GAME CRASHED! (seriously, this will crash crash crash and will do so until you install around 5 different mods for it)-WEAK main quest. I finished the main quest in about 4 hours and felt empty. Thankfully the numerous side-quests and DLC quests will keep you occupied for weeks on end.-Without mods the mechanics (especially fine-aiming) feel incredibly awkward, mainly in comparison to New Vegas. However, that game has its own set of flaws too.-Nothing else, other than the Gamebryo engine itself looking like complete @$$ for the majority of the game. Seriously, install the Fellout mod as well as some textures/subtle ENB effects (don't oversaturate it!). Then the game will look greatOverall a must-play for any RPG fan.			",100,2,0,10,1,1,2

												Riding off the heels of The Elder Scrolls IV, Bethesda had purchased the rights to the Fallout name. Fallout 3 is a welcoming break from the bright fantasy world that The Elder Scrolls has so familarized us with. The gameplay is very good albeit not perfect, ironsights are implemented only with mods, using the V.A.T.S system is pretty cool for a while but after using it for a while it starts to get boring just seeing bodies explode into ooey-gooey bits. There are a variety of weapons ranging from pistols to rifles and even an electrically powered slegde hammer. There are also many disgusting creatures to come across in this post-apocolyptic world. The visuals have not aged very well but (yet again) with the help of mods you can create a visually stunning experience. The story is okay at best and pretty generic at worst, but that doesn't go without saying how immersed this game makes you feel with it's large scale and barren yet rich enviroment. Overall, this is a fantastic game and deserves the previous praise, I give it a very confident 8.5/10.			",87,3,0,10,1,0,1

												After trying to play this game through several times, I always ended up getting bored because this game was just wasn't enough fun, it was boring. But then, Fallout 4 came out and after playing that through and exploring the world, the new world I thought why not give another try to Fallout 3 and see if it gets me after playing FO4. It did, for some reason I felt like I knew most of the things, I experienced a newer version of the similar systems in Fallout 4 and Fallout 3 didn't seem like an old weird boring game anymore. Of course after playing through Fallout 4 and 3 I realised that 4 is a much better game and it is more suitable for new Fallout players like myself. Now I don't want to say that Fallout 3 is a bad game because it isn't, it is a very fun game.....was a very fun game. Perhaps if I had played Fallout 3 when it came out I would have liked it and I would be a fan of the series, but right now I have to say that I am a fan of Fallout 4, not fallout 3. What I'm trying to say is that if you have never played a fallout game before because you weren't interested or you have played and thought it was boring than perhaps you shouldn't start here, go buy Fallout 4, and if you like it then give this a try.

												I heard about this game for years, but never got it until May 22, 2015, but didn't start playing until May 23rd, 2015. I didn't own a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360, which explains why I never played this game until May 23rd, 2015. Now, why is that day important? It's important because that's the day I played the best game ever in my opinion. The game is basically a Post-Apocalyptic, Post-Nuclear RPG FPS, which sounds amazing, and luckily, that is the case with Fallout 3. Most times with games, the first game in the series is the best and any others are usually inferior. However, Not with Fallout 3. While Fallout and Fallout 2 are basically masterpieces, Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel was okay, Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel was awful, having mixed reactions with many critics. While Fallout 2 offered a more variety of things and Fallout: Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel was the first and only (On PC at least) Fallout to have multiplayer, Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel wasn't good and should of never existed. Go to the year 2004, where Bethesda owns the entire Fallout franchise. A teaser is shown in 2007 for the game known as  Fallout 3. 1 year later, Bethesda releases Fallout 3. The game is given high reviews, named best RPG, best PC game, best Xbox 360 game, and of course, THE BEST GAME OF THE YEAR.Fallout 3 is amazing and I highly recommend it to anybody who likes the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series or any of the other Fallout games, you won't be disappointed. Sadly, this game is given a 85% on Steam because Bethesda won't fix it and people are too lazy to look up how to fix it. I fixed it almost instantly, with the only thing I had to download was GFWL, and luckily, it isn't bad here. Otherwise, it's just tweaking things in the Fallout 3 files. It runs great on my Alienware 15 and I'm happy I got this. However, I would recommend getting ""Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition"" because you get all of the DLC, and if you were to buy all the DLC seperate, it would cost more than the actual GOTY edition (GOTY: $19.99; All DLC combined: $24.95) Please, get this game.EDIT: I beat the game in 6 days and it took 25 hours (5 Hours and 45 minutes offline) to beat. IT IS the best RPG I have ever played in my life. You have to get this game, you'll love it.			",109,9,2,6,11,0,1

												(Warning: This is long)First off, you may be considering to buy Fallout 3 due to Fallout 4 almost being fully released. But if you actually want Fallout 3 for a different reason, like the nostalgic feel, or just because why not. In this review I will be discussing many topics, so grab your pencils and start writing!STORY The story line in Fallout 3, may not be the most interesting, but it is deffinetly worth the time. Now on the other hand, side-quests are another thing that come to play in Fallout 3. Side-quests, some fun, some creepy, and some even borning, are EVERYWHERE. To anyone who can do every single side-quest in the game without getting bored, or just go insain, I salute you. Story rating: 4.7/5GAMEPLAYGameplay is... well, gameplay. There is not much to say about the gameplay of Fallout besdies, it's good. Let's look at this in a broken-down fashion. Weapons are a big part of Fallout, they are what get you through the entire game, you can not go without any sort of weapon. How many weapons are there, you may be asking. Well, let's just say... over 110. Armor and Clothing is another part of Fallout, wearing armor will incrase the ammount of damage resistance you have, some armor peices even add special stats (such as +5 int). There are also junk items, and some other items, but it would take too long to list them all. Gameplay rating: 5/5AUDIOFallout has very good audio. That is, if you can hear it all. Some audio in Fallout is not able to be heard, unless you either have a decent headset, in the perfect area, or by Radio signals. There are mods which can even add better audio quality to the game. Audio rating: 4.6/5GLITCHESAh, Bethesda... what Bethesda game can you have without glitches? There are your regular minor texture or sound glitches, but usually nothing too serious. There are, or atleast was, gamebreaking glitches. These glitches can ruin your game in a good, and funny way, or in a more.. bad way. There are mods that fix most of these though.(Additional) Running Fallout 3 on a system that has Windows 7 or later.Fallout was never ment for Windows 7 or any later versions, so if you do own Windows 7, or any later version, you will probably have to dig through the files of the game, and download some mods so the game will run properly.FINAL RATING: 4.9/5  ",106,7,0,11,6,1,3

												This game is one of my favorites of all time, and if you have money left from pre-ordering Fallout 4 (assuming you did so) then I would definitely recommend getting the GOTY edition (I was stupid enough to accidentally buy this, save some money and get the GOTY version) and play it until it comes out. Even with Fallout 4, however, consider this about the game:PROS:-Amazing atmosphere. In post-apocalyptic Washington D.C, you feel the fight for survival at ALL times-Entertaining side-quests that can literally suck you in-Most of the entire game is a pro.CONS:-Woot! Gunna use my Fat Man- ♥♥♥♥ THE GAME CRASHED! (seriously, this will crash crash crash and will do so until you install around 5 different mods for it)-WEAK main quest. I finished the main quest in about 4 hours and felt empty. Thankfully the numerous side-quests and DLC quests will keep you occupied for weeks on end.-Without mods the mechanics (especially fine-aiming) feel incredibly awkward, mainly in comparison to New Vegas. However, that game has its own set of flaws too.-Nothing else, other than the Gamebryo engine itself looking like complete @$$ for the majority of the game. Seriously, install the Fellout mod as well as some textures/subtle ENB effects (don't oversaturate it!). Then the game will look greatOverall a must-play for any RPG fan.			",100,2,0,10,1,1,2

												This is a game where your main goal is to click a button on a menu that says  ""New Game"" and then the game ends.  I thought that this game ended in a very odd way, however, I found out quickly that through some computer wizardry it was possible to acesses a  SECRET BONUS PLOTLINE  that was included in the game, where you played as a small child trying to learn to walk. Once you take the first step the game then ends again, bringing you to the desktop like before. Through more forementioned wizardry (See Bonus Plotline  above) I found yet another story about growing up in a vault under the ground and eventually attempting to leave said vault. Once you leave the vault the game asks if you want to switch genders and then ends. I felt that the game was a little overpriced for its legnth and overall quality, but I do think that the game needs to be appreciated for the message it's trying to convey, by showing the player that life is nothing but a series of goals, and it never truly ends with one big event, but with collections of smaller events that make up our lives, and I think the game needs to be appreciated for that.4/10 buy the XBox version or learn how to mod the Havok engine.

It also is alot harder to get supplies and gear detieriats faster than in New Vegas, making the game more challenging.  Also, the story is better.  However, the skill system is better in New Vegas.

Fallout 3 is a post-apocalyptic role playing game with a 1950's feel, it has a very deep and extensive storyline with so much to do!. Coming from mainly first person shooter and survival sandbox games this is the best role-playing game I have ever seen!.Pros: Very good storyline, nice look and an interesting storyline. and also very cool weapons and apparel.Cons: No iron sights, bullet spread, and takes some research to work on Windows 8.Overall rating 9/10			",33,0,2,3,3,0,1

												Amazing gameplay and great environment! Wonderful RPG action that lets you choose what playstyle you want and has LOTS to do besides just the main story. The world also goes on with or without you to an extent so you never know what you will find. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game may get boring after a while, but at least you can enjoy it while it is not vompleted, my suggestion is to go around and play the side quests b4 you do the main quests for a reason im not going to spoil for you.			",103,5,2,13,16,1,17

												The first few hours are tedious. The first quest, ""Make fallout 3 run"" makes you go into your files and make the game run. This is excluive for pc master race. after that, The game is great			",50,9,0,10,21,0,5

												>Played New Vegas first>Didn't really enjoy it cuz of boring intro>Then get this game while On Sale>Play it  >The game has better intro than New Vegas                     >Spend most of my life in the Wasteland than in Real LifeSummary:+ Better Intro than NV, so new players can learn the Lore better+ Multi-solution, you can finish quest the way you like+ You make your own character, also what make them SPECIAL+ Unlike other RPG, you can still use weapons even if your weapon skill is low+ Karma System, one of gameplay mechanic that shouldn't removed from Fallout 4+ V.A.T.S.+ Bloody Mess perk!!            - Bugs. Yeah, every Bethesda games have bugs- 2nd most linear Fallout games- You can be evil in this game, but you can't join the Enclave (an evil corporation)- To fully enjoy the game, you need to get GOTY or at least, get the Broken Steel DLCIs it worth it? => Yes, but for some of you maybe No                               Recomended for: Those who are new to Fallout series, those who can't handle Fallout 4 but still want to play, Those who like Post-Apocalypse, First/Third Person RPG, those who want freedom on doing anythingNot Recomended for: Those who expect Turn-Based Fallout (if you do, get Wasteland instead), those who scared by mutant, ghoul, etc, for those who want Non-Linear RPGWell, Fallout 3 is a good game, just don't compare them to other Fallout games. Also, if you've finished playing this, I recommend getting Fallout: New Vegas next. Don't forget to check my New Vegas review!! xD			",28,9,0,8,1,0,4

												Well when I got the game, I was suprise the game was not optomize for win 7 and it is 2014. The game is finaly updated to window 7 but before that I had to go and edit thing and download fan patches to get the game to work. I enjoy this game a lot! I love exploring and figuring thing out and that type of things. I wish there was more puzzle maybe...instead of just locks and hacking. Though it still fun!  Though there some funny glitch or place there on purpose. When the sherif is shot, he still there after many days. You think the body would rot(disapear) but I guess radiation has cuase the body to rot verrrry slow. How rude for the villager to not proper burry him! Even his own son! The story I enjoy a lot! I might plan to get DLC point lookout.Though my only complaint from an animation stand point is on the dull facial animation emotion characters have. There scared? ""aaah"" but they look so neutral and don't match up with the voice emotion.			",77,7,0,11,7,0,2
